  superconductor surface losses",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art transmon qubits rely on large capacitors which
systematically improves their coherence due to reduced surface loss
participation. However, this approach increases both the footprint and the
parasitic cross-coupling and is ultimately limited by radiation losses - a
potential roadblock for scaling up quantum processors to millions of qubits. In
this work we present transmon qubits with sizes as low as 36$ \times $39$
\mu$m$^2$ with $\gtrsim$100 nm wide vacuum gap capacitors that are
micro-machined from commercial silicon-on-insulator wafers and shadow
evaporated with aluminum. After the release in HF vapor we achieve a vacuum
participation ratio up to 99.6\% in an in-plane design that is compatible with
standard coplanar circuits. Qubit relaxation time measurements for small gaps
with high vacuum electric fields of up to 22 V/m reveal a double exponential
decay indicating comparably strong coupling to long-lived two-level-systems
(TLS). The exceptionally high selectivity of $>$20 dB to the
superconductor-vacuum surface allows to precisely back out the
sub-single-photon dielectric loss tangent of aluminum oxide exposed to ambient
conditions. In terms of future scaling potential we achieve a qubit quality
factor by footprint area of $20 \mu \mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which is on par with the
highest $T_1$ devices relying on larger geometries and expected to improve
substantially for lower loss superconductors like NbTiN, TiN or Ta.

by high pressures have shown that a critical temperature of superconductivity
Tc can reach near room temperature values. The current studies focus on the
search for new superconductors with higher Tcs to understand the ultimate limit
of conventional superconductivity, and high-Tc superconductors at lower
pressures. However, high pressure conditions put serious limitations on
experimental studies. Electrical transport measurements have long been the
primary experimental technique for reliable detection of superconductivity at
high pressures, whereas magnetic susceptibility measurements continue to be a
challenge. Here, we dramatically changed the protocol of magnetic measurements
to probe the trapped magnetic flux. We tested this technique on samples of H3S
and LaH10 and propose it for a routine examination of superconductivity at high
pressures. Using the temperature- and magnetic field dependences of the trapped
flux we estimated Tc ~195 K, a lower critical field ~0.36 T, an irreversibility
field ~1.7 T, a full penetration field ~8.8 T, the London penetration depth ~37
nm, and critical current densities jc(T) in H3S at ~155 GPa in a wide
temperature range. The trapped flux method is found to be sensitive to a
particular phase in a mixture of superconducting phases: concomitant phases of
sulfur and hydrogen-depleted LaHx were detected. In contrast to the Meissner
state occurring at low external magnetic fields, a magnetic response from the
trapped flux at zero applied magnetic field is in tens times stronger and is
not contaminated by the magnetic background of a bulky diamond anvil cell. This
technique can be a powerful tool for the screening of new superconducting
materials, the study of multiphase, contaminated samples, or samples with a low
superconducting fraction at ambient pressure too.

of the order of 20\% in the velocity profile translate into differences of the
order of few percent in the Jacobian. This small discrepancy propagates to the
monopole and quadrupole of the void-tracer correlation function, producing

sloshing, causing dense gas to be dragged from the cool core of a cluster,

signatures of sloshing in its core and it is possible that the orbital plane of
the collision is seen nearly edge-on. We aim to evaluate whether the features

simulations of a non-frontal collision with a galaxy group of
$M_{200}=1.6\times10^{13}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$. We obtain a suitable scenario in
which the group passed by the main cluster core 0.8 Gyr ago, with a pericentric
separation of 292 kpc. Good agreement is obtained from the temperature maps as
well as the residuals from a $\beta$-model fit to the simulated X-ray emission.
We find that under an inclination of $i=70^{\circ}$ the simulation results
remain consistent with the observations.

synchronization in the EU -- a necessary condition for the optimal currency

decision maker's understanding of the business cycle and, by extension, the
quality of economic decisions. We define the business cycles by applying a
wavelet approach to drift-adjusted gross value added data spanning over 2000Q1
to 2021Q2. For the application of the synchronization analysis, we propose the
novel soft-clustering approach, which adjusts hierarchical clustering in
several aspects. First, the method relies on synchronicity dissimilarity
measures, noting that, for time series data, the feature space is the set of
all points in time. Then, the ``soft'' part of the approach strengthens the
synchronization signal by using silhouette measures. Finally, we add a
probabilistic sparsity algorithm to drop out the most asynchronous ``noisy''
data improving the silhouette scores of the most and less synchronous groups.
The method, hence, splits the sectoral-regional data into three groups: the
synchronous group that shapes the EU business cycle; the less synchronous group
that may hint at cycle forecasting relevant information; the asynchronous group
that may help investors to diversify through-the-cycle risks of the investment
portfolios. The results support the core-periphery hypothesis.

transient surveys covering the entire sky. Using data from the All-Sky
Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and \textit{Gaia} -- the only two
all-sky surveys to report classical nova candidates -- we find 39 confirmed
Galactic novae and 7 additional unconfirmed candidates discovered from
2019--2021, yielding a nova discovery rate of $\approx 14$ yr$^{-1}$. Using
accurate Galactic stellar mass models, three-dimensional dust maps, and
incorporating realistic nova light curves, we have built a sophisticated
Galactic nova model that allows an estimate of the recovery fraction of
Galactic novae from these surveys over this time period. The observing
capabilities of each survey are distinct: the high cadence of ASAS-SN makes it
sensitive to fast novae, while the broad observing filter and high spatial
resolution of \textit{Gaia} make it more sensitive to highly reddened novae
across the entire Galactic plane and bulge. Despite these differences, we find
that ASAS-SN and \textit{Gaia} give consistent Galactic nova rates, with a
final joint nova rate of $26 \pm 5$ yr$^{-1}$. This inferred nova rate is
substantially lower than found by many other recent studies. Critically
assessing the systematic uncertainties in the Galactic nova rate, we argue that
the role of faint fast-fading novae has likely been overestimated, but that
subtle details in the operation of transient alert pipelines can have large,
sometimes unappreciated effects on transient recovery efficiency. Our predicted
nova rate can be directly tested with forthcoming red/near-infrared transient

dispersion relations in the frequency-wavenumber space. These findings thus
reveal that mechanical waves analogous to condensed matter phonons propagate in

longitudinal, as expected for a fluid-like phase. When the coupling is
stronger, both longitudinal and transverse waves propagate, which is typically

where turbulent magnetic helicity fluxes allow to avoid catastrophic quenching

describe turbulent magnetic diffusion of the small-scale magnetic helicity. In
addition, the turbulent magnetic helicity fluxes contain source terms

freedom of the lattice, which results in the reduction of the dynamics to that
of an atom in an effective spin bath whose size is equal to the size of a unit

occupation probability may be enhanced by applying the magnetic field along
some specific directions. The dependence on the change of the temperature and
the magnitude of spin is also investigated. It turns out that the increase of
thermal fluctuations may reduce the occupation probability of the excited

  Defenses with Gradient Redirection","ICML 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Model stealing attacks present a dilemma for public machine learning APIs. To
protect financial investments, companies may be forced to withhold important
information about their models that could facilitate theft, including
uncertainty estimates and prediction explanations. This compromise is harmful
not only to users but also to external transparency. Model stealing defenses
seek to resolve this dilemma by making models harder to steal while preserving
utility for benign users. However, existing defenses have poor performance in
practice, either requiring enormous computational overheads or severe utility
trade-offs. To meet these challenges, we present a new approach to model
stealing defenses called gradient redirection. At the core of our approach is a
provably optimal, efficient algorithm for steering an adversary's training
updates in a targeted manner. Combined with improvements to surrogate networks
and a novel coordinated defense strategy, our gradient redirection defense,
called GRAD${}^2$, achieves small utility trade-offs and low computational
overhead, outperforming the best prior defenses. Moreover, we demonstrate how
gradient redirection enables reprogramming the adversary with arbitrary
behavior, which we hope will foster work on new avenues of defense.

fluctuations, resolving \emph{de facto} the cosmological constant problem. To
do so, we assume at primordial times that vacuum energy fuels an inflationary
quadratic hilltop potential nonminimally coupled to gravity through a standard
Yukawa-like interacting term, whose background lies on a perturbed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate how vacuum energy release
transforms into geometric particles, adopting a quasi-de Sitter phase where we
compute the expected particle density and mass ranges. Hence, we propose the
most suitable dark matter candidates, showing under which circumstances we can
interpret dark matter as constituted by geometric quasiparticles. We confront
our predictions with quantum particle production and constraints made using a
Higgs portal. In addition, the role of the bare cosmological constant is
reinterpreted to speed up the universe today. Thus, consequences on the
standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are critically highlighted, showing how both
coincidence and fine-tuning issues can be healed requiring the Israel-Darmois
matching conditions between our involved inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases.

ballistic transport. The resulting ""ballistic MFT"" (BMFT) is solely based on
the Euler hydrodynamics data of the many-body system. Within this framework,
mesoscopic observables are classical random variables depending only on the
fluctuating conserved densities, and Euler-scale fluctuations are obtained by
deterministically transporting thermodynamic fluctuations via the Euler
hydrodynamics. Using the BMFT, we show that long-range correlations in space
generically develop over time from long-wavelength inhomogeneous initial states
in interacting models. This result, which we verify by numerical calculations,
challenges the long-held paradigm that at the Euler scale, fluid cells may be
considered uncorrelated. We also show that the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation
theorem for non-equilibrium ballistic transport follows purely from
time-reversal invariance of the Euler hydrodynamics. We check the validity of
the BMFT by applying it to integrable systems, and in particular the hard-rod
gas, with extensive simulations that confirm our analytical results.

highlighted the detection prospects of parity-even tensor NGs via the GW

bispectra break parity at the non-linear level and can be introduced by
allowing alternative symmetry breaking patterns during inflation, like those

non-zero detection of squeezed $\langle \rm tts \rangle$ parity-odd bispectra
in the $V$ modes dipole is possible without requiring any short-scale
enhancement of the GW power spectrum amplitude over the constraints set by the

analyzing all available correct student submissions to repair a program is not
feasible. The clustering methods use program representations based on several
features such as abstract syntax tree (AST), syntax, control flow, and data
flow. However, these features are sometimes brittle when representing
semantically similar programs.
  This paper proposes InvAASTCluster, a novel approach for program clustering
that takes advantage of dynamically generated program invariants observed over
several program executions to cluster semantically equivalent IPAs. Our main
objective is to find a more suitable representation of programs using a
combination of the program's semantics, through its invariants, and its

InvAASTCluster shows that the proposed program representation outperforms
syntax-based representations when clustering a set of different correct IPAs.
Furthermore, we integrate InvAASTCluster into a state-of-the-art

results show that InvAASTCluster advances the current state-of-the-art when

Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires

simulators. On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture
the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the
resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm
has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction
by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement
learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of
potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial
and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether
Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we
apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world,
without simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back,
stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push
the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand
perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up. On two different robotic
arms, Dreamer learns to pick and place multiple objects directly from camera
images and sparse rewards, approaching human performance. On a wheeled robot,
Dreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images,
automatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same
hyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of
online learning in the real world, establishing a strong baseline. We release
our infrastructure for future applications of world models to robot learning.

dictate the dynamics of an underlying Cartan geometry. In a sense to be made
precise in the paper, the starting datum in the gauging procedure is a Klein
pair corresponding to a homogeneous space. What the gauging procedure amounts
to is the construction of a Cartan geometry modelled on that Klein geometry,
with the gauge field defining a Cartan connection. The lagrangian itself
consists of all gauge-invariant top-forms constructed from the Cartan
connection and its curvature. After demonstrating that this procedure produces
four-dimensional General Relativity upon gauging Minkowski spacetime, we
proceed to gauge all four-dimensional maximally symmetric carrollian spaces:
Carroll, (anti-)de Sitter--Carroll and the lightcone. For the first three of
these spaces, our lagrangians generalise earlier first-order lagrangians. The
resulting theories of carrollian gravity all take the same form, which seems to
be a manifestation of model mutation at the level of the lagrangians. The odd
one out, the lightcone, is not reductive and this means that although the
equations of motion take the same form as in the other cases, the geometric
interpretation is different. For all carrollian theories of gravity we obtain
analogues of the Gauss--Bonnet, Pontryagin and Nieh--Yan topological terms, as
well as two additional terms that are intrinsically carrollian and seem to have
no lorentzian counterpart. Since we gauge the theories from scratch this work
also provides a no-go result for the electric carrollian theory in a
first-order formulation.

compared to a $\Lambda$CDM baseline. It is therefore a widely held view that
constraints on those models can be obtained by searching for such features in
the clustering statistics of large-scale structure. However, when using biased
tracers of matter in the analysis, the situation is complicated by the fact
that the bias also depends on cosmology. Here we investigate how the selection
of tracers affects the observed signatures for two examples of
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies: massive neutrinos and clustering dark energy
($k$-essence). We study the signatures in the monopole, quadrupole, and
hexadecapole of the redshift-space power spectra for halo catalogues from large
$N$-body simulations and argue that a fixed selection criterion based on local
attributes like tracer mass leads to a near loss of signal in most cases.
Instead, the full signal is recovered only if the selection of tracers is done
at fixed bias. This emphasises the need to model or measure the bias parameters
accurately in order to get meaningful constraints on the cosmological model.

settle the issues, we propose a novel try-on condition generator as a unified

clinical text de-identification relies on the availability of clinical notes,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns. The NLP Sandbox is an
approach for alleviating the lack of data and evaluation frameworks for NLP
models by adopting a federated, model-to-data approach. This enables unbiased
federated model evaluation without the need for sharing sensitive data from
multiple institutions. Materials and Methods We leveraged the Synapse
collaborative framework, containerization software, and OpenAPI generator to
build the NLP Sandbox (nlpsandbox.io). We evaluated two state-of-the-art NLP
de-identification focused annotation models, Philter and NeuroNER, using data
from three institutions. We further validated model performance using data from
an external validation site. Results We demonstrated the usefulness of the NLP
Sandbox through de-identification clinical model evaluation. The external
developer was able to incorporate their model into the NLP Sandbox template and
provide user experience feedback. Discussion We demonstrated the feasibility of
using the NLP Sandbox to conduct a multi-site evaluation of clinical text
de-identification models without the sharing of data. Standardized model and
data schemas enable smooth model transfer and implementation. To generalize the
NLP Sandbox, work is required on the part of data owners and model developers
to develop suitable and standardized schemas and to adapt their data or model
to fit the schemas. Conclusions The NLP Sandbox lowers the barrier to utilizing

designed to self-consistently simulate LIM signals of multiple EoR probes, we
investigate how building blocks of galaxy formation and evolution theory, such
as feedback-regulated star formation and chemical enrichment, might be studied
with multi-tracer LIM during the EoR. On galaxy scales, we show that the star
formation law and the feedback associated with star formation can be indicated
by both the shape and redshift evolution of LIM power spectra. For a baseline
model of metal production that traces star formation, we find that lines highly
sensitive to metallicity are generally better probes of galaxy formation
models. On larger scales, we demonstrate that inferring ionized bubble sizes
from cross-correlations between tracers of ionized and neutral gas requires a
detailed understanding of the astrophysics that shape the line luminosity--halo

wide-area, multi-tracer LIM surveys will provide important high-redshift tests

constant IR opacities or simplified power laws ($\kappa \propto T^2$). We
investigate the impact of the radiation pressure of these IR photons on the
star formation efficiency (SFE) of the cloud, and its potential to drive dusty
winds. We find that IR radiation pressure is unable to regulate star formation
or prevent accretion onto the star clusters, even for very high gas surface
densities ($\Sigma > 10^5 M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$), contrary to recent
semi-analytic predictions and simulation results using simplified treatments of
the dust opacity. We find that the commonly adopted simplifications of $\kappa
\propto T^2$ or constant $\kappa$ for the IR dust opacities leads to this
discrepancy, as those approximations overestimate the radiation force. By
contrast, with realistic opacities that take into account the micro-physics of
the dust, we find that the impact of IR radiation pressure on star formation is
very mild, even at significantly high dust-to-gas ratios ($\sim 3$ times

geometry defined in the CHY moduli space. In order to compute these canonical
forms in kinematic spaces, we study the general problem of pushing forward
arbitrary rational differential forms via the scattering equations. We develop
three methods which achieve this without ever needing to explicitly solve any
scattering equations. Our results use techniques from computational algebraic
geometry, including companion matrices and the global duality of residues, and
they extend the application of similar results for rational functions to
rational differential forms.

well-being, and performance of occupants. Given the focus on energy efficiency
and Internet-of-Things enabled smart buildings, machine learning (ML) is being
increasingly used for data-driven thermal comfort (TC) prediction. Generally,
ML-based solutions are proposed for air-conditioned or HVAC ventilated
buildings and the models are primarily designed for adults. On the other hand,
naturally ventilated (NV) buildings are the norm in most countries. They are
also ideal for energy conservation and long-term sustainability goals. However,
the indoor environment of NV buildings lacks thermal regulation and varies
significantly across spatial contexts. These factors make TC prediction
extremely challenging. Thus, determining the impact of the building environment
on the performance of TC models is important. Further, the generalization
capability of TC prediction models across different NV indoor spaces needs to
be studied. This work addresses these problems. Data is gathered through
month-long field experiments conducted in 5 naturally ventilated school
buildings, involving 512 primary school students. The impact of spatial
variability on student comfort is demonstrated through variation in prediction
accuracy (by as much as 71%). The influence of building environment on TC
prediction is also demonstrated through variation in feature importance.
Further, a comparative analysis of spatial variability in model performance is
done for children (our dataset) and adults (ASHRAE-II database). Finally, the
generalization capability of thermal comfort models in NV classrooms is
assessed and major challenges are highlighted.

quantum fields in curved spacetime. The abundance and energy spectrum of
gravitationally produced particles is typically calculated by solving the
field's mode equations on a time-dependent background metric. For purposes of
studying dark matter production in an inflationary cosmology, these mode
equations are often solved numerically, which is computationally intensive,
especially for the rapidly-oscillating high-momentum modes. However, these same
modes are amenable to analytic evaluation via the Exact
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (EWKB) method, where gravitational particle
production is a manifestation of the Stokes phenomenon. These analytic
techniques have been used in the past to study gravitational particle
production for spin-0 bosons. We extend the earlier work to study gravitational
production of spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fermions. We derive an analytic expression
for the connection matrix (valid to all orders in perturbations) that relates
Bogoliubov coefficients across a Stokes line connecting a merged pair of simple
turning points. By comparing the analytic approximation with a direct numerical
integration of the mode equations, we demonstrate an excellent agreement and
highlight the utility of the Stokes phenomenon formalism applied to fermions.

non-perturbative non-supersymmetric conformal field theory that admits analytic
solutions. We study the dynamics of defects in the tensor model defined by
localized magnetic field couplings on a $p$-dimensional subspace in the
$d$-dimensional spacetime. While we work with general $p$ and $d$, the
physically interesting cases include line defects in $d=2,3$ and surface

comparing the properties of the intra-cluster population of GC-LMXBs with those
of the host galaxy. We use VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and Chandra observations.
We identify 168 LMXBs residing in GCs and divide it into host-galaxy and
intra-cluster objects based on their distance from the nearest galaxy in terms
of effective radius. We found 82 intra-cluster GC-LMXBs and 86 objects that are
hosted in galaxies. We perform a Gaussian mixture model to divide the
population into red and blue GCs. As has been found for the innermost regions
of galaxies, LMXBs tend to form in red and bright GCs in intra-cluster space as
well. We find, however, that the likelihood of a red GC to host an LMXB
decreases with galactocentric distance, but it remains approximately constant
for the blue GC population. Investigating the X-ray properties of the LMXBs
residing in GCs, we find a difference in the X-ray luminosity function between
the intra-cluster and host-galaxy sample: both follow a power-law down to $\sim
8.5\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with field LMXBs for the
intra-cluster sample, while the latter agree with previous estimates for LMXBs
in GCs. We detect a tentative difference in the hardness ratio of two
populations, where the intra-cluster GC-LMXBs appear to have harder spectra
than the host-galaxy objects. We find the same trend when we compare red and
blue GC-LMXBs: the spectra of the blue sample are harder spectra than those of
the red sample. This result could suggest a relation between the spectral
properties of LMXBs and the host GC colour and therefore its metallicity.

tailored for voids from the Euclid photometric dataset and present the first
forecasts on cosmological parameters that include the void-lensing correlation.
We examine two different probe settings, pessimistic and optimistic, both for
void clustering and galaxy lensing. We carry out forecast analyses in four
model cosmologies, accounting for a varying total neutrino mass, $M_\nu$, and a
dynamical dark energy (DE) equation of state, $w(z)$, described by the CPL
parametrisation. We find that void clustering constraints on $h$ and $\Omega_b$
are competitive with galaxy lensing alone, while errors on $n_s$ decrease
thanks to the orthogonality of the two probes in the 2D-projected parameter
space. We also note that, as a whole, the inclusion of the void-lensing
cross-correlation signal improves parameter constraints by $10-15\%$, and
enhances the joint void clustering and galaxy lensing Figure of Merit (FoM) by
$10\%$ and $25\%$, in the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively.
Finally, when further combining with the spectroscopic galaxy clustering,
assumed as an independent probe, we find that, in the most competitive case,
the FoM increases by a factor of 4 with respect to the combination of weak
lensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering taken as independent probes. The
forecasts presented in this work show that photometric void-clustering and its
cross-correlation with galaxy lensing deserve to be exploited in the data
analysis of the Euclid galaxy survey and promise to improve its constraining
power, especially on $h$, $\Omega_b$, the neutrino mass, and the DE evolution.

of physics simulation, including the calculation of response properties and
correlation functions. These quantities are also closely related to solving
linear systems of equations in quantum linear algebra. Here we present three
related algorithms for calculating transition probabilities with respect to
arbitrary operators and states. First, we extend a previously published
short-depth algorithm, allowing for the two input quantum states to be
non-orthogonal. The extension comes at the cost of one ancilla qubit and at
most only a constant four additional two-qubit gates. Building on this first
procedure, we then derive a higher-depth approach based on Trotterization and
Richardson extrapolation that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, we
introduce a tunable approach that in effect interpolates between the low-depth
method and the method of fewer circuit evaluations. This tunability between
circuit depth and measurement complexity allows the algorithm to be tailored to
specific hardware characteristics. Finally, we implement proof-of-principle
numerics for toy models in physics and chemistry and for use a subroutine in
variational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of our
approaches are that (a) arbitrary non-orthogonal states may now be used with
negligible increases in quantum resources, (b) we entirely avoid subroutines
such as the Hadamard test that may require three-qubit gates to be decomposed,
and (c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as

probabilities.

pools is critical for the efficiency of the algorithm as the problem size

facilitates the construction of problem-tailored pools for arbitrarily large

pool, we extract the most relevant operators and use them to design more
efficient pools for larger instances. Given that many problems, such as those
arising in condensed matter physics, have a naturally repeating (lattice)

  determinations for the super-Earth CoRoT-7b","20 pages including appendix, 22 Figures and 6 tables, Accepted for

under debate since their initial detection. In the previous studies, CoRoT-7
was found to have two planets, CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c with orbital periods of
0.85 and 3.69 days, and a potential third planet with a period of $\sim$9 days.
The existence of the third planet has been questioned as potentially being an
activity-induced artefact. Mass of the transiting planet CoRoT-7b has been
estimated to have widely different values owing to the activity level of the
parent star, the consequent Radial Velocity (RV) 'jitter', and the methods used
to rectify this ambiguity. Here we present an analysis of the HARPS archival RV
data of CoRoT-7 using a new wavelength-domain technique, scalpels, to correct
for the stellar activity-induced spectral line-shape changes. Simultaneous
modelling of stellar activity and orbital motions, identified using the l1-
periodogram, shows that scalpels effectively reduce the contribution of stellar
variability to the RV signal and enhance the detectability of exoplanets around
active stars. Using kima nested-sampling package, we modelled the system
incorporating a Gaussian Process together with scalpels. The resultant
posterior distributions favoured a three-planet system comprising two
non-transiting planets, CoRoT-7c and CoRoT-7d with orbital periods of
3.697$\pm$0.005 and 8.966$\pm$1.546 days, in addition to the known transiting
planet. The transiting planet CoRoT-7b is found to be a rocky super-Earth with
a mass of $M_{b}$=6.06$\pm$0.65 $M_{\oplus}$. The determined masses of
$M_{c}$=13.29$\pm$0.69 $M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{d}$=17.14$\pm$2.55 $M_{\oplus}$
suggest the non-transiting planets CoRoT-7c and CoRoT-7d to be structurally
similar to Uranus and Neptune.

find that the mean temperature radial profiles around nearby galaxies at $cz\le

$\sim 15~\mu \rm{K}$ extending up to several galaxy radii. This effect strongly
depends on the galaxy morphological type at scales within several tens of times
the galaxy size, becoming nearly independent of galaxy morphology at larger
scales. The effect is significantly stronger for the more extended galaxies,
with galaxy clustering having a large impact on the results. Our findings
indicate the presence of statistically relevant foregrounds in the CMB maps
that should be considered in detailed cosmological studies. Besides, we argue
that these can be used to explore the intergalactic medium surrounding bright
late-type galaxies and allow for diverse astrophysical analyses.

in the light-cone output of the MICE simulation, spanning $\sim5000\,{\rm
deg}^2$ and reaching redshift $z=1.4$. This assignment is based on a
'semi-analytic' IA model that uses photometric properties of galaxies as well
as the spin and shape of their host halos. Advancing on previous work, we
include more realistic distributions of galaxy shapes and a luminosity
dependent galaxy-halo alignment. The IA model parameters are calibrated against
COSMOS and BOSS LOWZ observations. The null detection of IA in observations of
blue galaxies is accounted for by setting random orientations for these
objects. We compare the two-point alignment statistics measured in the
simulation against predictions from the analytical IA models NLA and TATT over
a wide range of scales, redshifts and luminosities for red and blue galaxies
separately. We find that both models fit the measurements well at scales above
$8\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, while TATT outperforms NLA at smaller scales. The IA
parameters derived from our fits are in broad agreement with various
observational constraints from red galaxies. Lastly, we build a realistic
source sample, mimicking DES Year 3 observations and use it to predict the IA
contamination to the observed shear statistics. We find this prediction to be
within the measurement uncertainty, which might be a consequence of the random
alignment of blue galaxies in the simulation.

Consequently, for mass around tens of MeV, the muon $g_\mu$--$2$ solution from

the fixed points that can be later identified as the inflationary attractor and
the unstable fixed point where inflation could take place. Finally we study the

Regarding the problem of quantum state transfer, we use the solution and some
theorems concerning the approximation of irrational numbers, to show the
appearance of conclusive pretty good transmission for chains with particular
lengths. We present numerical evidence that pretty good transmission is
achieved by chains whose length is not a power of two. The set of spin chains
that shows pretty good transmission is a subset of the family with an exact
solution. Using perturbation theory, we thoroughly analyze the case when one of
the exchange coupling strengths is orders of magnitude larger than the other.
This strong coupling limit allows us to study, in a simple way, the appearance
of pretty good transmission. The use of analytical closed expressions for the
eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and transmission probabilities allows us to obtain
the precise asymptotic behavior of the time where the pretty good transmission
is observed. Moreover, we show that this time scales as a power law whose
exponent is an increasing function of the chain length. We also discuss the
crossover behavior obtained for the pretty good transmission time between the
regimes of strong coupling limit and the one observed when the exchange

eclipse times and brightnesses of U Sco in quiescence, from 2010 to 2022. The
orbital period suddenly increased by +22.4 +- 1.0 parts-per-million across the

(+3.9 +- 6.1 parts-per-million) across the 1999.2 eruption. This period change
cannot come from any of the usual mechanisms, whereas the one remaining
possibility is that the period changes are dominated by the little-known
mechanism of the nova ejecting asymmetric shells. From 2010.1 to 2016.78, the
O-C curve showed a steady period change that was large, with P-dot equal (-21.0

two previous inter-eruption intervals (-3.2 +- 1.9 and -1.1 +- 1.1 X 10^-9).
This large, variable, and negative P-dot apparently comes from magnetic braking
of the companion star's rotation. Starting in 2016.9 +- 0.6, the O-C curve
showed a strong kink that is a unique characteristic of the sudden period
change (+35.4 +- 7.1 parts-per-million) across a nova event. The brightness in

only possible time for the eruption to peak (such that its total duration of 60
days was undetectable by any observation) is during a 75 day interval inside
the 2016 solar gap, thus constraining the missed eruption to 2016.78 +- 0.10.

suit continuous type data. We implemented GLDA using STAN (a probabilistic
modeling language) and applied it on two datasets, one containing Ecological
Momentary Assessments (EMA) and the other heart measures from electrocardiogram
and impedance cardiograph. We found that in both datasets the GLDA-learned
class weights achieved significantly higher correlations with clinically
assessed depression, anxiety, and stress scores than those produced by the
baseline GMM. Our findings demonstrate the advantage of GLDA over conventional
finite mixture models for human state discovery from repeated multivariate
data, likely due to better characterization of potential underlying
between-participant differences. Future work is required to validate the
utility of this model on a broader range of applications.

parameters are fixed and known. In practice, however, some parameters may be a
priori unknown but can be estimated from historical data. A typical
predict-then-optimize approach separates predictions and optimization into two
stages. Recently, end-to-end predict-then-optimize has become an attractive
alternative. In this work, we present the PyEPO package, a PyTorchbased
end-to-end predict-then-optimize library in Python. To the best of our
knowledge, PyEPO (pronounced like pineapple with a silent ""n"") is the first
such generic tool for linear and integer programming with predicted objective
function coefficients. It provides four base algorithms: a convex surrogate
loss function from the seminal work of Elmachtoub and Grigas [16], a
differentiable black-box solver approach of Pogancic et al. [35], and two
differentiable perturbation-based methods from Berthet et al. [6]. PyEPO
provides a simple interface for the definition of new optimization problems,
the implementation of state-of-the-art predict-then-optimize training
algorithms, the use of custom neural network architectures, and the comparison
of end-to-end approaches with the two-stage approach. PyEPO enables us to
conduct a comprehensive set of experiments comparing a number of end-to-end and
two-stage approaches along axes such as prediction accuracy, decision quality,
and running time on problems such as Shortest Path, Multiple Knapsack, and the
Traveling Salesperson Problem. We discuss some empirical insights from these
experiments, which could guide future research. PyEPO and its documentation are

gas properties can distinguish between physical processes where they stop
forming stars due to a lack of fuel versus those where star-formation

Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of four quiescent galaxies
at $z=$ 3.5-4.0 found by the Fourstar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) and a
serendipitous optically dark galaxy at $z=3.71$. We aim to investigate the
presence of dust-obscured star-formation and their gas content by observing the
dust continuum emission at Band-7 and the atomic carbon [C I]($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$)
line at 492.16 GHz. Among the four quiescent galaxies, only one source is
detected in the dust continuum at $\lambda_{\rm obs} = 870 {\rm \mu m}$. The
sub-mm observations confirm their passive nature, and all of them are located
more than four times below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at
$z=3.7$. None of the targets are detected in [C I], constraining their gas mass
fractions to be $<$ 20%. These gas mass fractions are more than three times
lower than the scaling relation for star-forming galaxies at $z=3.7$. These
results support scenarios where massive galaxies at $z=$ 3.5-4.0 quench by
consuming/expelling all the gas rather than by reducing the efficiency of the
conversion of their gas into stars.

These are arithmetic counterparts, in the context of Arakelov geometry, of
germs of smooth complex-analytic surfaces along a projective complex curve.
Formal-analytic surfaces provide a natural framework for arithmetic
algebraization theorems, old and new.
  Formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces admit a rich geometry which parallels the
geometry of complex analytic surfaces. Notably the dichotomy between
pseudoconvexity and pseudoconcavity plays a central role in their geometry.
  Our study of formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces relies crucially on the use
of real-valued invariants. Some of these are intersection-theoretic, in the
spirit of Arakelov intersection theory. Some other invariants involve
infinite-dimensional geometry of numbers.
  Relating our new intersection-theoretic invariants to more classical
invariants of Arakelov geometry leads us to investigate a new invariant, the
Archimedean overflow, attached to an analytic map from a pointed compact
Riemann surface with boundary to a Riemann surface. It is related to the
characteristic functions of Nevanlinna theory.
  Our results on the geometry of formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces admit
applications to concrete problems of arithmetic geometry. Notably we generalize
the arithmetic holonomicity theorem of Calegari-Dimitrov-Tang regarding the
dimension of spaces of power series with integral coefficients satisfying some
convergence conditions.
  We also establish an arithmetic counterpart of theorems of Lefschetz and Nori
by providing a bound on the index, in the \'etale fundamental group of an
arithmetic surface, of the closed subgroup generated by the \'etale fundamental
groups of some arithmetic curve and of some compact Riemann surfaces mapping to
the arithmetic surface.

heavy quark propagating in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) while absorption causes
reduction of the radiative energy loss. On the other hand, the
chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations present in the QGP lead to
collisional energy gain of the heavy quark. The net effect of the thermal gluon
absorption and field fluctuations is a reduction of the total energy loss of
the heavy quark, prominent at the lower momenta. We consider both kind of the
energy gains along with the usual losses, and compute the nuclear modification
factor ($R_{AA}$) of heavy mesons, viz., $D$ and $B$ mesons. The calculations
have been compared with the experimental measurements in Au-Au collisions at

several topics of the universal and fruitful activity of A.S. Davydov. Within
the extended Thomas Fermi and semiclassical periodic orbit theory beyond the
Fermi-gas saddle-point method we obtain $\rho\propto I_\nu(S)/S^\nu$, where
$I_\nu(S)$ is the modified Bessel function of the entropy $S$. For small
shell-structure contribution one finds $\nu=\kappa/2+1$, where $\kappa$ is the
number of additional integrals of motion. This integer number is a dimension of
${\bf Q}$, ${\bf Q}=\{N, Z, ...\}$ for the case of two-component atomic nuclei,
where $N$ and $Z$ are the numbers of neutron and protons, respectively. For
much larger shell structure contributions, one obtains, $\nu=\kappa/2+2$. The
MMA level density $\rho$ reaches the well-known Fermi gas asymptote for large
excitation energies, and the finite micro-canonical combinatoric limit for low
excitation energies. The additional integrals of motion can be also the
projection of the angular momentum of a nuclear system for nuclear rotations of
deformed nuclei, number of excitons for collective dynamics, and so on. Fitting
the MMA total level density, $\rho(E,{\bf Q})$, for a set of the integrals of

higher spectral and energy requirements in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond

be further enhanced with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO)
characteristics towards boosting the network performance. However, channel
reciprocity, assumed in 5G systems such as mMIMO, appears to be questioned in
practice by recent studies on IRS. Hence, contrary to previous works, we
consider frequency division duplexing (FDD) to study the performance of an
IRS-assisted mMIMO system. However, FDD is not suitable for large number of
antennas architectures. For this reason we employ the joint spatial division
and multiplexing (JSDM) approach exploiting the structure of the correlation of
the channel vectors to reduce the channel state information (CSI) uplink
feedback, and thus, allowing the use even of a large number of antennas at the
base station. JSDM entails dual-structured precoding and clustering the user
equipments (UEs) with the same covariance matrix into groups. Specifically, we
derive the sum spectral efficiency (SE) based on statistical CSI in terms of
large-scale statistics by using the deterministic equivalent (DE) analysis
while accounting for correlated Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we formulate the
optimization problem concerning the sum SE with respect to the reflecting
beamforming matrix (RBM) and the total transmit power, which can be performed
at every several coherence intervals by taking advantage of the slow-time
variation of the large-scale statistics. This notable property contributes
further to the decrease of the feedback overhead.

missing values by themselves. However, missing values may in principle
contribute useful information that is lost through imputation. The
missing-indicator approach can be used to preserve this information. There are
several theoretical considerations why missing-indicators may or may not be
beneficial, but there has not been any large-scale practical experiment on
real-life datasets to test this question for machine learning predictions. We
perform this experiment for three imputation strategies and a range of
different classification algorithms, on the basis of twenty real-life datasets.
We find that missing-indicators generally increase classification performance,
and that nearest neighbour and iterative imputation do not lead to better
performance than simple mean/mode imputation. Therefore, we recommend the use
of missing-indicators with mean/mode imputation as a safe default, with the
caveat that for decision trees, pruning is necessary to prevent overfitting.

its potential for explaining the transient effects, such as double descent,
that emerge during neural network training. In this work, we study how the
alignment between the target function and the kernel affects the performance of
the KRR. We focus on the truncated KRR (TKRR) which utilizes an additional
parameter that controls the spectral truncation of the kernel matrix. We show
that for polynomial alignment, there is an \emph{over-aligned} regime, in which
TKRR can achieve a faster rate than what is achievable by full KRR. The rate of
TKRR can improve all the way to the parametric rate, while that of full KRR is
capped at a sub-optimal value. This shows that target alignemnt can be better
leveraged by utilizing spectral truncation in kernel methods. We also consider
the bandlimited alignment setting and show that the regularization surface of
TKRR can exhibit transient effects including multiple descent and non-monotonic
behavior. Our results show that there is a strong and quantifable relation
between the shape of the \emph{alignment spectrum} and the generalization
performance of kernel methods, both in terms of rates and in finite samples.

the early universe is the so-called misalignment mechanism. Three regimes have
been investigated in this context: standard misalignment, large misalignment
and kinetic misalignment. The latter applies if the axion inherits a large
initial velocity in the early universe, such that the field rolls through many
wiggles during its evolution, before it gets trapped in one minimum. This
largely opens the region of parameter space for ALP dark matter towards higher
values for the axion-photon coupling, which can be probed by the whole set of
next decade's upcoming experiments. In fact, almost the entire parameter space
in the [mass, decay constant] plane can now accommodate dark matter. In this
paper, we show that in kinetic misalignment, the axion field is almost always
entirely fragmented, meaning that the energy density of the homogeneous field
is redistributed over higher-mode axions. We present a general
model-independent analytical description of kinetic fragmentation, including
discussion of the modified initial conditions for the mode functions due to the
axion's initial velocity, and how they impact the growth of the adiabatic
fluctuations. We calculate precisely the parameter regions corresponding
respectively to standard misalignment, kinetic misalignment with weak
fragmentation, fragmentation after trapping and fragmentation before trapping.
While axion fragmentation can impact the precise determination of the relic
abundance, another main observational implication is the formation of much
denser compact axion halos, that is described in a companion paper. We also
point out a new gravitational-wave signature that arises in the large
misalignment regime with complete fragmentation and could be seen in
measurements of $\mu$ distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background.

differentially rotating Keplerian disk containing either vertical or azimuthal

eigenvalue stability analysis and linear global initial-value simulations, it
is demonstrated that this instability dominates at strong magnetic field where
local standard MRI becomes stable. Unlike the standard MRI mode, which is
concentrated in the high flow shear region, these distinct global modes (with
low azimuthal mode numbers) are extended in the global domain and are Alfv\'en
continuum driven unstable modes. As its mode structure and relative dominance
over MRI is inherently determined by the global spatial curvature as well as
the flow shear in the presence of magnetic field, we call it the
magneto-curvature (magneto-spatial-curvature) instability. Consistent with the
linear analysis, as the field strength is increased in the nonlinear
simulations, a transition from a MRI-driven turbulence to a state dominated by
global non-axisymmetric modes is obtained. This global instability could
therefore be a source of nonlinear transport in accretion disks at higher

model by combining a small labeled dataset with a presumably much larger
unlabeled dataset. Many methods for semi-supervised deep learning have been
developed, including pseudolabeling, consistency regularization, and
contrastive learning techniques. Pseudolabeling methods however are highly
susceptible to confounding, in which erroneous pseudolabels are assumed to be
true labels in early iterations, thereby causing the model to reinforce its
prior biases and thereby fail to generalize to strong predictive performance.
We present a new approach to suppress confounding errors through a method we
describe as Semi-supervised Contrastive Outlier removal for Pseudo Expectation
Maximization (SCOPE). Like basic pseudolabeling, SCOPE is related to
Expectation Maximization (EM), a latent variable framework which can be
extended toward understanding cluster-assumption deep semi-supervised
algorithms. However, unlike basic pseudolabeling which fails to adequately take
into account the probability of the unlabeled samples given the model, SCOPE
introduces an outlier suppression term designed to improve the behavior of EM
iteration given a discrimination DNN backbone in the presence of outliers. Our
results show that SCOPE greatly improves semi-supervised classification
accuracy over a baseline, and furthermore when combined with consistency
regularization achieves the highest reported accuracy for the semi-supervised
CIFAR-10 classification task using 250 and 4000 labeled samples. Moreover, we
show that SCOPE reduces the prevalence of confounding errors during
pseudolabeling iterations by pruning erroneous high-confidence pseudolabeled
samples that would otherwise contaminate the labeled set in subsequent
retraining iterations.

select, among many possible choices, the most efficient way to map a
probability measure onto another. That theory has been mostly used to estimate,
given a pair of source and target probability measures $(\mu, \nu)$, a
parameterized map $T_\theta$ that can efficiently map $\mu$ onto $\nu$. In many
applications, such as predicting cell responses to treatments, pairs of
input/output data measures $(\mu, \nu)$ that define optimal transport problems
do not arise in isolation but are associated with a context $c$, as for
instance a treatment when comparing populations of untreated and treated cells.
To account for that context in OT estimation, we introduce CondOT, a multi-task
approach to estimate a family of OT maps conditioned on a context variable,
using several pairs of measures $\left(\mu_i, \nu_i\right)$ tagged with a
context label $c_i$. CondOT learns a global map $\mathcal{T}_\theta$
conditioned on context that is not only expected to fit all labeled pairs in
the dataset $\left\{\left(c_i,\left(\mu_i, \nu_i\right)\right)\right\}$, i.e.,
$\mathcal{T}_\theta\left(c_i\right) \sharp \mu_i \approx \nu_i$, but should
also generalize to produce meaningful maps $\mathcal{T}_\theta\left(c_{\text

approach harnesses and provides a novel usage for partially input convex neural
networks, for which we introduce a robust and efficient initialization strategy

vision-language tasks such as image captioning as well as natural language
understanding and generation (NLU and NLG) tasks and computer vision tasks such

interactions among the elements of input source and target sequences. Although
self-attention successfully calculates the attention values and maps the
relationships among the elements of input source and target sequence, yet there
is no mechanism to control the intensity of attention. In real world, when
communicating with each other face to face or vocally, we tend to express
different visual and linguistic context with various amounts of intensity. Some
words might carry (be spoken with) more stress and weight indicating the
importance of that word in the context of the whole sentence. Based on this
intuition, we propose Zoneout Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC)
in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input
sequence are calculated with respect to the context of the elements of input
sequence. The results of our experiments reveal that employing ZoDIAC leads to
better performance in comparison with the self-attention module in the
Transformer model. The ultimate goal is to find out if we could modify
self-attention module in the Transformer model with a method that is
potentially extensible to other models that leverage on self-attention at their
core. Our findings suggest that this particular goal deserves further attention

the underlying graph is introduced to induce a block structure in the adjacency
matrix of the graph and learning relationships between fixed groups of

Monte Carlo is developed for block structural learning, under the conjugate
G-Wishart prior. The algorithm proposes moves that add or remove not just a
single link but an entire group of edges. The method is then applied to smooth
functional data. The classical smoothing procedure is improved by placing a
graphical model on the basis expansion coefficients, providing an estimate of
their conditional independence structure. Since the elements of a B-Spline
basis have compact support, the independence structure is reflected on
well-defined portions of the domain. A known partition of the functional domain
is exploited to investigate relationships among the substances within the

work, we present NumS, an array programming library which optimizes NumPy-like

search method which optimizes operator placement by minimizing maximum memory
and network load on any given node within a distributed system. Coupled with a
heuristic for load balanced data layouts, our approach is capable of attaining
communication lower bounds on some common numerical operations, and our
empirical study shows that LSHS enhances performance on Ray by decreasing
network load by a factor of 2x, requiring 4x less memory, and reducing
execution time by 10x on the logistic regression problem. On terabyte-scale

renewable penetration levels are rising rapidly in modern power systems. It is
a waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are
unable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher
power transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level.
Another major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation. The
hydrogen mix or pure hydrogen pipeline can both transfer and store the energy
in the form of hydrogen. However, its potential of accelerating renewable
integration has not been investigated. In this paper, hydrogen pipeline
networks, combined with power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P)
facilities, are organized to form a Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion
System (HETCS). We investigate the operation of power systems coupled with
HETCS, and propose the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)
with HETCS. The SCUC simulation is conducted on a modified IEEE 24-bus power
system with HETCS. Simulation results show HETCS can substantially reduce the
renewable curtailment, CO2 emission, load payment and total operational cost.
This study validates the HETCS can be a promising solution to achieve net-zero

a fundamental problem in data science. Often, such dynamics are the result of
non-local processes that present an integral over time. As such, these systems
are modeled with Integro-Differential Equations (IDEs); generalizations of
differential equations that comprise both an integral and a differential
component. For example, brain dynamics are not accurately modeled by
differential equations since their behavior is non-Markovian, i.e. dynamics are
in part dictated by history. Here, we introduce the Neural IDE (NIDE), a novel
deep learning framework based on the theory of IDEs where integral operators
are learned using neural networks. We test NIDE on several toy and brain
activity datasets and demonstrate that NIDE outperforms other models. These
tasks include time extrapolation as well as predicting dynamics from unseen
initial conditions, which we test on whole-cortex activity recordings in freely
behaving mice. Further, we show that NIDE can decompose dynamics into their
Markovian and non-Markovian constituents via the learned integral operator,
which we test on fMRI brain activity recordings of people on ketamine. Finally,
the integrand of the integral operator provides a latent space that gives
insight into the underlying dynamics, which we demonstrate on wide-field brain
imaging recordings. Altogether, NIDE is a novel approach that enables modeling
of complex non-local dynamics with neural networks.

the coalescence-inspired sum rule, i.e., to test if the flow of a light nucleus
or hypernucleus is the summed flow of each of its constituents. Here, the mass
difference and charge difference among the constituents of light nuclei and
hypernuclei are treated appropriately. The idea is applied to the available
data for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV fixed-target Au+Au collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), published by the STAR collaboration. It
is found that the sum rule for light nuclei is approximately valid near
mid-rapidity ($-0.3 < y < 0$), but there is a clear violation of the sum rule
at large rapidity ($y < -0.3$). The Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM),
with baryonic mean-field plus nucleon coalescence, generates a similar pattern
as obtained from the experimental data. In the present approach, the rapidity
dependence of directed flow of the hypernuclei $\mathrm{_{\Lambda}^{3}H}$ and
$\mathrm{_{\Lambda}^{4}H}$ is predicted in a model-independent way for
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV Au+Au collisions, which will be explored by ongoing and
future measurements from STAR.

detections of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning $970 - 1300$
d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including
at $\approx 700$ d, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at
$0.8-240$ GHz, steeper than $F_\nu\propto t^5$ relative to the time of optical
discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of
an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden
increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our
multi-frequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of
the radio-emitting outflow, showing that it was launched $\approx 750$ d after
optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with
$\beta\approx 0.25$ and $\approx 0.6$ for a spherical and a $10^\circ$ jet
geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is $E_K\approx 5.8\times
10^{49}$ and $\approx 6.3\times 10^{49}$ erg, respectively. This is the first
definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly-relativistic outflow
in a TDE; a comparison to the recently-published radio light curve of
ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final re-brightening observed in that event (at a
single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable
velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the
delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past
non-relativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE
Sw\,J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.

as SAT and CSP as well as using deep reinforcement learning to tackle
two-player games such as Go, certain classes of PSPACE-hard planning problems
have remained out of reach. Even carefully designed domain-specialized solvers
can fail quickly due to the exponential search space on hard instances. Recent
works that combine traditional search methods, such as best-first search and
Monte Carlo tree search, with Deep Neural Networks' (DNN) heuristics have shown
promising progress and can solve a significant number of hard planning
instances beyond specialized solvers. To better understand why these approaches
work, we studied the interplay of the policy and value networks of DNN-based
best-first search on Sokoban and show the surprising effectiveness of the
policy network, further enhanced by the value network, as a guiding heuristic
for the search. To further understand the phenomena, we studied the cost
distribution of the search algorithms and found that Sokoban instances can have
heavy-tailed runtime distributions, with tails both on the left and right-hand
sides. In particular, for the first time, we show the existence of \textit{left
heavy tails} and propose an abstract tree model that can empirically explain
the appearance of these tails. The experiments show the critical role of the
policy network as a powerful heuristic guiding the search, which can lead to
left heavy tails with polynomial scaling by avoiding exploring exponentially
sized subtrees. Our results also demonstrate the importance of random restarts,
as are widely used in traditional combinatorial solvers, for DNN-based search
methods to avoid left and right heavy tails.

the effect of the shape of the textures has only been considered in qualitative

comparing the physical response of the textured surfaces with various
cross-sectional profiles. As a case study, textured surfaces designed with this

cylindrical Couette flow regime in Taylor- Couette flows. With the reduction in
torque as the objective, experimental and numerical results confirm that
textures with height-to-half-spacing of lower and equal to unity with concave
profiles offer a lower torque compared to both smooth surfaces and triangular
textures. In addition, across multiple polynomial orders, textures defined by
second order polynomials offer a wide range of responses, eliminating the need
for considering polynomials of higher orders and complexity. While the case
study here is focused on the laminar flow regime and the frictional torque, the
same type of analysis can be applied to other surface properties and physical

qualitative and quantitative analysis of lesions or anatomical structures,
significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of diagnosis and
prognosis. Traditionally, these tasks are finished by physicians or medical
physicists and lead to two major problems: (i) low efficiency; (ii) biased by
personal experience. In the past decade, many machine learning methods have
been applied to accelerate and automate the image analysis process. Compared to
the enormous deployments of supervised and unsupervised learning models,
attempts to use reinforcement learning in medical image analysis are scarce.
This review article could serve as the stepping-stone for related research.
Significance: From our observation, though reinforcement learning has gradually
gained momentum in recent years, many researchers in the medical analysis field
find it hard to understand and deploy in clinics. One cause is lacking
well-organized review articles targeting readers lacking professional computer
science backgrounds. Rather than providing a comprehensive list of all
reinforcement learning models in medical image analysis, this paper may help
the readers to learn how to formulate and solve their medical image analysis
research as reinforcement learning problems. Approach & Results: We selected
published articles from Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering the scarcity of
related articles, we also included some outstanding newest preprints. The
papers are carefully reviewed and categorized according to the type of image
analysis task. We first review the basic concepts and popular models of
reinforcement learning. Then we explore the applications of reinforcement
learning models in landmark detection. Finally, we conclude the article by
discussing the reviewed reinforcement learning approaches' limitations and
possible improvements.

purpose of our study was to develop and test a deep-learning-based tool to
facilitate and automate the data annotation process for thyroid nodules; we
named our tool Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP). MADLaP
was designed to take multiple inputs included pathology reports, ultrasound
images, and radiology reports. Using multiple step-wise modules including
rule-based natural language processing, deep-learning-based imaging
segmentation, and optical character recognition, MADLaP automatically
identified images of a specific thyroid nodule and correctly assigned a
pathology label. The model was developed using a training set of 378 patients
across our health system and tested on a separate set of 93 patients. Ground
truths for both sets were selected by an experienced radiologist. Performance
metrics including yield (how many labeled images the model produced) and
accuracy (percentage correct) were measured using the test set. MADLaP achieved
a yield of 63% and an accuracy of 83%. The yield progressively increased as the
input data moved through each module, while accuracy peaked part way through.
Error analysis showed that inputs from certain examination sites had lower
accuracy (40%) than the other sites (90%, 100%). MADLaP successfully created
curated datasets of labeled ultrasound images of thyroid nodules. While
accurate, the relatively suboptimal yield of MADLaP exposed some challenges
when trying to automatically label radiology images from heterogeneous sources.
The complex task of image curation and annotation could be automated, allowing
for enrichment of larger datasets for use in machine learning development.

the potentially hazardous asteroid (2102)~Tantalus from the ESO NTT and Danish
telescopes at the La Silla Observatory and from the Arecibo planetary radar.
The object appears to be nearly spherical, showing a low amplitude light-curve
variation and limited large-scale features in the radar images. The spin-state
is difficult to constrain with the available data; including a certain
light-curve subset significantly changes the spin-state estimates, and the
uncertainties on period determination are significant. Constraining any change
in rotation rate was not possible, despite decades of observations. The convex
lightcurve-inversion model, with rotational pole at
${\lambda}=210{\pm}41${\deg} and ${\beta}=-30{\pm}35${\deg}, is more flattened
than the two models reconstructed by including radar observations: with
prograde (${\lambda}=36{\pm}23${\deg}, ${\beta}=30{\pm}15${\deg}), and with
retrograde rotation mode (${\lambda}=180{\pm}24${\deg},
${\beta}=-30{\pm}16${\deg}). Using data from WISE we were able to determine
that the prograde model produces the best agreement in size determination
between radar and thermophysical modelling. Radar measurements indicate
possible variation in surface properties, suggesting one side might have lower
radar albedo and be rougher at centimetre-to-decimetre scale than the other.
However, further observations are needed to confirm this. Thermophysical
analysis indicates a surface covered in fine-grained regolith, consistent with
radar albedo and polarisation ratio measurements. Finally, geophysical
investigation of the spin-stability of Tantalus shows that it could be
exceeding its critical spin-rate via cohesive forces.

in recent years is the use of neural networks as variational estimators for
quantum states. In this work, we propose a symmetry-projected variational
solution in the form of linear combinations of simple restricted Boltzmann
machines. This construction allows one to explore states outside of the
original variational manifold and increase the representation power with
moderate computational effort. Besides allowing one to restore spatial
symmetries, an expansion in terms of Krylov states using a Lanczos recursion
offers a solution that can further improve the quantum state accuracy. We
illustrate these ideas with an application to the Heisenberg $J_1-J_2$ model on
the square lattice, a paradigmatic problem under debate in condensed matter
physics, and achieve start-of-the-art accuracy in the representation of the

masses spanning fifteen orders of magnitude. We highlight the role of the FRB
redshift distribution on our ability to observe gravitational lensing. We
consider cosmological lensing of FRBs by stars in foreground galaxies and show
that strong stellar lensing will dominate on microsecond timescales. Upcoming

corresponding measurement values overlap. Additional uncertainty arises when
classification schemes fail to account for complicated structure in data. We
address these problems through a mathematical framework that combines high
dimensional data modeling and optimal decision theory. Specifically, we show
that appropriately increasing the dimension of data better separates positive
and negative populations and reveals nuanced structure that can be described in
terms of mathematical models. We combine these models with optimal decision
theory to yield a classification scheme that better separates positive and
negative samples relative to traditional methods such as confidence intervals
(CIs) and receiver operating characteristics. We validate the usefulness of
this approach in the context of a multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin
G assay dataset. This example illustrates how our analysis: (i) improves the
assay accuracy (e.g. lowers classification errors by up to 42 % compared to CI
methods); (ii) reduces the number of indeterminate samples when an inconclusive
class is permissible (e.g. by 40 % compared to the original analysis of the

diagnostic classification and highlights a method that can be adopted broadly

Prominent 220 kpc long filaments extend east of radio galaxy 3C40B, with very

field, we demonstrate that a Proca star, a self-gravitating condensate of the

instability without any pathology at UV, in which the EFT description is still
valid and the gradient instability in EFT may be interpreted as a standard
dynamical instability of a high-density boson star from the UV perspective. On

spontaneously excited to cure the pathology of the EFT as the EFT dynamically
tends to approach the onset of the ghost instability.

our systematic approach, two popular DL frameworks, Keras and PyTorch, are used

galileon model non-minimally coupled to the dark matter. Three well-known
classes of interacting models are considered where the energy exchange between
the dark components is a function of the dark matter density and of the dark
energy density: $Q_1=3\alpha H\rho_m$, $Q_2=3\beta\rho_m\dot{\phi}$ and $Q_3=3
\epsilon H \rho_\phi$, respectively. We are able to show the global asymptotic
dynamics of the model for the exponential potential in a homogeneous and
isotropic background. The cosmological implications of the proposed scenarios
are explored and it is found that, in addition to the appearance of new
equilibrium configurations that do not appear neither in the non-interacting
cubic galileon model nor in the interacting quintessence model, there is a
significant impact of the non-minimal coupling through modification of the
stability properties of the critical points. The resulting cosmological
scenario provides a bigbang origin of the cosmic expansion, an early transient
stage of inflationary expansion, as well as matter-scaling late time stable
state of the universe, among other solutions of lesser cosmological interest.
This work extends previous studies of coupled dark energy to a broader class of
gravitational theories.

lifetimes. Recent experiments imply upper bounds on bulk dielectric loss
tangents on the order of $100$ parts-per-billion, but because these inferences
are drawn from fully fabricated devices with many loss channels, they do not
definitively implicate or exonerate the dielectric. To resolve this ambiguity,
we have devised a measurement method capable of separating and resolving bulk
dielectric loss with a sensitivity at the level of $5$ parts per billion. The
method, which we call the dielectric dipper, involves the in-situ insertion of
a dielectric sample into a high-quality microwave cavity mode. Smoothly varying
the sample's participation in the cavity mode enables a differential
measurement of the sample's dielectric loss tangent. The dielectric dipper can
probe the low-power behavior of dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures, and does
so without the need for any lithographic process, enabling controlled
comparisons of substrate materials and processing techniques. We demonstrate
the method with measurements of EFG sapphire, from which we infer a bulk loss
tangent of $62(7) \times 10^{-9}$ and a substrate-air interface loss tangent of
$12(2) \times 10^{-4}$. For a typical transmon, this bulk loss tangent would
limit device quality factors to less than $20$ million, suggesting that bulk
loss is likely the dominant loss mechanism in the longest-lived transmons on
sapphire. We also demonstrate this method on HEMEX sapphire and bound its bulk
loss tangent to be less than $15(5) \times 10^{-9}$. As this bound is about 3
times smaller than the bulk loss tangent of EFG sapphire, use of HEMEX sapphire
as a substrate would lift the bulk dielectric coherence limit of a typical
transmon qubit to several milliseconds.

compiled optical data set that comprises 145 SNe and 1595 optical spectra in
4000-9000 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$. Our classification method naturally
identifies outliers and arranges the different SNe in terms of their major
spectral features. We compare our approach to the off-the-shelf umap manifold
learning and show that both strategies are consistent with a continuous
variation of spectral types rather than discrete families. The automated
classification naturally reflects the fast evolution of Type II SNe around the
maximum light while showcasing their homogeneity close to the end of the
plateau phase. The scheme we develop could be more widely applicable to
unsupervised time series classification or characterisation of other functional
data.

Continuous collection of mobile data results in the generation of a new type of

Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research,
and the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) using mobile devices in
psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex structure of
multivariate time series introduces new challenges in handling missing data for
proper causal inference. Data imputation is commonly recommended to enhance
data utility and estimation efficiency. The majority of available imputation
methods are either designed for longitudinal data with limited follow-up times
or for stationary time series, which are incompatible with potentially
non-stationary time series. In the field of psychiatry, non-stationary data are
frequently encountered as symptoms and treatment regimens may experience
dramatic changes over time. To address missing data in possibly non-stationary
multivariate time series, we propose a novel multiple imputation strategy based
on the state space model (SSMmp) and a more computationally efficient variant
(SSMimpute). We demonstrate their advantages over other widely used missing
data strategies by evaluating their theoretical properties and empirical
performance in simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series,
subject to various missing mechanisms. We apply the SSMimpute to investigate

using various stress-balance approximations and boundary conditions. At high
spatial resolution, with horizontal mesh/grid resolutions of a few kilometers

climate-coupling time scales because they update ice thickness after each
velocity solution. High-resolution performance is degraded by the stability
restrictions of such explicit time-stepping. This short note, which considers
the shallow ice approximation and Stokes models as stress-balance end members,
attempts to clarify numerical model performance by quantifying simulation cost

the SS433--W50 system. The most unique features of SS433 are the presence of
the precessing, mildly relativistic jets and the obscuration of the central
engine, which are considered to be due to a supercritical accretion on to the
central compact object. The jets are likely to be ejected from the innermost
region of the accretion flow. The concept of the accretion ring (Inoue 2021,
PASJ, 73,795) is applied to the outer boundary of the accretion flow and the
ring is supposed to have a precession. The accretion ring is expected to extend
a two-layer outflow of a thin excretion disk and a thick excretion flow, as
well as the accretion flow. The thin excretion disk is discussed to eventually
form the optically thick excretion belt along the Roche lobe around the compact
object, contributing to the obscuration of the central engine. The thick
excretion flow is likely to turn to the supersonic wind (disk wind) with the
terminal velocity of $\sim 10^{8}$ cm s$^{-1}$ and to collide with the SNR
matter at the distance of $\sim 10^{18}$ cm. The interactions of the jets with
the disk wind are considered to cause the features of the jets observed at the
distances of 10$^{14} \sim 10^{15}$ cm and $\sim 10^{17}$ cm. Finally, it is
discussed that the jets are braked by the SNR matter at the distance of
$\sim$10 pc and the momentum carried by the jet is transferred to the SNR
matter shoved by the jet. The SNR matter pushed to the inside of the precession
cone is expected to gather along the cone axis and to form the elongated
structures in the east and west directions from the main W50 structure.

as sparse linear regression and robust linear regression. The goal of the
sparse linear regression problem is to identify a small number of key features,

problem seeks a $k$-sparse vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to minimize $\|Ax-b\|_2$,
given an input matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and a target vector
$b\in\mathbb{R}^n$, while the robust linear regression problem seeks a set $S$
that ignores at most $k$ rows and a vector $x$ to minimize $\|(Ax-b)_S\|_2$.
  We first show bicriteria, NP-hardness of approximation for robust regression
building on the work of [OWZ15] which implies a similar result for sparse
regression. We further show fine-grained hardness of robust regression through
a reduction from the minimum-weight $k$-clique conjecture. On the positive
side, we give an algorithm for robust regression that achieves arbitrarily
accurate additive error and uses runtime that closely matches the lower bound
from the fine-grained hardness result, as well as an algorithm for sparse
regression with similar runtime. Both our upper and lower bounds rely on a
general reduction from robust linear regression to sparse regression that we
introduce. Our algorithms, inspired by the 3SUM problem, use approximate
nearest neighbor data structures and may be of independent interest for solving
sparse optimization problems. For instance, we demonstrate that our techniques
can also be used for the well-studied sparse PCA problem.

self-supervised learning is effective for pretraining multimodal interactions.
In this technical report, we focus on visual representations. We review and
evaluate self-supervised methods to leverage unlabeled images and pretrain a
model, which we then fine-tune on a custom VQA task that allows controlled
evaluation and diagnosis. We compare energy-based models (EBMs) with
contrastive learning (CL). While EBMs are growing in popularity, they lack an
evaluation on downstream tasks. We find that both EBMs and CL can learn
representations from unlabeled images that enable training a VQA model on very
little annotated data. In a simple setting similar to CLEVR, we find that CL
representations also improve systematic generalization, and even match the
performance of representations from a larger, supervised, ImageNet-pretrained
model. However, we find EBMs to be difficult to train because of instabilities
and high variability in their results. Although EBMs prove useful for OOD
detection, other results on supervised energy-based training and uncertainty
calibration are largely negative. Overall, CL currently seems a preferable
option over EBMs.

stability/recurrence in probability are usually expressed based on different
types of Lyapunov functions, including Lagrange/Lyapunov/Lyapunov-Forster

applications. The efficiency of graph storage is crucial for these
applications. Generally speaking, the tune tasks of graph storage rely on the
database administrators (DBAs) to find the best graph storage. However, DBAs
make the tune decisions by mainly relying on their experiences and intuition.
Due to the limitations of DBAs's experiences, the tunes may have an uncertain
performance and conduct worse efficiency. In this paper, we observe that an
estimator of graph workload has the potential to guarantee the performance of
tune operations. Unfortunately, because of the complex characteristics of graph
evaluation task, there exists no mature estimator for graph workload. We
formulate the evaluation task of graph workload as a classification task and
carefully design the feature engineering process, including graph data
features, graph workload features and graph storage features. Considering the
complex features of graph and the huge time consumption in graph workload
execution, it is difficult for the graph workload estimator to obtain enough
training set. So, we propose an active auto-estimator (AAE) for the graph
workload evaluation by combining the active learning and deep learning. AAE
could achieve good evaluation efficiency with limited training set. We test the
time efficiency and evaluation accuracy of AAE with two open source graph data,

simultaneously achieves: (i) High Capacity -- With almost no utility loss of
the carrier model, Matryoshka can hide a 26x larger secret model or 8 secret
models of diverse architectures spanning different application domains in the
carrier model, neither of which can be done with existing steganography

Here, we present experimental results on polycrystalline NbP, demonstrating the
simultaneous existence of a large Nernst effect and a large magneto-Seebeck
effect, which is typically not observed in a single material at the same
temperature. We compare transport results from two polycrystalline samples of
NbP with previously published work, observing a shift in the temperature at
which the maximum Nernst and magneto-Seebeck thermopowers occur, while still
maintaining thermopowers of similar magnitude. Theoretical modeling shows how
doping strongly alters both the Seebeck and Nernst magneto-thermopowers by
shifting the temperature-dependent chemical potential, and the corresponding
calculations provide a consistent interpretation of our results. Thus, we offer
doping as a tuning mechanism for shifting magneto-thermoelectric effects to
temperatures appropriate for device applications, improving zT at desirable
operating temperature. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of both a large
Nernst and magneto-Seebeck thermopower is uncommon and offers unique device
advantages if the thermopowers are used additively. Here, we also propose a
unique thermoelectric device which would collectively harness the large Nernst
and magneto-Seebeck thermopowers to greatly enhance the output and zT of

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with EUV deficit are suggested to be

in AGNs with EUV deficit for the first time. Methods. We construct a sample of
15 objects with EUV deficit to analyse their X-ray emission. The X-ray
luminosity in 13 objects are newly processed by ourself, while the other 2
sources are gathered from archival data. Results. It is found that the average
X-ray flux of AGNs with EUV deficit are 4.5 times larger than that of
radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs), while the slope of relationship between the
optical-UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$) and the X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) is
found to be similar with that of RQAGNs. For comparison, the average X-ray flux
of radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) without EUV deficit is about 2-3 times larger than
that of RQAGNs. A strong positive correlation between $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$ and
radio-loudness ($R_{\rm UV}$) is also reported. However, there is no strong
relationship between $L_{\rm X}$ and the radio luminosity ($L_{\rm R}$).
Conclusions. Both the excess of X-ray emission of RLAGNs with EUV deficit and
the strong $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$-$R_{\rm UV}$ relationship can be qualitatively
explained with MAD scenario, which can help to constrain the theoretical model

X-ray reverberation due to the lamp-post source. We utilize 16 XMM-Newton
observations individually as well as group them into three different luminosity
bins: low, medium and high. The soft (0.3-1 keV) and hard (1.2-5 keV) PSD
spectra are extracted and simultaneously fitted with the model. We find that
the corona height changes from h ~ 3 $\ r_{\rm g}$ during the lowest luminosity
state to ~ $25 \ r_{\rm g}$ during the highest luminosity state. This provides
further evidence that the source height from the reverberation data is
significantly larger than what constrained by the spectral analysis.
Furthermore, as the corona height increases, the energy spectrum tends to be
softer while the observed fractional excess variance, $F_{\rm var}$, reduces.
We find that the PSD normalization is strongly correlated with $F_{\rm var}$,
and moderately correlated with the PSD bending index. Therefore, the
normalization is dependent on accretion rate that controls the intrinsic shape
of the PSD. While the intrinsic variability of the disk is manifested by the
reverberation signals, the disk and corona may evolve independently. Our
results suggest that, during the source height increases, the disk itself
generates less overall variability power but more high-frequency variability
resulting in the PSD spectrum that flattens out (i.e. the inner disk becomes
more active). Using the luminosity-bin data, the hint of Lorentzian component
is seen, with the peak appearing at lower frequencies with increasing
luminosity.

limitation, we propose SememeWSD Synonym (SWSDS) model to assign a different
vector to every sense of polysemous words with the help of word sense
disambiguation (WSD) and synonym set in OpenHowNet. We use the SememeWSD model,
an unsupervised word sense disambiguation model based on OpenHowNet, to do word
sense disambiguation and annotate the polysemous word with sense id. Then, we
obtain top 10 synonyms of the word sense from OpenHowNet and calculate the
average vector of synonyms as the vector of the word sense. In experiments, We
evaluate the SWSDS model on semantic similarity calculation with Gensim's
wmdistance method. It achieves improvement of accuracy. We also examine the
SememeWSD model on different BERT models to find the more effective model.

  In this work, we take a different, more compute-friendly approach and

refrains from outputting certain kinds of samples. We show that redaction is a
fundamentally different task from data deletion, and data deletion may not
always lead to redaction. We then consider Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), and provide three different algorithms for data redaction that differ
on how the samples to be redacted are described. Extensive evaluations on

baselines, and are capable of redacting data while retaining high generation
quality at a fraction of the cost of full re-training.

superior performance in a variety of software engineering tasks, yet they are
often heavy in complexity, quadratically with the length of the input sequence.
Our empirical analysis of CodeBERT's attention reveals that CodeBERT pays more
attention to certain types of tokens and statements such as keywords and
data-relevant statements. Based on these findings, we propose DietCode, which
aims at lightweight leverage of large pre-trained models for source code.
DietCode simplifies the input program of CodeBERT with three strategies,
namely, word dropout, frequency filtering, and an attention-based strategy
which selects statements and tokens that receive the most attention weights
during pre-training. Hence, it gives a substantial reduction in the
computational cost without hampering the model performance. Experimental
results on two downstream tasks show that DietCodeBERT provides comparable
results to CodeBERT with 40% less computational cost in fine-tuning and
testing.

at higher temperatures have been reported to be effective in eliminating

concentration oxygen vacancies. In this work, a unidirectional annealing method
is proposed for the crystallization of $\mathrm{Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2}$ (HZO)
superlattice ferroelectrics, which involves heating from the
$\mathrm{Pt/ZrO_2}$ interface side. Nanoscale $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ is selected to
resist the formation of monoclinic phase, and the chemically inert Pt electrode
can avoid the continuous generation of oxygen vacancies during annealing. It is
demonstrated that $\mathrm{600^oC}$ annealing only leads to a moderate content
of monoclinic phase in HZO, and the TiN/HZO/Pt capacitor exhibits wake-up free
nature and a $2P_\mathrm{r}$ value of 27.4 $\mu\mathrm{C/cm^2}$. On the other
hand, heating from the $\mathrm{TiN/HfO_2}$ side, or using $\mathrm{500^oC}$
annealing temperature, both yield ferroelectric devices that require a wake-up

comparative studies with several other superlattice structures and HZO
solid-state solutions. It is discovered that heating from the

a memristor behavior. The mechanisms of ferroelectric phase stabilization and

applications. Currently, acoustic wave manipulation typically relies on either
acoustic metasurfaces or phased array transducers. The elements of metasurfaces
are designed and optimized for a target frequency, which thus limits their
bandwidth. Phased array transducers, suffering from high-cost and complex
control circuits, are usually limited by the array size and the filling ratio
of the control units. In this work, we introduce active coding piezoelectric
metasurfaces; demonstrate commonly implemented acoustic wave manipulation
functionalities such as beam steering, beam focusing and vortex beam focusing,
acoustic tweezers; and eventually realize ultrasound imaging. The information
coded on the piezoelectric metasurfaces herein is frequency independent and
originates from the polarization directions, pointing either up or down, of the
piezoelectric materials. Such a piezoelectric metasurface is driven by a single
electrode and acts as a controllable active sound source, which combines the
advantages of acoustic metasurfaces and phased array transducers while keeping
the devices structurally simple and compact. Our coding piezoelectric
metasurfaces can lead to potential technological innovations in underwater
acoustic wave modulation, acoustic tweezers, biomedical imaging, industrial
non-destructive testing and neural regulation.

reduced system that evolves on a low-rank manifold is constructed via an
unconventional basis update and Galerkin integrator to avoid a substep that is

magnetic field minimum at a right angle to the trap axis. It was assumed that
the lateral wall has the shape of a cylinder with a variable radius, so that on
an enlarged scale it repeats the shape of the plasma column.
  It has been found that for the effective stabilization of the listed modes by
an ideally conducting lateral wall, the parameter beta ($\beta$, the ratio of
the plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure) must exceed some critical
value $\beta_{\text{crit}}$. When combined with a conducting lateral wall and
conducting end plates imitating MHD end stabilizers, there are two critical
beta values and two stability zones $0<\beta<\beta_{\text{ crit}1}$ and
$\beta_{\text {crit}2}<\beta<1$ that can merge, making the entire range of
allowable beta values $0<\beta<1$ stable.
  The dependence of the critical betas on the degree of plasma anisotropy, the
mirror ratio, and the width of the vacuum gap between the plasma and the
lateral wall is studied. In contrast to the works of other authors devoted to
the plasma model with a sharp boundary, we calculated the boundaries of the
stability zone for a number of diffuse radial pressure profiles and several
axial magnetic field profiles.

CNNs, have drawn explosive attention recently. However, the daunting
computational complexity of global representation learning, together with rigid
window partitioning, hinders their deployment in medical image segmentation.
This work aims to address the above two issues in transformers for better
medical image segmentation. Methods: We propose a boundary-aware lightweight
transformer (BATFormer) that can build cross-scale global interaction with
lower computational complexity and generate windows flexibly under the guidance
of entropy. Specifically, to fully explore the benefits of transformers in
long-range dependency establishment, a cross-scale global transformer (CGT)
module is introduced to jointly utilize multiple small-scale feature maps for
richer global features with lower computational complexity. Given the
importance of shape modeling in medical image segmentation, a boundary-aware
local transformer (BLT) module is constructed. Different from rigid window
partitioning in vanilla transformers which would produce boundary distortion,
BLT adopts an adaptive window partitioning scheme under the guidance of entropy
for both computational complexity reduction and shape preservation. Results:
BATFormer achieves the best performance in Dice of 92.84%, 91.97%, 90.26%, and
96.30% for the average, right ventricle, myocardium, and left ventricle
respectively on the ACDC dataset and the best performance in Dice, IoU, and ACC
of 90.76%, 84.64%, and 96.76% respectively on the ISIC 2018 dataset. More
importantly, BATFormer requires the least amount of model parameters and the
lowest computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
Conclusion and Significance: Our results demonstrate the necessity of
developing customized transformers for efficient and better medical image
segmentation.

image analysis due to their remarkable performance on various computer vision
tasks. However, recent hybrid-/transformer-based approaches mainly focus on the
benefits of transformers in capturing long-range dependency while ignoring the
issues of their daunting computational complexity, high training costs, and
redundant dependency. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive pruning to
transformers for medical image segmentation and propose a lightweight and
effective hybrid network APFormer. To our best knowledge, this is the first
work on transformer pruning for medical image analysis tasks. The key features
of APFormer mainly are self-supervised self-attention (SSA) to improve the
convergence of dependency establishment, Gaussian-prior relative position
embedding (GRPE) to foster the learning of position information, and adaptive
pruning to eliminate redundant computations and perception information.
Specifically, SSA and GRPE consider the well-converged dependency distribution
and the Gaussian heatmap distribution separately as the prior knowledge of
self-attention and position embedding to ease the training of transformers and
lay a solid foundation for the following pruning operation. Then, adaptive
transformer pruning, both query-wise and dependency-wise, is performed by
adjusting the gate control parameters for both complexity reduction and
performance improvement. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets
demonstrate the prominent segmentation performance of APFormer against the
state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and lower GFLOPs. More
importantly, we prove, through ablation studies, that adaptive pruning can work
as a plug-n-play module for performance improvement on other

optimal stomatal model within a two-source energy balance model in drylands. We
assessed our ET estimation using in situ eddy covariance GPP as a benchmark,
and compared with results from using the Contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll
fluorescence (CSIF) remote sensing product instead of GPP, with and without the
effect of root-zone soil moisture on the Gc. The estimated ET was robust across
four steppes and two tree-grass dryland ecosystem. Comparison of ET simulated
against in situ GPP yielded an average R2 of 0.73 (0.86) and RMSE of 0.031
(0.36) mm at half-hourly (daily) timescale. Including explicitly the soil
moisture effect on Gc, increased the R2 to 0.76 (0.89). For the CSIF model, the
average R2 for ET estimates also improved when including the effect of soil
moisture: from 0.65 (0.79) to 0.71 (0.84), with RMSE ranging between 0.023

capacity of SIF to estimate subdaily and daily ET fluxes under very low ET
conditions. SIF can provide effective vegetation signals to constrain stomatal
conductance and partition ET into T and E in drylands. This approach could be
extended for regional estimates using remote sensing SIF estimates such as
CSIF, TROPOMI-SIF, or the upcoming FLEX mission, among others.

to be capable of correctly incorporating long-range interactions within a

estimate the transformation and are thus a flexible analysis approach for
continuous outcomes. However, it is difficult to establish asymptotic
properties for CPMs due to the potentially unbounded range of the
transformation. Here we show asymptotic properties for CPMs when applied to
slightly modified data where the outcomes are censored at the ends. We prove
uniform consistency of the estimated regression coefficients and the estimated
transformation function over the non-censored region, and describe their joint
asymptotic distribution. We show with simulations that results from this
censored approach and those from the CPM on the original data are similar when
a small fraction of data are censored. We reanalyze a dataset of HIV-positive

equipped with 1-bit analog-to-digital (in uplink) and digital-to-analog (in

communicates with multiple single antenna users with individual SINR
constraints. We first establish the uplink downlink duality principle under
1-bit hardware constraints under an uncorrelated quantization noise assumption.
We then present a linear solution to the multi-user downlink beamforming
problem based on the uplink downlink duality principle. The proposed solution
takes into account the hardware constraints and jointly optimizes the downlink
beamformers and the power allocated to each user. Optimized dithering obtained
by adding dummy users to the true system users ensures that the uncorrelated
quantization noise assumption is true under realistic settings. Detailed
simulations carried out using 3GPP channel models generated from Quadriga show
that our proposed solution outperforms state of the art solutions in terms of
the ergodic sum and minimum rate especially when the number of users is large.
We also demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly reduces the
performance gap from non-linear solutions in terms of the uncoded bit error

general scaling theory has been proposed for critical avalanche profiles in
crackling noise, predicting the collapse onto a universal avalanche shape, as
well as the scaling behaviour of the activity power spectrum as Brown noise.
Recently, much attention has been given to the profile of neuronal avalanches,
measured in neuronal systems in vitro and in vivo. Although a universal profile
was evidenced, confirming the validity of the general scaling theory, the
parallel study of the power spectrum scaling under the same conditions was not
performed. The puzzling observation is that in the majority of healthy neuronal
systems the power spectrum exhibits a behaviour close to $1/f$, rather than
Brown, noise. Here we perform a numerical study of the scaling behaviour of
avalanche shape and power spectrum for a model of integrate and fire neurons
with a short-term plasticity parameter able to tune the system to criticality.
We confirm that, at criticality, the average avalanche size and the avalanche
profile fulfill the general avalanche scaling theory. However, the power
spectrum consistently exhibits Brown noise behaviour, for both fully excitatory
networks and systems with 30\% inhibitory networks. Conversely, a behaviour
closer to $1/f$ noise is observed in systems slightly off-criticality. Results
suggest that the power spectrum is a good indicator to determine how close
neuronal activity is to criticality.

order geometric optics expansions of weakly stable quasilinear hyperbolic
boundary value problems, when the forcing boundary term is perturbed by a small
amplitude oscillating function, with a transverse frequency. Since the boundary
frequencies lie in the locus where the so-called Lopatinskii determinant is
zero, the amplifications on the boundary give rise to a highly coupled system
of equations for the profiles. A simplified model for this system is solved in
an analytical framework using the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem as well as a
version of it ensuring analyticity in space and time for the solution. Then it
is proven that, through resonances and amplification, a particular
configuration for the phases may create an instability, in the sense that the
small perturbation of the forcing term on the boundary interferes at the
leading order in the asymptotic expansion of the solution. Finally we study the
possibility for such a configuration of frequencies to happen for the
isentropic Euler equations in space dimension three.

self-organisation, with examples spanning cellular and animal systems. A basic
mechanism assumes a phenotypically homogeneous population that secretes its own
attractant, with the well known system introduced more than five decades ago by
Keller and Segel proving resolutely popular in modelling studies. The typical
assumption of population phenotypic homogeneity, however, often lies at odds
with the heterogeneity of natural systems, where populations may comprise
distinct phenotypes that vary according to their chemotactic ability,
attractant secretion, {\it etc}. To initiate an understanding into how this
diversity can impact on autoaggregation, we propose a simple extension to the
classical Keller and Segel model, in which the population is divided into two
distinct phenotypes: those performing chemotaxis and those producing
attractant. Using a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that switching between these phenotypic states
alters the capacity of a population to self-aggregate. Further, we show that
switching based on the local environment (population density or chemoattractant
level) leads to diverse patterning and provides a route through which a
population can effectively curb the size and density of an aggregate. We
discuss the results in the context of real world examples of chemotactic
aggregation, as well as theoretical aspects of the model such as global
existence and blow-up of solutions.

  Since the pioneering works from the 80s by Breuer, Dobrushin, Major,
Rosenblatt, Taqqu and others, central and noncentral limit theorems for $Y_t$
have been constantly refined, extended and applied to an increasing number of
diverse situations, to such an extent that it has become a field of research in
its own right.
  The common belief, representing the intuition that specialists in the subject
have developed over the last four decades, is that as $t\to\infty$ the
fluctuations of $Y_t$ around its mean are, in general (i.e. except possibly in
very special cases), Gaussian when $B$ has short memory, and non Gaussian when
$B$ has long memory and $R\geq 2$.
  We show in this paper that this intuition forged over the last forty years
can be wrong, and not only marginally or in critical cases. We will indeed
bring to light a variety of situations where $ Y_t $ admits Gaussian
fluctuations in a long memory context.
  To achieve this goal, we state and prove a spectral central limit theorem,
which extends the conclusion of the celebrated Breuer-Major theorem to
situations where $C\not\in L^R(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Our main mathematical tools are
the Malliavin-Stein method and Fourier analysis techniques.

sufficient mass via gas accretion overcoming radiative feedback. We investigate
protostellar growth in dynamically heated atomic-cooling haloes (ACHs) found in
recent cosmological simulations, performing three-dimensional radiation

mass reaches $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^4~{\rm M_\odot}$ unimpeded by radiative
feedback. In the other ACH, where the mass supply rate is lower, the star
spends most of its life as a hot main-sequence star, emitting intense ionizing
radiation. Then, the stellar mass growth is terminated around $500~{\rm
M_\odot}$ by photoevaporation of the circumstellar disk. A series of our RHD
simulations provide a formula of the final stellar mass determined either by
stellar feedback or their lifetime as a function of the mass supply rate from
the parent cloud in the absence of stellar radiation. Combining the results
with the statistical properties of SMS-forming clouds in high-redshift quasar
progenitor haloes, we construct a top-heavy mass distribution of primordial

tensor product of vector spaces. Here, we relax this tensorial property and
develop a framework for describing and analysing integrable models based on

Here, we propose a teleportation protocol to teleport an unknown qubit through
the amplitude damping channels with a fidelity up to one with a single copy of
the entangled state. Our proposed teleportation protocol, while illustrated
using the Bell and W entangled states as examples, can be utilized with any
type of entangled states. In our protocol we employ environment-assisted
measurement during the entanglement distribution, and further modify the
original teleportation protocol by applying weak measurement in the last step
of teleportation. We find a balance between teleportation fidelity and success
probability by varying the strength of the weak measurement. Furthermore, we
investigate the protection of controlled teleportation protocols, where all the
qubits of the entangled state pass through the amplitude damping channel. In
particular, for the controlled teleportation with the W state, the decoherence
of the shared entanglement can be totally suppressed by using EAM, hence no
weak measurement is required to achieve an average teleportation fidelity of
unity. The numerical simulation results reveal that our proposed teleportation
protocol outperforms both the weak measurement based probabilistic

the last problem of the trilemma was not solved, i.e., their training/sampling

environment, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new paradigm for
designing future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we consider
optical IRS for improving the performance of visible light communication (VLC)
under a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) setting. Specifically, we
focus on the downlink communication of an indoor MIMO VLC system and aim to
minimize the mean square error (MSE) of demodulated signals at the receiver. To
this end, the MIMO channel gain of the IRS-aided VLC is first derived under the
point source assumption, based on which the MSE minimization problem is then
formulated subject to the emission power constraints. Next, we propose an
alternating optimization algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into
three subproblems, to iteratively optimize the IRS configuration, the precoding
and detection matrices for minimizing the MSE. Moreover, theoretical analysis
on the performance of the proposed algorithm in high and low signal-to-noise
rate (SNR) regimes is provided, revealing that the joint optimization process
can be simplified in such special cases, and the algorithm's convergence
property and computational complexity are also discussed. Finally, numerical
results show that IRS-aided schemes significantly reduce the MSE as compared to
their counterparts without IRS, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other
baseline schemes.

information-driven services in smart cities. On the one hand, Internet of
Things (IoT) sensors can be deployed at certain fixed locations to capture data
reliably but suffer from limited sensing coverage. On the other hand, data can
also be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary
users but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users'
contributions. In this paper, we explore an integrated paradigm called ""hybrid
sensing"" that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary
manner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not
covered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in
calibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that
can be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In
this paper, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user
privacy -- IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private
user data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a
privacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of
our system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available
parking spaces in outdoor parking lots. We implemented our hybrid sensing
system for smart parking and conducted extensive empirical evaluations.
Finally, our hybrid sensing system can be potentially applied to other
information-driven services in smart cities.

the important yet challenging single domain generalization problem, in which a

directly generalize to different unseen target domains. We present a novel
approach to address this problem in medical image segmentation, which extracts
and integrates the semantic shape prior information of segmentation that are
invariant across domains and can be well-captured even from single domain data
to facilitate segmentation under distribution shifts. Besides, a test-time
adaptation strategy with dual-consistency regularization is further devised to
promote dynamic incorporation of these shape priors under each unseen domain to
improve model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two medical image
segmentation tasks demonstrate the consistent improvements of our method across
various unseen domains, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in addressing domain generalization under the worst-case scenario.

  turbulent flows and scalar transport around obstacles",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In RANS simulations for turbulent scalar transport, it is common that using
an eddy-viscosity (EV) model to close the Reynolds stress yields reasonable
mean flow predictions but large errors in scalar transfer results regardless of
scalar flux model inadequacies. This failure mode of EV models is generally
related to the fact that the transport of momentum and scalar depends on
different Reynolds stress components. The present work addresses two common
issues relevant to such failures in turbulent scalar transport around
obstacles. The first issue is the general overprediction of scalar transfer
near the upwind surfaces, which is primarily attributed to the absence of
wall-blocking mechanism in conventional EV models. We accordingly propose a
Shear-Preserving-Wall-Blocking (SPWB) method to analytically correct the
overpredicted wall-normal stress under the realizability constraint. The second
issue is the general underprediction of scalar transfer in the downstream large
separation regions, which is essentially attributed to the presence of vortex
shedding invalidating the scaling ground in conventional EV models' dissipation
closures. We accordingly apply the recently proposed Double-Scale
Double-Linear-EV (DSDL) model to scalar transport predictions. Consequently, a
hybrid model SPWB-DSDL is developed. The model is then applied to two test
cases, of which the first features a bluff obstacle with an upstream
impingement flow and a downstream two-dimensional separation and the second a
streamlined obstacle with an upstream concave surface flow and a downstream
three-dimensional separation. In the two cases, the SPWB-DSDL model is capable
of simultaneously yielding reasonable results of mean flow field, turbulence
energy and stress, and scalar transfer in both upstream and downstream regions,
thus demonstrating significant improvement upon a classical EV model.

deploy a computationally efficient, yet accurate, finite deformation
rate-independent elastic-plastic material behavior (with inclusion of

based on (i) hypoelasticity, and ii) multiplicative plasticity, are programmed

steady-state rolling simulations. Moreover, the use of classical rigid-plastic

application has been limited by the relatively small size of EEG datasets. Data
augmentation, which consists in artificially increasing the size of the dataset

augmentation transformations for EEG data have been proposed in the literature,
their positive impact on performance is often evaluated on a single dataset and
compared to one or two competing augmentation methods. This work proposes to
better validate the existing data augmentation approaches through a unified and
exhaustive analysis. Approach: We compare quantitatively 13 different
augmentations with two different predictive tasks, datasets and models, using
three different types of experiments. Main results: We demonstrate that
employing the adequate data augmentations can bring up to 45% accuracy
improvements in low data regimes compared to the same model trained without any
augmentation. Our experiments also show that there is no single best
augmentation strategy, as the good augmentations differ on each task.
Significance: Our results highlight the best data augmentations to consider for
sleep stage classification and motor imagery brain-computer interfaces. More
broadly, it demonstrates that EEG classification tasks benefit from adequate

  reconstruction with adjustable speed of sound",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a high-resolution functional
imaging modality that can non-invasively access a broad range of
pathophysiological phenomena by quantifying the contrast of endogenous
chromophores in tissue. Real-time imaging is imperative to translate MSOT into
clinical imaging, visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes associated with
disease progression, and enable in situ diagnoses. Model-based reconstruction
affords state-of-the-art optoacoustic images; however, the image quality
provided by model-based reconstruction remains inaccessible during real-time
imaging because the algorithm is iterative and computationally demanding. Deep
learning affords faster reconstruction, but the lack of ground truth training
data can lead to reduced image quality for in vivo data. We introduce a
framework, termed DeepMB, that achieves accurate optoacoustic image
reconstruction for arbitrary input data in 31 ms per image by expressing
model-based reconstruction with a deep neural network. DeepMB facilitates
accurate generalization to experimental test data through training on signals
synthesized from real-world images and ground truth images generated by
model-based reconstruction. The framework affords in-focus images for a broad
range of anatomical locations because it supports dynamic adjustment of the
reconstruction speed of sound during imaging. Furthermore, DeepMB is compatible
with the data rates and image sizes of modern multispectral optoacoustic
tomography scanners. We evaluate DeepMB on a diverse dataset of in vivo images
and demonstrate that the framework reconstructs images 1000 times faster than
the iterative model-based reference method while affording near-identical image
qualities. Accurate and real-time image reconstructions with DeepMB can enable
full access to the high-resolution and multispectral contrast of handheld
optoacoustic tomography.

the training set size, model size, or both, have driven substantial performance
improvements in deep learning. However, these improvements through scaling
alone require considerable costs in compute and energy. Here we focus on the
scaling of error with dataset size and show how in theory we can break beyond
power law scaling and potentially even reduce it to exponential scaling instead
if we have access to a high-quality data pruning metric that ranks the order in
which training examples should be discarded to achieve any pruned dataset size.
We then test this improved scaling prediction with pruned dataset size
empirically, and indeed observe better than power law scaling in practice on
ResNets trained on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet. Next, given the importance of
finding high-quality pruning metrics, we perform the first large-scale
benchmarking study of ten different data pruning metrics on ImageNet. We find
most existing high performing metrics scale poorly to ImageNet, while the best
are computationally intensive and require labels for every image. We therefore
developed a new simple, cheap and scalable self-supervised pruning metric that
demonstrates comparable performance to the best supervised metrics. Overall,
our work suggests that the discovery of good data-pruning metrics may provide a
viable path forward to substantially improved neural scaling laws, thereby
reducing the resource costs of modern deep learning.

sky and observing the extragalactic Universe with unprecedented spatial
resolution in the optical domain ($\sim$ 180 mas by the end of the mission).
Gaia provides an opportunity to study the morphology of the galaxies of the
local Universe (z<0.45) with much higher resolution than has ever been attained
from the ground. It also allows us to provide the first morphological all-sky

detected a host galaxy around 64\,498 of them ($\sim$6\%). We publish the

state to another, are important in a wide range of engineering applications. A
popular scenario is morphing from an initial two-dimensional (2D) shape that is
flat to a three-dimensional (3D) target shape. One of the exciting
manufacturing paradigms is transforming flat 2D sheets with prescribed cuts
(i.e. kirigami) into 3D structures. By employing the formalism of the 'tapered
elastica' equation, we develop an inverse design framework to predict the shape
of the 2D cut pattern that would generate a desired axisymmetric 3D shape. Our
previous work has shown that tessellated 3D structures can be achieved by
designing both the width and thickness of the cut 2D sheet to have particular
tapered designs. However, the fabrication of a sample with variable thickness
is quite challenging. Here we propose a new strategy -- perforating the cut
sheet with tapered width but uniform thickness to introduce a distribution of
porosity. We refer to this strategy as perforated kirigami and show how the
porosity function can be calculated from our theoretical model. The porosity
distribution can easily be realized by laser cutting and modifies the bending
stiffness of the sheet to yield a desired elastic deformation upon buckling. To
verify our theoretical approach, we conduct finite element simulations and
physical experiments. We also examine the loading-bearing capacity of morphed
structures via indentation tests in both FEM simulations and experiments. As an
example, the relationship between the measured geometric rigidity of morphed
half-ellipsoids and their aspect ratio is investigated in details.

that optimizes its structure to respond to mechanical stimuli, which also
govern growth and remodeling processes. However, a full understanding of the
underlying mechanisms responsible for the cooperation of bone toughness and
biological functions, with important implications in bone ageing, osteoporosis
and tissue repair, has yet to be achieved. In particular, how micro-damage
nucleation, needed for tissue remodeling, does not evolve into catastrophic
failure in such a stiff material, still remains a partial enigma, cement lines,
interfaces and sacrificial elements alone not providing a definitive answer to
the question. Here, we bring to light a novel stress-based bone toughening
mechanism, calling into play the nearly-symmetrical, chiral and hierarchical
architecture of the osteons, demonstrating that their arrangement
simultaneously gives rise to stress states alternating in sign along the osteon
radius and to localized stress amplifications, both in the tensile and
compressive regimes. This unveils a previously unforeseen synergistic mechanism
allowing micro-damage accumulation without propagating cracks, kindled by the
contrast between crack-opening due to tensile hoop stresses and crack-stopping
due to compressive stresses at the crack tips in adjacent lamellae, which seal
the crack ends conferring toughness to bone well beyond that predicted by
current models. Furthermore, shear stresses occur at the lamellar interfaces,
contributing with fluid flow to mechanically stimulate the osteocytes and to
amplify the bone signalling. These results, obtained through original exact
elastic solutions and confirmed by both FE fracture analyses and experimental
tests on 3D-printed osteon prototypes, contribute with another piece in the
puzzle to making the rational biophysical picture of bone mechanobiology
complete.

interstellar media (ISM) formed after the explosive death of massive stars.
Their morphology and emission properties depend both on the surrounding
circumstellar structure shaped by the stellar wind-ISM interaction of the
progenitor star and on the local conditions of the ambient medium. In the warm
phase of the Galactic plane (n = 1/cm3, T = 8000 K), an organised magnetic
field of strength 7 microG has profound consequences on the morphology of the
wind bubble of massive stars at rest. In this paper we show through 2.5D
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, in the context of a Wolf-Rayet-evolving 35
Mo star, that it affects the development of its supernova remnant. When the
supernova remnant reaches its middle age (15 to 20 kyr), it adopts a tubular
shape that results from the interaction between the isotropic supernova ejecta
and the anisotropic, magnetised, shocked stellar progenitor bubble into which
the supernova blast wave expands. Our calculations for non-thermal emission,
i.e. radio synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, reveal that such
supernova remnants can, due to projection effects, appear as rectangular
objects in certain cases. This mechanism for shaping a supernova remnant is
similar to the bipolar and elliptical planetary nebula production by wind-wind
interaction in the low-mass regime of stellar evolution. If such a rectangular
core-collapse supernova remnant is created, the progenitor star must not have
been a runaway star. We propose that such a mechanism is at work in the shaping
of the asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnant Puppis A.

in-distribution samples from out-distribution ones. To show the efficacy of our

epistemic state and its change. Asynchrony plays a key role in distributed
systems, in which the messages transmitted may not be received instantly by the
agents. To characterize asynchronous communications, asynchronous announcement
logic (AAL) has been presented, which focuses on the logic laws of the change
of epistemic state after receiving information.
  However AAL does not involve the interactive behaviours between an agent and
its environment. Through enriching the well-known pi-calculus by adding the
operators for passing basic facts and applying the well-known action model
logic to describe agents' epistemic states, this paper presents the e-calculus
to model epistemic interactions between agents with epistemic states. The
e-calculus can be adopted to characterize synchronous and asynchronous
communications between agents. To capture the asynchrony, a buffer pools is
constructed to store the basic facts announced and each agent reads these facts
from this buffer pool in some order. Based on the transmission of link names,
the e-calculus is able to realize reading from this buffer pool in different
orders. This paper gives two examples: one is to read in the order in which the
announced basic facts are sent (First-in-first-out, FIFO), and the other is in
an arbitrary order.

forward some challenges for teams. One of the most relevant challenges is
coordinating the decisions of team members who work from different time zones.
Intuition suggests that task performance should improve if the team members'
decisions are coordinated. However, previous research suggests that the effect
of coordination on task performance is ambiguous. Specifically, the effect of
coordination on task performance depends on aspects such as the team members'
learning and the changes in team composition over time. This paper aims to
understand how individual learning and team composition moderate the
relationship between coordination and task performance. We implement an
agent-based modeling approach based on the NK-framework to fulfill our research
objective. Our results suggest that both factors have moderating effects.
Specifically, we find that excessively increasing individual learning is
harmful for the task performance of fully autonomous teams, but less
detrimental for teams that coordinate their decisions. In addition, we find
that teams that coordinate their decisions benefit from changing their
composition in the short-term, but fully autonomous teams do not. In
conclusion, teams that coordinate their decisions benefit more from individual
learning and dynamic composition than teams that do not coordinate.
Nevertheless, we should note that the existence of moderating effects does not
imply that coordination improves task performance. Whether coordination
improves task performance depends on the interdependencies between the team
members' decisions.

  - In monadically stable classes the Ramsey numbers $R(s,t)$ are bounded from
above by $\mathcal{O}(t^{s-1-\delta})$ for some $\delta>0$, improving the bound
$R(s,t)\in \mathcal{O}(t^{s-1}/(\log t)^{s-1})$ known for general graphs and
the bounds known for $k$-stable graphs when $s\leq k$.
  - For every monadically stable class $\mathcal{C}$ and every integer $r$,
there exists $\delta > 0$ such that every graph $G \in \mathcal{C}$ that
contains an $r$-subdivision of the biclique $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph also
contains $K_{t^\delta,t^\delta}$ as a subgraph. This generalizes earlier
results for nowhere dense graph classes.
  - We obtain a stronger regularity lemma for monadically stable classes of

  - Finally, we show that we can compute polynomial kernels for the independent

only fixed-parameter tractable algorithms were known for these problems on

the grid. Binary variables with nonlinear AC network constraints make this
problem NP-hard. For large real-world networks, obtaining an AC feasible
optimum solution for these problems is computationally challenging and often
unattainable with state-of-the-art tools today. In this work, we map the MINLP
decision problem into a set of equivalent circuits by representing binary
variables with a circuit-based continuous switch model. We characterize the
continuous switch model by a controlled nonlinear impedance that more closely
mimics the physical behavior of a real-world switch. This mapping effectively
transforms the MINLP problem into an NLP problem. We mathematically show that
this transformation is a tight relaxation of the MINLP problem. For fast and
robust convergence, we develop physics-driven homotopy and Newton-Raphson
damping methods. To validate this approach, we empirically show robust
convergences for large, realistic systems ($>$ 70,000 buses) in a practical
wall-clock time to an AC-feasible optimum. We compare our results and show
improvement over industry-standard tools and other binary relaxation methods.

millimetre interferometry within the inner ~20pc of the active galaxy NGC1068
at comparable scales and sensitivity to single dish observations of the
Circumnuclear Disk (CND) in the Galactic Center. To interpret observations of
these regions and determine the physical properties of their gas distribution,
we present a modelling effort that includes (i) a simple dynamical simulations
involving partially inelastic collisions between disk gas clouds, (ii) an
analytical model of a turbulent clumpy gas disk calibrated by the dynamical
model and observations, (iii) local turbulent and cosmic ray gas heating and
cooling via H2O, H2, and CO emission, and (iv) determination of the molecular
abundances. We also consider photodissociation regions (PDR) where gas is
directly illuminated by the central engine. We compare the resulting model
datacubes of the CO, HCN, HCO+, and CS brightness temperatures to available
observations. In both cases the kinematics can be explained by one or two
clouds colliding with a pre-existing ring, in a prograde sense for the CND and
retrograde for NGC1068. And, with only dense disk clouds, the line fluxes can
be reproduced to within a factor of about two. To avoid self-absorption of the
intercloud medium, turbulent heating at the largest scales, comparable to the
disk height, has to be decreased by a factor of 50-200. Our models indicate
that turbulent mechanical energy input is the dominant gas heating mechanism
within the thick gas disks. In N1068, while the bulk of the AGN X-ray radiation
is absorbed in a layer of Compton-thick gas inside the dust sublimation radius,
the optical/UV radiation may enhance the molecular line emission from
photodissociation regions by ~50% at the inner edge of the gas ring.

are frequently observed by radio telescopes (and in other frequencies), where
the glitch is observed as irregular arrival times of pulses which are otherwise
very regular. A glitch in an isolated neutron star can excite the fundamental
(f)-mode oscillations which can lead to gravitational wave generation.
Electromagnetic observations of pulsars (and hence pulsar glitches) require the
pulsar to be oriented so that the jet is pointed toward the detector, but this
is not a requirement for gravitational wave emission which is more isotropic
and not jetlike. Hence, gravitational wave observations have the potential to
uncover nearby neutron stars where the jet is not pointed towards the Earth. In
this work, we study the prospects of finding glitching neutron stars using a
generic all-sky search for short-duration gravitational wave transients. The
analysis covers the high-frequency range from $1-4$ kHz of LIGO-Virgo detectors
for signals up to a few seconds. We set upper limits for the third observing
run of the LIGO-Virgo detectors and present the prospects for upcoming
observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO India. We find the detectable
glitch size will be around $10^{-5}$ Hz for the fifth observing run for pulsars
with spin frequencies and distances comparable to the Vela pulsar. We also
present the prospects of localizing the direction in the sky of these sources
with gravitational waves alone, which can facilitate electromagnetic follow-up.
We find that for the five detector configuration, the localization capability
for a glitch size of $10^{-5}$ Hz is around $132\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ at
$1\sigma$ confidence for $50\%$ of events with distance and spin frequency as
that of Vela.

some basic properties of the maximal hull dimension are studied. We prove that

Plot, Gramian Angular Field, Markov Transition Field. The likelihood of the
occurrence of a seizure in a future predefined time window is computed by
averaging the output of the softmax layer of a CNN, differently from the usual
consideration of the output of the classification layer. By thresholding this
likelihood, seizure forecasting has better performance. Interestingly, for
almost every patient, the best threshold was different from 50%. The results
show that this technique can predict with good results for some seizures and
patients. However, more tests, namely more patients and more seizures, are
needed to better understand the real potential of this technique.

pattern-recognition logic essential to the reconstruction of particle
interactions in liquid argon time projection chamber detectors. Pandora is the
primary event reconstruction software used at ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype for the
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment far detector. ProtoDUNE-SP, located at
CERN, is exposed to a charged-particle test beam. This paper gives an overview
of the Pandora reconstruction algorithms and how they have been tailored for
use at ProtoDUNE-SP. In complex events with numerous cosmic-ray and beam
background particles, the simulated reconstruction and identification
efficiency for triggered test-beam particles is above 80% for the majority of
particle type and beam momentum combinations. Specifically, simulated 1 GeV/$c$
charged pions and protons are correctly reconstructed and identified with
efficiencies of 86.1$\pm0.6$% and 84.1$\pm0.6$%, respectively. The efficiencies
measured for test-beam data are shown to be within 5% of those predicted by the
simulation.

solution vanishes, the 5d effective action reconstructed from the equations of
motion using $M^5 \times S^5$ compactification ansatz is proportional to the
AdS$_5$ volume. The latter is consistent with the conformal anomaly
interpretation in AdS/CFT context. We show that this paradox can be resolved
if, in the case of $M^5 \times X^5$ topology, the 10d action contains an
additional 5-form dependent ""topological"" term $\int F_{5M} \wedge F_{5X}$. The
presence of this term is suggested also by gauge-invariance considerations in
the PST formulation of type IIB supergravity action. We show that this term

  Case-based Reasoning","27 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Case-based Reasoning (CBR) on high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is a
trending yet challenging and computationally expensive task in the real world.
A promising approach is to obtain low-dimensional hash codes representing cases
and perform a similarity retrieval of cases in Hamming space. However, previous
methods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual
construction, inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g.,
high-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data
characteristics. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel deep
hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient
case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR.
Specifically, we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous
features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings,
which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality
and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then, we feed the case
embeddings into fully-connected layers, and subsequently a hash layer generates
hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss
during relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR, we further propose
an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive
experiments on public datasets show that HeCBR greatly reduces storage and
significantly accelerates case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance
compared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly
better than hashing-based CBR methods in classification.

expected to be extended to the computing domain in 6G. In order to provide this
holistic approach of ubiquity in communication and computation, an integration
of satellite, aerial and terrestrial networks is foreseen. In particular, the
rising amount of applications such as In-Flight Entertainment and Connectivity
Services (IFECS) and SDN-enabled satellites renders network management more
challenging. Moreover, due to the stringent Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements edge computing gains in importance for these applications. Here,
network performance can be boosted by considering components of the aerial
network, like aircrafts, as potential Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) nodes.
Thus, we propose an Aerial-Aided Multi-Access Edge Computing (AA-MEC)
architecture that provides a framework for optimal management of computing
resources and internet-based services in the sky. Furthermore, we formulate
optimization problems to minimize the network latency for the two use cases of
providing IFECS to other aircrafts in the sky and providing services for
offloading AI/ML-tasks from satellites. Due to the dynamic nature of the
satellite and aerial networks, we propose a re-configurable optimization. For
the transforming network we continuously identify the optimal MEC node for each
application and the optimal path to the destination MEC node. In summary, our
results demonstrate that using AA-MEC improves network latency performance by
10.43% compared to the traditional approach of using only terrestrial MEC nodes
for latency-critical applications such as online gaming. Furthermore, while
comparing our proposed dynamic approach with a static one, we record a benefit
of at least 6.7% decrease in flow latency for IFECS and 56.03% decrease for

shapes into a common reference by estimating transformations. GPA has been
extensively studied for the Euclidean and affine transformations. We introduce
GPA with deformable transformations, which forms a much wider and difficult
problem. We specifically study a class of transformations called the Linear
Basis Warps (LBWs), which contains the affine transformation and most of the
usual deformation models, such as the Thin-Plate Spline (TPS). GPA with
deformations is a nonconvex underconstrained problem. We resolve the
fundamental ambiguities of deformable GPA using two shape constraints requiring
the eigenvalues of the shape covariance. These eigenvalues can be computed
independently as a prior or posterior. We give a closed-form and optimal
solution to deformable GPA based on an eigenvalue decomposition. This solution
handles regularization, favoring smooth deformation fields. It requires the
transformation model to satisfy a fundamental property of free-translations,
which asserts that the model can implement any translation. We show that this
property fortunately holds true for most common transformation models,
including the affine and TPS models. For the other models, we give another
closed-form solution to GPA, which agrees exactly with the first solution for
models with free-translation. We give pseudo-code for computing our solution,
leading to the proposed DefGPA method, which is fast, globally optimal and
widely applicable. We validate our method and compare it to previous work on
six diverse 2D and 3D datasets, with special care taken to choose the

generation. Although the introduction of deep visual processing models have
contributed in extending this ability, existing methods lack in the ability to
actively modify what to perceive; humans perform internally during visual
cognitive processes. This paper addresses the issue by proposing a novel robot
motion generation model, inspired by a human cognitive structure. The model
incorporates a state-driven active top-down visual attention module, which
acquires attentions that can actively change targets based on task states. We
term such attentions as role-based attentions, since the acquired attention
directed to targets that shared a coherent role throughout the motion. The
model was trained on a robot tool-use task, in which the role-based attentions
perceived the robot grippers and tool as identical end-effectors, during object
picking and object dragging motions respectively. This is analogous to a
biological phenomenon called tool-body assimilation, in which one regards a
handled tool as an extension of one's body. The results suggested an
improvement of flexibility in model's visual perception, which sustained stable
attention and motion even if it was provided with untrained tools or exposed to
experimenter's distractions.

Specifically, we propose two criteria on judging such sufficiency.
Theoretically and empirically, we show that existing methods can violate both

Motivated by this, we design a new group invariant learning method, which
constructs groups with statistical independence tests, and reweights samples by

multi-hop routing structure with the communication link selection for a given

appears that the formulated problem belongs to a class of nonconvex and integer

different clinical centres. This rapid and generalisable learning ability is
mostly due to the compositional structure of image patterns in the human brain,
which is less incorporated in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we
model the compositional components (i.e. patterns) of human anatomy as
learnable von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels, which are robust to images collected
from different domains (e.g. clinical centres). The image features can be
decomposed to (or composed by) the components with the composing operations,
i.e. the vMF likelihoods. The vMF likelihoods tell how likely each anatomical
part is at each position of the image. Hence, the segmentation mask can be
predicted based on the vMF likelihoods. Moreover, with a reconstruction module,
unlabeled data can also be used to learn the vMF kernels and likelihoods by
recombining them to reconstruct the input image. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed vMFNet achieves improved generalisation performance on two

is discussed for the existence of phase transition between the stable states of
interacting system. Thereby analyzing the von Neumann entanglement entropy and
degree of condensation provide the information about quantum phase correlation

we further probe the internal structure of quantum mechanically stable and
unstable states. Much emphasis is put on finding the spatial correlation of
bosonic atoms in the rotating system for the formation and entry of singly
quantized vortices, and then organizing into canonical polygons with and
without a central vortex at the trap center. Results are summarized in the form

Planck satellite has been discovered and analyzed toward several nearby edge-on
spiral galaxies. It provides a way to probe galactic halo rotation, and to
constrain the baryon fraction in the galactic halos. The frequency independence
of the observed data provides a strong indication of the Doppler shift nature
of the effect, due to the galactic halo rotation. It was proposed that this
effect may arise from the emission of cold gas clouds populating the galactic
halos. However, in order to confirm this view, other effects that might give
rise to a temperature asymmetry in the CMB data, have to be considered and
studied in detail. The main aim of the present paper is to estimate the
contribution in the CMB temperature asymmetry data due to the free-free
emission by hot gas (particularly electrons) through the rotational kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (rkSZ) effect. We concentrate, in particular, on the M31
galactic halo and compare the estimated values of the rkSZ induced temperature
asymmetry with those obtained by using the SMICA pipeline of the Planck data
release, already employed to project out the SZ sources and for lensing
studies. As an additional consistency check, we also verified that the hot gas
diffuse emission in the X-ray band does not exceed that detected in the soft
X-ray band by ROSAT observations. We note that our results clearly show that
the rkSZ effect gives only a minor contribution to the observed M31 halo
temperature asymmetry by Planck data.

scenarios. We present an extensive analysis on the security aspects of the
underlying sensors and networks deployed in such environments, a novel
user-centred privacy framework for analysing ubiquitous computing systems, and
a complete analysis on the security and privacy challenges that need to be
faced to implement cognitive cities properly. Second, we contribute to process
mining, a popular analytical field that helps analyse business processes within
organisations. Despite its popularity within the healthcare industry, we
address two major issues: the high complexity of healthcare processes and the
scarce research on privacy aspects. Regarding the first issue, we present a
novel process discovery algorithm with a built-in heuristic that simplifies
complex processes and, regarding the second, we propose two novel
privacy-preserving process mining methods, which achieve a remarkable trade-off
between accuracy and privacy. Last but not least, we present some smart health
applications, namely a context-aware recommender system for routes, a platform
supporting early mobilization programmes in hospital settings, and a
health-oriented geographic information system. The results of this dissertation
are intended to help the research community to enhance the security of the
intelligent environments of the future as well as the privacy of the citizens
regarding their personal and health data.

(LSEs) for code-switching speech recognition. Because LSEs are initialized by
two pre-trained language-specific models (LSMs), the dual-encoder structure can
exploit sufficient monolingual data and capture the individual language
attributes. However, most existing methods have no language constraints on LSEs
and underutilize language-specific knowledge of LSMs. In this paper, we propose
a language-specific characteristic assistance (LSCA) method to mitigate the
above problems. Specifically, during training, we introduce two
language-specific losses as language constraints and generate corresponding
language-specific targets for them. During decoding, we take the decoding
abilities of LSMs into account by combining the output probabilities of two
LSMs and the mixture model to obtain the final predictions. Experiments show
that either the training or decoding method of LSCA can improve the model's
performance. Furthermore, the best result can obtain up to 15.4% relative error
reduction on the code-switching test set by combining the training and decoding
methods of LSCA. Moreover, the system can process code-switching speech
recognition tasks well without extra shared parameters or even retraining based
on two pre-trained LSMs by using our method.

band-insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have
attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport has been thoroughly
explored and fundamental aspects of conduction firmly established. Perhaps
surprisingly, similar insights into conceptually much simpler conducting
homointerfaces, such as the domain walls that separate regions of different
orientations of electrical polarisation within the same ferroelectric
band-insulator, are not nearly so well-developed. Addressing this disparity, we
herein report magnetoresistance in approximately conical 180o charged domain
walls, which occur in partially switched ferroelectric thin film single crystal
lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: firstly, the
conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is extremely and
unusually large (a factor of at least 1013) and hence currents driven through
the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly
channelled along the walls; secondly, when electrical contact is made to the
top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their
cone axes (perpendicular to the thin film surface), then the test geometry
mirrors that of a Corbino disc, which is a textbook arrangement for geometric
magnetoresistance measurement. Our data imply carriers at the domain walls with
extremely high room temperature Hall mobilities of up to ~ 3,700cm2V-1s-1. This
is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is
most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic,
rather than at room, temperature.

transverse to the current. In particular, the non-collinear alignment of the
field and current can be exploited to increase the switching efficiency and
reliability compared to the standard collinear alignment. By probing individual

extrapolate the results to materials with different torque ratios. Finally, we
propose device geometries that leverage the fieldlike torque for density

of atmospheric surface-layer turbulence. Based on the hypothesis that a single
length scale determined by surface fluxes governs the turbulent exchange of
momentum, mass, and energy between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, MOST
has been widely used in parametrizations of turbulent processes in virtually
all numerical models of atmospheric flows. However, its inherent limitations to
flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain, the non-scaling of horizontal
velocity variances, and stable turbulence have plagued the theory since its
inception. Thus, the limitations of MOST, and its use beyond its intended range
of validity contribute to large uncertainty in weather, climate, and
air-pollution models, particularly in polar regions and over complex terrain.
Here we present a first generalized extension of MOST encompassing a wide range
of realistic surface and flow conditions. The novel theory incorporates
information on the directionality of turbulence exchange (anisotropy of the
Reynolds stress tensor) as a key missing variable. The constants in the
standard empirical MOST relations are shown to be functions of anisotropy, thus
allowing a seamless transition between traditional MOST and its novel
generalization. The new scaling relations, based on measurements from 13
well-known datasets ranging from flat to highly complex mountainous terrain,
show substantial improvements to scaling under all stratifications. The results
also highlight the role of anisotropy in explaining general characteristics of
complex terrain and stable turbulence, adding to the mounting evidence that
anisotropy fully encodes the information on the complexity of the boundary
conditions.

(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) features. Consistency refers to
the correctness of databases and is a crucial property for many applications,
such as financial and banking services. However, there exist typical challenges
for consistency. Theoretically, the current two definitions of consistency
express quite different meanings, which are causal and sometimes controversial.
Practically, it is notorious to check the consistency of databases, especially
in terms of the verification cost. This paper proposes Coo, a framework to
check the consistency of databases. Specifically, Coo has the following
advancements. First, Coo proposes partial order pair (POP) graph, which has a
better expressiveness on transaction conflicts in a schedule by considering
stateful information like Commit and Abort. By POP graph with no cycle, Coo
defines consistency completely. Secondly, Coo can construct inconsistent test
cases based on POP cycles. These test cases can be used to check the
consistency of databases in accurate (all types of anomalies), user-friendly
(SQL-based test), and cost-effective (one-time checking in a few minutes) ways.
We evaluate Coo with eleven databases, both centralized and distributed, under
all supported isolation levels. The evaluation shows that databases did not
completely follow the ANSI SQL standard (e.g., Oracle claimed to be
serializable but appeared in some inconsistent cases), and have different
implementation methods and behaviors for concurrent controls (e.g., PostgreSQL,
MySQL, and SQL Server performed quite differently at Repeatable Read level).
Coo aids to comprehend the gap between coarse levels, finding more detailed and
complete inconsistent behaviors.

(or more) the top drive nominal angular speed. In addition, uncertainties
should be taken into account when calibrating (identifying) the bit-rock
interaction parameters. This paper proposes a procedure to estimate the
parameters of four bit-rock interaction models, one of which is new, and at the
same time select the most suitable model, given the available field data. The
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is used for this purpose. An approximate
posterior probability density function is obtained for the parameters of each
model, which allows uncertainty to be analyzed. Furthermore, the impact of the
uncertainties of the selected models on the torsional stability map (varying
the nominal top drive angular speed and the weight on bit) of the system is
evaluated.

through their time-varying tidal potential. Magnetostrophic oscillations with a
frequency much smaller than the stellar rotation frequency have recently been
proposed to account for the spin-orbit commensurability observed in several
planet-hosting stars. In principle, they can be resonantly excited in an
isolated slender magnetic flux tube by a Fourier component of the time-varying
tidal potential with a very low frequency in the reference frame rotating with
the host. However, due to the weakness of such high-order tidal components, a
mechanism is required to lock the oscillations in phase with the forcing for
long time intervals ($10^{3}-10^{7}$ years) in order to allow the oscillation
amplitude to grow. We propose that the locking mechanism is an autoresonance
produced by the non-linear dependence of the oscillation frequency on its
amplitude. We suggest that the angular momentum loss rate is remarkably reduced
in hosts entering autoresonance that contributes to maintain those systems in
that regime for a long time. We apply our model to a sample of ten systems
showing spin-orbit commensurability and estimate the maximum drifts of the
relevant tidal potential frequencies that allow them to enter the autoresonant
regime. Such drifts are compared with the expected drifts owing to the tidal
evolution of the planetary orbits and the stellar angular momentum loss in the
magnetized winds finding that autoresonance is a viable mechanism in eight
systems, at least in our idealized model. The duration of the autoresonant
regime and the associated spin-orbit commensurability may be comparable with
the main-sequence lifetimes of the host stars, indicating that gyrochronology
may not be applicable to those hosts.

  Rates of Reporting of Violence Against Children",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Ongoing school closures and gradual reopenings have been occurring since the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. One substantial cost of school closure is
breakdown in channels of reporting of violence against children, in which
schools play a considerable role. There is, however, little evidence
documenting how widespread such a breakdown in reporting of violence against
children has been, and scant evidence exists about potential recovery in
reporting as schools re-open. We study all formal criminal reports of violence
against children occurring in Chile up to December 2021, covering physical,
psychological, and sexual violence. This is combined with administrative
records of school re-opening, attendance, and epidemiological and public health
measures. We observe sharp declines in violence reporting at the moment of
school closure across all classes of violence studied. Estimated reporting
declines range from -17% (rape), to -43% (sexual abuse). While reports rise
with school re-opening, recovery of reporting rates is slow. Conservative
projections suggest that reporting gaps remained into the final quarter of
2021, nearly two years after initial school closures. Our estimates suggest
that school closure and incomplete re-opening resulted in around 2,800
`missing' reports of intra-family violence, 2,000 missing reports of sexual
assault, and 230 missing reports of rape against children, equivalent to
between 10-25 weeks of reporting in baseline periods. The immediate and longer
term impacts of school closures account for between 40-70% of `missing' reports
in the post-COVID period.

approximate the posterior distribution of tokens given the acoustic inputs.
Consequently, the E2E systems implicitly define a language model (LM) over the

models less straightforward than in conventional ASR systems. This makes it
difficult to dynamically adapt E2E ASR system to contextual profiles for better
recognizing special words such as named entities. In this work, we propose a

aforementioned technique to an E2E ASR system, which transcribes doctor and

first-principles calculations, we have discovered 17 new Ferrovalley materials
(rare-earth iodides RI$_2$, where R is a rare-earth element belonging to Sc, Y,
or La-Lu, and I is Iodine). The rare-earth iodides are layered and demonstrate
2H, 1T, or 1T$_d$ phase as the ground-state in bulk, analogous to transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The calculated exfoliation energy of monolayers
is comparable to that of graphene and TMDCs, suggesting possible experimental
synthesis. The monolayers in the 2H phase exhibit two-dimensional
ferromagnetism due to unpaired electrons in $d$ and $f$ orbitals. Throughout
the rare-earth series, $d$ bands show valley polarization at $K$ and $\bar{K}$
points in the Brillouin zone near the Fermi level. Due to strong magnetic
exchange interaction and spin-orbit coupling, large intrinsic valley
polarization in the range of 15-143 meV without external stimuli is observed,
which can be tuned and enhanced by applying a biaxial strain. These valleys can
selectively be probed and manipulated for information storage and processing,
potentially offering superior performance beyond conventional electronics and
spintronics. We further show that the 2H ferromagnetic phase of RI$_2$
monolayers possesses non-zero Berry curvature and exhibits the valley Hall
effect with considerable anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work will incite
exploratory synthesis of the predicted Ferrovalley materials and their
application in valleytronics and beyond.

Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Q}_{\infty}$, the cyclotomic
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, of the $p$-adic weight one cusp forms
$f$, obtained via the $p$-stabilization of weight one Eisenstein series, under
the assumption that a certain Eisenstein component of the $p$-ordinary
universal cuspidal Hecke algebra is Gorenstein. As an application, we compute
the Iwasawa invariants of ordinary modular forms of weight $k\geq 2$ with the
same residual Galois representations as the one of $f$, which in our setting,
is reducible and non-$p$-distinguished. Combining this with a result of Kato
\cite[Theorem~17.4.2]{kato04}, we prove the Iwasawa main conjecture for these
forms. Also, we give numerical examples that satisfy the Gorenstein hypothesis.
  The crucial point on the analytic counter part is that under the Gorenstein
hypothesis, we are able to define, following Greenberg--Vatsal, the $p$-adic
$L$-functions of $p$-adic weight one forms $f$ as an element in the
one-dimensional Iwasawa algebra by using Mazur--Kitagawa two-variable $p$-adic
$L$-function and then, to compute them explicitly via local explicit
reciprocity law. On the algebraic counter part, we compute the (strict) Selmer
groups of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}_{\infty}$ via the knowledge of the Galois
representations of $f$ studied in \cite{BDP}.

wavelength cooperatively emit light in a short burst, a phenomenon called
superradiance by R. Dicke in 1954. The burst is characterized by a maximum
intensity scaling with the square of the number of atoms $N$ and a temporal
width reduced by $N$ compared to the single atom spontaneous decay time. Both
effects are usually attributed to a synchronization of the electric dipole
moments of the atoms occurring during the process of light emission. Contrary
to this explanation, it was recently shown by use of a quantum path description
that the peak intensity results from the quantum correlations among the atoms
when occupying symmetric Dicke states. Here we investigate from this
perspective the temporal evolution of the ensemble, starting in the small
sample limit, i.e., when the atoms have mutual separations much smaller than
the transition wavelength $\lambda$ and pass down the ladder of symmetric Dicke
states. In addition, we explore the temporal evolution for the case of
non-interacting atoms with mutual separations much larger than $\lambda$. We
show that in this case a similar superradiant burst of the emitted radiation is
observed if the quantum correlations of the atoms are generated by conditional
photon measurements retaining the atomic ensemble within or close to the

thermal background) relevant for the observed background rate of
$10^{-4}$~s$^{-1}$ for the detection of photons with a wave length of 1064 nm,
we investigate the impact of natural radioactivity. Dedicated measurements
using gamma-emitters mounted outside the cryostat have been used to estimate
the sensitivity of the TES setup for ionizing radiation. We have found that
indeed an increased background can be observed in the presence of the
radioactive sources. After selecting events which populate our signal region
tuned for single photon detection at near-infrared, roughly 0.5% of the events
produced by gamma-rays appear indistinguishable from those due to single
photons with 1064~nm wave length. This ratio is consistent with that observed
for the residual background detected with the TES at a rate of
$10^{-4}$~s$^{-1}$. From this, we conclude that the bulk of the observed

which the dark matter haloes reflect the intricate web-like pattern of the
underlying dark matter distribution. With our systematic topological analysis
we correlate local information and halo properties with the multi-scale
geometrical environment of the cosmic web, delineated by elongated filamentary
bridges and sheetlike walls that connect compact clusters at the nodes and
define the boundaries of near-empty voids. We capture the multi-scale topology
traced by the discrete spatial halo distribution through filtering the distance
field of the corresponding Delaunay tessellation. The tessellation is naturally
adaptive to the local density, perfectly outlining the local geometry. The
resulting nested alpha shapes contain the complete information on the
multi-scale topology. Normalising second-order clustering, we find a remarkable
linear relationship between halo masses and topology: haloes of different mass
trace environments with different topological signature. This is topological
bias, a bias independent of the halo clustering bias associated with the
two-point correlation function. Topological bias can be viewed as an
environmental structure bias. We quantify it through a linear relation
accounting for selection effects in the analysis and interpretation of the
spatial distribution of galaxies. This mass-dependent scaling relation allows
us to take clustering into account and determine the overall connectivity based
on a limited sample of galaxies. This is of particular relevance with large

Nyquist rate. It is also desired that the signals' dynamic range should be
within that of the ADC's; otherwise, the signal will be clipped. Nonlinear
operators such as modulo or companding can be used prior to sampling to avoid
clipping. To recover the true signal from the samples of the nonlinear
operator, either high sampling rates are required or strict constraints on the
nonlinear operations are imposed, both of which are not desirable in practice.
In this paper, we propose a generalized flexible nonlinear operator which is
sampling efficient. Moreover, by carefully choosing its parameters, clipping,
modulo, and companding can be seen as special cases of it. We show that
bandlimited signals are uniquely identified from the nonlinear samples of the

uncertainties were found to be dominant in the case of off-shell Higgs
production at next-to-leading order in QCD for large values of the Higgs
virtuality $m_H^*$. In this work, we study the uncertainties related to the
top-quark mass definition up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We
include the full top-quark mass dependence up to three loops in the virtual

obtaining the so-called soft-virtual (SV) approximation. We construct NNLO-SV
predictions for off-shell Higgs boson production renormalizing the top-quark
mass within both the on-shell (OS) and the MSbar schemes, and study in detail
the differences between them. While the differences between the two schemes are
sizeable, we find that the predictions are always compatible within scale
uncertainties. We also observe that the difference between renormalization
schemes is largely reduced when increasing the order of the perturbative
expansion. We analyze the quality of the convergence of the perturbative series

present much larger corrections than their OS counterparts. We also comment on

the extraction of the spectral functions from lattice QCD correlators. We will

localization accuracy, thus yields accurate and robust biometric measurements.
To validate our method, we assembled a dataset of 3,398 ultrasound images from
1,829 subjects acquired in three clinical sites with seven different ultrasound
devices. Comparison and cross-validation of three different biometric
measurements on two independent datasets shows that BiometryNet is robust and
yields accurate measurements whose errors are lower than the clinically
permissible errors, outperforming other existing automated biometry estimation
methods. Code is available at

When applying the axiomatic approach to evaluate and compare voting rules, we

profile) will be worst-case with respect to the desired criterion. In this
paper, we study the axiomatic approach slightly \emph{beyond} the worst-case:
we present and apply a ""smoothed"" model of the voting setting, which assumes
that while inputs (profiles) may be worst-case, all inputs will be perturbed by
a small amount of noise. In defining and analyzing our noise model, we do not
aim to substantially technically innovate on Lirong Xia's recently-proposed

simple proofs of smoothed-satisfaction or smoothed-violation of several axioms

investigate the effects of different chemical structures of the host
protoplanetary disc on the planetary composition. We consider both scenarios of
molecular (inheritance from the pre-stellar cloud) and atomic (complete
chemical reset) initial abundances in the disc. We focus on four elemental
tracers of different volatility: C, O, N, and S. We explore the entire
extension of possible formation regions suggested by observations by coupling
the disc chemical scenarios with N-body simulations of forming and migrating
giant planets. The planet formation process produces giant planets with
chemical compositions significantly deviating from that of the host disc. We
find that the C/N, N/O, and S/N ratios follow monotonic trends with the extent
of migration. The C/O ratio shows a more complex behaviour, dependent on the
planet accretion history and on the chemical structure of the formation
environment. The comparison between S/N* and C/N* (where * indicates
normalisation to the stellar value), constrains the relative contribution of
gas and solids to the total metallicity. Giant planets whose metallicity is
dominated by the contribution of the gas are characterised by N/O* > C/O* >

metallicity is instead dominated by the contribution of the solids we find that

measurements of the polarization of prompt J/$\psi$ mesons. While several
studies have addressed the $\psi$(2S) and $\chi_c$ impact on the determination
of the polarization of the directly-produced J/$\psi$ mesons, the theoretical
and experimental knowledge of the non-prompt polarization is very poor.
Furthermore, non-prompt J/$\psi$ polarization measurements can provide
interesting information on quarkonium hadroproduction, complementing the
studies of prompt production. We review the method of measuring the
polarization of non-prompt J/$\psi$ mesons (produced in decays of
unreconstructed B mesons and detected in the dilepton channel), in conditions
typical of LHC experiments studying J/$\psi$ production. Realistic
model-independent scenarios are validated with data from experiments studying
$e^+e^- \to \Upsilon$(4S) interactions, converted to the high-momentum regime
using B differential cross sections measured at the LHC. The non-prompt
J/$\psi$ polarization measurements are seen to remain dependent on the event
selection criteria, even after correcting for the dilepton acceptance and
efficiencies. This implies that reproducible definitions of all relevant
analysis choices must be reported with the polarization result, for rigorous
comparisons with other measurements and/or theoretical calculations. We also
discuss how the non-prompt J/$\psi$ polarization significantly depends on the
relative importance of two complementary $\mathrm{B}\to {\rm J}/\psi$ decay
topologies, two-body (reasonably dominated by singlet production) and
multi-body (including octet contributions), providing, hence, valuable
information for studies of the charmonium formation mechanisms.

a combination theorem for these spaces. More precisely, we prove that a space

the graded pieces are uniformly hyperbolic geodesic metric spaces, $(2)$
barycenter maps for the fibers are uniformly coarsely surjective, $(3)$ the
edge spaces are uniformly qi embedded in the corresponding fibers and $(4)$ a

of a uniform flaring for a space $\mathfrak{X}$, given by a surjective
$1$-Lipschitz map $p:\mathfrak{X}\ri\mathfrak{B}$, to be hyperbolic provided

the integer line. The direction of the steps is reversed at the time instants
of events in a discrete-time renewal process and is maintained at uneventful
time instants. This model represents a discrete-time semi-Markovian
generalization of the telegraph process. We derive exact formulae for the
propagator using generating functions. We prove that for geometrically
distributed waiting times in the diffusive limit, this walk converges to the
classical telegraph process. We consider the large-time asymptotics of the
expected position: For waiting time densities with finite mean the walker
remains in the average localized close to the departure site whereas escapes
for fat-tailed waiting-time densities (i.e. densities with infinite mean) by a
sublinear power-law. We explore anomalous diffusion features by accounting for
the `aging effect' as a hallmark of non-Markovianity where the discrete-time
version of the `aging renewal process' comes into play. By deriving pertinent
distributions of this process we obtain explicit formulae for the variance when
the waiting-times are Sibuya-distributed. In this case and generally for
fat-tailed waiting time PDFs a $t^2$-ballistic superdiffusive scaling emerges
in the large time limit. In contrast if the waiting time PDF between the step
reversals is light-tailed (`narrow' with finite mean and variance) the walk
exhibits normal diffusion and for `broad' waiting time PDFs (with finite mean
and infinite variance) superdiffusive large time scaling. We also consider
time-changed versions where the walk is subordinated to a continuous-time point
process such as the time-fractional Poisson process. This defines a new class
of biased continuous-time random walks exhibiting several regimes of anomalous

orbital eccentricities. We investigate the orbital eccentricities of 62 binary
black hole candidates from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue of
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration with an aligned-spin, moderate-eccentricity
waveform model. Within this framework, we find that at least four of these
events show significant support for eccentricity $e_{10} \geq 0.1$ at a
gravitational-wave frequency of $10$~Hz ($> 60\%$ credibility, under a
log-uniform eccentricity prior that spans the range $10^{-4} < e_{10} < 0.2$).
Two of these events are new additions to the population: GW191109 and
GW200208\_22. If the four eccentric candidates are truly eccentric, our results
suggest that densely-populated star clusters may produce 100\% of the observed
mergers. However, it remains likely that other formation environments with
higher yields of eccentric mergers -- for example, active galactic nuclei --
also contribute. We estimate that we will be able to confidently distinguish
which formation channel dominates the eccentric merger rate after $\gtrsim 80$
detections of events with $e_{10} \geq 0.05$ at LIGO--Virgo sensitivity, with
only $\sim 5$ detectably-eccentric events required to distinguish formation

tackling computationally challenging problems. A data reduction rule is a
polynomial-time algorithm that, given a problem instance as input, outputs an
equivalent, typically smaller instance of the same problem. The application of
data reduction rules during the preprocessing of problem instances allows in
many cases to considerably shrink their size, or even solve them directly.
Commonly, these data reduction rules are applied exhaustively and in some fixed
order to obtain irreducible instances. It was often observed that by changing
the order of the rules, different irreducible instances can be obtained. We
propose to ""undo"" data reduction rules on irreducible instances, by which they
become larger, and then subsequently apply data reduction rules again to shrink
them. We show that this somewhat counter-intuitive approach can lead to
significantly smaller irreducible instances. The process of undoing data
reduction rules is not limited to ""rolling back"" data reduction rules applied
to the instance during preprocessing. Instead, we formulate so-called backward
rules, which essentially undo a data reduction rule, but without using any
information about which data reduction rules were applied to it previously. In
particular, based on the example of Vertex Cover we propose two methods
applying backward rules to shrink the instances further. In our experiments we
show that this way smaller irreducible instances consisting of real-world
graphs from the SNAP and DIMACS datasets can be computed.

elastic deformation, Poisson effects, transverse-isotropic materials

values to these points, and ""convexifies"" the loss in some way to obtain a
surrogate. We establish a strong connection between this approach and
polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses: every discrete loss is
embedded by some polyhedral loss, and every polyhedral loss embeds some
discrete loss. Moreover, an embedding gives rise to a consistent link function
as well as linear surrogate regret bounds. Our results are constructive, as we
illustrate with several examples. In particular, our framework gives succinct
proofs of consistency or inconsistency for various polyhedral surrogates in the
literature, and for inconsistent surrogates, it further reveals the discrete
losses for which these surrogates are consistent. We go on to show additional
structure of embeddings, such as the equivalence of embedding and matching
Bayes risks, and the equivalence of various notions of non-redudancy. Using
these results, we establish that indirect elicitation, a necessary condition
for consistency, is also sufficient when working with polyhedral surrogates.

to the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime is due to the value of the
gravitational coupling which depends on the distance from the origin and
approaches its classical value in the far zone. However, at some stage this
approach has an arbitrariness of choice of some identification parameter. The
two cases of identification are considered here: first, by the modified proper
length (the Bonanno-Reuter metric), and second, by the Kretschmann scalar (the
metric for this case coincides, up to the redefinition of constants, with the
Hayward metric). Even though the quasinormal modes of these metrics have been
extensively studied, a number of interesting points were missed. We have found
that quasinormal modes are qualitatively similar for both types of
identification. The deviation of the fundamental mode from its Schwarzschild
limit may be a few times larger than it was claimed in the previous studies.
The striking deviation from the Schwarzschild limit occurs for overtones, being
as large as hundreds of percent even when the fundamental mode is almost
coinciding with the Schwarzschild one. This happens because the above metrics
are very close to the Schwarzschild one everywhere, except a small region near
the event horizon, which is crucial for overtones. The spectrum of both metrics
contains purely imaginary (non-oscillatory) modes, which, for some values of
parameters, can appear already at the second overtone.

harmonic trap, and a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of
motion. The steady state correlations and the mean square displacement are
studied when the particle is confined as well as when it is set free from the
trap. With the help of both numerical simulation and analytical calculations,
we observe that inertia plays a crucial role in the dynamics in the presence of
a magnetic field. In a highly viscous medium where the inertial effects are
negligible, the magnetic field has no influence on the correlated behaviour of
position as well as velocity. In the time asymptotic limit, the overall
displacement of the confined harmonic particle gets enhanced by the presence of
magnetic field and saturates for a stronger magnetic field. On the other hand,
when the particle is set free, the overall displacement gets suppressed and
approaches zero when strength of the field is very high. Interestingly, it is
seen that in the time asymptotic limit, the confined harmonic particle behaves
like a passive particle and becomes independent of the activity, especially in
the presence of a very strong magnetic field. Similarly, for a free particle
the mean square displacement in the long time limit becomes independent of
activity even for a longer persistence of noise correlation in the dynamics.

multiple semiconductor wafers without any additional material at the bonding
interface. In the context of particle pixel detectors this might provide an
alternative to bump-bonding for joining sensors to readout chips. Previous
investigations have shown that the amorphous layer formed at the interface
during bonding is detrimental to charge propagation. To investigate the
influence of the bonding interface on signal collection we have fabricated
custom test structures by bonding high-resistivity N to high-resistivity P-type
silicon wafers thus forming P-N junctions. Scanning transmission electron
microscopy shows indeed the formation of ca. 3nm wide amorphous layer at the
interface. Using a scanning transient current technique (TCT) setup we were
able to record generated signals. Illuminating our sample with light of
different wavelengths and from different sides, indicates that the P side of
the bonded structures can be fully depleted, but not the N side. This indicates
a strongly asymmetric depletion behaviour which we attribute to the presence of
the bonding interface.

aspects. However, the performance of existing medical image segmentation models
has been limited by the challenge of obtaining sufficient number of
high-quality data with the high cost of data annotation. To overcome the
limitation, we propose a new vision-language medical image segmentation model
LViT (Language meets Vision Transformer). In our model, medical text annotation
is introduced to compensate for the quality deficiency in image data. In
addition, the text information can guide the generation of pseudo labels to a
certain extent and further guarantee the quality of pseudo labels in
semi-supervised learning. We also propose the Exponential Pseudo label
Iteration mechanism (EPI) to help extend the semi-supervised version of LViT
and the Pixel-Level Attention Module (PLAM) to preserve local features of
images. In our model, LV (Language-Vision) loss is designed to supervise the
training of unlabeled images using text information directly. To validate the
performance of LViT, we construct multimodal medical segmentation datasets
(image + text) containing pathological images, X-rays,etc. Experimental results
show that our proposed LViT has better segmentation performance in both fully

automatically generate contrastive samples. Besides, Trial2Vec encodes trial

aggregating multi-aspect information from the whole document. We show that our
method yields medically interpretable embeddings by visualization and it gets a
15% average improvement over the best baselines on precision/recall for trial

For sufficiently large couplings, the trilinear interaction leads to an

GW background (SGWB) is generated throughout the process. We study the linear
and non-linear dynamics of preheating with lattice simulations, following the

with an increase in explanation utility. Finally, we propose a defense based on
a randomized response mechanism for releasing the explanations which

HI brightness temperature. Amongst them, the 4 parameters of interest are: the
cold dark matter density, $\omega_{\rm c}$, the Hubble parameter, $h$, the
primordial amplitude of the power spectrum, $A_{\rm s}$, and the linear HI
bias, $b_1$. For the best case scenario, we obtain unbiased constraints on all

faint jets remain well collimated and disappear in the intergalactic medium,
without any visible hotspot or radio lobes. The jets detected up to $\sim20$
kpc extent at higher frequencies are relatively bright within the optical
extent of the galaxy but become faint abruptly outside, where detection is made
only in the LOFAR image. The total radio luminosity of the galaxy at 144 MHz is
estimated to be $3.7(\pm0.4)\times10^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The 144 MHz radio
luminosity of the faint jets outside the optical extent is estimated to be
$7.1(\pm2.0)\times10^{21}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The extent of the jets for its radio
luminosity is abnormally large when compared to the general population of radio
galaxies. It makes NGC 5322 a member of a rare population of radio galaxies,
previously not detected in other radio surveys. A combined effect of stellar
core depletion and low-density environment around the jets, inferred from
previous studies in other wave-bands, resulting into weak entrainment of

that pictures are capable of reliably predicting the economic prosperity of

on, this novel approach makes use of only images posted on Dollar Street as
input data on household wealth across 66 countries and predicts the consumption
or income level of each household using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
method. The best result predicts the log of consumption level with root mean
squared error of 0.66 and R-squared of 0.80 in CNN regression problem. In
addition, this simple model also performs well in classifying extreme poverty
with an accuracy of 0.87 and F-beta score of 0.86. Since the model shows a
higher performance in the extreme poverty classification when I applied the
different threshold of poverty lines to countries by their income group, it is
suggested that the decision of the World Bank to define poverty lines
differently by income group was valid.

Indeed, there are applications such as Shazam app that provides music matching.
However, the limitations of those apps are that the same piece performed by the
same musician cannot be identified if it is not the same recording. Shazam
identifies the recording of it, not the music. This is because Shazam matches
the variation in volume, not the frequencies of the sound. This research
attempts to match music the way humans understand it: by the frequency spectrum
of music, not the volume variation. Essentially, the idea is to precompute the
frequency spectrums of all the music in the database, then take the unknown
piece and try to match its frequency spectrum against every segment of every
music in the database. I did it by matching the frequency spectrum of the
unknown piece to our database by sliding the window by 0.1 seconds and
calculating the error by taking Absolute value, normalizing the audio,
subtracting the normalized arrays, and taking the sum of absolute differences.
The segment that shows the least error is considered the candidate for the
match. The matching performance proved to be dependent on the complexity of the
music. Matching simple music, such as single note pieces, was successful.
However, more complex pieces, such as Chopins Ballade 4, were not successful,
that is, the algorithm could not produce low error values in any of the music
in the database. I suspect that it has to do with having too many notes:
mismatches in the higher harmonics added up to a significant amount of errors,
which swamps the calculations.

of the embedded vectors to historical failing test vectors. We also study an
alternative based on the diversity of test vectors. Finally, we propose a

conventional fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for dynamics iteration.
Compared with other integrators, our method is more stable in energy drift

a challenge to explore the full posterior, with traditional algorithms such as
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) being computationally inefficient due to
generating correlated samples and the performance of variational inference
being highly dependent on the choice of divergence (loss) function. Here we
develop a hybrid scheme, called variational self-boosted sampling (VBS) to
mitigate the drawbacks of both these algorithms by learning a variational
approximation for the proposal distribution of Monte Carlo sampling and combine
it with HMC. The variational distribution is parameterized as a normalizing
flow and learnt with samples generated on the fly, while proposals drawn from
it reduce auto-correlation length in MCMC chains. Our normalizing flow uses
Fourier space convolutions and element-wise operations to scale to high

generates better quality of samples than simple VI approaches and reduces the
correlation length in the sampling phase by a factor of 10-50 over using only
HMC to explore the posterior of initial conditions in 64$^3$ and 128$^3$

quasi-random polarization states and moving/bending a fiber without changing
power allows finding a polarimeter calibration where the degree-of-polarization
reaches unity and parasitic polarization-dependent loss is small. Using a
polarization scrambler/transformer and a polarimeter a device-under-test can be
characterized. Its Mueller matrix can be decomposed into a product of a
nondepolarizing Mueller-Jones matrix times a purely depolarizing Mueller
matrix. Test polarizations may drift over time. With help of an optical switch
the reference device can be measured against an internal reference path. Later,
with possibly different test polarizations, the actual device-under-test is
measured against the internal reference. Polarization drift and need for
repeated reference device measurement are thus overcome. When a patchcord is
inserted, connector PDL can be measured, provided that errors are calibrated
away, again by fiber moving/bending. Experimentally we have measured PDL with
errors <0.004 dB. This easily suffices to measure connector PDL, which is
demonstrated. PDL >60 dB was measured when the device under test was a good
polarizer. A 20 Mrad/s polarization scrambler with LiNbO3 device generates the
test polarizations. The polarimeter can sample at 100 MHz and can store 64M
Stokes vectors. During laser frequency scans Mueller matrices can be measured
in time intervals as short as 5 us.

  Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic community detection has been prospered as a powerful tool for
quantifying changes in dynamic brain network connectivity patterns by
identifying strongly connected sets of nodes. However, as the network science
problems and network data to be processed become gradually more sophisticated,
it awaits a better method to efficiently learn low dimensional representation
from dynamic network data and reveal its latent function that changes over time
in the brain network. In this work, an adversarial temporal graph
representation learning (ATGRL) framework is proposed to detect dynamic
communities from a small sample of brain network data. It adopts a novel
temporal graph attention network as an encoder to capture more efficient
spatio-temporal features by attention mechanism in both spatial and temporal
dimensions. In addition, the framework employs adversarial training to guide
the learning of temporal graph representation and optimize the measurable
modularity loss to maximize the modularity of community. Experiments on the
real-world brain networks datasets are demonstrated to show the effectiveness
of this new method.

the split point that produces the maximum variance reduction from a node to its
children. Our key observation is that the best factor to use (in terms of MSE
drop) is always the target itself, as this most clearly separates the target.
Thus using the target as the splitting factor provides an upper bound on MSE
drop (or lower bound on the residual children MSE). Based on this observation,
we define the k-bit lepto-variance ${\lambda}k^2$ of a target variable (or
equivalently the lepto-variance at a specific depth k) as the variance that
cannot be removed by any regression tree of a depth equal to k. As the upper
bound performance for any feature, we believe ${\lambda}k^2$ to be an
interesting statistical concept related to the underlying structure of the
sample as it quantifies the resolving power of the RT for the sample. The max
variance that may be explained using RTs of depth up to k is called the sample
k-bit macro-variance. At any depth, total sample variance is thus decomposed
into lepto-variance ${\lambda}^2$ and macro-variance ${\mu}^2$. We demonstrate
the concept, by performing 1- and 2-bit RT based lepto-structure analysis for
daily IBM stock returns.

neglects or simplifies the nature of AC power flows in the power system as it
predominantly relies on DC power flows. This paper proposes a novel bilevel
formulation based on the smoothing technique, where any price-affecting
strategic player can be modelled in the upper level, while the market clearing
problem in the lower level uses convex quadratic transmission AC optimal power
flow (AC OPF), with the goal of achieving accuracy close to the one of the
exact nonlinear formulations. Achieving convexity in the lower level is the
foundation for bilevel modeling since traditional single-level reduction
techniques do not hold for nonconvex models. The bilevel market participation
problem with the AC OPF formulation in the lower level is transformed into a
single-level problem and solved using multiple techniques such as the
primal-dual counterpart, the strong duality theorem, the McCormick envelopes,
the complementary slackness, the penalty factor, the interaction discretization
as well as the proposed smoothing techniques. Due to an extensive amount of
information and descriptions, the overall work is presented as a two-part
paper. This first part provides a literature overview, positions the work and
presents the model and the solution algorithm, while the solution techniques
and case studies are provided in the accompanying paper.

  detection from EEG data",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is abundant medical data on the internet, most of which are unlabeled.
Traditional supervised learning algorithms are often limited by the amount of
labeled data, especially in the medical domain, where labeling is costly in
terms of human processing and specialized experts needed to label them. They
are also prone to human error and biased as a select few expert annotators
label them. These issues are mitigated by Self-supervision, where we generate
pseudo-labels from unlabelled data by seeing the data itself. This paper
presents various self-supervision strategies to enhance the performance of a
time-series based Diffusion convolution recurrent neural network (DCRNN) model.
The learned weights in the self-supervision pretraining phase can be
transferred to the supervised training phase to boost the model's prediction
capability. Our techniques are tested on an extension of a Diffusion
Convolutional Recurrent Neural network (DCRNN) model, an RNN with graph
diffusion convolutions, which models the spatiotemporal dependencies present in
EEG signals. When the learned weights from the pretraining stage are
transferred to a DCRNN model to determine whether an EEG time window has a
characteristic seizure signal associated with it, our method yields an AUROC
score $1.56\%$ than the current state-of-the-art models on the TUH EEG seizure
corpus.

fundamental property underlying consciousness in physical systems. The amount
of consciousness in a system is determined by the extent of non-separability
and the number of degrees of freedom involved. Non-interacting and feedforward
systems have zero consciousness, whereas most systems of interacting particles
appear to have low non-separability and consciousness. By contrast, brain
circuits exhibit high complexity and weak but tightly coordinated interactions,
which appear to support high non-separability and therefore high amount of
consciousness. The hypothesis applies to both classical and quantum cases, and
we highlight the formalism employing the Wigner function (which in the
classical limit becomes the Liouville density function) as a potentially
fruitful framework for characterizing non-separability and, thus, the amount of
consciousness in a system. The hypothesis appears to be consistent with both
the Integrated Information Theory and the Orchestrated Objective Reduction
Theory and may help reconcile the two. It offers a natural explanation for the
physical properties underlying the amount of consciousness and points to
methods of estimating the amount of non-separability as promising ways of
characterizing the amount of consciousness.

when deploying assistant systems on-device. However, the limited number of

slightly worse than their cascaded counterparts, which we hope encourages
future work in this direction.

to scaling laws of the efficiency that are valid across a wide range of street

capacity-constrained fleets. We approximate the scaling function with a

thereby enabling mean-field predictions of required fleet sizes in more complex
settings. These results may help to transfer insights from existing
