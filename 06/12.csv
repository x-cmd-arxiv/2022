  Computation",,,,,"cs.GL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  If Turing's groundbreaking paper in 1936 laid the foundation of the theory of
computation (ToC), it is no exaggeration to say that Cook's paper in 1971, ""The
complexity of theorem proving procedures"", [4] has pioneered the study of
computational complexity. So computational complexity, as an independent
research field, is 50 years old now (2021) if we date from Cook's article. This
year coincides with the 100th birthday of Cook's mentor Hao Wang, one of the
most important logicians. This paper traces the origin of computational
complexity, and meanwhile, tries to sort out the instrumental role that Wang
played in the process.

topics in multi-modal machine learning. Nevertheless, none of existing works
make attempts to link knowledge discovery with knowledge guided multi-modal
pre-training. In this paper, we propose to unify them into a continuous
learning framework for mutual improvement. Taking the open-domain uni-modal
datasets of images and texts as input, we maintain a knowledge graph as the
foundation to support these two tasks. For knowledge discovery, a pre-trained
model is used to identify cross-modal links on the graph. For model
pre-training, the knowledge graph is used as the external knowledge to guide
the model updating. These two steps are iteratively performed in our framework
for continuous learning. The experimental results on MS-COCO and Flickr30K with
respect to both knowledge discovery and the pre-trained model validate the
effectiveness of our framework.

compressible Navier-Stokes equations (\textbf{CNS}) is considered. When the
viscosity $\mu(\rho)$ depends on the density $\rho$ in a sublinear power law ($
\rho^\delta$ with $0<\delta\leq 1$), based on an elaborate analysis of the
intrinsic singular structure of this degenerate system, we prove the
global-in-time well-posedness of regular solutions with conserved total mass,
momentum, and finite total energy in some inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces.
Moreover, the solutions we obtained satisfy that $\rho$ keeps positive for all
point $x\in \mathbb{R}$ but decays to zero in the far field, which is
consistent with the facts that the total mass of the whole space is conserved,
and \textbf{CNS} is a model of non-dilute fluids where $\rho$ is bounded below
away from zero. The key to the proof is the introduction of a well-designed
reformulated structure by introducing some new variables and initial
compatibility conditions, which, actually, can transfer the degeneracies of the
time evolution and the viscosity to the possible singularity of some special
source terms. Then, combined with the BD entropy estimates and transport
properties of the so-called effective velocity $v=u+\varphi(\rho)_x$ ($u$ is
the velocity of the fluid, and $\varphi(\rho)$ is a function of $\rho$ defined
by $\varphi'(\rho)=\mu(\rho)/\rho^2$), one can obtain the required uniform a

verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training
with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however,
little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper,
we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to
mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight
for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization
performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated
as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a
type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The
non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with
new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under
the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high

propose \textit{Comm-FedBiO} to solve the general Federated Bilevel

communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence
analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the

possible to tune the photoconductive gain using a vertical electric field, so
that the gain is constant with respect to the light intensity-a linear
photoresponse, with a high responsivity of ~2.5*10^4 A/W. Additionally, the 1/f

states and the states outputted by transition models. MDEs can be used to
define a model precondition that describes which transitions are accurately
modeled. We then propose a planner that uses the learned model preconditions to
switch between various models in order to use models in conditions where they
are accurate, prioritizing faster models when possible. We evaluate our method
on two real-world tasks: placing a rod into a box and placing a rod into a
closed drawer.

a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$: First, we restrict to a submanifold $H

$e_k$ of $H$. We then Fourier restrict $\gamma_H \phi_j$ to a short interval of
eigenvalues of $H$. Laplace eigenvalues of $M$ are denoted $\lambda_j^2$ and
those of $H$ are denoted $\mu_k^2$.
  The Fourier coefficients are negligible unless the $H$- eigenvalues lie in
the interval $\mu_k \in [-\lambda_j, \lambda_j]$. The short windows have the
form $|\mu_k - c \lambda_j| < \epsilon$. The goal is to obtain asymptotics and
estimates of the Fourier coefficients of $\gamma_H \phi_j$ and to see how they
vary with $c$. In prior work with E. L. Wyman and Y. Xi, we obtained
asymptotics for sums over $(\mu_k, \lambda_j)$ in such windows for $0 < c < 1$.
In this article, we obtain `edge' asymptotics when $c=1$ and $H$ is totally
geodesic. The order of magnitude and leading coefficient are very different
from the case $c<1$. In particular, they depend on the dimension of $H$. We
explain how to bridge the bulk results and edge results.

an open-source software tool that leverages a U-Net architecture to accurately

problem, as well as its robust beamforming (RBF) version under imperfect
channel state information (CSI). Such problems arise due to various reasons,
e.g., the costly nature of the radio frequency (RF) chains and
energy/resource-saving considerations. The joint (R)BF\&AS problem is a mixed
integer and nonlinear program, and thus finding {\it optimal solutions} is
often costly, if not outright impossible. The vast majority of the prior works
tackled these problems using techniques such as continuous approximations,
greedy methods, and supervised machine learning -- yet these approaches do not
ensure optimality or even feasibility of the solutions. The main contribution
of this work is threefold. First, an effective {\it branch and bound} (B\&B)
framework for solving the problems of interest is proposed. Leveraging existing
BF and RBF solvers, it is shown that the B\&B framework guarantees global
optimality of the considered problems. Second, to expedite the potentially
costly B\&B algorithm, a machine learning (ML)-based scheme is proposed to help
skip intermediate states of the B\&B search tree. The learning model features a
{\it graph neural network} (GNN)-based design that is resilient to a commonly
encountered challenge in wireless communications, namely, the change of problem
size (e.g., the number of users) across the training and test stages. Third,
comprehensive performance characterizations are presented, showing that the
GNN-based method retains the global optimality of B\&B with provably reduced
complexity, under reasonable conditions. Numerical simulations also show that
the ML-based acceleration can often achieve an order-of-magnitude speedup
relative to B\&B.

generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$,
but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$
in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.
  We parameterize the problem by specifying a family $\mathcal S \subseteq
2^{[k]}$ of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive
ratio as a function of the cache size $k$ and family $\mathcal S$:
  - If all request sets are allowed ($\mathcal
S=2^{[k]}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized
competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging ($\mathcal
S=\{[k]\}$).
  - As a function of $|\mathcal S|$ and $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is
polynomial: at most $O(k^2|\mathcal S|)$ and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal
S|})$.
  - For any laminar family $\mathcal S$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are
$O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\log k)$ (randomized).
  - The special case of laminar $\mathcal S$ that we call All-or-One Paging
extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to
put the requested page in. The optimal deterministic ratio for weighted
All-or-One Paging is $\Theta(k)$. Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.
  Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the
generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\mathcal P of
pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\mathcal P into the cache.
The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$)
are at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\,H_k$ (randomized).

nodes) into a low-dimensional vector space. Since the current methods are
mostly based on machine learning, a black box of an input-output data fitting
mechanism, generally the space's dimension is indeterminable and its elements
are not interpreted. Although massive efforts to cope with this issue have
included, for example, automated machine learning by computer scientists and
computational theory by mathematics, the root causes still remain unresolved.

only 30 lines of single-script code on average. We further demonstrate the
performance of the generated models on emerging per-packet ML platforms to
showcase its timely and practical significance.

distributions provides practical tools for identifying features such as the
nonclassicality of quantum states. In this setting, filter functions are
commonly used to regularize or smooth the phase-space quasiprobability
distributions, in particular, the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We show that
the quantum map associated with a filter function is completely positive and
trace-preserving if and only if the Fourier transform of the filter function is
a probability density distribution. In this case, filtering the
quasiprobability distributions of a quantum state can be viewed as applying a
random displacement operation on the quantum state according to the Fourier
transform of the filter function. We derive a lower bound on the fidelity
between the input and output states of a quantum filtering map. We illustrate
several examples of filter functions corresponding to physical and nonphysical
maps, in particular, a class of positive but not completely positive maps. We
also discuss interesting applications of our results in estimating the output
state of unknown quantum channels and estimating the outcome probabilities of
quantum measurements.

thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for
astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them.
This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star
catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a
catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly
together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the
completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of
the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is
performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R
diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1
among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems
illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues.
Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf
companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also
presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of
previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate
binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis
of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars
using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints
on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new
exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one
super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring
confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.

mathematical view of Neural Network (NN)-based flight control systems and the
challenging problems that still remain. The paper will cover both the
model-based and model-free IFCSs. The model-based methods consist of the basic
feedback error learning scheme, the pseudocontrol strategy, and the neural
backstepping method. Besides, different approaches to analyze the closed-loop
stability in IFCSs, their requirements, and their limitations will be discussed
in detail. Various supplementary features, which can be integrated with a basic
IFCS such as the fault-tolerance capability, the consideration of system
constraints, and the combination of NNs with other robust and adaptive elements
like disturbance observers, would be covered, as well. On the other hand,
concerning model-free flight controllers, both the indirect and direct adaptive
control systems including indirect adaptive control using NN-based system
identification, the approximate dynamic programming using NN, and the
reinforcement learning-based adaptive optimal control will be carefully
addressed. Finally, by demonstrating a well-organized view of the current stage
in the development of IFCSs, the challenging issues, which are critical to be
addressed in the future, are thoroughly identified.

valley-singlet (STVS) superconducting phase in certain two-valley electron
liquids, including rhombohedral trilayer graphene, Bernal bilayer graphene and
ZrNCl. This fully gapped phase is exotic in that it combines into Cooper pairs
same-spin electrons from valleys centered around the opposing corners of a
hexagonal Brillouin zone, but is, nevertheless, topologically trivial. Here, we
predict that upon stacking two layers of an STVS material with an angular
twist, a novel chiral topological phase -- an $f \pm if'$-wave superconductor
-- emerges in the vicinity of the `maximal' twist angle of 30$^{\circ}$ where
the system becomes an extrinsic quasi-crystal with 12-fold tiling. The
resulting composite is a non-Abelian topological superconductor (TSC) with an
odd number of chiral Majorana modes at its edges and a single Majorana zero
mode (MZM) localized in the vortex core. Through symmetry analysis and detailed
microscopic modelling based on a novel quasi-crystal band structure technique,
we demonstrate that the non-Abelian TSC forms when the isolated Fermi pockets
coalesce into a single connected Fermi surface around the center of the
moir\'{e} Brillouin zone and is stable over a wide range of electron density.
We further discuss how the energetics leading to the $f \pm if'$-wave phase
results in anomalous $\pi$-periodic inter-layer Josephson effect, which can
serve as a distinctive signature of the chiral phase. Distinct from the
valley-preserving moir\'{e} physics in small-angle twisted graphene, our
results establish the large-angle moir\'{e} physics arising near maximal twist
as a new avenue toward intrinsic TSC with non-Abelian excitations.

Humans naturally use either or both visual and tactile perception to extract
object class and properties. Typical approaches for robots, however, require
complex visual systems or multiple high-density tactile sensors which can be
highly expensive. In addition, they usually require actual collection of a
large dataset from real objects through direct interaction. In this paper, we
propose a kinesthetic-based object recognition method that can be performed
with any multi-fingered robotic hand in which the kinematics is known. The
method does not require tactile sensors and is based on observing grasps of the
objects. We utilize a unique and frame invariant parameterization of grasps to
learn instances of object shapes. To train a classifier, training data is
generated rapidly and solely in a computational process without interaction
with real objects. We then propose and compare between two iterative algorithms
that can integrate any trained classifier. The classifiers and algorithms are
independent of any particular robot hand and, therefore, can be exerted on
various ones. We show in experiments, that with few grasps, the algorithms
acquire accurate classification. Furthermore, we show that the object
recognition approach is scalable to objects of various sizes. Similarly, a
global classifier is trained to identify general geometries (e.g., an ellipsoid
or a box) rather than particular ones and demonstrated on a large set of
objects. Full scale experiments and analysis are provided to show the
performance of the method.

to utilize historic data to predict and diagnose incidents using
spatio-temporal forecasting. We consider the specific use case of road traffic
systems where incidents take the form of anomalous events, such as accidents or
broken-down vehicles. To tackle this, we develop a neural model, called RadNet,
which forecasts system parameters such as average vehicle speeds for a future
timestep. As such systems largely follow daily or weekly periodicity, we
compare RadNet's predictions against historical averages to label incidents.
Unlike prior work, RadNet infers spatial and temporal trends in both
permutations, finally combining the dense representations before forecasting.
This facilitates informed inference and more accurate incident detection.
Experiments with two publicly available and a new road traffic dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model gives up to 8% higher prediction F1 scores

also develop adaptive algorithms for pruning each neuron in the network

Information-Centric Networking. The NDN architecture adopts name-based routing
and location-independent data retrieval. Among other important features, NDN
integrates security mechanisms and focuses on protecting the content rather
than the communications channels. Along with a new architecture come new
threats and NDN is no exception. NDN is a potential target for new network
attacks such as Interest Flooding Attacks (IFAs). Attackers take advantage of
IFA to launch (D)DoS attacks in NDN. Many IFA detection and mitigation
solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, there is no
comprehensive review study of these solutions that has been proposed so far.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a survey of the various IFAs with a
detailed comparative study of all the relevant proposed solutions as
counter-measures against IFAs. We also review the requirements for a complete
and efficient IFA solution and pinpoint the various issues encountered by IFA
detection and mitigation mechanisms through a series of attack scenarios.
Finally, in this survey, we offer an analysis of the open issues and future
research directions regarding IFAs. This manuscript consists of an extended

most recent developments of information theory of networks. Maximum entropy
models of networks are the least biased ensembles enforcing a set of
constraints and are used in a number of application to produce null model of
networks. Here maximum entropy ensembles of networks are introduced by
distinguishing between microcanonical and canonical ensembles revealing the the
non-equivalence of these two classes of ensembles in the case in which an
extensive number of constraints is imposed. It is very common that network data
includes also meta-data describing feature of the nodes such as their position
in a real or in an abstract space. The features of the nodes can be treated as
latent variables that determine the cost associated to each link. Maximum
entropy network ensembles with latent variables include spatial networks and
their generalisation. In this chapter we cover the case of transportation
networks including airport and rail networks. Maximum entropy network ensemble
satisfy a given set of constraints. However traditional approaches do not
provide any insight on the origin of such constraints. We use information
theory principles to find the optimal distribution of latent variables in the
framework of the classical information theory of networks. This theory explains
the ""blessing of non-uniformity"" of data guaranteeing the efficiency of
inference algorithms.

four BSD family operating systems: DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

provides empirical evidence that quantifiable evolutionary code characteristics

paper we demonstrate a deep learning technique to generate synthetic but
realistic whole-body PET sinograms from abundantly-available whole-body MRI.
Specifically, we use a dataset of 56 $^{18}$F-FDG-PET/MRI exams to train a 3D
residual UNet to predict physiologic PET uptake from whole-body T1-weighted
MRI. In training we implemented a balanced loss function to generate realistic
uptake across a large dynamic range and computed losses along tomographic lines
of response to mimic the PET acquisition. The predicted PET images are forward
projected to produce synthetic PET time-of-flight (ToF) sinograms that can be
used with vendor-provided PET reconstruction algorithms, including using
CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) and MR-based attenuation correction
(MRAC). The resulting synthetic data recapitulates physiologic $^{18}$F-FDG
uptake, e.g. high uptake localized to the brain and bladder, as well as uptake
in liver, kidneys, heart and muscle. To simulate abnormalities with high
uptake, we also insert synthetic lesions. We demonstrate that this synthetic
PET data can be used interchangeably with real PET data for the PET
quantification task of comparing CT and MR-based attenuation correction
methods, achieving $\leq 7.6\%$ error in mean-SUV compared to using real data.
These results together show that the proposed synthetic PET data pipeline can

complex parameters. Understanding their parameter spaces is key to
understanding families with more asymptotic values, just as understanding
quadratic polynomials was for rational maps more generally.
  The first such families studied were the one-dimensional slices of the
exponential family, $\exp(z) + a$, and the tangent family $\lambda \tan z$. The
exponential case exhibited phenomena not seen for rational maps: Cantor
bouquets in both the dynamic and parameter spaces, and no bounded hyperbolic
components. The tangent case, with its two finite asymptotic values $\pm
\lambda i$, is closer to the rational case, a kind of infinite degree version
of the latter.

and a one-dimensional slice for which one of the asymptotic values is
constrained to be pole, the ""polar asymptotic value"" of the title. We show how

principle, which asserts that the universe is statistically isotropic and
homogeneous on large scales, so the observed dipole anisotropy in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) must be attributed to our local peculiar motion. We
test the null hypothesis that there is a dipole anisotropy in the sky
distribution of radio galaxies and quasars consistent with the motion inferred
from the CMB, as is expected for cosmologically distant sources. Our two
samples, constructed respectively from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, are systematically independent and have no
shared objects. Using a completely general statistic that accounts for
correlation between the found dipole amplitude and its directional offset from
the CMB dipole, the null hypothesis is independently rejected by the radio
galaxy and quasar samples with $p$-value of $8.9\times10^{-3}$ and
$1.2\times10^{-5}$, respectively, corresponding to $2.6\sigma$ and $4.4\sigma$
significance. The joint significance, using sample size-weighted $Z$-scores, is
$5.1\sigma$. We show that the radio galaxy and quasar dipoles are consistent
with each other and find no evidence for any frequency dependence of the
amplitude. The consistency of the two dipoles improves if we boost to the CMB
frame assuming its dipole to be fully kinematic, suggesting that cosmologically
distant radio galaxies and quasars may have an intrinsic anisotropy in this
frame.

bound to their training contexts, with no considerations of changes to their
surrounding environments. Continual adaptability and automation of neural
networks is of paramount importance to several domains where model
accessibility is limited after deployment (e.g IoT devices, self-driving
vehicles, etc). Additionally, even accessible models require frequent
maintenance post-deployment to overcome issues such as Concept/Data Drift,
which can be cumbersome and restrictive. The current state of the art on
adaptive ANNs is still a premature area of research; nevertheless, Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), a form of AutoML, and Continual Learning (CL) have
recently gained an increasing momentum in the Deep Learning research field,
aiming to provide more robust and adaptive ANN development frameworks. This
study is the first extensive review on the intersection between AutoML and CL,
outlining research directions for the different methods that can facilitate
full automation and lifelong plasticity in ANNs.

  systems as exemplified by single enzyme chemotaxis",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Single enzyme chemotaxis is a phenomenon by which a non-equilibrium spatial
distribution of an enzyme is created and maintained by concentration gradients
of the substrate and product of the catalyzed reaction. These gradients can
arise either naturally through metabolism, or experimentally, e.g., by flow of
materials through several channels or by use of diffusion chambers with
semipermeable membranes. Numerous hypotheses regarding the mechanism of this
phenomenon have been proposed. Here we discuss a mechanism based solely on
diffusion and chemical kinetics and show that kinetic asymmetry, a difference
in the off rates for substrate and for product, and diffusion asymmetry, a
difference in the diffusivities of the bound and free forms of the enzyme, are
the sole determinates of the direction of chemotaxis. Exploration of these
fundamental symmetries that govern nonequilibrium behavior helps to distinguish
between possible mechanisms for the evolution of a chemical system from initial
to the steady state, and whether the principle that determines the direction a
system shifts when exposed to an external energy source is based on
thermodynamics, or on kinetics, with the latter being supported by the results
of the present paper. Our results show that while dissipation ineluctably
accompanies non-equilibrium phenomena, including chemotaxis, systems do not
evolve to maximize dissipation, but rather to attain greatest kinetic
stability. Chemotactic response to the gradients formed by other enzymes
provides a mechanism for forming loose associations known as metabolons.
Significantly the direction of the effective force due to these gradients
depends on the kinetic asymmetry of the enzyme, and so can be non-reciprocal,
where one enzyme is attracted to another enzyme, but the other enzyme is
repelled by the one, an important ingredient in the behavior of active matter.

facilitated recently by the early third data release of the Gaia space mission.
Based on the proper nebular central star (CS) motion towards the region of

process for a group of 68 PNe and disprove the interaction process for a group
of 33 PNe. The members of both groups were confirmed as genuine PN-ISM
interacting objects in the literature. The members belonging to the 33 PNe
group are false PN-ISM interacting objects that mimic the structure of IPNe.
Moreover, we calculated the physical and kinematic properties of the verified
group and analyzed their galactic population classification using reliable and
precise measurements of the proper motion and parallax of the CS. We find that
41\% and 41\% of this group are associated with galactic thin and thick disks,
respectively, while 18\% are members of thin or thick disks. The kinematical
results show that the galactic thin-disk members have smaller vertical galactic

probabilities of random quantum circuits. We consider three random circuit
families, namely, Haar random, $p=1$ QAOA, and random IQP circuits. Our results
are as follows. For Haar random circuits with $m$ gates, we improve on prior
results by showing $\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hardness of average-case additive
approximations to an imprecision of $2^{-O(m)}$. Efficient classical simulation
of such problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For
constant depth circuits i.e., when $m=O(n)$, this linear scaling in the
exponent is within a constant of the scaling required to show hardness of
sampling. Prior to our work, such a result was shown only for Boson Sampling in
Bouland et al (2021). We also use recent results in polynomial interpolation to
show $\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hardness under $\mathsf{BPP}$ reductions rather than
$\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{NP}}$ reductions. This improves the results of prior
work for Haar random circuits both in terms of the error scaling and the power
of reductions. Next, we consider random $p=1$ QAOA and IQP circuits and show
that in the average-case, it is $\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hard to approximate the
output probability to within an additive error of $2^{-O(n)}$. For $p=1$ QAOA
circuits, this work constitutes the first average-case hardness result for the
problem of approximating output probabilities for random QAOA circuits, which

consequence of our results is that approximating the Ising partition function

the posterior full conditional distributions of the model parameters,
circumventing computationally intensive Metropolis-Hastings methods. A

symmetry perfectly behaves as an atom, in the sense that its surrounding cloud

dilatonic black hole. We find exact wave functions of the cloud for arbitrary
gravitational fine structure constant $\mu M$, and clear the underlying

of this discovery especially from considerations of entropy, and the resultant

since the artificial threshold involved in the procedure is not robust; 2) The
attention awaiting loss calculation is necessarily high-dimensional, and
decreasing it by convolution will inevitably introduce additional learnable

into a one-dimensional feature map in the mathematical sense for loss
calculation midway through the network, while automatically providing adaptive

modified to always produce tileable (periodic) material maps. In addition to

quantization adaptive and can be used in different compression ratios. More
importantly, to jointly optimize the preprocessing module with the downstream

our method achieves a better trade-off between the coding bitrate and the

treated as probability distributions instead of point estimates and, Bayesian
inference is used to update their prior distribution. Now, to manage the
computational cost associated with approximating the posterior distribution,
the proposed VB-DeepONet uses \textit{variational inference}. Unlike Markov
Chain Monte Carlo schemes, variational inference has the capacity to take into

illustrate the performance of the proposed VB-DeepONet and comparisons have

synergistic manner. Specifically, as a result of the band alignment, charge
carriers can be transferred between graphene and the substrate under the
control of gate voltages, which may yield a long-wavelength electronic crystal
at the surface of the substrate. The electronic crystal in turn exerts a
superlattice Coulomb potential to the Dirac electrons in graphene, which
reduces the non-interacting Fermi velocity such that $e$-$e$ Coulomb
interactions within graphene would give rise to a gapped Dirac state at the
charge neutrality point, concomitant with interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity.
Reciprocally, the electronic crystal formed in the substrate can be
substantially stabilized in such coupled bilayer heterostructure by virtue of
the cooperative interlayer Coulomb coupling. We have further performed

a new device called a $(\gamma_i,\alpha_i)$-resilient convex combination, which
allows normal agents in the network to utilize their locally available
information to automatically isolate the impact of the Byzantine agents. Such a
resilient convex combination is computable through linear programming, whose
complexity scales well with the size of the overall system. By applying this
new device to multi-agent systems, we introduce network and constraint
redundancy conditions under which resilient constrained consensus can be
achieved with an exponential convergence rate. We also provide insights on the
design of a network such that the redundancy conditions are satisfied. Finally,
numerical simulations and an example of safe multi-agent learning are provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

to thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors. The model is based on
the framework of synchronization and considers the acoustic field and the
unsteady heat release rate from turbulent reactive flow as two nonlinearly
coupled sub-systems. Previous experimental studies have reported a route from
low amplitude chaotic oscillation (i. e. combustion noise) to periodic
oscillations through intermittency in turbulent combustors. By varying the
coupling strength, our proposed model can replicate the route that is observed
in experiments. Instead of assessing combustion noise as background noise to
the system, the model considered a coupled oscillator system that produces
multifractal chaotic oscillations to represent the combustion noise. This set
of coupled oscillators is then nonlinearly coupled to a linear oscillator
representing the acoustic field. As the coupling strength increases, the system
loses its multifractality and exhibits large-amplitude periodic oscillations in
a manner consistent with the dynamics observed in experimental studies.

management in large-scale dynamic systems. In such systems, blockchain is
mainly used to store the trust score or trust-related information of

architectures using blockchain lack verifiable interactions among the entities
on which the trust score is calculated. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-based trust management framework that allows independent trust
providers to implement different trust metrics on a common set of trust
evidence and provide individual trust value. We employ geo-location as proof of
interaction. Some of the existing proposals rely upon geo-location data, but
they do not support trust calculation by multiple trust providers. Instead,
they can only support a centralised system. Our proposed architecture does not
depend upon a single centralised third-party entity to ensure trusted
interactions. Our architecture is supported by provable interactions that can
easily be verified using blockchain. Therefore, it allows a high degree of
confidence in trust management by ensuring the actual interactions between the
entities. We provide a detailed design and development of the architecture
using real-world use case examples. The proof of prototype was implemented on
the Ethereum blockchain platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the
employment of independent trust providers adequately provides a high degree of
trust scores and that the proposed architecture can be used in a real-world

of users and systems to identify unexpected deviations. The feasibility of this
approach crucially depends on how well attack-related events can be isolated
from benign and mundane system activities. Despite the significant focus on
end-user systems, the background behavior of servers running critical services
for the enterprise is less studied. To guide the design of detection methods
tailored for servers, in this work, we examine system event records from 46
servers in a large enterprise obtained over a duration of ten weeks. We analyze
the rareness characteristics and the similarity of the provenance relations in
the event log data. Our findings show that server activity, in general, is
highly variant over time and dissimilar across different types of servers.
However, careful consideration of profiling window of historical events and
service level grouping of servers improve rareness measurements by 24.5%.
Further, utilizing better contextual representations, the similarity in
provenance relationships could be improved. An important implication of our
findings is that detection techniques developed considering experimental setups

physics for more than 30 years. In such unconventional superconductivities,
d-wave Cooper pairing with antiparallel spins has been often observed in
various quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) bulk systems. Interestingly, many
theories predicted that the triangular lattice causes the d-wave pairing to be
unstable and may lead to more exotic pairing such as parallel spin
(spin-triplet) pairing. Here we focus on a bulk organic triangular-lattice
system in which superconductivity emerges near a nonmagnetic Mott insulating
phase. We demonstrate, by using low-power nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements, that the spin susceptibility of the superconducting state retains
the normal state value even deep in the superconducting state. This result
indicates the possibility that the material exhibits spin-triplet

learning (MIL) models achieve competitive performance at the bag level.
However, instance-level prediction, which is essential for many important
applications, remains largely unsatisfactory. We propose to conduct novel
active deep multiple instance learning that samples a small subset of
informative instances for annotation, aiming to significantly boost the
instance-level prediction. A variance regularized loss function is designed to
properly balance the bias and variance of instance-level predictions, aiming to
effectively accommodate the highly imbalanced instance distribution in MIL and
other fundamental challenges. Instead of directly minimizing the variance
regularized loss that is non-convex, we optimize a distributionally robust bag
level likelihood as its convex surrogate. The robust bag likelihood provides a
good approximation of the variance based MIL loss with a strong theoretical
guarantee. It also automatically balances bias and variance, making it
effective to identify the potentially positive instances to support active
sampling. The robust bag likelihood can be naturally integrated with a deep
architecture to support deep model training using mini-batches of
positive-negative bag pairs. Finally, a novel P-F sampling function is
developed that combines a probability vector and predicted instance scores,
obtained by optimizing the robust bag likelihood. By leveraging the key MIL
assumption, the sampling function can explore the most challenging bags and
effectively detect their positive instances for annotation, which significantly
improves the instance-level prediction. Experiments conducted over multiple
real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art instance-level
prediction achieved by the proposed model.

animal-related datasets focus either on animal tracking or single-frame animal
pose estimation, and never on both aspects. The lack of APT datasets hinders
the development and evaluation of video-based animal pose estimation and
tracking methods, limiting real-world applications, e.g., understanding animal
behavior in wildlife conservation. To fill this gap, we make the first step and
propose APT-36K, i.e., the first large-scale benchmark for animal pose
estimation and tracking. Specifically, APT-36K consists of 2,400 video clips
collected and filtered from 30 animal species with 15 frames for each video,
resulting in 36,000 frames in total. After manual annotation and careful
double-check, high-quality keypoint and tracking annotations are provided for
all the animal instances. Based on APT-36K, we benchmark several representative
models on the following three tracks: (1) supervised animal pose estimation on
a single frame under intra- and inter-domain transfer learning settings, (2)
inter-species domain generalization test for unseen animals, and (3) animal
pose estimation with animal tracking. Based on the experimental results, we
gain some empirical insights and show that APT-36K provides a valuable animal
pose estimation and tracking benchmark, offering new challenges and
opportunities for future research. The code and dataset will be made publicly

non-minimal couplings between the scalar field and Maxwell field, we observe
that an initial scalar-free configuration suffers tachyonic instability and
both the scalar field and the black hole irreducible mass grow exponentially at
early times and saturate exponentially at late times. For fractional couplings,
we find that though there is negative energy distribution near the black hole
horizon, the black hole horizon area never decreases. But when the parameters
are large, the evolution endpoints of linearly unstable bald black holes will
be spacetimes with naked singularity and the cosmic censorship is violated. The
effects of the black hole charge, cosmological constant and coupling strength
on the dynamical scalarization process are studied in detail. We find that
large enough cosmological constant can prevent the spontaneous scalarization.

research direction, in this work, we propose tBDFS -- a novel temporal GNN
architecture. tBDFS applies a layer that efficiently aggregates information
from temporal paths to a given (target) node in the graph. For each given node,
the aggregation is applied in two stages: (1) A single representation is
learned for each temporal path ending in that node, and (2) all path
representations are aggregated into a final node representation. Overall, our
goal is not to add new information to a node, but rather observe the same exact
information in a new perspective. This allows our model to directly observe
patterns that are path-oriented rather than neighborhood-oriented. This can be
thought as a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal over the temporal graph,
compared to the popular Breath-First Search (BFS) traversal that is applied in
previous works. We evaluate tBDFS over multiple link prediction tasks and show
its favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best

Numerous factors that affect electromagnetic detection are considered in the
model, such as detection mode, bandwidth, and other factors. The RL-GA embeds a
Q-learning method into an improved genetic algorithm, and the evolution of each
individual depends on the decision of the agent. Q-learning is used to guide
the population search process by choosing evolution operators. In this way, the
search information can be effectively used by the reinforcement learning
method. In the algorithm, we design a reward function to update the Q value.
According to the problem characteristics, a new combination of <state, action>

improve search performance. After that, a task time window selection algorithm
(TTWSA) is proposed to evaluate the performance of population evolution.
Several experiments are used to examine the scheduling effect of the proposed
algorithm. Through the experimental verification of multiple instances, it can
be seen that the RL-GA can solve the EDSSP problem effectively. Compared with
the state-of-the-art algorithms, the RL-GA performs better in several aspects.

  Deterministic Load Profiles using MPC",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Smart home appliances can time-shift and curtail their power demand to assist
demand side management or allow operation with limited power, as in an off-grid
application. This paper proposes a scheduling process to start appliances with
time-varying deterministic load profiles. Self-triggered model predictive
control is used to limit the household net power demand below a given
threshold. Meanwhile, deterministic load profiles are more difficult to
schedule compared to variable charging or thermal loads because system failure
will occur once power demand is not satisfied. The proposed scheme formulates
the decision of the load shifting time as a continuous optimization problem,
and an inhomogeneous time grid system is introduced to handle the optimization
of different appliances and their consensus at this resolution. The efficacy of
the proposed scheme is studied by numerical comparison with a mixed-integer MPC
controller and by a case study of three home appliances and an interruptible
washing machine.

differentiable phase correlation (DPC) solver that is globally convergent and
correspondence-free. When combined with simple feature extraction networks, our
general framework DPCN++ allows for versatile pose registration with arbitrary
initialization. Specifically, the feature extraction networks first learn dense
feature grids from a pair of homogeneous/heterogeneous measurements. These
feature grids are then transformed into a translation and scale invariant
spectrum representation based on Fourier transform and spherical radial
aggregation, decoupling translation and scale from rotation. Next, the
rotation, scale, and translation are independently and efficiently estimated in
the spectrum step-by-step using the DPC solver. The entire pipeline is
differentiable and trained end-to-end. We evaluate DCPN++ on a wide range of
registration tasks taking different input modalities, including 2D bird's-eye
view images, 3D object and scene measurements, and medical images. Experimental
results demonstrate that DCPN++ outperforms both classical and learning-based

scalar mesons, which undergo modifications in a magnetized medium. The charged
open bottom mesons have additional positive mass shifts due to Landau

the upsilon states originates from the modification of the gluon condensates
simulated by the variation of dilaton field ($\chi$) and a quark mass term in
the magnetized medium. The open bottom mesons and upsilon states experience a
mass drop in the magnetized medium. The masses of these mesons initially
increase with a rise in temperature, and beyond a high value of temperature,
their masses are observed to drop. When the temperature is below 90 MeV, the
in-medium masses of the mesons increase with an increase in the magnetic field.
However, at high temperatures (T $>$ 90 MeV), the masses are observed to drop
with an increase in the magnetic field. The dominant in-medium effects are the

scale distribution incurred by intrinsic scale shift. We propose Gaussian
Mixture Scope (GMS) to regularize the chaotic scale distribution. Concretely,
the GMS utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution to adapt to scale distribution
and decouples the mixture model into sub-normal distributions to regularize the
chaos within the sub-distributions. Then, an alignment is introduced to
regularize the chaos among sub-distributions. However, despite that GMS is
effective in regularizing the data distribution, it amounts to dislodging the
hard samples in training set, which incurs overfitting. We assert that it is
blamed on the block of transferring the latent knowledge exploited by GMS from
data to model. Therefore, a Scoped Teacher playing a role of bridge in
knowledge transform is proposed. What' s more, the consistency regularization
is also introduced to implement knowledge transform. To that effect, the
further constraints are deployed on Scoped Teacher to derive feature
consistence between teacher and student end.
  With proposed GMS and Scoped Teacher implemented on five mainstream datasets
of crowd localization, the extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our work. Moreover, comparing with existing crowd locators, our work achieves
state-of-the-art via F1-meansure comprehensively on five datasets.

from the integration of Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra for a sample
of about 32.2 million stars brighter than G_RVS~14 mag (or G~15 mag). In this
paper, we describe the data used and the approach adopted to derive and
validate the G_RVS magnitudes published in DR3. We also provide estimates of
the G_RVS passband and associated G_RVS zero-point. We derived G_RVS photometry
from the integration of RVS spectra over the wavelength range from 846 to 870
nm. We processed these spectra following a procedure similar to that used for
DR2, but incorporating several improvements that allow a better estimation of
G_RVS. These improvements pertain to the stray-light background estimation, the
line spread function calibration, and the detection of spectra contaminated by
nearby relatively bright sources. We calibrated the G_RVS zero-point every 30
hours based on the reference magnitudes of constant stars from the Hipparcos
catalogue, and used them to transform the integrated flux of the cleaned and
calibrated spectra into epoch magnitudes. The G_RVS magnitude of a star
published in DR3 is the median of the epoch magnitudes for that star. We
estimated the G_RVS passband by comparing the RVS spectra of 108 bright stars
with their flux-calibrated spectra from external spectrophotometric libraries.
The G_RVS magnitude provides information that is complementary to that obtained
from the G, G_BP, and G_RP magnitudes, which is useful for constraining stellar
metallicity and interstellar extinction. The median precision of G_RVS
measurements ranges from about 0.006 mag for the brighter stars (i.e. with 3.5
< G_RVS < 6.5 mag) to 0.125 mag at the faint end. The derived G_RVS passband
shows that the effective transmittance of the RVS is approximately 1.23 times
better than the pre-launch estimate.

well with an acceleration model with or without jerk. The orbital model was
tried when the fit of any acceleration model was beyond our acceptance

Apart from its empirical success, the theoretical convergence property of
decentralized AC algorithms is largely unexplored. Most of the existing
finite-time convergence results are derived based on either double-loop update
or two-timescale step sizes rule, and this is the case even for centralized AC
algorithm under a single-agent setting. In practice, the
\emph{single-timescale} update is widely utilized, where actor and critic are
updated in an alternating manner with step sizes being of the same order. In
this work, we study a decentralized \emph{single-timescale} AC
algorithm.Theoretically, using linear approximation for value and reward
estimation, we show that the algorithm has sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ under Markovian sampling, which matches
the optimal complexity with a double-loop implementation (here,

AC using a single-timescale update scheme. The central to establishing our

often referred to as Casimir-Lifshitz forces. For bodies in relative motion, in
addition to the Casimir-Lifshitz force, a lateral frictional force (""quantum
friction"", in the zero temperature limit) comes into play. The widely accepted
theory of the fluctuation induced forces is based on the ""fluctuational
electrodynamics"" , when the Maxwell equations are supplemented by random
current sources responsible for the fluctuations of the medium polarization.
  The first part of our paper touches on some conceptual issues of the theory,
such as the dissipation-less limit and the link between Rytov's approach and
quantum electrodynamics. We point out the problems with the dissipation-less
plasma model (with its unphysical double pole at zero frequency) which still
appears in the literature.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to ""quantum friction"", in a broad
sense, and it contains some novel material. In particular, it is pointed out
that in weakly dissipative systems the friction force may not be a stationary
process. It is shown, using an ""exact"" (nonpertubative) quantum treatment that
under appropriate conditions, an instability can occur when the kinetic energy
(due to the relative motion between the bodies) is transformed into coherent
radiation, exponentially growing in intensity (the instability gets eventually
limited by non-linear effects). We also discuss a setup when the two bodies are
at rest but a constant electric current is flowing in one of the bodies. One
may say that only the electron component of one body is dragged with respect to
the other body, unlike the usual setup when the two bodies are in relative
motion. Clearly there are differences in the frictional forces between the two
setups.

of surface reconstruction from multi-view images. This task becomes more
difficult when only sparse images are provided as input, a scenario where
existing neural reconstruction approaches usually produce incomplete or
distorted results. Moreover, their inability of generalizing to unseen new
scenes impedes their application in practice. Contrarily, SparseNeuS can
generalize to new scenes and work well with sparse images (as few as 2 or 3).
SparseNeuS adopts signed distance function (SDF) as the surface representation,
and learns generalizable priors from image features by introducing geometry
encoding volumes for generic surface prediction. Moreover, several strategies
are introduced to effectively leverage sparse views for high-quality
reconstruction, including 1) a multi-level geometry reasoning framework to
recover the surfaces in a coarse-to-fine manner; 2) a multi-scale color
blending scheme for more reliable color prediction; 3) a consistency-aware
fine-tuning scheme to control the inconsistent regions caused by occlusion and
noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods, but also exhibits good efficiency,
generalizability, and flexibility.

alternative approach is the creation of a nano machine that is directed to its
target (the cancerous tissue), then activated to engage cancerous cells and
""surgically"" induce controlled apoptosis. A magneto-mechanical device composed
of nanomagnets that potentially meets this objective is thus predicated. The
magnetic particles must be bio-functionalised for ""in-body"" use where their
uniqueness allows precise tracking and manipulation. In order to
bio-functionalize magnetic particles they have to be embedded in a
biocompatible coating or shell. Even enclosed within a biological entity the
application of magnetic field gradients result in significant forces acting
upon the magnetic particles. As such, single domain, ferromagnetic particles
can be used inside the body for a number of applications. The lack of naturally
occurring ferromagnetic particles inside the human body allows the
bio-functionalized particles to be detectable, without the interference of
noise from the host environment. Therefore, it is of paramount importance, for
medical applications, to understand exactly how the magnetic particles will
respond to a magnetic field gradient. Accordingly, the magnetic response of a
system of four interacting magnetic particles is examined and it is shown that
such a system can be optimised for targeting cancer cells and performing
nano-surgical operations. The range of magnetic field required for such
nano-medical applications is specified and the connection of these applications
to different phase transitions arising in the magnetic field is described.

Representations from each view are separately used to coarsely predict the

Extensive experiments conducted on typical fake news detection datasets prove

(CLSM) has been adopted to capture the interface topology in squeezing regime
($Ca_c <10^{-2}$) for wide flow rate ratio ($1/10 \leq Q_r \leq 10$) and
contact angle ($120^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 180^{\circ}$). Based on the
instantaneous phase profiles, droplet formation stages are classified as
initial, filling, squeezing, pinch-off and stable droplet. Wettability effects
are insignificant in filling stage. However, hydrophobic effects are more
visible in squeezing and pinch-off stages. Engineering parameters have
generally shown complex dependence on dimensionless parameters ($Ca_c$, $Q_r$,
$\theta$). Capturing the instantaneous interface evolution has revealed droplet
shape senstivity with the contact angle. Interface profiles transform from
convex into concave immediately for hydrophobic ($120^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq
135^{\circ}$) whereas slowly for super hydrophobic ($150^{\circ} \leq \theta

dispersed phase is not constant, but it is an anti-phase with pressure in
continuous phase. Comparing the filling and pinch-off time based on the
pressure and phase profiles has brought new insights that the droplet pinch-off
mechanism can be elucidated by installing the pressure sensors even without the
flow visualization and phase profiles. The interface curvature adopts a
flattened to a more concave shape when the Laplace pressure varies from a
smaller to a higher value. The interface neck width (2r) shows an increasing
trend up to a threshold value and then decreases linearly with the contact

applications from various malicious injection attacks such as SQL injection,
XML injection, and PHP injection, to name a few. However, given the evolving
sophistication of injection attacks and the increasing complexity of tuning a
WAF, it is challenging to ensure that the WAF is free of injection
vulnerabilities such that it will block all malicious injection attacks without
wrongly affecting the legitimate message. Automatically testing the WAF is,
therefore, a timely and essential task. In this paper, we propose DaNuoYi, an
automatic injection testing tool that simultaneously generates test inputs for
multiple types of injection attacks on a WAF. Our basic idea derives from the
cross-lingual translation in the natural language processing domain. In
particular, test inputs for different types of injection attacks are
syntactically different but may be semantically similar. Sharing semantic
knowledge across multiple programming languages can thus stimulate the
generation of more sophisticated test inputs and discovering injection
vulnerabilities of the WAF that are otherwise difficult to find. To this end,
in DaNuoYi, we train several injection translation models by using multi-task
learning that translates the test inputs between any pair of injection attacks.
The model is then used by a novel multi-task evolutionary algorithm to
co-evolve test inputs for different types of injection attacks facilitated by a
shared mating pool and domain-specific mutation operators at each generation.
We conduct experiments on three real-world open-source WAFs and six types of
injection attacks, the results reveal that DaNuoYi generates up to 3.8x and
5.78x more valid test inputs (i.e., bypassing the underlying WAF) than its
state-of-the-art single-task counterparts and the context-free grammar-based
injection construction.

view of the strong interdependencies between these parameters, evaluating their
influence on the performance is not a trivial task. In this work we present an
experimentally validated 3D-resolved electrochemical model of a NMC111-based
electrode which reveals how slurry formulation and calendering degree affect
the electrode performance. A series of electrodes with different formulations
and calendering degrees were fabricated at the experimental level.
Corresponding three-dimensional manufacturing models were built based on the
same experimental manufacturing parameters to generate the digital counterparts
of the experimental electrodes that were then used in the electrochemical
model. The results of simulations and experiments were compared individually.
Among the manufacturing parameters analyzed, we found that the major factors
linking manufacturing parameters and electrode performance are the carbon and
binder domain (CBD) distribution within the electrode volume, and the
electrostatic potential difference between the electrode and the current
collector. A well-connected electronic conductive network throughout the
electrode is vital for ensuring full utilization of active material, and it was
found that increasing calendering degree is effective in reducing interfacial
impedance. This work uncovers, based on a dual modeling/experimental approach,
the essence of how electrode manufacturing process takes effect on electrode
performance by influencing its microstructure.

variability parameters, period and amplitude, were derived from model fits to

720 558 LPV candidates, including 392 240 stars with published periods (ranging
from 35 to1000 days) and 546 468 stars classified as C-stars candidates.
Comparison with literature data (OGLE and ASAS-SN) leads to an estimated 80% of
completeness. The recovery rate is about 90% for the most regular stars
(typically Miras) and 60% for semi-regular and irregular ones. At the same
time, the number of known LPVs is increased by a large factor with respect to
the literature data, especially in crowded regions, and the contamination is
estimated to be below two percents. Our C-star classification, based on solid
theoretical arguments, is consistent with spectroscopically identified C stars
in the literature. Caution must however be taken if the S/N ratio is small, in
crowded regions or if the source is reddened by some kind of extinction. The
quality and potential of the catalogue are illustrated by presenting and
discussing LPVs in the solar neighbourhood, in globular clusters and in
galaxies of the Local Group. This is the largest all-sky catalogue of LPVs to

entanglement classes and implement it on an NMR quantum processor. The protocol
is designed in such a way that the experiments performed to classify the states
can also measure the amount of entanglement present in the state. The
classification requires the experimental reconstruction of the correlation
matrices using 13 operators. The rank of the correlation matrices provide the
criteria to classify the state in one of the five classes, namely, separable,
biseparable (of three types), and genuinely entangled (of two types, GHZ and
W). To quantify the entanglement, a concurrence function is defined which
measures the global entanglement present in the state, using the same 13
operators. Global entanglement is zero for separable states and non-zero
otherwise. We demonstrate the efficacy of the protocol by implementing it on
states chosen from each of the six inequivalent (under stochastic local
operations and classical communication) classes for three qubits. We also
implement the protocol on states picked at random from the state space of
three-qubit pure states.

explaining such phenomena are rooted in the concept of a moving quasiparticle's
Berry phase, driven by a chiral (left- or right-handed) spin-habit. Dynamical
and nearly random spin fluctuations, with a slight bent towards left- or
right-handed chirality, represent a promising route to realizing Berry-phase

crystal lattice geometry on the resulting macroscopic observables. Here, we
report thermoelectric and electric transport experiments on two metals with
large magnetic moments on a triangular and on a slightly distorted kagom\'e

strongly enhanced for the kagom\'e lattice. Both these spiral magnets have
similar magnetic phase diagrams including a periodic array of magnetic
skyrmions. However, our modelling shows that the geometry of the kagom\'e
lattice, with corner-sharing spin-trimers, helps to avoid cancellation of
Berry-phase contributions; spin fluctuations are endowed with a net chiral
habit already in the thermally disordered (paramagnetic) state. Hence, our
observations for the kagom\,e material contrast with theoretical models
treating magnetization as a continuous field, and emphasize the role of lattice
geometry on emergent electrodynamic phenomena.

over the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in the
literature to understand if these black holes could have originated in the
early universe. If the primordial scalar power over small scales is boosted
considerably when compared to the COBE normalized amplitude over large scales,
then, such an increased power can lead to a copious production of primordial
black holes that can constitute a significant fraction of the cold dark matter
density today. Recently, many models of inflation involving single or two
scalar fields have been constructed which lead to enhanced power on small
scales. In this work, we examine the evolution of the quantum state of the
curvature perturbations in such single and two field models of inflation using
measures of squeezing, entanglement entropy or quantum discord. We find that,
in the single as well as the two field models, the extent of squeezing of the
modes is enhanced to a certain extent (when compared to the scenarios involving
only slow roll) over modes which exhibit increased scalar power. Moreover, we
show that, in the two field models, the entanglement entropy associated with
the curvature perturbation, arrived at when the isocurvature perturbation has
been traced out, is also enhanced over the small scales. We also take the
opportunity to discuss the relation between entanglement entropy and quantum
discord in the case of the two field model. We conclude with a brief discussion

parallelise it on the GPU, addressing (1) by applying Z-order space-filling

to align image-level and instance-level shifts to eventually minimize the
domain discrepancy, but they may align single-class features to mixed-class
features in image-level domain adaptation because each image in the object
detection task may be more than one class and object. In order to achieve
single-class with single-class alignment and mixed-class with mixed-class
alignment, we treat the mixed-class of the feature as a new class and propose a
mixed-classes $H-divergence$ for object detection to achieve homogenous feature
alignment and reduce negative transfer. Then, a Semantic Consistency Feature

previous authors on much smaller $R'_{\rm HK}$ datasets. The highest stellar
activity regime is associated with PMS stars and RS CVn systems, in which
activity is enhanced by tidal interaction. Some evidence of a bimodal

defines the two other regimes, without a clear gap in between. Stars with 3500

model of differential privacy (DP), which enables to guarantee privacy without
a trustworthy server. Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on
achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are
randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves
($\epsilon,\delta$) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additional
additive $O\!\left(\!\frac{K\log T\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$
cost in $T$-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost for
achieving a stronger ($\epsilon,0$) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used
central trust model is only $\Theta\!\left(\!\frac{K\log
T}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$, where, however, a trusted server is required. In this
work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while
sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this
by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination,
where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete
Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our
algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol,
ensures \emph{R\'{e}nyi differential privacy} -- a stronger notion than
approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of
$O\!\left(\!\frac{K\sqrt{\log T}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$.

the quotient $\Delta\gamma/v_2$ with the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ for
$p$+Au, $d$+Au, $p$+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions, scale as $1/{\rm N_{ch}}$
consistent with background-driven charge separation. By contrast, the
$\Delta\gamma/v_2$ values for Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, and Au+Au collisions show scaling
violations consistent with the presence of background plus a CME-driven

mid-central collisions, the fraction of the measured $\Delta\gamma/v_2$
attributable to the CME is approximately 27\% for Au+Au and roughly a factor of
two smaller for Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr, which show similar magnitudes.

using the occasional coupling scheme that implies the intermittent interaction
among the oscillators. An enhancement of amplitude death regions (i.e., an
increment of the width of the amplitude death regions along the control
parameter axis) can be possible using the occasional coupling in a pair of
delay-coupled oscillators. Our study starts with coupled limit cycle
oscillators (Stuart-Landau) and coupled chaotic oscillators (R\""ossler). We
further examine coupled horizontal Rijke tubes, a prototypical model of
thermoacoustic systems. Oscillatory states are highly detrimental to
thermoacoustic systems such as combustors. Consequently, a state of amplitude
death is always preferred. We employ the on-off coupling (i.e., a square wave
function), as an occasional coupling scheme, to these coupled oscillators. On
monotonically varying the coupling strength (as a control parameter), we
observe an enhancement of amplitude death regions using the occasional coupling
scheme compared to the continuous coupling scheme. In order to study the
contribution of the occasional coupling scheme, we perform a detailed linear
stability analysis and analytically explain this enhancement of the amplitude
death region for coupled limit cycle oscillators. We also adopt the frequency
ratio of the oscillators and the time delay between the oscillators as the
control parameters. Intriguingly, we obtain a similar enhancement of the
amplitude death regions using frequency ratio and time delay as the control
parameters in the presence of the occasional coupling. Finally, we use a
half-wave rectified sinusoidal wave function (motivated by practical reality)
to introduce the occasional coupling in time-delay coupled oscillators and get
similar results.

(FSI), focusing on biomechanical modeling, geometric modeling, and solver
technology. The biomechanical model is constructed based on the unified
continuum formulation. We highlight that the chosen time integration scheme
differs from existing implicit FSI integration methods in that it is indeed
second-order accurate, does not suffer from the overshoot phenomenon, and
optimally dissipates high-frequency modes in both subproblems. We propose a
pipeline for generating subject-specific meshes for FSI analysis for
anatomically realistic geometric modeling. Unlike most existing methodologies
that operate directly on the wall surface mesh, our pipeline starts from the
image segmentation stage. With high-quality surface meshes obtained, the
volumetric meshes are then generated, guaranteeing a boundary-layered mesh in
the fluid subdomain and a matching mesh across the fluid-solid interface. In
the last, we propose a combined suite of nonlinear and linear solver
technologies. Invoking a segregated algorithm within the Newton-Raphson
iteration, the problem reduces to solving two linear systems in the
multi-corrector stage. The first linear system can be addressed by the
algebraic multigrid (AMG) method. The matrix related to the balance equations
presents a two-by-two block structure in both subproblems. Using the Schur
complement reduction (SCR) technique reduces the problem to solving matrices of
smaller sizes of the elliptic type, and the AMG method again becomes a natural
candidate. The benefit of the unified formulation is demonstrated in
parallelizing the solution algorithms as the number of unknowns matches in both
subdomains. We use the Greenshields-Weller benchmark as well as a
patient-specific vascular model to demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and
scalability of the overall FSI solver technology.

theoretical singular behavior of the near-tip stress and strain fields, the
standard PINNs formulation is enriched here by including the crack-tip
asymptotic functions such that the singular solutions at the crack-tip region
can be modeled accurately without a high degree of nodal refinement. The
learnable parameters of the enriched PINNs are trained to satisfy the governing
equations of the cracked body and the corresponding boundary conditions. It was
found that the incorporation of the crack-tip enrichment functions in PINNs is
substantially simpler and more trouble-free than in the finite element (FEM) or
boundary element (BEM) methods. The present algorithm is tested on a class of
representative benchmarks with different modes of loading types. Results show

of the calculation of the scattering amplitudes, where the infinities of the

progressive calculation of the higher-order perturbative terms. The
mathematical structure of the mass term from quantum field theories expressed
in the form of infinities suggests that there exists a finite dynamical mass in
the limit when the input mass parameter approaches zero. The Lagrangian
recovers symmetry at the same time as the input mass becomes zero, whereas the
self-energy diagrams acquire a finite dynamical mass of the quantum fields in
the 4-dimensional space when the dimensional regularization method of
renormalization is utilized. The complex forms of the QCD and QED interaction
potentials are obtained by replacing the fixed mass and coupling constants in
the Yukawa potential with the scale-dependent running coupling constant and the
corresponding dynamical mass. The derived QCD potential predicts quark
