field theory coupled to gravity. Recently, multi-solitonic configurations
interpreted as static chains of multiple Boson Stars bound by gravity and
carrying no angular momentum were reported. We propose to generalize those
solutions to the stationary case by constructing chains of rotating Boson Stars
and analyze their properties. The non-linear elliptic field equations are
solved using the finite element method. We find that chains with an even number
of constituents exhibit the same spiral-like frequency dependence of their
mass, angular momentum and Noether charge as single Boson Stars. In contrast,
sequences of chains with an odd number of constituents show nontrivial loops
starting and ending at the flat vacuum. As a consequence, such solutions cannot
be uniquely parametrized by a single parameter. We conjecture that all rotating
chains correspond to excitations of single Boson Stars or pairs of them. We
also analyze their flat space limit and find that they reduce to chains of
$Q$-balls.

wing unmanned aerial vehicle. First, a set of optimal trajectories are computed
off-line based on a geometric formulation of dynamics that captures the
nonlinear coupling between the large angle flapping motion and the quasi-steady
aerodynamics. Then, it is transformed into a feedback control system according
to the framework of imitation learning. In particular, an additional constraint
is incorporated through the learning process to enhance the stability
properties of the resulting controlled dynamics. Compared with conventional
methods, the proposed constrained imitation learning eliminates the need to
generate additional optimal trajectories on-line, without sacrificing
stability. As such, the computational efficiency is substantially improved.
Furthermore, this establishes the first nonlinear control system that
stabilizes the coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics of flapping wing
aerial vehicle without relying on averaging or linearization. These are
illustrated by numerical examples for a simulated model inspired by Monarch
butterflies.

shaped closed ends with the `tube-arrest' method and observe bubbles generated
at these two locations. For the bubbles generated at the close end of the tube,
we propose the onset criteria, consisting of two universal non-dimensional

The results indicate that the larger the conical angle, the faster the bubbles
collapse. For the bubbles generated in the bulk liquid, we numerically study
the collapse time, the jet characteristics and the pressure pulse at bubble

occurrence of transiting young planets will require a larger sample unbiased to

virtual two-dimensional planar array with a much larger number of elements,
leading to an increase in the fully augmentable range of the array. The
difference co-array of the proposed rectangular array gives a contiguous dense
structure which leads to a reduction in holes within the planar array as
compared to the traditional methods of CPA geometry in which there are many
holes present in the outer dimension of the array structure as well as within
the array as well. Moreover, we know that the angular resolution of an array is
highly dependent on its beamwidth which itself is inversely proportional to
array size or effective array aperture. Hence by increasing the array dimension
a higher resolution can be achieved. The proposed arrays provide a higher DOF
for the given number of physical sensors. Optimization is performed on the
proposed geometry to maximize the directivity in the array steering look-up

the mutual information between a random graph and a stochastic process evolving

  Normalization","11 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables. Accepted at KDD 2022 (ADS Track)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Curbing online hate speech has become the need of the hour; however, a
blanket ban on such activities is infeasible for several geopolitical and
cultural reasons. To reduce the severity of the problem, in this paper, we
introduce a novel task, hate speech normalization, that aims to weaken the
intensity of hatred exhibited by an online post. The intention of hate speech
normalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a
stepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to
monitor any improvement in the user's behavior.
  To this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their
normalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We
introduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that
operates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the
original sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally,
it reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans. We perform extensive
experiments to measure the efficacy of NACL via three-way evaluation
(intrinsic, extrinsic, and human-study). We observe that NACL outperforms six
baselines - NACL yields a score of 0.1365 RMSE for the intensity prediction,
0.622 F1-score in the span identification, and 82.27 BLEU and 80.05 perplexity
for the normalized text generation. We further show the generalizability of
NACL across other platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Gab). An interactive prototype
of NACL was put together for the user study. Further, the tool is being
deployed in a real-world setting at Wipro AI as a part of its mission to tackle
harmful content on online platforms.

In particular, we analyze sample-dependent and sample-independent semantic

semantic noise appears frequently, and design the masked vector
quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with the noise-related masking
strategy. We use a discrete codebook shared by the transmitter and the receiver

we develop a feature importance module (FIM) to suppress the noise-related and
task-unrelated features. Thus, the transmitter simply needs to transmit the
indices of these important task-related features in the codebook. Simulation
results show that the proposed method can be applied in many downstream tasks
and significantly improve the robustness against semantic noise with remarkable
reduction on the transmission overhead.

the consolidated parameters in the semantic memory. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to employ dual memory experience replay in
conjunction with synaptic consolidation that is suitable for general CL whereby
the network does not utilize task boundaries or task labels during training or

multi-frequency atomic force microscopy (AFM) is crucial for studying the
performance of polymers, ultra-thin coatings, and biological systems. Such
characterization processes often make use of cantilever's spectral components
to discern nanomechanical properties within a multi-parameter optimization
problem. This could inadvertently lead to an over-determined parameter
estimation with no clear relation between the identified parameters and their
influence on the experimental data. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of
viscoelastic characterization in polymeric samples to the experimental
observables of multi-frequency intermodulation AFM. By performing simulations
and experiments we show that surface viscoelasticity has negligible effect on
the experimental data and can lead to inconsistent and often non-physical
identified parameters. Our analysis reveals that this lack of influence of the
surface parameters relates to a vanishing gradient and non-convexity while
minimizing the objective function. By removing the surface dependency from the
model, we show that the characterization of bulk properties can be achieved
with ease and without any ambiguity. Our work sheds light on the sensitivity
issues that can be faced when optimizing for a large number of parameters and
observables in AFM operation, and calls for the development of new viscoelastic
models at the nanoscale and improved computational methodologies for nanoscale
mapping of viscoelasticity using AFM.

systems may be the ideal solution to implement such a distributed-transistor
response. To this end, using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach, we
characterize the optical conductivity of a two-dimensional material under a
static electric bias. It is found that similar to the nonlinear Hall effect,
the electron transport depends on the Berry curvature dipole. Our analysis
reveals that the electro-optic effect modifies the optical conductivity of the
material, breaking the electromagnetic reciprocity and yielding a dynamical
response that imitates that of a transistor but in a distributed volume.
Furthermore, the effective conductivity tensor can be non-Hermitian, opening
the possibility of optical gain. To maximize the non-Hermitian response, we
explore the specific case of strained twisted bilayer graphene. Our analysis
reveals that the optical gain for incident light transmitted through the biased
system depends on the light polarization, and can be quite large, especially

provide quantum interfaces between microwave and optical photons. Such
applications benefit from a high cooperativity between the spin ensemble and a
microwave cavity -- this motivates an increase in the rare earth ion
concentration which in turn impacts the spin coherence lifetime. We measure
spin dynamics of two rare-earth spin species, $^{145}$Nd and Yb doped into
Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$, coupled to a planar microwave resonator in the high
cooperativity regime, in the temperature range 1.2 K to 14 mK. We identify
relevant decoherence mechanisms including instantaneous diffusion arising from
resonant spins and temperature-dependent spectral diffusion from impurity
electron and nuclear spins in the environment. We explore two methods to
mitigate the effects of spectral diffusion in the Yb system in the
low-temperature limit, first, using magnetic fields of up to 1 T to suppress
impurity spin dynamics and, second, using transitions with low effective
g-factors to reduce sensitivity to such dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how
the `clock transition' present in the $^{171}$Yb system at zero field can be
used to increase coherence times up to $T_{2} = 6(1)$ ms.

great successes. However, unsupervised learning point clouds in outdoor scenes
remains challenging because previous methods need to reconstruct the whole
scene and capture partial views for the contrastive objective. This is
infeasible in outdoor scenes with moving objects, obstacles, and sensors. In
this paper, we propose CO^3, namely Cooperative Contrastive Learning and
Contextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point
clouds in an unsupervised manner. CO^3 has several merits compared to existing
methods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and
infrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain
common semantic information for contrastive learning, which are more
appropriate than views built by previous methods. (2) Alongside the contrastive
objective, shape context prediction is proposed as pre-training goal and brings
more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation
learning, which are beneficial when transferring the learned representation to
downstream detection tasks. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation
learned by CO^3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset
collected by different type of LiDAR sensors. (4) CO^3 improves current
state-of-the-art methods on both Once and KITTI datasets by up to 2.58 mAP.
Codes and models will be released. We believe CO^3 will facilitate
understanding LiDAR point clouds in outdoor scene.

  Synthesis",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising
class of generative models. The key idea is to produce high-quality images by
recurrently adding Gaussian noises and gradients to a Gaussian sample until
converging to the target distribution, a.k.a. the diffusion sampling. To ensure
stability of convergence in sampling and generation quality, however, this
sequential sampling process has to take a small step size and many sampling
iterations (e.g., 2000). Several acceleration methods have been proposed with
focus on low-resolution generation. In this work, we consider the acceleration
of high-resolution generation with SGMs, a more challenging yet more important
problem. We prove theoretically that this slow convergence drawback is
primarily due to the ignorance of the target distribution. Further, we
introduce a novel Target Distribution Aware Sampling (TDAS) method by
leveraging the structural priors in space and frequency domains. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN, and FFHQ datasets validate that TDAS can
consistently accelerate state-of-the-art SGMs, particularly on more challenging
high resolution (1024x1024) image generation tasks by up to 18.4x, whilst
largely maintaining the synthesis quality. With fewer sampling iterations, TDAS
can still generate good quality images. In contrast, the existing methods
degrade drastically or even fails completely

constant step-size in the high-dimensional regime. We prove limit theorems for
the trajectories of summary statistics (i.e., finite-dimensional functions) of
SGD as the dimension goes to infinity. Our approach allows one to choose the
summary statistics that are tracked, the initialization, and the step-size. It
yields both ballistic (ODE) and diffusive (SDE) limits, with the limit
depending dramatically on the former choices. We show a critical scaling regime
for the step-size, below which the effective ballistic dynamics matches
gradient flow for the population loss, but at which, a new correction term
appears which changes the phase diagram. About the fixed points of this
effective dynamics, the corresponding diffusive limits can be quite complex and
even degenerate. We demonstrate our approach on popular examples including
estimation for spiked matrix and tensor models and classification via two-layer
networks for binary and XOR-type Gaussian mixture models. These examples
exhibit surprising phenomena including multimodal timescales to convergence as
well as convergence to sub-optimal solutions with probability bounded away from
zero from random (e.g., Gaussian) initializations. At the same time, we
demonstrate the benefit of overparametrization by showing that the latter

coupled-resonator system with an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) and a
small instability. The oscillator with the exceptional degeneracy is realized
by using two coupled resonators with an almost balanced small-signal gain and
loss, that saturates due to nonlinear effects of the active component,
resulting in an oscillation frequency that is very sensitive to a perturbation
of the circuit. Two cases are investigated, with two parallel LC resonators
with balanced small-signal gain and loss that are either coupled wirelessly by
mutual inductance or coupled-wired by a capacitor. This paper demonstrates
theoretically and experimentally the conditions to obtain a second-order EPD
oscillator and analyzes the ultrasensitivity of the oscillation frequency to
components' perturbation, including the case of asymmetric perturbation that
breaks PT-symmetry. We discuss the effects of nonlinearity on the performance
of the oscillator and how the proposed scheme improves the sensing's
sensitivity of perturbations. In contrast to previous methods, our proposed
degenerate oscillator can sense positive or negative changes of a circuit
component. The degenerate oscillator circuit may find applications in various
areas such as ultrasensitive sensors, tunable oscillators and modulators.

not be in compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. In this paper,
we focus on research in natural language processing to investigate the

multiple roles and provide many sorts of information; and (2) compared to the
life sciences and social sciences, ML research tends to embrace a dynamic
workflow, where research questions are seldom stated ex ante and data sharing
opens the door for future studies to ask questions about different targets from
the original study. In particular, our analysis exposes a potential loophole in

in horizontal rows and vertical columns identifiable by name, can cover a wide
range of NLP tasks. Following this constatation, we propose a framework for
text-to-table neural models applicable to problems such as extraction of line
items, joint entity and relation extraction, or knowledge base population. The
permutation-based decoder of our proposal is a generalized sequential method
that comprehends information from all cells in the table. The training
maximizes the expected log-likelihood for a table's content across all random
permutations of the factorization order. During the content inference, we
exploit the model's ability to generate cells in any order by searching over
possible orderings to maximize the model's confidence and avoid substantial
error accumulation, which other sequential models are prone to. Experiments
demonstrate a high practical value of the framework, which establishes
state-of-the-art results on several challenging datasets, outperforming
previous solutions by up to 15%.

Domain generalization (DG) aims to close this gap, with existing DG methods
mainly focusing on the loss function design. In this paper, we propose to
explore an orthogonal direction, i.e., the design of the backbone architecture.
It is motivated by an empirical finding that transformer-based models trained
with empirical risk minimization (ERM) outperform CNN-based models employing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG algorithms on multiple DG datasets. We develop a
formal framework to characterize a network's robustness to distribution shifts
by studying its architecture's alignment with the correlations in the dataset.
This analysis guides us to propose a novel DG model built upon vision
transformers, namely Generalizable Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE). Extensive
experiments on DomainBed demonstrate that GMoE trained with ERM outperforms
SOTA DG baselines by a large margin. Moreover, GMoE is complementary to
existing DG methods and its performance is substantially improved when trained
with DG algorithms.

Observations by the $R$-Process Alliance (RPA) and others have confirmed that
many RPE stars are associated with chemo-dynamically tagged groups, which
likely came from accreted dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). However, we do
not know how RPE stars are formed. Here, we present the result of a
cosmological zoom-in simulation of an MW-like galaxy with $r$-process
enrichment, performed with the highest resolution in both time and mass. Thanks
to this advancement, unlike previous simulations, we find that most highly RPE
($r$-II; [Eu/Fe] $> +0.7$) stars are formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that
have been enriched in $r$-process elements for [Fe/H] $\,<-2.5$, while those
with higher metallicity are formed in situ, in locally enhanced gas clumps that
were not necessarily members of dwarf galaxies. This result suggests that
low-mass accreted dwarf galaxies are the main formation site of $r$-II stars
with [Fe/H] $\,<-2.5$. We also find that most low-metallicity $r$-II stars
exhibit halo-like kinematics. Some $r$-II stars formed in the same halo show
low dispersions in [Fe/H] and somewhat larger dispersions of [Eu/Fe], similar
to the observations. The fraction of simulated $r$-II stars is commensurate
with observations from the RPA, and the distribution of the predicted [Eu/Fe]
for halo $r$-II stars matches that observed. These results demonstrate that RPE
stars can be valuable probes of the accretion of dwarf galaxies in the early
stages of their formation.

\Vert\phi\Vert)$, where $\lambda$ is order-one in Planck units. While the
evidence for this conjecture is formidable, there is at present no consensus on
which values of $\lambda$ are allowed. In this paper, we propose a sharp lower
bound for the lightest tower in a given infinite-distance limit in $d$
dimensions: $\lambda \geq 1/\sqrt{d-2}$. In support of this proposal, we show
that (1) it is exactly preserved under dimensional reduction, (2) it is
saturated in many examples of string/M-theory compactifications, including
maximal supergravity in $d= \text{4 - 10}$ dimensions, and (3) it is saturated
in many examples of minimal supergravity in $d= \text{4 - 10}$ dimensions,
assuming appropriate versions of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. We argue that
towers with $\lambda < 1/\sqrt{d-2}$ discussed previously in the literature are
always accompanied by even lighter towers with $\lambda \geq 1/\sqrt{d-2}$,
thereby satisfying our proposed bound. We discuss connections with and
implications for the Emergent String Conjecture, the Scalar Weak Gravity
Conjecture, the Repulsive Force Conjecture, large-field inflation, and scalar
field potentials in quantum gravity. In particular, we argue that if our

fitting. When the functional form of such a model can not be deduced from first
principles, one has to make a choice between different possible models. A
common approach in such cases is to minimise the information loss in the model
by trying to reduce the number of fit variables (or the model flexibility,
respectively) as much as possible while still yielding an acceptable fit to the
data. Model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) provides such
an implementation of Occam's razor. We argue that the same principles can be
applied to optimise the penalty-strength of a penalised maximum-likelihood
model. However, while in typical applications AIC is used to choose from a
finite, discrete set of maximum-likelihood models the penalty optimisation
requires to select out of a continuum of candidate models and these models
violate the maximum-likelihood condition. We derive a generalised information
criterion AICp that encompasses this case. It naturally involves the concept of
effective free parameters which is very flexible and can be applied to any
model, be it linear or non-linear, parametric or non-parametric, and with or
without constraint equations on the parameters. We show that the generalised
AICp allows an optimisation of any penalty-strength without the need of
separate Monte-Carlo simulations. As an example application, we discuss the
optimisation of the smoothing in non-parametric models which has many
applications in astrophysics, like in dynamical modeling, spectral fitting or
gravitational lensing.

resolution narrowband imaging in $\rm H\alpha$, [S II] and [O III] light. The
object exhibits two major and distinct filamentary emission structures in a
partial shell-like formation. The optical filaments are found in excellent
positional match with available X-ray, radio and UV maps, can be traced over a
relatively long angular distance (38' and 70') and appear unaffected by any
strong interactions with the ambient interstellar medium. We also present a
flux-calibrated, optical emission spectrum from a single location, with Balmer
and several forbidden lines detected, indicative of emission from shock
excitation in a typical evolved SNR. Confirmation of the most likely SNR nature
of G 116.6-26.1 is provided from the observed value of the line ratio $\rm [S\,

range $70-100\, km\, s^{-1}$ at the spectroscopically examined filament, which,
when combined with the low emissivity in $\rm H\alpha$ and other emission

Spectrograph (OSIRIS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory is a lenslet-based IFS that
requires precise methods to associate the flux on the detector with both a
wavelength and a position on the detector. During calibration scans, a single
column lenslet mask is utilized to keep light from adjacent lenslet columns
separate from the primary lenslet column, in order to uniquely determine
spectral response of individual lenslets on the detector. Despite employing a
single column lenslet mask, an issue associated with such calibration schemes
may occur when light from adjacent masked lenslet columns leaks into the
primary lenslet column. Incorrectly characterizing the flux due to additional
light in the primary lenslet column results in one form of crosstalk between
lenslet columns, which most clearly manifest as non-physical artifacts in the
spectral dimension of the reduced data. We treat the problem of potentially
blended calibration scans as a source separation problem and implement
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a way to separate blended
calibration scan spectra. After applying NMF to calibration scan data,
extracted spectra from calibration scans show reduced crosstalk of up to
26.7$\pm$0.5$\%$ while not adversely impacting the signal-to-noise ratio.
Additionally, we determined the optimal number of calibration scans per lenslet
column needed to create NMF factors, finding that greatest reduction crosstalk
occurs when NMF factors are created using one calibration scan per lenslet
column.

drastic change in the accretion rate of the existing active galactic nucleus

observations, short-timescale stochastic variability is seen, consistent with
an AGN. We are able to fit the TESS light curve with a damped-random-walk (DRW)
model and recover a rest-frame variability amplitude of $\hat{\sigma} = 0.93
\pm 0.02$ mJy and a rest-frame timescale of $\tau_{DRW} = 20^{+15}_{-6}$ days.
We find that the estimated $\tau_{DRW}$ for ASASSN-18el is broadly consistent
with an apparent relationship between the DRW timescale and central
supermassive black hole mass. The large-amplitude stochastic variability of
ASASSN-18el, particularly during late stages of the flare, suggests that the

common pair of two other order parameters that would complete them to the
maximal set of compatible (anticommuting) orders of five. We first derive a
unitary transformation in the Nambu (particle-hole) space which maps any two
such triplets, possibly containing some superconducting orders, onto purely
insulating order parameters. This allows one to consider a universal SO(4)
Gross-Neveu-Yukawa description of the multicriticality without any Nambu

with fermions decoupled there is a stable fixed point of the flow, the Yukawa
coupling to fermions quickly leads to its elimination by a generic fixed-point
collision in the relevant range of fermion flavor numbers $N_f$. This suggests
the replacement of the critical behavior by a runaway flow in the physical case
$n_a=n_b=3$. The structure of the RG flow at $n_a\neq n_b$ is also discussed,
and some non-perturbative arguments in favor of the stability of the decoupled
critical point when $n_a=3$ and $n_b=1$ in $D=2+1$ are provided.

coupling quantum matter to the theory. In the past, several ways of coupling
matter to spin foam quantum gravity have been proposed, but the dynamics of the
coupled matter-gravity system is challenging to explore. To take first steps
towards uncovering the influence quantum matter has on spin foam models, we
couple free, massive scalar lattice field theory to a restricted,
semi-classical 4d spin foam model, called quantum cuboids. This model can be
understood as a superposition of hypercuboidal (and thus irregular) lattices.
Both theories are coupled by defining scalar lattice field theory on irregular
lattices via discrete exterior calculus and then superimposing these theories
by summing over spin foam configurations. We compute expectation values of
geometric and matter observables using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.
From the observables, we identify a regime in parameter space, in which the
spin foam possesses a finite total volume and looks on average like a regular
lattice with an emergent lattice spacing dependent on the mass of the scalar
field. We also measure the 2-point correlation function and correlation length
of the scalar field in relation to the geodesic distance encoded in the spin
foam. Our results are consistent with the correlation function of ordinary
scalar lattice field theory defined on a fixed regular lattice with the
emergent lattice spacing and the same mass. We conclude that in this regime of
the model, the scalar field is not sensitive to the fluctuations of the spin
foam and effectively behaves as if it is defined on a fixed regular lattice.

parametrically heavier than the standard one. Within this picture the Standard
Model quarks are embedded into a larger non-abelian Grand Color group that at

value of the axion is automatically relaxed to zero because the only
renormalizable source of explicit CP violation, beyond those encoded in the
topological angles, is contained in the Standard Model Yukawa couplings, and is
therefore very suppressed. The axion potential is controlled by the scale of
the new confining group and is much larger than the QCD contribution, such that
its dynamics is less exposed to the so-called ""axion quality problem"".
Potentially observable corrections to the effective topological angle can also
arise, in our model as well as in a large class of heavy axion scenarios, from
non-renormalizable Peccei-Quinn-conserving interactions, which introduce a new
""heavy axion quality problem"". Our model has a very minimal field content, it
relies entirely on gauge invariance and does not require the introduction of
additional symmetries beyond the usual one postulated by Peccei and Quinn. The
phenomenology is very rich and can be tested at colliders as well as via
cosmological observations. A particularly interesting portion of parameter
space predicts a visible axion of mass above the GeV and decay constant larger

the fractions and properties of CEMP stars in different Galactic environments
can provide us with unique insights into the formation and evolution of the
Milky Way halo and its building blocks. In this work, we investigate whether
directly comparing fractions of CEMP stars from different literature samples of
very metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.0) stars is valid. We compiled published CEMP
fractions and samples of Galactic halo stars from the past 25 years, and find
that they are not all consistent with each other. Focusing on giant stars, we
find significant differences between various surveys when comparing their
trends of [Fe/H] versus [C/Fe] and their distributions of CEMP stars. To test
the role of the analysis pipelines for low-resolution spectroscopic samples, we
re-analysed giant stars from various surveys with the SSPP and FERRE pipelines.
We found systematic differences in [C/Fe] of ~0.1-0.4 dex, partly independent
of degeneracies with the stellar atmospheric parameters. These systematics are
likely due to the different pipeline approaches, different assumptions in the
employed synthetic grids, and/or the comparison of different evolutionary
phases. We conclude that current biases in (the analysis of) very metal-poor
samples limit the conclusions one can draw from comparing different surveys. We
provide some recommendations and suggestions that will hopefully aid the

this paper, we continue to explore the idea of a cosmic ray Eddington limit by
introducing a general framework that accounts for the circumgalactic
environment and applying it to five galaxies that we believe to be a good
representative sample of the star forming galaxy population, using different
cosmic ray transport models to determine what gives each galaxy the best chance
to reach this limit. We show that while an Eddington limit for cosmic rays does
exist, for our five galaxies, the limit either falls at star formation rates
that are much larger or gas densities that are much lower than each galaxy's
measured values. This suggests that cosmic ray pressure is not the main factor
limiting the luminosity of starburst galaxies.

Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) acquired multi-band photometry of 92
TNOs, and found that the surfaces of TNOs can be well described by two surface
classifications, BrightIR and FaintIR. These classifications both include
optically red members and are differentiated predominantly based on whether
their near-infrared spectral slope is similar to their optical spectral slope.
The vast majority of cold classical TNOs, with dynamically unexcited orbits,
have the FaintIR surface classification, and we infer that TNOs in other
dynamical classifications with FaintIR surfaces share a common origin with the
cold classical TNOs. Comparison between the resonant populations and the
possible parent populations of cold classical and dynamically excited TNOs
reveal that the 3:2 has minimal contributions from the FaintIR class,
consistent with the $\nu_8$ secular resonance clearing the region near the 3:2
before any sweeping capture occurred. Conversely, the FaintIR class is
over-represented in the 4:3 resonance, 2:1 resonance, and the resonances within
the cold classical belt, implying that the FaintIR surface formed in the
protoplanetary disk between ~<34.6 au to ~>47 au, though the outer bound
depends on the degree of resonance sweeping during migration. The presence and
absence of the FaintIR surfaces in Neptune's resonances provides critical
constraints for the history of Neptune's migration, the evolution of the

compilations of such objects (~120,000 candidates in the Galactic midplane).
Many SPICY candidates are spatially clustered, but, perhaps surprisingly,
approximately half the candidates appear spatially distributed. To better
characterize this unexpected population and confirm its nature, we obtained
Palomar/DBSP spectroscopy for 26 of the optically-bright (G<15 mag) ""isolated""

their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, H and Ca II line-emission
from over half the sample, and robust detection of infrared excesses. This
implies a contamination rate of <10% for SPICY stars that meet our optical
selection criteria. Spectral types range from B4 to K3, with A-type stars most
common. Spectral energy distributions, diffuse interstellar bands, and Galactic
extinction maps indicate moderate to high extinction. Stellar masses range from
~1 to 7 $M_\odot$, and the estimated accretion rates, ranging from
$3\times10^{-8}$ to $3\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, are typical for YSOs
in this mass range. The 3D spatial distribution of these stars, based on Gaia
astrometry, reveals that the ""isolated"" YSOs are not evenly distributed in the
Solar neighborhood but are concentrated in kpc-scale dusty Galactic structures
that also contain the majority of the SPICY YSO clusters. Thus, the processes
that produce large Galactic star-forming structures may yield nearly as many

W0116-0505 as having excess rest-frame optical/UV emission, and concluded this
excess emission is most likely scattered light from the heavily obscured AGN.
We find that the broad-band rest-frame UV flux is strongly linearly polarized
(10.8$\pm$1.9\%, with a polarization angle of 74$\pm$9~deg), confirming this
conclusion. We analyze these observations in the context of a simple model
based on scattering either by free electrons or by optically thin dust,
assuming a classical dust torus with polar openings. Both can replicate the
degree of polarization and the luminosity of the scattered component for a
range of geometries and column densities, but we argue that optically thin dust
in the ISM is the more likely scenario. We also explore the possibility that
the scattering medium corresponds to an outflow recently identified for
W0116-0505. This is a feasible option if the outflow component is bi-conical
with most of the scattering occurring at the base of the receding outflow. In
this scenario the quasar would still be obscured even if viewed face on, but
might appear as a reddened type 1 quasar once the outflow has expanded. We
discuss a possible connection between blue-excess Hot DOGs, extremely red

the nature of that binary interaction and the secondary object is uncertain.
Recently, a double white dwarf model known as the dynamically driven
double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) model has become a promising
explanation for these events. One realization of this scenario predicts that
the companion may survive the explosion and reside within the remnant as a fast
moving ($V_{peculiar} >1000$ km s$^{-1}$), overluminous ($L > 0.1 L_\odot$)
white dwarf. Recently, three objects which appear to have these unusual
properties have been discovered in the Gaia survey. We obtained photometric
observations of the SN Ia remnant SN 1006 with the Dark Energy Camera over four
years to attempt to discover a similar star. We present a deep, high precision
astrometric proper motion survey of the interior stellar population of the
remnant. We rule out the existence of a high proper motion object consistent
with our tested realization of the D6 scenario ($V_{transverse} > 600$ km
s$^{-1}$ with $m_r < 21$ corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of $L >

named brightIR and faintIR, where the range of colors in each class is governed
by a mixture of two material end members. Here, we investigate the orbital

the orbital inclinations of the brightIR class objects are correlated with
their optical colors. Using the output of numerical simulations investigating
the orbital evolution of TNOs during their scattering phase with Neptune, we
show that this correlation could reflect a composition gradient in the early
protoplanetary disk, in the range of heliocentric distances over which TNOs
from the brightIR class accreted. However, tensions between this interpretation
and the existence of blue contaminants among cold classical TNOs, and possible
alternative origins for the detected correlation, currently bear uncertainty on
our proposed interpretation.

simulations of collective neutrino oscillations, in particular fast
neutrino-flavor conversions (FFC), require unfeasible computational resources
due to large disparity of scales between flavor conversion and astrophysical
phenomena. We propose a novel approach to tackle the issue. This paper is
devoted to describe the philosophy, design, and numerical implementation of
GRQKNT with a number of tests ensuring correct implementation of each module.
The code is based on a discrete-ordinate Sn method, finite-difference
realization of mean-field quantum kinetic equation. The transport equation is
solved based on a conservative formalism, and we use a fifth-order weighted
essentially non-oscillatory scheme with fourth-order TVD Runge-Kutta
time-integration. The transport module is designed to work with arbitrary
spacetimes and currently three different stationary spacetimes (flat spacetime,
Schwarzschild black hole, and Kerr black hole) are implemented. The collision
term including neutrino emission, absorption, and momentum-exchanged
scatterings are also implemented into our code. The oscillation Hamiltonian
consists of vacuum, matter, and self-interactions. Both two- and three
neutrino-flavor scenarios can be applied. Fluid-velocity dependences in
transport-, collision-, and oscillation modules, are also treated
self-consistently by using two-energy-grid technique, that has been already
established in our another code with full Boltzmann neutrino transport.

Recent methods propose using pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to
approximate human similarity, but pre-trained DNNs may not be available for
certain domains (e.g., medical images, low-resource languages) and their
performance in approximating human similarity has not been extensively tested.
We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains --
images, audio, video -- and found that there is a large gap in performance
between human similarity judgments and pre-trained DNNs. To address this gap,
we propose a new class of similarity approximation methods based on language.
To collect the language data required by these new methods, we also developed
and validated a novel adaptive tag collection pipeline. We find that our
proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper, in the number of
human judgments, than classical methods, but still improve performance over the
DNN-based methods. Finally, we also develop `stacked' methods that combine
language embeddings with DNN embeddings, and find that these consistently
provide the best approximations for human similarity across all three of our
modalities. Based on the results of this comprehensive study, we provide a
concise guide for researchers interested in collecting or approximating human
similarity data. To accompany this guide, we also release all of the similarity
and language data, a total of 206,339 human judgments, that we collected in our
experiments, along with a detailed breakdown of all modeling results.

combine models that are predictive in different input domains into a composite
distribution that has improved predictive power over the entire input space. We
explore the application of BMM to the mixing of two expansions of a function of
a coupling constant $g$ that are valid at small and large values of $g$
respectively. This type of problem is quite common in nuclear physics, where
physical properties are straightforwardly calculable in strong and weak
interaction limits or at low and high densities or momentum transfers, but
difficult to calculate in between. Interpolation between these limits is often
accomplished by a suitable interpolating function, e.g., Pad\'e approximants,
but it is then unclear how to quantify the uncertainty of the interpolant. We
address this problem in the simple context of the partition function of
zero-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, for which the (asymptotic) expansion at small
$g$ and the (convergent) expansion at large $g$ are both known. We consider
three mixing methods: linear mixture BMM, localized bivariate BMM, and
localized multivariate BMM with Gaussian processes. We find that employing a
Gaussian process in the intermediate region between the two predictive models
leads to the best results of the three methods. The methods and validation
strategies we present here should be generalizable to other nuclear physics

distinguishing 3D LiDAR points that belong to currently moving objects, like
walking pedestrians or driving cars, from points that are obtained from
non-moving objects, like walls but also parked cars. Our approach takes a
sequence of observed LiDAR scans and turns them into a voxelized sparse 4D
point cloud. We apply computationally efficient sparse 4D convolutions to
jointly extract spatial and temporal features and predict moving object
confidence scores for all points in the sequence. We develop a receding horizon
strategy that allows us to predict moving objects online and to refine
predictions on the go based on new observations. We use a binary Bayes filter
to recursively integrate new predictions of a scan resulting in more robust
estimation. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI moving object
segmentation challenge and show more accurate predictions than existing
methods. Since our approach only operates on the geometric information of point
clouds over time, it generalizes well to new, unseen environments, which we
evaluate on the Apollo dataset.

the temporal exceeding probability of ship responses in a random wave field,

particular, we consider large thresholds so that the response exceedance needs
to be treated as rare events. Our computational framework builds on the
parameterization of wave field into wave groups and efficient sampling in the
group parameter space through Bayesian experimental design (BED). Previous
works following this framework exclusively studied extreme statistics of
group-maximum response, i.e., the maximum response within a wave group, which
is however not straightforward to interpret in practice (e.g., its value
depends on the subjective definition of the wave group). In order to adapt the
framework to the more robust measure by the temporal exceeding probability,
novel developments need to be introduced to the two components of BED (on
surrogate model and acquisition function), which are detailed in the paper. We
validate our framework for a case of ship roll motion calculated by a nonlinear
roll equation, in terms of the agreement of our results to the true solution
and the independence of our results to the criterion of defining groups.
Finally, we demonstrate the coupling of the framework with CFD models to handle
more realistic and general ship response problems.

radiative breakout of the shock wave in the outer envelope of a red supergiant
(RSG) which has suffered core collapse and will become a Type IIP supernova.
The intrinsically 3D structure of the fully convective RSG envelope yields key
differences in the brightness and duration of the shock breakout (SBO) from
that predicted in a 1D stellar model. First, the lower-density `halo' of
material outside of the traditional photosphere in 3D models leads to a shock
breakout at lower densities than 1D models. This would prolong the duration of
the shock breakout flash at any given location on the surface to $\approx$1-2
hours. However, we find that the even larger impact is the intrinsically 3D
effect associated with large-scale fluctuations in density that cause the shock
to break out at different radii at different times. This substantially prolongs
the SBO duration to $\approx$3-6 hours and implies a diversity of radiative
temperatures, as different patches across the stellar surface are at different
stages of their radiative breakout and cooling at any given time. These
predicted durations are in better agreement with existing observations of SBO.
The longer durations lower the predicted luminosities by a factor of 3-10
($L_\mathrm{bol}\sim10^{44}\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$), and we derive the new
scalings of brightness and duration with explosion energies and stellar
properties. These intrinsically 3D properties eliminate the possibility of

appear to be increasing with time, but the reason behind the establishment of
these correlations and their subsequent evolution is still uncertain. We
conduct a theoretical analysis of the impact of viscous evolution on power-law
initial conditions for a population of protoplanetary discs. We find that, for
evolved populations, viscous evolution enforces the two correlations to have
the same slope, $\lambda_{\mathrm{m}}$ = $\lambda_{\mathrm{acc}}$, and that
this limit is uniquely determined by the initial slopes $\lambda_{\mathrm{m},
0}$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{acc}, 0}$. We recover the increasing trend claimed
from the observations when the difference in the initial values, $\delta_0 =
\lambda_{\mathrm{m}, 0} - \lambda_{\mathrm{acc}, 0}$, is larger than $1/2$;
moreover, we find that this increasing trend is a consequence of a positive
correlation between the viscous timescale and the stellar mass. We also present

pressures in excess of 100 GPa, wherein it adopts a face-centered cubic

still supports superconductivity, but with a much lower critical temperature.
Previous calculations have shown that quantum and anharmonic effects are
necessary to stabilize the cubic structure, but have not resolved the low
pressure distortion. Using large scale path-integral molecular dynamics enabled
by a machine learned potential, we show that a rhombohedral distortion appears
at sufficiently low pressures, even with quantum and anharmonic effects. We
also highlight the importance of quantum zero point motion in stabilizing the

transition are captured by observation time averaging, which effectively
suppresses the large dynamical entanglement fluctuations near the critical
point. We employ this approach to the experimentally available Bosonic
Josephson Junction. In this example the transition from a tunneling regime to
Hilbert-space localization reveals clear signatures in the entanglement entropy

quantum effects in comparison to the well-known result of the mean-field
approximation in the form of self-trapping. This indicates that quantum
fluctuations reduce the classical self-trapping. Different scaling with the
respect to the number of bosons $N$ are found in the tunneling and the
localization regime: While the entanglement entropy grows {\it logarithmically}
with $N$ in the tunneling regime, it increases {\it linearly} in the localized

such a result.
  Main Theorem. Suppose $G$ is the fundamental group of a connected reduced

each vertex group is finitely presented and either 1-ended and semistable at

distinct semantics; and (2) action extraction extracts from one document

propose a new task, key event detection at the intermediate level, aiming to
detect from a news corpus key events (e.g., ""HK Airport Protest on Aug.

inherently challenging because of the thematic and temporal closeness of key

captures document co-occurrences, semantic similarities, and temporal closeness

training a classifier with automatically generated pseudo labels from the

establish conditions under which a sample analogue estimator is asymptotically
normal and construct a consistent estimator of its corresponding asymptotic
variance. Combining these results establishes the asymptotic exactness of tests
based on these estimators. In contrast, we show that, for two common testing
procedures based on t-tests constructed from linear regressions, one test is
generally conservative while the other generally invalid. We go on to apply our
results to study the asymptotic properties of what we call ""fully-blocked"" 2^K

together, uniquely, with a CNN backbone to extract the most relevant texture

investigated for use in photon-counting CT applications. The low atomic number
of silicon leads to a significant number of incident photons being Compton
scattered in the detector, depositing a part of their energy and potentially
being counted multiple times. Although the physics of Compton scatter is well
established, the effects of Compton interactions in the detector on image
quality for an edge-on-irradiated silicon detector have still not been
thoroughly investigated.
  Purpose: To investigate and explain effects of Compton scatter on
zero-frequency DQE for photon-counting CT using edge-on-irradiated silicon
detectors.
  Methods: We extend an existing Monte Carlo model of an edge-on-irradiated
silicon detector to develop projection and image domain performance metrics for
pure density and pure spectral imaging tasks. We show that the lowest energy
threshold of the detector can be used as an effective discriminator of primary
counts and cross-talk caused by Compton scatter. We study the developed metrics
as functions of the lowest threshold energy.
  Results: Density imaging performance decreases monotonically as a function of
the lowest threshold in both projection and image domains. Spectral imaging
performance has a plateau between 0 and 10 keV and decreases monotonically
thereafter, in both projection and image domain.
  Conclusions: Compton interactions contribute significantly to the density
imaging performance of edge-on-irradiated silicon detectors. With the studied
detector topology, the benefit of counting primary Compton interactions
outweighs the penalty of multiple counting at all lower threshold energies.
Compton interactions also contribute significantly to the spectral imaging

applications. Rather than rely solely on declarative action models, recent
approaches also use black-box external action cost estimators, often learned

computationally expensive, and produce uncertain values. In this paper we
suggest a generalization of deterministic planning with action costs that
allows selecting between multiple estimators for action cost, to balance
computation time against bounded estimation uncertainty. This enables a much
richer -- and correspondingly more realistic -- problem representation.
Importantly, it allows planners to bound plan accuracy, thereby increasing
reliability, while reducing unnecessary computational burden, which is critical
for scaling to large problems. We introduce a search algorithm, generalizing
$A^*$, that solves such planning problems, and additional algorithmic
extensions. In addition to theoretical guarantees, extensive experiments show
considerable savings in runtime compared to alternatives.

releases neutrons, allowing continued s-process nucleosynthesis, if the

In black-box optimization, the dependencies between decision variables remain

Large Scale Global Optimization (LSGO), problems are high-dimensional. It was
shown effective to decompose LSGO problems into subproblems and optimize them
separately. The effectiveness of such approaches may be highly dependent on the
accuracy of problem decomposition. Many state-of-the-art decomposition
strategies are derived from Differential Grouping (DG). However, if a given
problem consists of non-additively separable subproblems, DG-based strategies
may discover many non-existing interactions. On the other hand, monotonicity
checking strategies proposed so far do not report non-existing interactions for
any separable subproblems but may miss discovering many of the existing ones.
Therefore, we propose Incremental Recursive Ranking Grouping (IRRG) that
suffers from none of these flaws. IRRG consumes more fitness function
evaluations than the recent DG-based propositions, e.g., Recursive DG 3 (RDG3).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the considered Cooperative Co-evolution

additively separable subproblems that are suitable for RDG3. After replacing
the additive separability with non-additive, embedding IRRG leads to results of
significantly higher quality.

thanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Its
ability to find local minimisers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitz
gradients, where it can be seen as a `bona-fide' discretisation of an
underlying gradient flow. Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrised models
do not fall into this problem class, which has motivated research beyond the
so-called ``Edge of Stability'' (EoS), where the step-size crosses the
admissibility threshold inversely proportional to the Lipschitz constant above.
Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed to still converge
regardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior.
  The incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused in
the overparametrised regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning rate
may be associated to a `Sharpness-Minimisation' implicit regularisation within
the manifold of minimisers, under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast,
in this work we directly examine the conditions for such unstable convergence,
focusing on simple, yet representative, learning problems. Specifically, we
characterize a local condition involving third-order derivatives that
stabilizes oscillations of GD above the EoS, and leverage such property in a
teacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, focusing on Matrix
Factorization, we establish a non-asymptotic `Local Implicit Bias' of GD above
the EoS, whereby quasi-symmetric initializations converge to symmetric
solutions -- where sharpness is minimum amongst all minimisers.

symmetries, can only be approximate. This motivates us to quantify the breaking
of the shift invariance that characterizes the couplings of an axion-like
particle (ALP), and to identify proper order parameters associated to this
breaking. Focusing on the flavorful effective Yukawa couplings to Standard
Model fermions, we work out explicit conditions for them to maintain an exact
axion shift symmetry. Those conditions are given in terms of Jarlskog-like
flavor-invariants and can be directly evaluated from the values of the
different Yukawa couplings. Therefore, they represent order parameters for the
breaking of the axion shift symmetry. We illustrate this construction by
matching the axion EFT to UV models, and by showing that the renormalization
group running closes on those shift-breaking flavor-invariants, as it should on
any complete set of order parameters. Furthermore, the study of the invariants'
CP-parities indicate that all but one are CP-odd, hence the assumption of CP
conservation suffices to cancel all but one sources of shift-breaking in the
theory. We also investigate similar conditions in the low-energy EFT below the
electroweak scale, and comment on relations inherited from a UV completion
which realizes the electroweak symmetry linearly. Finally, we discuss the order

numerical dissipation at high frequencies is presented for the transient
analysis of structural dynamic problems. The amount of numerical dissipation is
controlled by a user-specified value of the spectral radius $\rho_\infty$ in
the high frequency limit. Using this user-specified parameter as a weight
factor, a Pad\'e expansion of the matrix exponential solution of the equation
of motion is constructed by mixing the diagonal and sub-diagonal expansions. An
efficient timestepping scheme is designed where systems of equations, similar
in complexity to the standard Newmark method, are solved recursively. It is
shown that the proposed high-order scheme achieves high-frequency dissipation,
while minimizing low-frequency dissipation and period errors. The effectiveness
of the provided dissipation control and the efficiency of the scheme are
demonstrated by numerical examples. A simple guideline for the choice of the

We use the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to construct the spacetime
metric representing a black hole surrounded by such a dark matter spike. We
consider the dark matter to be a perfect fluid, but make no other assumption
about its nature. The assumed power law density provides in principle three
parameters with which to work: the power law exponent $\gamma_\text{sp}$, the
external radius $R_\text{sp}$, and the spike density $\rho_\text{DM}^\text{sp}$
at $R_\text{sp}$. These in turn determine the total mass of the spike. We focus
on Sagittarius A* and M87 for which some theoretical and observational bounds
exist on the spike parameters. Using these bounds in conjunction with the
metric obtained from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we investigate
the possibility of detecting the dark matter spikes surrounding these black
holes via the gravitational waves emitted at the ringdown phase of black hole
perturbations. Our results suggest that if the spike to black hole mass ratio

densities to yield potentially observable signals. In particular, the detection
of the dark matter spike surrounding a black hole with a mass comparable to M87

Dynamically dividing the crossbar arrays by adding memristive partitions

highly unique, and was recently exploited to accelerate multiplication (11x
with 32 partitions) and sorting (14x with 16 partitions). Yet, the physical
implementation of memristive partitions, such as the peripheral decoders and
the control message, has never been considered and may lead to vast
impracticality. This paper overcomes that challenge with several novel

begin by formalizing the algorithmic properties of memristive partitions into
serial, parallel, and semi-parallel operations. Peripheral overhead is
addressed via a novel technique of half-gates that enables efficient decoding
with negligible overhead. Control overhead is addressed by carefully reducing
the operation set of memristive partitions, while resulting in negligible
performance impact, by utilizing techniques such as shared indices and pattern
generators. Ultimately, these efficient practical solutions, combined with the
vast algorithmic potential, may revolutionize digital memristive

model on a two-dimensional additive small-world network (A-SWN). The system
model consists of a LxL square lattice where each site of the lattice is
occupied for a spin variable that interacts with the nearest neighbor and has a
certain probability p of being additionally connected at random to one of its
farther neighbors. The system is in contact with a heat bath at a given
temperature T and it is simulated by one-spin flip according to the Metropolis
prescription. We have calculated the thermodynamic quantities of the system,
such as, the magnetization per spin m, magnetic susceptibility chi, and the
reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant U as a function of T for several values of
lattice size L and additive probability p. We also have constructed the phase
diagram for the equilibrium states of the model in the plane T versus p showing
the existence of a continuous transition line between the ferromagnetic F and
paramagnetic P phases. Using the finite-size scaling (FSS) theory, we have
obtained the critical exponents for the system, where varying the parameter p,
we have observed a change in the critical behavior from the regular square
lattice Ising model to A-SWN.

one obtains a differential equation to solve for the argument f(s) of the

it to work out more general expressions for the kinematical quantities. As a
byproduct, we obtain a class of modified Rindler hyperbolic worldlines

  Computing Systems","13 pages",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is expected to provide low-latency computation
service for wireless devices (WDs). However, when WDs are located at cell edge
or communication links between base stations (BSs) and WDs are blocked, the
offloading latency will be large. To address this issue, we propose an
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cell-free MEC system consisting
of multiple BSs and IRSs for improving the transmission environment.
Consequently, we formulate a min-max latency optimization problem by jointly
designing multi-user detection (MUD) matrices, IRSs' reflecting beamforming
vectors, WDs' transmit power and edge computing resource, subject to
constraints on edge computing capability and IRSs phase shifts. To solve it, an
alternating optimization algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD)
technique is proposed, in which the original non-convex problem is decoupled
into two subproblems for alternately optimizing computing and communication
parameters. In particular, we optimize the MUD matrix based on the second-order
cone programming (SOCP) technique, and then develop two efficient algorithms to
optimize IRSs' reflecting vectors based on the semi-definite relaxation (SDR)
and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, respectively. Numerical
results show that employing IRSs in cell-free MEC systems outperforms
conventional MEC systems, resulting in up to about 60% latency reduction can be
attained. Moreover, numerical results confirm that our proposed algorithms
enjoy a fast convergence, which is beneficial for practical implementation.

late-time observables. Whilst vector- and tensor-type parity-violation can be
observed in the $B$-modes of the cosmic microwave background, scalar-type
signatures are visible only in the four-point correlation function (4PCF) and
beyond. This work presents a blind test for parity-violation in the 4PCF of the
BOSS CMASS sample, considering galaxy separations in the range
$[20,160]h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The parity-odd 4PCF contains no contributions
from standard $\Lambda$CDM physics and can be efficiently measured using
recently developed estimators. Data are analyzed using both a non-parametric
rank test (comparing the BOSS 4PCFs to those of realistic simulations) and a
compressed $\chi^2$ analysis, with the former avoiding the assumption of a
Gaussian likelihood. These find similar results, with the rank test giving a
detection probability of $99.6\%$ ($2.9\sigma$). This provides significant
evidence for parity-violation, either from cosmological sources or systematics.
We perform a number of systematic tests: although these do not reveal any
observational artefacts, we cannot exclude the possibility that our detection
is caused by the simulations not faithfully representing the statistical
properties of the BOSS data. Our measurements can be used to constrain physical
models of parity-violation. As an example, we consider a coupling between the
inflaton and a $U(1)$ gauge field and place bounds on the latter's energy
density, which are several orders of magnitude stronger than those previously
reported. Upcoming probes such as DESI and Euclid will reveal whether our
detection of parity-violation is due to new physics, and strengthen the bounds
on a variety of models.

the phase. The stronger the modulation parameters are applied, the more
remarkable the interference effect in momentum spectrum occur. In particular,
for high central frequency field, an extremely good symmetry in momentum
spectrum is found while it is destroyed severely when the modulated amplitude
becomes large. The reduced particle number can be also enhanced greatly at
about a few times or/and one order by the modulation parameters. Moreover, the
effect of spatial scales on the reduced particle number are examined carefully

be a constant at large spatial scales. Two interesting features are revealed
for the reduced particle number, i.e., the optimal modulation parameters are

gravity Schwarzschild black hole solution has been given in the existing
literature. Such a black hole spacetime is obtained through the inclusion of a
modified gravity coupling parameter, which corresponds to the modified
gravitational constant and the black hole charge. In this sense, the modified
gravity parameter acts as not only an enhanced gravitational effect but also a
gravitational repulsive force contribution to a test particle moving around the
black hole. Because the modified Schwarzschild spacetime is static spherical
symmetric, it is integrable. However, the spherical symmetry and the
integrability are destroyed when the black hole is immersed in an external
asymptotic uniform magnetic field and the particle is charged. Although the
magnetized modified Schwarzschild spacetime is nonintegrable and inseparable,
it allows for the application of explicit symplectic integrators when its
Hamiltonian is split into five explicitly integrable parts. Taking one of the
proposed explicit symplectic integrators and the techniques of Poincare
sections and fast Lyapunov indicators as numerical tools, we show that the
charged particle can do chaotic motions under some circumstances. Chaos is
strengthened with an increase of the modified gravity parameter from the global
phase space structures. There are similar results when the magnetic field

important strong transitions and complete for weak transitions. We find that
the elements on the left side of the periodic table, such as Ca, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba,
La, and Ce, tend to produce prominent absorption lines in the spectra. This is
because such elements have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying
energy levels, resulting in strong transitions. By performing self-consistent
radiative transfer simulations for the entire ejecta, we find that La III and
Ce III appear in the NIR spectra, which can explain the absorption features at
$\lambda\sim 12000$-14000 A in the spectra of GW170817/AT2017gfo. The mass

understood by two coupling probabilities, one for the central-peripheral
connections and the other for the peripheral-peripheral connections

chimera states, traveling waves, coherent, and asynchronized states that arise
throughout the network dynamics. We have also investigated the appearance of a
special kind of asynchronization behavior called ""solitary nodes"" that have

different ways of balancing competing pressures of dependency locality and
information locality, whereby languages favor placing elements together when
they are syntactically related or contextually informative about each other.
Using data from 80 languages in 17 language families and phylogenetic modeling,
we demonstrate that languages evolve to balance these pressures, such that word
order change is accompanied by change in the frequency distribution of the
syntactic structures which speakers communicate to maintain overall efficiency.
Variability in word order thus reflects different ways in which languages
resolve these evolutionary pressures. We identify relevant characteristics that
result from this joint optimization, particularly the frequency with which
subjects and objects are expressed together for the same verb. Our findings
suggest that syntactic structure and usage across languages co-adapt to support

prominent substructures, such as stream broadening, gaps, large deviations of

streams as a population, as expected we find that streams with globular cluster
progenitors are typically narrower than those with dwarf galaxy progenitors,
with streams around 100 pc wide showing overlap between the two populations. We
also note the average luminosity of globular cluster streams is significantly
lower than the typical luminosity of intact globular clusters. The likely

belonging to the training classes is still a challenging problem. There has
been a burst of interest in this subject recently, which is called Open-Set
Recognition (OSR). In OSR, the goal is to achieve both the classification and
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Several ideas have been proposed
to push the empirical result further through complicated techniques. We believe
that such complication is indeed not necessary. To this end, we have shown that
Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), as the simplest baseline for OSR, applied on
Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the base classifier that is trained with non-OOD
augmentations can surprisingly outperform many recent methods. Non-OOD
augmentations are the ones that do not alter the data distribution by much. Our
results outperform state-of-the-art in CIFAR-10 datasets, and is also better
than most of the current methods in SVHN and MNIST. We show that training
augmentation has a significant effect on the performance of ViTs in the OSR
tasks, and while they should produce significant diversity in the augmented
samples, the generated sample OOD-ness must remain limited.

assumption that the real space is a continuum, it is rigorously proved that
large barriers of arbitrary shapes can be penetrated by low-energy particles
with a probability of unity, i.e., realization of resonant tunneling (RT), by
simply tuning the inter-barrier spacing. The results are demonstrated by
tunneling of electrons and protons, in which resonant and sequential tunneling
are distinguished. The critical dependence of tunneling probabilities on the
barrier positions not only demonstrates the crucial role of phase factors, but
also points to the possibility of ultrahigh accuracy measurements near
resonance. By contrast, the existence of a nonzero minimum length puts upper
bounds on the barrier size and particle mass, beyond which effective RT ceases.
A scheme is suggested for dealing with the practical difficulties arising from
the delocalization of particle position due to the uncertainty principle. This
work opens a possible avenue for experimental tests of the existence of a
minimum length based on atomic systems.

  Regularizer",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the graph signal processing (GSP) literature, graph Laplacian regularizer
(GLR) was used for signal restoration to promote piecewise smooth / constant
reconstruction with respect to an underlying graph. However, for piecewise
planar (PWP) graph signals, GLR suffers from an undesirable ""staircase"" effect.
In this paper, focusing on manifold graphs -- collections of uniform discrete
samples on low-dimensional continuous manifolds -- we generalize GLR to
gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that promotes PWP signal
reconstruction. Specifically, for a graph endowed with latent space coordinates
(e.g., 2D images, 3D point clouds), we first define a gradient operator, using
which we construct a higher-order gradient graph for the computed gradients in
latent space. This maps to a gradient-induced nodal graph (GNG) and a Laplacian
matrix for a signed graph that is provably positive semi-definite (PSD), thus
suitable for quadratic regularization. For manifold graphs without explicit
latent coordinates, we propose a fast parameter-free spectral method to obtain
latent space coordinates for graph nodes via eigenvector computation. We derive
the means-square-error minimizing weight parameter for GGLR efficiently,
trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate. Experimental results show
that GGLR outperformed previous graph signal priors like GLR and graph total
variation (GTV) in a range of graph signal restoration tasks.

Multi-Layer Perceptron, also known as MLP, for the head architecture. We
evaluate our model on one of the most widely-used and largest x-ray datasets

Chest X-ray14 have shown that a 3-layer head attains state-of-the-art

fuelled massive amounts of data over wireless cellular networks. Random access
(RA) system of wireless cellular networks, e.g., 5G New Radio (NR), based on
S-ALOHA system should cope with ever-growing IoT traffic. This work proposes
S-ALOHA system with time offsets (TOs), where one slot consists of K TOs and
one packet transmission time. The length of the overall TOs is a fraction of a
packet transmission time. In the system users (re)transmit to the boundary of a
TO randomly selected. This enables the base station (BS) to inform the users of
who transmits the first and the last packets in the slot with collision so that
the two users can retransmit successfully in the following two slots
respectively. Our throughput analysis compared to simulations shows that
adopting even with three and four TOs surpasses the throughput limit of S-ALOHA
system without TOs. Additionally, we propose two Bayesian-optimized backoff
algorithms for S-ALOHA system with TOs, with which users can apply
throughput-optimal (re)transmission probability or uniform backoff window even
in unsaturated traffic scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed backoff algorithms can achieve the throughput close to an ideal system
and drastically reduce the access delay compared to S-ALOHA system.

improved adaptive sliding mode control method is studied in the Three
Dimensional (3-D) underwater environment. Firstly, the kinematics model and the
dynamic model of the AUVs are given as the Six Dimensions of Freedom (6-DOF)
considered. Then, control law based on the mathematical model of the AUVs is
proposed based on the improved sliding mode method. A second order sliding mode
control method is adopted to eliminate the chatting phenomenon of the
controller. Thirdly, considering the water flow in the underwater working
environment of the AUVs, an adaptive module is added to the controller. With
the adaptive approach, the finite disturbances caused by water flow could be
handled with the controller. The proposed method achieves stability by
substituting an adaptive continuous term for the switching term in the
controller. At last, a robust sliding mode controller with continuous model
predictive control strategy for the multi-AUV system is developed to achieve
leader-follower formation tracking under the presence of bounded flow
disturbances, and simulations are implemented to confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

regions. It is of broad interest as a tracer of star-formation physics, a probe
of nitrogen astrochemistry, and an ingredient in prebiotic chemical schemes.
Despite this, one of the most fundamental astrochemical properties of HCN
remains poorly characterized: its thermal desorption behavior. Here, we present
a series of experiments to characterize the thermal desorption of HCN in
astrophysically relevant conditions, with a focus on predicting the HCN
sublimation fronts in protoplanetary disks. We derive HCN-HCN and HCN-H2O
binding energies of 3207\pm197 K and 4192\pm68 K, which translate to disk
midplane sublimation temperatures around 85 K and 103 K. For a typical midplane
temperature profile, HCN should only begin to sublimate ~1-2 au exterior to the
H2O snow line. Additionally, in H2O-dominated mixtures (20:1 H2O:HCN), we find
that the majority of HCN remains trapped in the ice until H2O crystallizes.
Thus, HCN may be retained in disk ices at almost all radii where H2O-rich
planetesimals form. This implies that icy body impacts to planetary surfaces
should commonly deliver this potential prebiotic ingredient. A remaining
unknown is the extent to which HCN is pure or mixed with H2O in astrophysical
ices, which impacts the HCN desorption behavior as well as the outcomes of
ice-phase chemistry. Pure HCN and HCN:H2O mixtures exhibit distinct IR bands,
raising the possibility that the James Webb Space Telescope will elucidate the
mixing environment of HCN in star- and planet-forming regions and address these
open questions.

subnetwork within a sufficiently overparameterized (dense) neural network that

Burkholz 2022 demonstrate that the SLTH can be extended to translation
equivariant networks -- i.e. CNNs -- with the same level of overparametrization
as needed for the SLTs in dense networks. However, modern neural networks are
capable of incorporating more than just translation symmetry, and developing
general equivariant architectures such as rotation and permutation has been a
powerful design principle. In this paper, we generalize the SLTH to functions
that preserve the action of the group $G$ -- i.e. $G$-equivariant network --
and prove, with high probability, that one can approximate any $G$-equivariant
network of fixed width and depth by pruning a randomly initialized
overparametrized $G$-equivariant network to a $G$-equivariant subnetwork. We
further prove that our prescribed overparametrization scheme is optimal and
provides a lower bound on the number of effective parameters as a function of
the error tolerance. We develop our theory for a large range of groups,
including subgroups of the Euclidean $\text{E}(2)$ and Symmetric group $G \leq
\mathcal{S}_n$ -- allowing us to find SLTs for MLPs, CNNs,
$\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, and permutation equivariant networks as specific

corresponding to the sensitivity is constructed by approximately calculating
the derivatives based on the simulations, and then, observation sites are
selected by evaluating the quantity of the sensitivity matrix based on the
D-optimality criterion proposed in the optimal design of experiments. In the
present study, physical knowledge on the sensitivity to the parameters such as
seismic velocity, layer thickness, and hypocenter location was obtained by
investigating the characteristics of the sensitivity matrix. Furthermore, the

still lack of theoretical understanding when the observations are contaminated

results and is unable to capture the optimal dependence of the estimation error

asymmetric errors when the parameter in the loss function is carefully designed

an efficient nonconvex algorithm via a balanced low-rank Burer-Monteiro matrix

that under merely bounded second moment condition on the error distributions,
rather than the sub-Gaussian assumption, the Euclidean error of the iterates
generated by the proposed algorithm decrease geometrically fast until achieving
a minimax-optimal statistical estimation error, which has the same order as

nebular properties. We analyze 12 local star-forming galaxies from the COS
Legacy Spectroscopy SurveY (CLASSY) to assess the impact of using different

gas-phase metallicity. We compare optical spectra observed with the SDSS
aperture, which has a 3"" of diameter similar to COS, to IFU and longslit
spectra, including new LBT/MODS observations of five CLASSY galaxies. We
calculate the reddening, electron densities and temperatures, metallicities,
star formation rates, and equivalent widths (EWs). We find that measurements of
the electron densities and temperatures, and metallicity remained roughly
constant with aperture size, indicating that the gas conditions are relatively
uniform for this sample. However, using the IFU observations of 3 galaxies, we
find that the E(B-V) values derived from the Balmer ratios decrease ( by up to
53%) with increasing aperture size. The values change most significantly in the
center of the galaxies, and level out near the COS aperture diameter of 2.5"".
We examine the relative contributions from the gas and stars using the
H$\alpha$ and [OIII] $\lambda$5007 EWs as a function of aperture light
fraction, but find little to no variations within a given galaxy. These results
imply that the optical spectra provide nebular properties appropriate for the

introduce a new problem setting for reinforcement learning, the Exogenous
Markov Decision Process (ExoMDP), in which the state space admits an (unknown)
factorization into a small controllable (or, endogenous) component and a large
irrelevant (or, exogenous) component; the exogenous component is independent of
the learner's actions, but evolves in an arbitrary, temporally correlated
fashion. We provide a new algorithm, ExoRL, which learns a near-optimal policy
with sample complexity polynomial in the size of the endogenous component and
nearly independent of the size of the exogenous component, thereby offering a
doubly-exponential improvement over off-the-shelf algorithms. Our results
highlight for the first time that sample-efficient reinforcement learning is
possible in the presence of exogenous information, and provide a simple,
user-friendly benchmark for investigation going forward.

the highest energy known to date, reaching about 146 keV during the 2017
outburst of the first galactic pulsing ultraluminous X-ray source (pULX) Swift
J0243.6+6124. During this outburst, the CRSF was only prominent close to the
peak luminosity $\sim 2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the highest to date in any
of the Galactic pulsars. The CRSF is most significant in the spin phase region
corresponding to the main pulse of the pulse profile, and its centroid energy
evolves with phase from 120 to 146 keV. We identify this feature as the
fundamental CRSF, since no spectral feature exists at $60-70$ keV. This is the
first unambiguous detection of an electron CRSF from an ULX. We also estimate a
surface magnetic field $\sim1.6\times10^{13}$ G for Swift J0243.6+6124.
Considering that the dipole magnetic field strengths, inferred from several
independent estimates of magnetosphere radius, are at least an order of
magnitude lower than our measurement, we argue that the detection of the
highest energy CRSF reported here unambiguously proves the presence of
multipole field components close to the surface of the neutron star. Such a
scenario has previously been suggested for several pulsating ULXs, including
Swift J0243.6+6124, and our result represents the first direct confirmation of
this scenario.

Target tracking, pulse-edge detection, peak detection and anomaly/change

Erlang-weighted polynomial regression provides a design framework within which
the various design trade-offs of state estimators (e.g. bias errors vs. random
errors) and IIR smoothers (e.g. frequency isolation vs. time localization) may
be intuitively balanced. Erlang weights are configured using a smoothing
parameter which determines the decay rate of the exponential tail; and a shape
parameter which may be used to discount more recent data, so that a greater
relative emphasis is placed on a past time interval. In Morrison's 1969
treatise on sequential smoothing and prediction, the exponential weight (i.e.
the zero shape-parameter case) and the Laguerre polynomials that are orthogonal
with respect to this weight, are described in detail; however, more general
Erlang weights and the resulting associated Laguerre polynomials are not
considered there, nor have they been covered in detail elsewhere since. Thus,
one of the purposes of this tutorial is to explain how Erlang weights may be
used to shape and improve the response of recursive regression filters.

artifacts like texture shift, blur, etc. to the reconstructed images, thus it
is necessary to evaluate the quality of super-resolution images (SRIs). Note
that most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods were developed for
synthetically distorted images, which may not work for SRIs since their
distortions are more diverse and complicated. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a no-reference deep-learning image quality assessment method based on
frequency maps because the artifacts caused by SISR algorithms are quite
sensitive to frequency information. Specifically, we first obtain the
high-frequency map (HM) and low-frequency map (LM) of SRI by using Sobel
operator and piecewise smooth image approximation. Then, a two-stream network
is employed to extract the quality-aware features of both frequency maps.
Finally, the features are regressed into a single quality value using fully
connected layers. The experimental results show that our method outperforms all
compared IQA models on the selected three super-resolution quality assessment

side, this is an issue of non-perturbative QCD, and therefore of lattice
simulations. However, a finite baryon density entails a technical problem
(known as the ``sign problem''), which has not been overcome so far. Here we
present a study of an effective theory, the O(4) non-linear sigma model. It
performs spontaneous symmetry breaking with the same Lie group structure as
2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit, which strongly suggests that they belong to
the same universality class. Since we are interested in high temperature, we
further assume dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, which implies
topological sectors. As pointed out by Skyrme, Wilczek and others, its
topological charge takes the r\^{o}le of the baryon number. Hence the baryon
chemical potential $\mu_{B}$ appears as an imaginary vacuum angle, which can be
included in the lattice simulation without any sign problem. We present
numerical results for the critical line in the chiral limit, and for the
crossover in the presence of light quark masses. Their shapes are compatible
with other predictions, but up to the value of about $\mu_{B} \approx 300~{\rm

distinction between the fully and partial quantum settings. We present parallel
results for the extended conditional min-entropy. In doing so, we extend the
notion of k-superpositive channels to superchannels. We also present
operational uses of this framework. We first show the cone restricted
min-entropy of a Choi operator captures a measure of entanglement-assisted
noiseless classical communication using restricted measurements. We show that
quantum majorization results naturally generalize to other cones. As a novel
example, we introduce a new min-entropy-like quantity that captures the quantum
majorization of quantum channels in terms of bistochastic pre-processing.
Lastly, we relate this framework to general conic norms and their
non-additivity. Throughout this work we emphasize the introduced measures'
relationship to general convex resource theories. In particular, we look at
both resource theories that capture locality and resource theories of
coherence/Abelian symmetries.

paper considers UAV communication with reconfigurable antenna (RA) in the
presence of fading and shadowing effects which occur due to tall buildings and
skyscrapers in urban areas. More precisely, RA offers to receive information
through mirror activation patterns (MAPs) so that it can achieve a receive
diversity with decreased error probability by using only one radio frequency
(RF) chain. Also, media based modulation (MBM) technique for data transmission
with MAPs can be exploited by using RAs with reduced cost. To quantify the
performance of the proposed UAV system, we derive a tight upper bound for the
overall error probability by considering approximated channel model to the
standardization studies for UAVs. The results have shown that RAs can make the
overall system more resilient to shadowing and fading effects in terms of error
performance, and they are energy efficient.

derived which coincides asymptotically, characterizing its true scaling. For
the single packet queue, an upper bound is derived whose effectiveness is

  Context: Snowlines during star and disk formation are responsible for a range
of effects during the evolution of protostars, such as setting the chemical
composition of the envelope and disk. This in turn influences the formation of
planets by changing the elemental compositions of solids and affecting the
collisional properties and outcomes of dust grains. Snowlines can also reveal
accretion bursts, providing insight into the formation process of stars.
  Methods: A numerical chemical network coupled with a grid of
cylindrical-symmetric physical models was used to identify what physical
parameters alter the CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. The investigated
parameters are the initial molecular abundances, binding energies of CO and
H$_2$O, heating source, cloud core density, outflow cavity opening angle, and
disk geometry. Simulated molecular line emission maps were used to quantify the
change in the snowline location with each parameter.
  Conclusions: The models presented in this work show that the CO and H$_2$O
snowline locations do not occur at a single, well-defined temperature as is
commonly assumed. Instead, the snowline position depends on luminosity, cloud
core density, and whether a disk is present or not. Inclination and spatial
resolution affect the observability and successful measurement of snowline
locations. We note that N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ emission serve as good
observational tracers of CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. However, constraints
on whether or not a disk is present, the observation of additional molecular
tracers, and estimating envelope density will help in accurately determining
the cause of the observed snowline position. Plots of the N$_2$H$^+$ and
HCO$^+$ peak emission radius versus luminosity are provided to compare the
models with observations of deeply embedded protostars aiming to measure the CO
and H$_2$O snowline locations.

evidence further show that the linear classifier trained with the adversarial
noises of the training data can well classify the adversarial noises of the

since it allows to observe living tissues with improved penetration depth and
excellent sectioning effect. Multi-photon microscopy relies on multi-photon

depends on the properties of the sample structure, the selected fluorophore and
the excitation laser. However, versatile and tunable laser excitation for
multi-photon absorption is still a challenge, limited by e.g. the narrow
bandwidth of typical laser gain medium or by the tunability of wavelength
conversion offered by optical parametric oscillators or amplifiers. As an
alternative, supercontinuum generation can provide broadband excitationspanning
from the ultra-violet to far infrared domains and integrating numerous
fluorophore absorption peaks, in turn enabling different imaging modalities or
potential multiplexed spectroscopy. Here, we report on the use of machine
learning to optimize the spectro-temporal properties of supercontinuum
generation in order to selectively enhance multi-photon excitation signals

typical multi-photon excitations at selected wavelengths, here obtained in a

Previous studies focused on approximating the distribution of normal features
without adaptation to a target dataset. However, since anomaly localization
should precisely discriminate normal and abnormal features, the absence of
adaptation may make the normality of abnormal features overestimated. Thus, we
propose Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation (CFA) which accomplishes
sophisticated anomaly localization using features adapted to the target
dataset. CFA consists of (1) a learnable patch descriptor that learns and
embeds target-oriented features and (2) scalable memory bank independent of the
size of the target dataset. And, CFA adopts transfer learning to increase the
normal feature density so that abnormal features can be clearly distinguished
by applying patch descriptor and memory bank to a pre-trained CNN. The proposed
method outperforms the previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively. For
example, it provides an AUROC score of 99.5% in anomaly detection and 98.5% in
anomaly localization of MVTec AD benchmark. In addition, this paper points out
the negative effects of biased features of pre-trained CNNs and emphasizes the
importance of the adaptation to the target dataset. The code is publicly

a small $\Delta$ is most promising to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase. Two
representative honeycomb materials Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ are

their different magnetization behaviors and spin excitation spectra. Proximity

needed to harness this technology's potential. Instead of recording video by
capturing frames, event-based cameras have sensors that emit events when their
inputs change, thus encoding information in the timing of events. This creates
new challenges in establishing reconstruction guarantees and algorithms, but
also provides advantages over frame-based video. We use time encoding machines
to model event-based sensors: TEMs also encode their inputs by emitting events
characterized by their timing and reconstruction from time encodings is well
understood. We consider the case of time encoding bandlimited video and
demonstrate a dependence between spatial sensor density and overall spatial and
temporal resolution. Such a dependence does not occur in frame-based video,
where temporal resolution depends solely on the frame rate of the video and
spatial resolution depends solely on the pixel grid. However, this dependence
arises naturally in event-based video and allows oversampling in space to
provide better time resolution. As such, event-based vision encourages using
more sensors that emit fewer events over time.

that Sgr\,B2 was formed by a cloud-cloud collision (CCC) between two clouds
with velocities of $\sim$45 km~s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$75 km~s$^{-1}$. However, some
recent observational studies conflict with this scenario. We have re-analyzed
this region, by using recent, fully sampled, dense-gas data and by employing a
recently developed CCC identification methodology, with which we have
successfully identified more than 50 CCCs and compared them at various
wavelengths. We found two velocity components that are widely spread across
this region and that show clear signatures of a CCC, each with a mass of
$\sim$10$^6$ $M_\odot$. Based on these observational results, we suggest an
alternative scenario, in which contiguous collisions between two velocity
features with a relative velocity of $\sim$20 km~s$^{-1}$ created both Sgr\,B1

relative velocity of the colliding clouds, satisfy a relation that has been
found to apply to the most massive Galactic CCCs, meaning that the triggering
of high-mass star formation in the Galaxy and starbursts in external galaxies
can be understood as being due to the same physical CCC process.

onto heavy metals (HM) have been proposed for the realization of novel
spintronic devices because of their perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and
sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), allowing for both enhanced
thermal stability and stabilization of chiral spin textures. However,
establishing routes towards this goal requires the fundamental understanding of
the microscopic origin of their unusual properties. Here, we elucidate the
nature of the induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at Gr/Co interfaces on Ir.
Through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission along with density functional
theory, we show that the interaction of the HM with the C atomic layer via
hybridization with the FM is the source of strong SOC in the Gr layer.
Furthermore, our studies on ultrathin Co films underneath Gr reveal an energy
splitting of $\sim$\,100 meV (negligible) for in-plane (out-of-plane) spin
polarized Gr $\pi$ bands, consistent with a Rashba-SOC at the Gr/Co interface,
which is either the fingerprint or the origin of the DMI. This mechanism
vanishes at large Co thicknesses, where neither in-plane nor out-of-plane
spin-orbit splitting is observed, indicating that Gr $\pi$ states are
electronically decoupled from the HM. The present findings are important for
future applications of Gr-based heterostructures in spintronic devices.

where the MCSC platform employs workers to serve MCSC tasks with diverse

workers' participation and their local workloads. We propose a hybrid worker
recruitment framework consisting of offline and online trading modes. The
former enables the platform to overbook long-term workers (services) to cope
with dynamic service supply via signing contracts in advance, which is
formulated as 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) with probabilistic
constraints related to service quality and budget. Besides, motivated by the
existing uncertainties which may render long-term workers fail to meet the
service quality requirement of each task, we augment our methodology with an
online temporary worker recruitment scheme as a backup Plan B to support
seamless service provisioning for MCSC tasks, which also represents a 0-1 ILP
problem. To tackle these problems which are proved to be NP-hard, we develop
three algorithms, namely, i) exhaustive searching, ii) unique index-based
stochastic searching with risk-aware filter constraint, and iii) geometric
programming-based successive convex algorithm, which achieve the optimal (with
high computational complexity) or sub-optimal (with low complexity) solutions.

neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) generalize
surprisingly well. Based on the Rademacher complexity of a pre-specified
hypothesis set, different norm-based generalization bounds have been developed
to explain this phenomenon. However, recent studies suggest these bounds might
be problematic as they increase with the training set size, which is contrary
to empirical evidence. In this study, we argue that the hypothesis set SGD
explores is trajectory-dependent and thus may provide a tighter bound over its
Rademacher complexity. To this end, we characterize the SGD recursion via a
stochastic differential equation by assuming the incurred stochastic gradient
noise follows the fractional Brownian motion. We then identify the Rademacher
complexity in terms of the covering numbers and relate it to the Hausdorff
dimension of the optimization trajectory. By invoking the hypothesis set
stability, we derive a novel generalization bound for deep neural networks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that it predicts well the generalization gap
over several common experimental interventions. We further show that the Hurst
parameter of the fractional Brownian motion is more informative than existing
generalization indicators such as the power-law index and the upper
Blumenthal-Getoor index.

mining tasks.However, drastic performance degradation is always observed when a
GNN is stacked with many layers. As a result, most GNNs only have shallow
architectures, which limits their expressive power and exploitation of deep
neighborhoods.Most recent studies attribute the performance degradation of deep
GNNs to the \textit{over-smoothing} issue. In this paper, we disentangle the
conventional graph convolution operation into two independent operations:
\textit{Propagation} (\textbf{P}) and \textit{Transformation}
(\textbf{T}).Following this, the depth of a GNN can be split into the
propagation depth ($D_p$) and the transformation depth ($D_t$). Through
extensive experiments, we find that the major cause for the performance
degradation of deep GNNs is the \textit{model degradation} issue caused by
large $D_t$ rather than the \textit{over-smoothing} issue mainly caused by
large $D_p$. Further, we present \textit{Adaptive Initial Residual} (AIR), a
plug-and-play module compatible with all kinds of GNN architectures, to
alleviate the \textit{model degradation} issue and the \textit{over-smoothing}
issue simultaneously. Experimental results on six real-world datasets
demonstrate that GNNs equipped with AIR outperform most GNNs with shallow
architectures owing to the benefits of both large $D_p$ and $D_t$, while the
time costs associated with AIR can be ignored.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based BIQA model for 4K content,
which on one hand can recognize true and pseudo 4K content and on the other
hand can evaluate their perceptual visual quality. Considering the
characteristic that high spatial resolution can represent more abundant
high-frequency information, we first propose a Grey-level Co-occurrence Matrix
(GLCM) based texture complexity measure to select three representative image
patches from a 4K image, which can reduce the computational complexity and is
proven to be very effective for the overall quality prediction through
experiments. Then we extract different kinds of visual features from the
intermediate layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and integrate
them into the quality-aware feature representation. Finally, two multilayer
perception (MLP) networks are utilized to map the quality-aware features into
the class probability and the quality score for each patch respectively. The
overall quality index is obtained through the average pooling of patch results.
The proposed model is trained through the multi-task learning manner and we
introduce an uncertainty principle to balance the losses of the classification
and regression tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms all compared BIQA metrics on four 4K content quality assessment

Standard error correction methods require overhead that makes their application
prohibitive for near-term devices. To mitigate the limitations of near-term
devices, a number of hybrid approaches have been pursued in which a
parameterized quantum circuit prepares and measures quantum states and a
classical optimization algorithm minimizes an objective function that
encompasses the solution to the problem of interest. In this work, we propose a
different approach starting by analyzing how a small perturbation of a

parameterized quantum states. We derive a set of equations that allow us to
compute the new minimum by solving a constrained linear system of equations
that is obtained from measuring a series of observables on the unperturbed

can be implemented with NISQ devices while at the same time is insensitive to
the initialization of the parameters and to other limitations hindered in the
optimization part of variational quantum algorithms. We also derive a lower

find that the inclusion of particle drift leads to less suppression of Galactic
cosmic rays fluxes than when it is excluded from the model. In the case of AU
Mic we explore two different wind environments, with a low and high stellar
wind mass-loss rate. For AU Mic, the particle drift also leads to less
suppression of the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes but it is only significant for
the high mass-loss rate scenario. However, both wind scenarios for AU Mic
suppress the Galactic cosmic rays strongly. Overall, careful modelling of
stellar winds is needed to calculate the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes reaching

the information loss problem, the proposed model aims to preserve the
spatiotemporal information for videos during the feature extraction and the
state transitions, respectively. Firstly, a Multi-Grained Spatiotemporal
Auto-Encoder (MGST-AE) is designed based on the X-Net structure. The proposed
MGST-AE can help the decoders recall multi-grained information from the
encoders in both the temporal and spatial domains. In this way, more
spatiotemporal information can be preserved during the feature extraction for
high-resolution videos. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Gated Recurrent Unit (STGRU)
is designed based on the standard Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) structure, which
can efficiently preserve spatiotemporal information during the state
transitions. The proposed STGRU can achieve more satisfactory performance with
a much lower computation load compared with the popular Long Short-Term (LSTM)
based predictive memories. Furthermore, to improve the traditional MSE loss

optimizing mesh style attributes. We build a text-driven human motion
recommendation system by leveraging a large-scale human motion dataset with
language labels. Given a natural language prompt, CLIP-Actor suggests a
text-conforming human motion in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then, our novel
zero-shot neural style optimization detailizes and texturizes the recommended
mesh sequence to conform to the prompt in a temporally-consistent and
pose-agnostic manner. This is distinctive in that prior work fails to generate
plausible results when the pose of an artist-designed mesh does not conform to
the text from the beginning. We further propose the spatio-temporal view
augmentation and mask-weighted embedding attention, which stabilize the
optimization process by leveraging multi-frame human motion and rejecting
poorly rendered views. We demonstrate that CLIP-Actor produces plausible and
human-recognizable style 3D human mesh in motion with detailed geometry and

Markov decision process (MDP) of which vertices and directed edges represent
graph states and graph actions, separately. As state-action spaces of VMG are
finite and relatively small compared to the original environment, we can
directly apply the value iteration algorithm on VMG to estimate graph state

the offline RL dataset. Together with an action translator that converts the
abstract graph actions in VMG to real actions in the original environment, VMG
controls agents to maximize episode returns. Our experiments on the D4RL

transmitting only the local model updates to the central server. However, it
faces challenges including statistical heterogeneity of clients' datasets and
resource constraints of client devices, which severely impact the training
performance and user experience. Prior works have tackled these challenges by
combining personalization with model compression schemes including quantization
and pruning. However, the pruning is data-dependent and thus must be done on
the client side which requires considerable computation cost. Moreover, the
pruning normally trains a binary supermask $\in \{0, 1\}$ which significantly
limits the model capacity yet with no computation benefit. Consequently, the
training requires high computation cost and a long time to converge while the
model performance does not pay off. In this work, we propose HideNseek which
employs one-shot data-agnostic pruning at initialization to get a subnetwork
based on weights' synaptic saliency. Each client then optimizes a sign
supermask $\in \{-1, +1\}$ multiplied by the unpruned weights to allow faster
convergence with the same compression rates as state-of-the-art. Empirical
results from three datasets demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art,
HideNseek improves inferences accuracies by up to 40.6\% while reducing the

we propose VITA, a simple structure built on top of an off-the-shelf
Transformer-based image instance segmentation model. Specifically, we use an
image object detector as a means of distilling object-specific contexts into
object tokens. VITA accomplishes video-level understanding by associating
frame-level object tokens without using spatio-temporal backbone features. By
effectively building relationships between objects using the condensed

ResNet-50 backbone: 49.8 AP, 45.7 AP on YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and 19.6 AP on
OVIS. Moreover, thanks to its object token-based structure that is disjoint
from the backbone features, VITA shows several practical advantages that
previous offline VIS methods have not explored - handling long and
high-resolution videos with a common GPU, and freezing a frame-level detector
trained on image domain. Code is available at

relativistic Ritz approach was recently introduced and some its theoretical
consequences were explored. In this article, the relativistic Ritz approach is
used to fit extant measurements of atomic hydrogen and deuterium transitions
using information-theoretic analyses. As a result, the fine-structure constant
($\alpha$), a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, may be determined
simultaneously with the ionization energies of hydrogen and deuterium,
$E_I^{\text{(H)}}$ and $E_I^{\text{(D)}}$. The best hydrogen analysis yields
$\alpha^{-1} = 137.035\,999\,185(25)$, in good agreement with the value
obtained by other methods and without relying on a separately determined
Rydberg constant. From the same analysis, I find that $E_I^{\text{(H)}} =
13.598\,434\,599\,684(25)\,\text{eV}$, an improvement of two orders of
magnitude in precision compared to previous determinations and in agreement
with the Standard Model prediction at 1.8 parts per trillion. The best
deuterium analysis yields $E_I^{\text{(D)}} =
13.602\,134\,636\,543(31)\,\text{eV}$, agreeing with the Standard Model at 2.3
parts per trillion. This study demonstrates how the relativistic Ritz approach
can be used for testing the Standard Model with the spectra of hydrogen-like
atoms.

address these limitations, we consider a novel application of conformal
prediction to contextual bandits. Given data collected under a behavioral

output reliable predictive intervals for the outcome under a new target policy.
We provide theoretical finite-sample guarantees without making any additional

conjecture (WCCC) of the static and spherically symmetric hairy black holes in
the Einstein gravity without using the explicit expressions of the metric and
lagrangian for matter fields. We examine the WCCC in the collision process
without requiring the spherically symmetry of the perturbation matter fields.
After assuming the stability condition of spacetime and applying the Gaussian
null coordinates into the variational identities, we derive the first two order
perturbation inequalities which reflects the null energy condition of the
matter fields. As a result, we find that nearly extremal static hairy black
hole cannot be destroyed in the above perturbation process under the
second-order approximation. Our result implies that the valid of the WCCC is
universal for the hairy black hole in the Einstein gravity as long as the
matter fields satisfy the null energy condition under the perturbation level.

source region was an X1.4 flare located at approximately S15W01 on the solar
disk as observed from the Earth's perspective. The position of the CME as
derived from the 3D Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) reconstruction method was
at around S18W00 at 2.5 solar radii and S07W00 at 5.7 solar radii, meaning that
the CME was deflected towards the Equator while propagating outward in the
corona. The projected speed of the leading edge of the CME also evolved from
around 200 km s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to around 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in the
COR2 field of view. The degree of polarisation of the CME is around 65 % but it
can go as high as 80 % in some CME regions. The CME showed deviation of the
polarisation angle from the tangential in the range of 10$^\circ$ - 15$^\circ$
(or more). Our analysis showed that this is mostly due to the fact that the
sequence of three polarised images from where the polarised parameters are
derived is not taken simultaneously, but at a difference of few seconds in
time. In this interval of time, the CME is moving by at least two pixels in the
FOV of the instruments and this displacement results in uncertainties in the
polarisation parameters (degree of polarisation, polarisation angle, etc.). We
propose some steps forward to improve the derivation of the polarisation. This
study is important for analysing the future data from instruments with
polarisation capabilities.

technique to improve generalization is to learn on increasingly complex

literature indicate, this technique might suffer from catastrophic forgetting
when transferring the learned skills between different problem sizes. To
address this issue, we introduce a novel Adversarial Curriculum Learning (ACL)
strategy, which dynamically adjusts the difficulty level during the learning
process to revisit the worst-performing instances. This work also presents a
deep learning model to solve the JSP, which is equivariant w.r.t. the job

the current state-of-the-art models on the JSP. It reduces the average

by the fact that typical deep learning algorithms require (manual) annotations
in addition to the large amounts of image data, to enable effective training.
Multiple instance learning exhibits a powerful tool for learning deep neural
networks in a scenario without fully annotated data. These methods are
particularly effective in this domain, due to the fact that labels for a
complete whole slide image are often captured routinely, whereas labels for
patches, regions or pixels are not. This potential already resulted in a
considerable number of publications, with the majority published in the last
three years. Besides the availability of data and a high motivation from the

of a biological neuron, is a spontaneous regulation mechanism that maintains
neuronal homeostasis, i.e., the constant overall spiking firing rate of a

threshold, which has been extensively studied in biology. Existing work in the
machine learning community does not employ bioinspired spiking threshold
schemes. This work aims at bridging this gap by introducing a novel bioinspired
dynamic energy-temporal threshold (BDETT) scheme for spiking neural networks

dynamic threshold has 1) a positive correlation with the average membrane
potential and 2) a negative correlation with the preceding rate of
depolarization. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed BDETT on robot
obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal conditions
and various degraded conditions, including noisy observations, weights, and
dynamic environments. We find that the BDETT outperforms existing static and
heuristic threshold approaches by significant margins in all tested conditions,

attracted considerable recent interest, especially for supplying energy to
relay nodes in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems to assist the information
exchange between a source and a destination. Moreover, limited hardware,
computational resources, and energy availability of IoT devices have raised
various security challenges. To this end, physical layer security (PLS) has
been proposed as an effective alternative to cryptographic methods for
providing information security. In this study, we propose a PLS approach for
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-based half-duplex
(HD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems in the presence of an
eavesdropper. Furthermore, we take into account both static power splitting
relaying (SPSR) and dynamic power splitting relaying (DPSR) to thoroughly
investigate the benefits of each one. To further enhance secure communication,
we consider multiple friendly jammers to help prevent wiretapping attacks from
the eavesdropper. More specifically, we provide a reliability and security
analysis by deriving closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and
intercept probability (IP), respectively, for both the SPSR and DPSR schemes.
Then, simulations are also performed to validate our analysis and the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Specifically, numerical results
illustrate the non-trivial trade-off between reliability and security of the
proposed system. In addition, we conclude from the simulation results that the
proposed DPSR scheme outperforms the SPSR-based scheme in terms of OP and IP

The qWP-based denoising method (qWPdn) consists of multiscale qWP transform of
the degraded image, application of adaptive localized soft thresholding to the
transform coefficients using the Bivariate Shrinkage methodology, and
restoration of the image from the thresholded coefficients from several

qWPdn and WNNM algorithms in a way that at each iteration the output from one
algorithm boosts the input to the other. The proposed methodology couples the
qWPdn capabilities to capture edges and fine texture patterns even in the

  Multiple experiments, which compared the proposed methodology with six

approach for evaluating results from randomized controlled trials. Whereas NHST
comes with long-run error rate guarantees, its main inferential tool -- the
$p$-value -- is only an indirect measure of evidence against the null
hypothesis. The main reason is that the $p$-value is based on the assumption
the null hypothesis is true, whereas the likelihood of the data under any
alternative hypothesis is ignored. If the goal is to quantify how much evidence
the data provide for or against the null hypothesis it is unavoidable that an
alternative hypothesis be specified (Goodman & Royall, 1988). Paradoxes arise
when researchers interpret $p$-values as evidence. For instance, results that
are surprising under the null may be equally surprising under a plausible
alternative hypothesis, such that a $p=.045$ result (`reject the null') does
not make the null any less plausible than it was before. Hence, $p$-values have
been argued to overestimate the evidence against the null hypothesis.
Conversely, it can be the case that statistically non-significant results
(i.e., $p>.05)$ nevertheless provide some evidence in favor of the alternative
hypothesis. It is therefore crucial for researchers to know when statistical
significance and evidence collide, and this requires that a direct measure of
evidence is computed and presented alongside the traditional $p$-value.

degradation under transition disturbance and observation disturbance depends on
a novel metric of Value Function Range (VFR), which corresponds to the gap in
the value function between the best state and the worst state. Based on the

slow-fast system. Thus, we analyse the slow-fast dynamics near the
singularities on the consensus space. In particular, we prove a theorem that
provides existence conditions for a maximal canard, that coincides with the
consensus subspace, by using the symmetry properties of the network.
Furthermore, we provide a linear approximation of the intersecting branches of
equilibria at the singular points; as a consequence, we show that, generically,
the singularities on the consensus space turn out to be transcritical.

biologically crucial contraction. A general understanding of this rectification
phenomenon as a function of the medium's elasticity is however lacking. Here we
use theoretical continuum elasticity to show that rectification is actually a
very general effect in nonlinear materials subjected to anisotropic internal
stresses. We analytically show that both bucklable and constitutively linear
materials subjected to geometrical nonlinearities rectify small forces towards
contraction, while granular-like materials rectify towards expansion. Using

materials can also exhibit emergent behaviours -- where local interactions lead
to complex global behaviours that are robust to variation in individual
elements -- which are promising for In Materio computation due to the high
degree of expressivity that emergence offers. However, to make use of the broad
range of complexity that these emergent systems boast, methods for reading and
writing data to and from the material substrate must be tailored to extract the
specific computational properties that a given task demands. Here, devices of
arrays of interconnected permalloy nanorings, shown to exhibit emergent
dynamics, are electrically measured under three input configurations falling
under the paradigm of 'Reservoir Computing' to perform signal transformation,
spoken digit recognition, and memory-intensive time series prediction. The
successful performance of each of these tasks is then correlated to the
physical processes occurring in the device, providing interpretability of the
role of the substrate in computation. The ring array system performs
competitively compared to other proposed magnetic architectures in the signal

generalized VQ-VAE, RQ-VAE first represents a high-resolution image as a
sequence of discrete code stacks. After code stacks in the sequence are
randomly masked, Contextual RQ-Transformer is trained to infill the masked code
stacks based on the unmasked contexts of the image. Then, Contextual
RQ-Transformer uses our two-phase decoding, Draft-and-Revise, and generates an
image, while exploiting the global contexts of the image during the generation
process. Specifically. in the draft phase, our model first focuses on
generating diverse images despite rather low quality. Then, in the revise
phase, the model iteratively improves the quality of images, while preserving
the global contexts of generated images. In experiments, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on conditional image generation. We also validate that
the Draft-and-Revise decoding can achieve high performance by effectively
controlling the quality-diversity trade-off in image generation.

parallaxes of PNe display inconsistency with those of Gaia, particularly the

employed as the probability factors in stochastic quantization between adjacent

The output embeddings of the SSL model are treated as powerful short-time

objective is to get the correct sequence of acoustic units, characters, or
byte-pair encodings (BPEs). Usually, encoder-decoder architecture works
exceptionally well for a sequence-to-sequence task like ASR. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a new paradigm that exploits the power of a decoder during
self-supervised learning. We use Hidden Unit BERT (HuBERT) SSL framework to
compute the conventional masked prediction loss for the encoder. In addition,
we have introduced a decoder in the SSL framework and proposed a target
preparation strategy for the decoder. Finally, we use a multitask SSL setup
wherein we jointly optimize both the encoder and decoder losses. We hypothesize
that the presence of a decoder in the SSL model helps it learn an acoustic
unit-based language model, which might improve the performance of an ASR
downstream task. We compare our proposed SSL model with HuBERT and show up to
25% relative improvement in performance on ASR by finetuning on various

much more efficient than full CC calculations, and it is substantially more

various applications. The working mechanism behind it, however, remains
mysterious. GNN models are designed to learn effective representations for
graph-structured data, which intrinsically coincides with the principle of
graph signal denoising (GSD). Algorithm unrolling, a ""learning to optimize""
technique, has gained increasing attention due to its prospects in building
efficient and interpretable neural network architectures. In this paper, we
introduce a class of unrolled networks built based on truncated optimization
algorithms (e.g., gradient descent and proximal gradient descent) for GSD
problems. They are shown to be tightly connected to many popular GNN models in
that the forward propagations in these GNNs are in fact unrolled networks
serving specific GSDs. Besides, the training process of a GNN model can be seen
as solving a bilevel optimization problem with a GSD problem at the lower
level. Such a connection brings a fresh view of GNNs, as we could try to
understand their practical capabilities from their GSD counterparts, and it can
also motivate designing new GNN models. Based on the algorithm unrolling
perspective, an expressive model named UGDGNN, i.e., unrolled gradient descent
GNN, is further proposed which inherits appealing theoretical properties.
Extensive numerical simulations on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that
UGDGNN can achieve superior or competitive performance over the

induced optimal trajectories with expert demonstrations locally in a receding

it thereby avoids the 'curse of dimensionality'. This contrasts sharply with
earlier algorithms that match with expert demonstrations globally over the

  Rencontres de Physique de la Vall\'ee d'Aoste""",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea of unification attempts to explain the structure of the Standard
Model (SM) in terms of fewer fundamental forces and/or matter fields. However,
traditional grand unified theories based on $SU(5)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(10)$
shed no light on the existence of three generations of fermions, nor the
distinctive pattern of their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We discuss two
routes for unifying the SM gauge symmetry with its flavour symmetries: firstly,
unifying flavour with electroweak symmetries via the group $SU(4) \times
Sp(6)_L \times Sp(6)_R$; secondly, unifying flavour and colour via $SU(12)
\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. In either case, all three generations of SM
fermions are unified into just two fundamental fields. In the larger part of
this proceeding, we describe how the former model of `electroweak flavour
unification' offers a new explanation of hierarchical fermion masses and CKM
angles. As a postscript, we show that gauge flavour unification can have
unexpected spin-offs not obviously related to flavour. In particular, the
$SU(12) \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry, when broken, can leave behind
remnant discrete gauge symmetries that exactly stabilize protons to all orders.

spatial point processes. This problem finds a natural description in terms of
the canonical ensemble but not in the usual grand-canonical one, customarily

question of ensemble equivalence and study whether the resulting canonical

to the inhomogeneous turbulence inside the reconnecting current sheet (CS) and
invokes the fast phase of reconnection. Fast reconnection brings an extra
dissipation of magnetic field which enhances the reconnection rate in an
apparent way. The energy spectrum in the CS shows the power-law pattern and the
dynamics of plasmoids governs the associated spectral index. We noticed that
the energy dissipation occurs at a scale $l_{ko}$ of 100-200~km, and the
associated CS thickness ranges from 1500 to 2500~km, which follows the Taylor
scale $l_T=l_{ko} S^{1/6}$. The termination shock(TS) appears in the turbulent
region above flare loops, which is an important contributor to heating flare
loops. Substantial magnetic energy is converted into both kinetic and thermal
energies via TS, and the cumulative heating rate is greater than the rate of
the kinetic energy transfer. In addition, the turbulence is somehow amplified
by TS, of which the amplitude is related to the local geometry of the TS.

to its ability to automate asset transfers. It requires distributed
participants to reach a consensus on a block despite the presence of malicious

weaknesses of these blockchain consensus algorithms, with sometimes devastating
consequences. In fact, these weaknesses are quite common and are well
illustrated by the flaws in the hand-written proofs of existing blockchain

been holistically verified using model checking.
  In this paper, we remedy this paradox by model checking for the first time a
blockchain consensus used in industry. We propose a holistic approach to verify
the consensus algorithm of the Red Belly Blockchain [20], for any number $n$ of
processes and any number $f<n/3$ of Byzantine processes. We decompose directly
the algorithm pseudocode in two parts -- an inner broadcast algorithm and an
outer decision algorithm -- each modelled as a threshold automaton [36], and we
formalize their expected properties in linear-time temporal logic. We then
automatically check the inner broadcasting algorithm, under a carefully
identified fairness assumption. For the verification of the outer algorithm, we
simplify the model of the inner algorithm by relying on its checked properties.
Doing so, we formally verify not only the safety properties of the Red Belly
Blockchain consensus but also its liveness in about 70 seconds.

further to investigate the case that the DM's preference is not only ambiguous
but also potentially inconsistent or even displaying some kind of randomness.
We propose a distributionally preference robust optimization (DPRO) approach
where the DM's preference is represented by a random utility function and the
ambiguity is described by a set of probability distributions of the random
utility. An obvious advantage of the new DPRO model is that it no longer
concerns the DM's preference inconsistency. In the case when the random utility
functions are of piecewise linear structure, we propose two statistical methods
for constructing the ambiguity set: an ellipsoidal method and a bootstrap
method both of which are fundamentally based on the idea of confidence region
with the sample mean of the random parameters, and demonstrate how the
resulting DPRO can be solved by a cutting surface algorithm and an MISOCP
respectively. We also show how the DPRO models with general random utility
functions may be approximated by those with piecewise linear random utility
functions. Finally, we apply the proposed DPRO model in car manufacturing and
facility location planning and show how the random samples may be extracted by
multinomial logit method and conjoint analysis/machine learning. The paper is

problems. Although the convergence behavior of optimization algorithms has been
extensively studied in the minimax settings, their generalization guarantees in
stochastic minimax optimization problems, i.e., how the solution trained on
empirical data performs on unseen testing data, have been relatively
underexplored. A fundamental question remains elusive: What is a good metric to
study generalization of minimax learners? In this paper, we aim to answer this
question by first showing that primal risk, a universal metric to study
generalization in minimization problems, which has also been adopted recently
to study generalization in minimax ones, fails in simple examples. We thus
propose a new metric to study generalization of minimax learners: the primal
gap, defined as the difference between the primal risk and its minimum over all
models, to circumvent the issues. Next, we derive generalization error bounds
for the primal gap in nonconvex-concave settings. As byproducts of our
analysis, we also solve two open questions: establishing generalization error
bounds for primal risk and primal-dual risk, another existing metric that is
only well-defined when the global saddle-point exists, in the strong sense,
i.e., without strong concavity or assuming that the maximization and
expectation can be interchanged, while either of these assumptions was needed
in the literature. Finally, we leverage this new metric to compare the
generalization behavior of two popular algorithms -- gradient descent-ascent
(GDA) and gradient descent-max (GDMax) in stochastic minimax optimization.

in 2006 through the construction of a new example of such a geometry. Later it
was realised by Neves and Saa, that a wider, two-parameter class exists, with
Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes as special cases. In this article, we revisit
and generalise the Hayward spacetime by applying the Damour-Solodukhin (DS)
prescription. Recalling the DS suggestion of a deformed Schwarzschild spacetime
where $g_{tt} = -\left (1-\frac{2M_1}{r}\right )$, $g_{rr} = \left
(1-\frac{2M_2}{r}\right )^{-1}$ and $M_1\neq M_2$, we propose a similar
deformation of the Hayward geometry. The $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ in the original
Hayward line element remain functionally the same, {\em albeit} mutations
introduced via differently valued metric parameters, following the DS idea.
This results in a plethora of spacetime geometries, known as well as new, and
including singular black holes, wormholes or regular black holes. We first
study the geometric features and matter content of each of such spacetimes in
some detail. Subsequently, we find the scalar quasinormal modes corresponding
to scalar wave propagation in these geometries. We investigate how the real and
imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes depend on the values and ranges of the
metric parameters used to classify the geometries. Finally, we argue how our
results on this family of spacetimes suggest their utility as black hole
mimickers.

Hankel matrices), a novel state-space analysis referred to as Hankel Spectral
Analysis (HSA), was developed. Depended on the Hankel total least square
(HTLS), the HSA incorporates truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and
its shift-invariant property in robustly decomposing the closely-spaced
sinusoids. Resorted to a sliding window processing, HSA can be used to analyze
non-stationary sequential structures, in the support of consecutive quaternary
parameters {Ai, {\alpha}i, fi, {\theta}i}. Based on a series of experiments
with special features commonly in real measurements, the availabilities of HSA
in complex harmonic constituents (e.g., the time-variant amplitude/frequency,
mutation, the episodic recording signals) with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio are
confirmed. In real applications, we use HSA to analyze both global geophysical
observables, including polar motion (PM) and earth's dynamic oblateness
({\Delta}J2), and some new findings are obtained. In the PM series since the
1900s, a total of triple jumps from Chandler wobble (CW) are firstly confirmed;
and all of them are synchronized by the sharp decrease of Chandler intensity
and period. In the {\Delta}J2 series, two decadal signals (18.6 yr, 10.5 yr)
are identified to be associated with the tide effect, and solar activity; and
its interannual-to-decadal oscillations contribute to multiple global gravity
anomalies. These findings implied the great potential of the HSA in searching
hitherto signals of geophysical observations.

  component and the effect of mergers","Paper I in a series of III, 16 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theory suggests that mergers play an important role in shaping galactic disks
and stellar haloes, which was observationally confirmed in the MW thanks to the
Gaia data. In this work, aiming to probe the contribution of mergers to the
in-situ stellar halo formation, we analyze six M31/MW analogues from the HESTIA
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of the Local Group. We
found that all the HESTIA galaxies experience from 1 to 4 mergers with stellar
mass ratios between 0.2 and 1 relative to the host at the time of the merger.
These significant mergers, with a single exception, happened 7-11 Gyr ago. The
overall impact of the most massive mergers in HESTIA is clearly seen as a sharp
increase of the orbital eccentricity (and a corresponding decrease of the Vphi)
of preexisting disc stars of the main progenitor, thus reproducing well the
Splash/Plume-like feature discovered in the MW. We do find a correlation
between mergers/close pericentric passages of massive satellites and bursts of
the star formation in the in-situ component. Massive mergers sharply increase
the disc velocity dispersion of the in-situ stars, however, the latest
significant merger often heats up the disk up to the numbers when the
contribution of the previous ones is less prominent in the age-velocity
dispersion relation. In the HESTIA galaxies, the in-situ halo is an important
component of the inner stellar halo where its fraction is about 30-40%, while
in the outer parts it typically does not exceed ~5% beyond 15 kpc. The
simulations suggest that this component of the stellar haloes continues to grow
well after mergers conclude; however, the most significant contribution comes
from stars formed recently before the merger. The orbital analysis of the
HESTIA galaxies suggests that wedges in Rmax-Zmax space are mainly populated by
the stars born in between significant mergers.

is driven by the tremendous amount of high-quality data delivered by Gaia,
which has revealed a number of substructures potentially linked to several
ancient accretion events. In this work, aiming to explore the phase-space
structure of accreted stars, we analyze six M31/MW analogues from the HESTIA
suite of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations of the Local Group. We
found that all the HESTIA galaxies experience a few dozen mergers but only 1-4
mergers have the stellar mass ratio >0.2 where, depending on the halo
definition, the most massive merger contributes from 20% to 70% of the total
stellar halo. Individual merger remnants show diverse density distributions at
z=0, significantly overlapping with each other and with the in-situ stars in
the ELz, UV and RVphi coordinates. The mergers debris often change their
position in the ELz with time due to the galactic mass growth and the
non-axisymmetry of the potential. In agreement with previous works, we show
that even individual merger debris exhibit a number of distinct ELz features.
In the UV plane, all HESTIA galaxies reveal radially hot, non-rotating or
weakly counter-rotating, Gaia-Sausage-like features. We found an age gradient
in Elz space for the individual debris, where the youngest stars, formed in the
inner regions of accreting systems, deposit to the innermost regions of the
host. The bulk of these stars is being formed during the last stages of
accretion, making it possible to date the merger. In actions space (Jr, Jz,
J\phi), the mergers debris do not appear as isolated substructures but are
instead scattered over a large parameters area and overlapping with the in-situ
stars. We also introduce a purely kinematic space (Jz/Jr-eccentricity), where
different merger debris can be disentangled better from each other and from the
in-situ stars.

emphasis detection, followed by a translation model. The translated text is
then synthesized by a Text-to-Speech model that recreates the original emphases
mapped from the original sentence. The resulting synthetic voice is then mapped
back to the original speakers' voice using a voice conversion model. Finally,
to synchronize the lips of the speaker with the translated audio, a conditional
generative adversarial network-based model generates frames of adapted lip
movements with respect to the input face image as well as the output of the

our design, we present a user study of the complete system as well as separate
evaluations of the single components. Since there is no available dataset to
evaluate our whole system, we collect a test set and evaluate our system on

involving an entropy current with non-negative divergence by including the
arbitrary non-minimal coupling of scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields with gravity.
In recent works, the construction of entropy current to prove the linearized
second law rested on an important assumption about the possible matter
couplings to gravity: the corresponding matter stress tensor was assumed to
satisfy the null energy conditions. However, the null energy condition can be
violated, even classically, when the non-minimal coupling of matter fields to
gravity is considered. Considering small dynamical perturbations around
stationary black holes in diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity with
non-minimal coupling to scalar or gauge fields, we prove that an entropy
current with non-negative divergence can still be constructed. The additional
non-minimal couplings that we have incorporated contribute to the entropy
current, which may even survive in the equilibrium limit. We also obtain a
spatial current on the horizon apart from the entropy density in
out-of-equilibrium situations. We achieve this by using a boost symmetry of the
near horizon geometry, which constraints the off-shell structure of a specific
component of the equations of motion with newer terms due to the non-minimal
couplings. The final expression for the entropy current is $U(1)$
gauge-invariant for gauge fields coupled to gravity. We explicitly check that
the entropy current obtained from our abstract arguments is consistent with the
expressions already available in the literature for specific model theories
involving non-minimal coupling of matter with higher derivative theories of
gravity. Finally, we also argue that the physical process version of the first
law holds for these theories with arbitrary non-minimal matter couplings.

considered to be produced by Comptonization in the hot corona. The corona and
its interaction with the disc play an essential role in the evolution of the
system and are potentially responsible for many observed features. However many
intrinsic properties of the corona are still poorly understood, especially for
the geometrical configurations. The traditional spectral fitting method is not
powerful enough to distinguish various configurations. In this paper we intent
to investigate the possible configurations by modeling the polarization
properties of X-ray radiations. The geometries of the corona include the slab,
sphere and cylinder. The simulations are implemented through the publicly
available code, LEMON, which can deal with the polarized radiative transfer and
different electron distributions readily. The results demonstrate clearly that
the observed polarizations are dependent on the geometry of the corona heavily.
The slab-like corona produces the highest polarization degrees, the following
are the cylinder and sphere. One of the interesting things is that the
polarization degrees first increase gradually and then decrease with the
increase of photon energy. For slab geometry there exists a zero point where
the polarization vanishes and the polarization angle rotates for $90^\circ$.
These results may potentially be verified by the upcoming missions for
polarized X-ray observations, such as $IXPE$ and $eXTP$.

pair of self-stabilizing diffusions and of their related particle
approximations. These asymptotic are considered in a peculiar framework where
diffusions evolve in a double-wells landscape and where collisions manifest due
to the combined action of the Brownian motions driving each diffusion and the
action of a self-stabilizing kernel. As the Brownian effects vanish, we show
that first collision-times grow at an explicit exponential rate and that the
related collision-locations persist at a special point in space. These results
are mainly obtained by linking collision phenomena for diffusion processes with
exit-time problems of random perturbed dynamical systems, and by exploiting
Freidlin-Wentzell's LDP approach to solve these exit-time problems.
Importantly, we consider two distinctive situations: the one-dimensional case
(where true collisions can be directly studied) and the general
multidimensional case (where collisions are required to be enlarged).

  Generalization in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning","ICLR2022 accepted paper",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The generalization of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods to
environments with unseen transition dynamics is an important yet challenging
problem. Existing methods try to extract environment-specified information $Z$
from past transition segments to make the dynamics prediction model
generalizable to different dynamics. However, because environments are not
labelled, the extracted information inevitably contains redundant information
unrelated to the dynamics in transition segments and thus fails to maintain a
crucial property of $Z$: $Z$ should be similar in the same environment and
dissimilar in different ones. As a result, the learned dynamics prediction
function will deviate from the true one, which undermines the generalization
ability. To tackle this problem, we introduce an interventional prediction
module to estimate the probability of two estimated $\hat{z}_i, \hat{z}_j$
belonging to the same environment. Furthermore, by utilizing the $Z$'s
invariance within a single environment, a relational head is proposed to
enforce the similarity between $\hat{{Z}}$ from the same environment. As a
result, the redundant information will be reduced in $\hat{Z}$. We empirically
show that $\hat{{Z}}$ estimated by our method enjoy less redundant information
than previous methods, and such $\hat{{Z}}$ can significantly reduce dynamics
prediction errors and improve the performance of model-based RL methods on
zero-shot new environments with unseen dynamics. The codes of this method are

where a user has a collection of samples from a candidate probability measure

useful property of KSD is that it may be calculated with samples from only the
candidate measure and without knowledge of the normalising constant of the
target measure. KSD has been employed in a range of settings including
goodness-of-fit testing, parametric inference, MCMC output assessment and
generative modelling. Two main issues with current KSD methodology are (i) the
lack of applicability beyond the finite dimensional Euclidean setting and (ii)
a lack of clarity on what influences KSD performance. This paper provides a
novel spectral representation of KSD which remedies both of these, making KSD
applicable to Hilbert-valued data and revealing the impact of kernel and Stein
operator choice on the KSD. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
methodology by performing goodness-of-fit tests for various Gaussian and

with known redshifts for our study. Due to their low redshifts and the strong
degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$ and $\Omega_bh^2$, however, this catalog could
not provide a good constraint on the helium abundance. Then, we simulated 500
low redshift FRB mock data with $z\in[0,\,1.5]$ to forecast the constraining
ability on $Y_{\rm He}$. In order to break the degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$
and $\Omega_bh^2$ further, we introduced the shift parameters of the Planck
measurement $(R,l_A,\Omega_bh^2)$ as a prior, where $\Omega_bh^2$ represents
the baryon density parameter, and $R$ and $l_A$ correspond to the scaled
distance to recombination and the angular scale of the sound horizon at
recombination, respectively. We obtained the standard deviation for the helium
abundance: $\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.025$. Finally, we considered 2000 higher
redshift FRB data with the redshift distribution of $[0,\,3]$ and found that
the constraining power for $Y_{\rm He}$ would be improved by more than 2 times,
$\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.011$, which indicates that the FRB data with high
redshift can provide a better constraint on the helium abundance. Hopefully,
large FRB samples with high redshift from the Square Kilometre Array can
provide high-precision measurements of the helium abundance in the near future.

method often suffers from the divergence at band degeneracy and optical zeros

This generalized Wilson loop method avoids the above cumbersome challenges and

well approximate certain classes of functions in terms of the function value.

prove that large ConvResNets can not only approximate a target function in

Moreover, we extend our theory to approximating functions supported on a
low-dimensional manifold. Our theory partially justifies the benefits of using
deep and wide networks in practice. Numerical experiments on adversarial robust

assessing its performance on well understood simple cases that have either
known exact solutions or well understood expansions. These scenarios include
spherical configurations, isolated plane waves, and two interacting plane
waves: initial conditions that are very different from the Gaussian random
fields used for training. We find our model generalizes well to these well

physical principles and learned the nonlinear mode couplings from the complex,
random Gaussian training data. These tests also provide a useful diagnostic for
finding the model's strengths and weaknesses, and identifying strategies for
model improvement. We also test the model on initial conditions that contain
only transverse modes, a family of modes that differ not only in their phases

orthogonal to the training set, the model fails completely. In addition to
these simple configurations, we evaluate the model's predictions for the

quantum oscillations in resistivity, elastic constant, and surface impedance,
which enabled us to determine the position of the Fermi energy. In combination
with the first-principles calculation, we revealed that the Weyl points are
located in the vicinity of the Fermi energy when the Eu spins are fully
polarized. Furthermore, we observed large anomalous Hall effect (Hall angle
$\Theta_{\mathrm{AH}}\sim0.07$) in the forced ferromagnetic phase, which is
consistent with this field variation of band structure.

on their low metallicities and coherent radial velocities, and four candidate
members for which only velocities are derived. In contrast to previous work, we
find that Grus I has a very low mean metallicity of $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle =
-2.62 \pm 0.11$ dex, making it one of the most metal-poor UFDs. Grus I has a
systemic radial velocity of $-143.5\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity
dispersion of $\sigma_{\text{rv}} = 2.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ which
results in a dynamical mass of $M_{1/2} (r_h) = 8^{+12}_{-4} \times 10^5$
M$_{\odot}$ and a mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ = $440^{+650}_{-250}$
M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$. Under the assumption of dynamical equilibrium, our
analysis confirms that Grus I is a dark-matter-dominated UFD (M/L $> 80$
M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$). However, we do not resolve a metallicity dispersion
($\sigma_{\text{[Fe/H]}} < 0.44$ dex). Our results indicate that Grus I is a
fairly typical UFD with parameters that agree with mass-metallicity and
metallicity-luminosity trends for faint galaxies. This agreement suggests that
Grus I has not lost an especially significant amount of mass from tidal
encounters with the Milky Way, in line with its orbital parameters.
Intriguingly, Grus I has among the lowest central density ($\rho_{1/2} \sim
3.5_{-2.1}^{+5.7} \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-3}$) of the UFDs that are not
known to be tidally disrupting. Models of the formation and evolution of UFDs
will need to explain the diversity of these central densities, in addition to
any diversity in the outer regions of these relic galaxies.

The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale
real-world residential data acquisition and long-term expert screening. In
order to address the issues and advance a benchmark dataset for various
intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of
smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset,

37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728 residential
buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for
residential community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative
layout design, morphological pattern recognition and spatial evaluation. To
validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community layout

computational tools to study the conformational states of proteins. Yet, these
two simulation methods suffer from the fact that without access to
supercomputing resources, the time and length scales at which these states
become detectable are difficult to achieve. One alternative to such methods is
based on encoding the atomistic trajectory of molecular dynamics as a shorthand
version devoid of physical particles, and then learning to propagate the
encoded trajectory through the use of artificial intelligence. Here we show
that a simple textual representation of the frames of molecular dynamics
trajectories as vectors of Ramachandran basin classes retains most of the
structural information of the full atomistic representation of a protein in
each frame, and can be used to generate equivalent atom-less trajectories
suitable to train different types of generative neural networks. In turn, the
trained generative models can be used to extend indefinitely the atom-less
dynamics or to sample the conformational space of proteins from their
representation in the models latent space. We define intuitively this
methodology as molecular dynamics without molecules, and show that it enables
to cover physically relevant states of proteins that are difficult to access

Predictive Exit framework for computation- and energy-efficient deep learning

establish the number of remaining layers to finish the inference), which
effectively reduces the network computation cost by exiting on time without
running every pre-placed exiting layer. Moreover, according to the number of
remaining layers, proper computing configurations (i.e., frequency and voltage)
are selected to execute the network to further save energy. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Predictive Exit achieves up to 96.2%

biomechanical knowledge of the optic nerve head (ONH) from a relatively large
population; (2) assess ONH robustness from a single optical coherence
tomography (OCT) scan of the ONH; (3) identify what critical three-dimensional
(3D) structural features make a given ONH robust.
  $\mathbf{Design}$: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
  $\mathbf{Methods}$: 316 subjects had their ONHs imaged with OCT before and
after acute intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation through ophthalmo-dynamometry.
IOP-induced lamina-cribrosa deformations were then mapped in 3D and used to
classify ONHs. Those with LC deformations superior to 4% were considered
fragile, while those with deformations inferior to 4% robust. Learning from
these data, we compared three AI algorithms to predict ONH robustness strictly
from a baseline (undeformed) OCT volume: (1) a random forest classifier; (2) an
autoencoder; and (3) a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN). The latter algorithm also
allowed us to identify what critical 3D structural features make a given ONH
robust.
  $\mathbf{Results}$: All 3 methods were able to predict ONH robustness from 3D
structural information alone and without the need to perform biomechanical
testing. The DGCNN (area under the receiver operating curve [AUC]: 0.76 $\pm$
0.08) outperformed the autoencoder (AUC: 0.70 $\pm$ 0.07) and the random forest
classifier (AUC: 0.69 $\pm$ 0.05). Interestingly, to assess ONH robustness, the
DGCNN mainly used information from the scleral canal and the LC insertion
sites.
  $\mathbf{Conclusions}$: We propose an AI-driven approach that can assess the
robustness of a given ONH solely from a single OCT scan of the ONH, and without
the need to perform biomechanical testing. Longitudinal studies should
establish whether ONH robustness could help us identify fast visual field loss
progressors.

  Recovery",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To solve inverse problems, plug-and-play (PnP) methods replace the proximal
step in a convex optimization algorithm with a call to an application-specific
denoiser, often implemented using a deep neural network (DNN). Although such
methods yield accurate solutions, they can be improved. For example, denoisers
are usually designed/trained to remove white Gaussian noise, but the denoiser
input error in PnP algorithms is usually far from white or Gaussian.
Approximate message passing (AMP) methods provide white and Gaussian denoiser
input error, but only when the forward operator is sufficiently random. In this
work, for Fourier-based forward operators, we propose a PnP algorithm based on
generalized expectation-consistent (GEC) approximation -- a close cousin of AMP
-- that offers predictable error statistics at each iteration, as well as a new
DNN denoiser that leverages those statistics. We apply our approach to magnetic

seeks to generalize patterns from the data. This task has been studied
extensively for traditional graph datasets such as knowledge graphs (KGs), with
representative techniques such as inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing
ILP methods typically assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary
relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other
applications such as video instructions, scene graphs and program executions.
While inductive logic reasoning is also beneficial for these applications,
applying ILP to the corresponding graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex
than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a
type of hypergraph with temporal events.
  In this work, we study two of such applications and propose to represent them
as hypergraphs with time intervals. To reason on this graph, we propose the
multi-start random B-walk that traverses this hypergraph. Combining it with a
path-consistency algorithm, we propose an efficient backward-chaining ILP

Technically, we propose a diffusion-curve based parametric icon representation,

well as quantization levels to achieve perceptual monotonicity and readability.

also approaches a de-sitter phase asymptotically. However, the crossing of the

spherical coordinates. In particular, we use pure quaternions to define a
spherical product. This product, which is inspired by the product of complex
numbers, add the angles and multiply the radii of the spherical coordinates. We
show that the algebraic structure of pure quaternions with the spherical
product is a commutative unital magma. Then, we present several generalizations
of the Mandelbrot set. Among them, we present a set that is visually identical
to the so-called Mandelbulb. We show that this set is bounded and that it can
be generated by an escape time algorithm. We also define another
generalization, the bulbic Mandelbrot set. We show that one of its 2D cuts has
the same dynamics as the Mandelbrot set and that we can generate this set only
with a quaternionic product, without using the spherical product.

  Autoencoders with Attention",,,,,"eess.SP cs.DB cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the digitization of energy systems, sensors and smart meters are
increasingly being used to monitor production, operation and demand. Detection
of anomalies based on smart meter data is crucial to identify potential risks
and unusual events at an early stage, which can serve as a reference for timely
initiation of appropriate actions and improving management. However, smart
meter data from energy systems often lack labels and contain noise and various
patterns without distinctively cyclical. Meanwhile, the vague definition of
anomalies in different energy scenarios and highly complex temporal
correlations pose a great challenge for anomaly detection. Many traditional
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms such as cluster-based or
distance-based models are not robust to noise and not fully exploit the
temporal dependency in a time series as well as other dependencies amongst
multiple variables (sensors). This paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly
detection method based on a Variational Recurrent Autoencoder with attention
mechanism. with ""dirty"" data from smart meters, our method pre-detects missing
values and global anomalies to shrink their contribution while training. This
paper makes a quantitative comparison with the VAE-based baseline approach and
four other unsupervised learning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
superiority. This paper further validates the proposed method by a real case
study of detecting the anomalies of water supply temperature from an industrial
heating plant.

inter-turn short circuit fault that uses electrical current signals. Electrical
current signal collected from permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is
subjected to different environmental and operational conditions. To solve these
problems, robust current signal imaging method and deep learning-based feature
extraction method are developed. The overall procedure includes the following
three key steps: (1) transformation of a time-series current signal to
two-dimensional image, (2) extracting features using convolutional neural
networks, and (3) calculating a health indicator using Mahalanobis distance.
Transformation of the time-series signal is based on recurrence plots (RP). The
proposed RP method develops from feature engineering that provides the dominant
fault feature representations in a robust way. The proposed RP is designed that
maximizes the features of inter-turn short fault and minimizes the effect of
noise from systems with various capacities. To demonstrate the validity of the
proposed method, two case studies are conducted using an artificial fault
seeded testbed with two different capacities of motor. By calculating the
feature using only the electrical current signal of the motor without the
parameters related to the capacity of the motor, the proposed feature can be
applied to motors with different capacities while maintaining the same
performance.

Before and after the flare activity the ultraviolet spectral lines show low,

studies. We detect prominent flare activity in three years. Before and after
this period there is a gradual clear decrease in the level of activity. The
reddening of II Peg was estimated from the 2200 Angstrom absorption feature. We

challenging to endow vocal assistants with advanced functionalities to
facilitate meeting management. In this context, a task like active speaker
detection can provide useful insights to model interaction between meeting
participants. Motivated by our application context related to advanced meeting
assistant, we want to combine audio and visual information to achieve the best
possible performance. In this paper, we propose two different types of fusion
for the detection of the active speaker, combining two visual modalities and an
audio modality through neural networks. For comparison purpose, classical
unsupervised approaches for audio feature extraction are also used. We expect
visual data centered on the face of each participant to be very appropriate for
detecting voice activity, based on the detection of lip and facial gestures.
Thus, our baseline system uses visual data and we chose a 3D Convolutional
Neural Network architecture, which is effective for simultaneously encoding
appearance and movement. To improve this system, we supplemented the visual
information by processing the audio stream with a CNN or an unsupervised
speaker diarization system. We have further improved this system by adding
visual modality information using motion through optical flow. We evaluated our
proposal with a public and state-of-the-art benchmark: the AMI corpus. We
analysed the contribution of each system to the merger carried out in order to
determine if a given participant is currently speaking. We also discussed the
results we obtained. Besides, we have shown that, for our application context,
adding motion information greatly improves performance. Finally, we have shown
that attention-based fusion improves performance while reducing the standard

  Robots","6 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual homing is a lightweight approach to robot visual navigation. Based
upon stored visual information of a home location, the navigation back to this
location can be accomplished from any other location in which this location is
visible by comparing home to the current image. However, a key challenge of
visual homing is that the target home location must be within the robot's field
of view (FOV) to start homing. Therefore, this work addresses such a challenge
by integrating blockchain technology into the visual homing navigation system.
Based on the decentralized feature of blockchain, the proposed solution enables
visual homing robots to share their visual homing information and synchronously
access the stored data (visual homing information) in the decentralized ledger
to establish the navigation path. The navigation path represents a per-robot
sequence of views stored in the ledger. If the home location is not in the FOV,
the proposed solution permits a robot to find another robot that can see the
home location and travel towards that desired location. The evaluation results
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of end-to-end
latency, throughput, and scalability.

However, in high-value, sensitive, or safety-critical applications such as
self-management for personalized health or food recommendation with a specific
purpose (e.g., allergy-aware recipe recommendations), their adoption is
unlikely. Firstly, the AI system needs to follow guidelines or well-defined
processes set by experts; the data alone will not be adequate. For example, to
diagnose the severity of depression, mental healthcare providers use Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). So if an AI system were to be used for diagnosis,
the medical guideline implied by the PHQ-9 needs to be used. Likewise, a
nutritionist's knowledge and steps would need to be used for an AI system that
guides a diabetic patient in developing a food plan. Second, the BlackBox
nature typical of many current AI systems will not work; the user of an AI

explanations constructed using concepts that humans can understand and are
familiar with. This is the key to eliciting confidence and trust in the AI

healthcare services, such as seeing doctors, medications or planned surgery.
Care deferral can be the result of patient decisions, service availability,
service limitations, or restrictions due to cost. Continual care deferral in
populations may lead to a decline in population health and compound health
issues leading to higher social and financial costs in the long term.
Consequently, identification of patients who may be at risk of deferring care
is important towards improving population health and reducing care total costs.
Additionally, minority and vulnerable populations are at a greater risk of care
deferral due to socioeconomic factors. In this paper, we (a) address the
problem of predicting care deferral for well-care visits; (b) observe that
social determinants of health are relevant explanatory factors towards
predicting care deferral, and (c) compute how fair the models are with respect
to demographics, socioeconomic factors and selected comorbidities. Many health
systems currently use rules-based techniques to retroactively identify patients
who previously deferred care. The objective of this model is to identify
patients at risk of deferring care and allow the health system to prevent care
deferrals through direct outreach or social determinant mediation.
