topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins
as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier

such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half
the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the
return amplitudes in the presence of ""space-like"" defects stretching around the
system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with
the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary
evolution in the presence of ""time-like"" defects that implement anti-periodic
and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired
localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly
construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We
also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single

of 3D surfaces, i.e. homeomorphic transformations from a 2D domain to surfaces.
Compared to prior work, we propose two major contributions. First, instead of
mapping a fixed 2D domain, such as a set of square patches, to the surface, we
learn a continuous 2D domain with arbitrary topology by optimizing a point
sampling distribution represented as a mixture of Gaussians. Second, we learn
consistent mappings in both directions: charts, from the 3D surface to 2D
domain, and parametrizations, their inverse. We demonstrate that this improves
the quality of the learned surface representation, as well as its consistency
in a collection of related shapes. It thus leads to improvements for
applications such as correspondence estimation, texture transfer, and
consistent UV mapping. As an additional technical contribution, we outline
that, while incorporating normal consistency has clear benefits, it leads to
issues in the optimization, and that these issues can be mitigated using a
simple repulsive regularization. We demonstrate that our contributions provide
better surface representation than existing baselines.

that of sample reusability: to what extent can samples selected for one learner
be reused by another? This paper explains why sample reusability is of

improved by importance-weighted active learning, and which obstacles to
universal reusability remain. With theoretical arguments and practical
demonstrations, this paper argues that universal reusability is impossible.
Because every active learning strategy must undersample some areas of the

more from a random sample selection. This paper describes several experiments
with importance-weighted active learning that show the impact of the

some pairs of classifiers -- there is sample reusability. Finally, this paper
explores the conditions that could guarantee the reusability between two

nearby elements to a discrete set of up to 2000 possible feasible operation

changes over time, the configuration of the station has to adapt. Our goal is
to minimize the necessary changes in the overall operation modes and related

interpretations and internal structure of experimentally-observed exotic
mesons. However, the overwhelming majority of tetraquark QCD sum-rule analyses
have been performed at leading order (LO), which raises questions about the
underlying theoretical uncertainties from higher-loop corrections. The impact
of next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative effects are systematically examined
in scalar ($J^{PC}=0^{++}$) isoscalar light-quark tetraquark systems where
comprehensive LO sum-rule analyses have been performed and NLO perturbative
corrections to the correlators have previously been calculated. Using the
scalar-isoscalar state as a detailed case study to illustrate the differences
between LO and NLO analyses, it is shown that NLO effects in individual Laplace
sum-rules are numerically significant and have an important role in improving
the reliability of the sum-rule analyses by widening the Borel window. However,
ratios of sum-rules are found to be less sensitive to NLO effects with the
additional advantage of cancelling the anomalous dimension that emerges from
the NLO corrections. NLO mass predictions based on these sum-rule ratios are
thus remarkably robust despite the slow perturbative convergence of the
underlying correlator. The mass predictions $0.52\,\text{GeV}< m_{\sigma}<
0.77\,\text{GeV}$ for the lightest scalar-isoscalar $\sigma$ state are in good
agreement with the four-quark interpretation of the $f_0(500)$, and the
relative coupling strengths of the $f_{0}(980)$ and $f_0(500)$ to the
tetraquark current agree with the pattern found in chiral Lagrangian analyses.
Effects of the $\sigma$ resonance width are studied for different models,
including resonance shapes inspired by chiral Lagrangians.

  are social and memory-guided",,,,,"q-bio.PE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  While previously thought to be uniquely human, cumulative cultural evolution
continues to be found in non-human animals. It occurs when an adaptive
innovation from an individual is repeatedly passed onto consecutive generations
through social learning. For example, pigeons who fly alone or in stable pairs
show relatively rigid sub-optimal routes, but gradually improve route
efficiency over generations of pairs in which experienced members are swapped
for naive ones. This raises the question of what the minimally required
cognitive architecture is for cumulative cultural evolution to emerge. Here, I
aimed to answer this question in artificial agents who employ three main
functions: goal-direction, social proximity, and route memory. At the optima
for efficiency and generational efficiency improvement, agents replicated
cumulative culture observed in pigeons. Naive individuals benefitted from being
paired with an experienced navigator, because it allowed them to follow an
established route. Experienced navigators also benefitted from being paired
with a naive individual due to regression to the goal. Unhindered by route
memory, the naive agent's heading was more likely to err towards the goal.
Because of their need for social proximity, experienced agents were biased
towards their naive counterparts while following a memorised route. Thus, the
presence of goal-erring naive agents improved pair's route efficiency. The
resulting incremental improvements over generations meet all core criteria in
current frameworks of cumulative cultural evolution, suggesting that
rudimentary cumulative optimisation is an evolutionary mechanism that emerges
even in simple systems that prefer social proximity and have a memory capacity.

solutions regarding the relationship between baryons and dark matter in
Ultra-Diffuse galaxies. But there seems to be a quite unanimous belief that, if
such very low dark matter content is confirmed and extended to other similar
galactic objects, it might be a deathblow to theories which modify and extend
General Relativity. Deficient dark matter galaxies thus represent a fertile
ground to test both standard dark matter and modified gravity theories. In this
work, we consider a specific Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar Tensor model to
study the velocity dispersion of ten compact globular clusters-like objects
associated with NGC1052-DF2 to infer the dynamical mass of the galaxy. Due to
the partial breaking of the corresponding screening mechanism, this model can
possibly have large cosmological scale effects influencing the dynamics of
smaller structures like galaxies. We consider two scenarios: one in which the
model only describes dark energy; and one in which it additionally entirely
substitutes dark matter. We find that the best model to explain data is the one
in which we have General Relativity and only stellar contribution. But while in
former scenario General Relativity is still statistically (Bayesian) favoured,
in the latter one the alternative model is as much successful and effective as
General Relativity in matching observations. Thus, we can conclude that even
objects like NGC1052-DF2 are not in contrast, and are not obstacles, to the
study and the definition of a reliable alternative to General Relativity.

such systems, the asymptotic behaviour of solutions \emph{stable at infinity},
that is approaching a stable spatially homogeneous equilibrium as $|x|$ goes to
$+\infty$, is investigated. A partial description of the global asymptotic
behaviour of such a solution is provided, depending on the mean speed of growth
of the spatial domain where the solution is not close to this equilibrium, in
relation with the \emph{asymptotic energy} of the solution. If this mean speed
is zero, then the asymptotic energy is nonnegative, and the time derivative
$u_t$ goes to $0$ uniformly in space. If conversely the mean speed is nonzero,
then the asymptotic energy equals $-\infty$. This result is called upon in a
companion paper where the global behaviour of radially symmetric solutions
stable at infinity is described. The proof relies mainly on energy estimates in
the laboratory frame and in frames travelling at a small nonzero velocity.

Ansatz algorithm with a Hamming-weight-preserving XY mixer (XY-QAOA) on

restrict the quantum evolution to the in-constraint subspace, using up to 20
qubits and a two-qubit gate depth of up to 159. We demonstrate the necessity of
directly encoding the constraints into the quantum circuit by showing the
trade-off between the in-constraint probability and the quality of the solution
that is implicit if unconstrained quantum optimization methods are used. We
show that this trade-off makes choosing good parameters difficult in general.
We compare XY-QAOA to the Layer Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm,
which has a highly expressive constant-depth circuit, and the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We discuss the respective trade-offs of the
algorithms and implications for their execution on near-term quantum hardware.

have been highly influenced by Transformer-based object detector (i.e., DETR).
Nevertheless, most of them directly map parametric interaction queries into a
set of HOI predictions through vanilla Transformer in a one-stage manner. This
leaves rich inter- or intra-interaction structure under-exploited. In this
work, we design a novel Transformer-style HOI detector, i.e., Structure-aware
Transformer over Interaction Proposals (STIP), for HOI detection. Such design
decomposes the process of HOI set prediction into two subsequent phases, i.e.,
an interaction proposal generation is first performed, and then followed by
transforming the non-parametric interaction proposals into HOI predictions via
a structure-aware Transformer. The structure-aware Transformer upgrades vanilla
Transformer by encoding additionally the holistically semantic structure among
interaction proposals as well as the locally spatial structure of human/object
within each interaction proposal, so as to strengthen HOI predictions.
Extensive experiments conducted on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks have
demonstrated the effectiveness of STIP, and superior results are reported when
comparing with the state-of-the-art HOI detectors. Source code is available at

newly-minted networks for video recognition due to the large variations and
complexities in video data. In this paper, we present MLP-3D networks, a novel
MLP-like 3D architecture for video recognition. Specifically, the architecture
consists of MLP-3D blocks, where each block contains one MLP applied across
tokens (i.e., token-mixing MLP) and one MLP applied independently to each token
(i.e., channel MLP). By deriving the novel grouped time mixing (GTM)
operations, we equip the basic token-mixing MLP with the ability of temporal
modeling. GTM divides the input tokens into several temporal groups and
linearly maps the tokens in each group with the shared projection matrix.
Furthermore, we devise several variants of GTM with different grouping
strategies, and compose each variant in different blocks of MLP-3D network by
greedy architecture search. Without the dependence on convolutions or attention

delays the occurrence of liquid--solid contact. For impacts on smooth

off with dynamics identical to that observed for impacts on superamphiphobic

restitution. In the case of highly viscous or very thin films, the impact
dynamics is not affected by the presence of the viscous film. Within this
substrate--independent limit, bouncing is suppressed once the drop viscosity
exceeds a critical value as on superamphiphobic substrates. For thicker or less
viscous films, both the drop and film properties influence the rebound dynamics
and conspire to inhibit bouncing above a critical film thickness. This
substrate--dependent regime also admits a limit, for low viscosity drops, in
which the film properties alone determine the limits of repellency.

consumer products containing polymer additives exhibit weakly rate-thickening
responses in the final stages of capillarity-driven thinning, where a large
accumulated strain and high extensional strain rate alter the thinning dynamics
of the slender liquid filament. Consequently, the capillarity-driven thinning
dynamics typically feature two distinct regions at the early and late stages of
the filament breakup process, each dominated by distinct mechanisms. These
features have been incorporated in a simple Inelastic Rate-Thickening (IRT)
model with linear and quadratic contributions to the constitutive stress-strain
rate relationship, where the apparent extensional viscosity slowly thickens at
high strain rates. We numerically compute the thinning dynamics of the IRT
model assuming an axially-slender axisymmetric filament and no fluid inertia.
The computational results motivate a new self-similar solution dominated by the
second-order stress obtained through a similarity transformation. The new
asymptotic solution leads to a self-similar filament shape that is more slender
than the Newtonian counterpart and results in a quadratic thinning of the
mid-point radius of the filament with time to breakup close to singularity. A
new and distinct asymptotic geometric correction factor, $X\approx 0.5778$ is
obtained, from which a more accurate true extensional viscosity can be
recovered from an interpolated time-varying geometric correction factor based
on the magnitudes of different stress components. Finally, we propose a
statistics-based protocol to select the best-fit constitutive model using a
parameter-free criterion, enabling us to quantify the extensional rheological
behavior through capillarity-driven thinning dynamics more systematically on
complex rate-thickening viscoelastic fluids.

their predictions is an impediment to their widespread use. We distinguish two
types of learnable uncertainty: model uncertainty due to a lack of training
data and noise-induced observational uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks use
solid mathematical foundations to learn the model uncertainties of their
predictions. The observational uncertainty can be calculated by adding one
layer to these networks and augmenting their loss functions. Our contribution
is to apply these uncertainty concepts to predictive process monitoring tasks
to train uncertainty-based models to predict the remaining time and outcomes.
Our experiments show that uncertainty estimates allow more and less accurate
predictions to be differentiated and confidence intervals to be constructed in
both regression and classification tasks. These conclusions remain true even in
early stages of running processes. Moreover, the deployed techniques are fast
and produce more accurate predictions. The learned uncertainty could increase
users' confidence in their process prediction systems, promote better
cooperation between humans and these systems, and enable earlier
implementations with smaller datasets.

game-theoretic approach. Each individual plays a coordination game with its
neighbors and decides which to adopt to maximize its payoff. As products are
used in conjunction with others and through repeated interactions, individuals
are more interested in their long-term benefits and tend to show
trustworthiness to others to maximize their long-term payoffs. To capture such
trustworthy behavior, we deviate from the expected utility theory and use a new
notion of rationality based on limited-trust equilibrium (LTE). By
incorporating such a notion into the diffusion model, we analyze the
convergence of emerging dynamics to their equilibrium points using a mean-field
approximation. We study the equilibrium state and the convergence rate of the
diffusion process using the absorption probability and the expected absorption
time of a reduced-size absorbing Markov chain. We also show that the LTE
diffusion model under the best-response strategy can be converted to the
well-known linear threshold model. Simulations show that when agents behave
trustworthily, their long-term payoffs will increase significantly compared to
the case when they are solely self-interested. Moreover, the Markov chain
analysis provides a good estimation of the convergence property over random
networks.

from below, in agreement with first-principles studies which do not take the

however, the presence of a gap induces an increase of the speed of sound above
its asymptotic value. Importantly, even if gap-induced corrections to the
pressure may appear small, we find that derivatives of the gap with respect to
the chemical potential can still be sizeable and lead to a qualitative change
of the density dependence of the speed of sound. Taking into account
constraints on the density dependence of the speed of sound at low densities,
our general considerations suggest the existence of a maximum in the speed of

galaxies, pre-passage paired galaxies have similar $f_{\text{HI}}$, SFR and
$\rm SFE_{\text{HI}}$, while pairs during pericentric passage have weakly
decreased $f_{\text{HI}}$ ($-0.10\pm0.05$ dex), significantly enhanced SFR

categorical equivalences, (2) maps inducing an isomorphism on fundamental
groups and an R-homology equivalence between universal covers, and (3)
R-homology equivalences. Analogously, for any field F, we construct three model

role of a universal task layer. We propose a semi-causal language modeling
objective to jointly pretrain the interface and the modular encoders. We
subsume the advantages and capabilities from both causal and non-causal
modeling, thereby combining the best of two worlds. Specifically, the proposed
method not only inherits the capabilities of in-context learning and open-ended
generation from causal language modeling, but also is conducive to finetuning
because of the bidirectional encoders. More importantly, our approach
seamlessly unlocks the combinations of the above capabilities, e.g., enabling
in-context learning or instruction following with finetuned encoders.
Experimental results across various language-only and vision-language

of two steady states in a double-well potential. However, this interpretation
fails in the quantum-mechanical perspective, where a single unique steady state
is allowed in the whole parameter space. Here, we measure the non-equilibrium
dynamics of a superconducting Duffing oscillator and reconcile the classical
and quantum descriptions in a unified picture of quantum metastability. We
demonstrate that the two classically regarded steady states are in fact
metastable states. They have a remarkably long lifetime in the classical
hysteresis regime but must eventually relax into a single unique steady state
allowed by quantum mechanics. By engineering the lifetime of the metastable
states sufficiently large, we observe a first-order dissipative phase
transition, which mimics a sudden change of the mean field in a 11-site
Bose-Hubbard lattice. We also reveal the two distinct phases of the transition
by quantum state tomography, namely a coherent-state phase and a squeezed-state

history of the dwarfs, indicating that the interaction with the MW is causing
them. Dwarfs that are close to the MW and moving towards their orbits
pericentres show, on average, larger velocity gradients. On the other hand,
dwarfs that have recently left their orbits pericentres show no significant
gradients. Lastly, dwarfs located at large Galactocentric distances show
gradients with an intermediate intensity. Our results would indicate that the
torque caused by the strong tidal forces exerted by the MW induces a strong
velocity gradient when the dwarfs approach their orbits pericentres. During the
pericentre passage, the rapid change in the forces direction would disrupt such
gradient, which may steadily recover as the galaxies recede. We assess our

exploiting such priors in neural rendering is highly non-trivial: while

a soft symmetry constraint to the 3D geometry and material properties, having
factored appearance into lighting, albedo colour and reflectivity. We evaluate

estimation network is a convolutional neural network with a combined

quantitative spatial alignment between parametric $K_{i}$ and $V_{b}$ images

distinguish malignant from benign hypermetabolic regions of interest. Once

around 460 times faster than the conventional registration baseline, showing
its potential to be easily applied in clinical settings.

propose a learning framework StructureViT (SViT for short), which demonstrates
how utilizing the structure of a small number of images only available during

both images and videos contain structured information, we enrich a transformer
model with a set of \emph{object tokens} that can be used across images and
videos. Second, the scene representations of individual frames in video should
""align"" with those of still images. This is achieved via a \emph{Frame-Clip
Consistency} loss, which ensures the flow of structured information between
images and videos. We explore a particular instantiation of scene structure,
namely a \emph{Hand-Object Graph}, consisting of hands and objects with their
locations as nodes, and physical relations of contact/no-contact as edges. SViT
shows strong performance improvements on multiple video understanding tasks and

that geometry in a quantum theory of gravity should likewise not be a linear
observable. This allows for linear dependencies between states with distinct
geometries. We explore linear dependencies between certain states with simple
geometric duals: states made up of $n$ copies of a thermofield double state and
the states obtained from this one by permuting the $n$ right hand sides. There

Bayesian model that comes with naturally well-calibrated variance estimations.
However, it is challenging to learn a stand-alone global GP since merging local
kernels leads to privacy leakage. To preserve privacy, previous works that
consider federated GPs avoid learning a global model by focusing on the
personalized setting or learning an ensemble of local models. We present
Federated Bayesian Neural Regression (FedBNR), an algorithm that learns a
scalable stand-alone global federated GP that respects clients' privacy. We
incorporate deep kernel learning and random features for scalability by
defining a unifying random kernel. We show this random kernel can recover any
stationary kernel and many non-stationary kernels. We then derive a principled
approach of learning a global predictive model as if all client data is
centralized. We also learn global kernels with knowledge distillation methods
for non-identically and independently distributed (non-i.i.d.) clients.

duration ($t\geq81,200\, GM/c^3$) simulations which achieve mass accretion
rates $\gtrsim 11$ times the Eddington rate and produce thermal synchrotron
spectra and images of their jets. The jet reaches a maximum velocity of $v/c
\approx 0.5-0.9$, but the density weighted outflow velocity is $\sim0.2-0.35c$.
Gas flowing beyond the funnel wall expands conically and drives a strong shock
at the jet head while variable mass ejection along the jet axis results in
internal shocks and dissipation. For a $T_i/T_e=1$ model, the
radio/submillimeter spectra peak at $>100$ GHz and the luminosity increases
with BH spin, exceeding $\sim 10^{41} \, \rm{erg\, s^{-1}}$ in the brightest
models. The emission is extremely sensitive to $T_i/T_e$ as some models show an
order of magnitude decrease in the peak frequency and up to four orders of
magnitude decline in their radio/submillimeter luminosity as $T_i/T_e$
approaches 20. Assuming a maximum VLBI baseline distance of $10 \
{\rm{G}}\lambda$, 230 GHz images of $T_i/T_e=1$ models shows that the jet head
may be bright enough for its motion to be captured with the EHT (ngEHT) at
$D\lesssim110$ (180) Mpc at the $5\sigma$ significance level. Resolving
emission from internal shocks requires $D\lesssim45$ Mpc for both the EHT or

However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep
networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and
thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be
unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling:
instead of relying on model confidence, we instead measure whether an unlabeled
sample is likely to be ""in-distribution""; i.e., close to the current training
data. To classify whether an unlabeled sample is ""in-distribution"" or
""out-of-distribution"", we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution
detection literature. As training progresses and more unlabeled samples become
in-distribution and contribute to training, the combined labeled and
pseudo-labeled data can better approximate the true distribution to improve the
model. Experiments demonstrate that our energy-based pseudo-labeling method,
albeit conceptually simple, significantly outperforms confidence-based methods
on imbalanced SSL benchmarks, and achieves competitive performance on
class-balanced data. For example, it produces a 4-6% absolute accuracy
improvement on CIFAR10-LT when the imbalance ratio is higher than 50. When

category. This paper presents MaskDistill: a novel framework for unsupervised
semantic segmentation based on three key ideas. First, we advocate a
data-driven strategy to generate object masks that serve as a pixel grouping
prior for semantic segmentation. This approach omits handcrafted priors, which
are often designed for specific scene compositions and limit the applicability
of competing frameworks. Second, MaskDistill clusters the object masks to
obtain pseudo-ground-truth for training an initial object segmentation model.
Third, we leverage this model to filter out low-quality object masks. This
strategy mitigates the noise in our pixel grouping prior and results in a clean
collection of masks which we use to train a final segmentation model. By
combining these components, we can considerably outperform previous works for
unsupervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL (+11% mIoU) and COCO (+4% mask
AP50). Interestingly, as opposed to existing approaches, our framework does not
latch onto low-level image cues and is not limited to object-centric datasets.
The code and models will be made available.

Similar to recent observations of SN 2009ip and SN 2015bh, SN 2016jbu has not

there is a lack of on-going dust formation. We find SN 2016jbu is fading slower

2009ip. The late time light curve displays a non-linear decline and follows on
from a re-brightening event that occurred $\sim$8 months after peak brightness,
suggesting CSM interaction continues to dominate SN 2016jbu. While our optical
observations are plausibly consistent with a surviving, hot, dust-enshrouded

COSMOS2020, other galaxies can be processed through SOM to obtain an estimate
of their stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Both quantities result to
be in good agreement with independent measurements derived from more extended
photometric baseline, and also their combination (i.e., the SFR vs. stellar

previous studies. We discuss the advantages of this method compared to
traditional SED fitting, highlighting the impact of having, instead of the
usual synthetic templates, a collection of empirical SEDs built by the SOM in a
""data-driven"" way. Such an approach also allows, even for extremely large data

which allows Ly$\alpha$ escape from high column density neutral medium with low
dust content. In eLARS01, high intensity Ly$\alpha$ emission is located in
regions of low column density HI, below the HI data sensitivity limit
($<2\times10^{20}\,$cm$^{-2}$). The perturbed ISM distribution with low column
density gas in front of the Ly$\alpha$ emission region plays an important role
in the escape. In both galaxies, the faint Ly$\alpha$ emission ($\sim
1\times10^{-16}$erg.s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$) traces intermediate
H$\alpha$ emission regions where HI is found, regardless of the dust content.
Dust seems to modulate, but not prevent, the formation of a faint Ly$\alpha$

distribution and require comparison with models to be extracted. These models
must contain a synthetic stellar population and, where infrared data is to be
used, also consider prescriptions for energy reprocessing and re-emission by
dust. While many such models have been constructed, there are few analyses of
the impact of stellar population model choice on derived dust parameters, or
vice versa. Here we apply a simple framework to compare the impact of these
choices, combining three commonly-used stellar population synthesis models and
three dust emission models. We compare fits to the ultraviolet to far-infrared
spectral energy distributions of a validation sample of infrared-luminous
galaxies. We find that including different physics, such as binary stellar
evolution, in the stellar synthesis model can introduce biases and
uncertainties in the derived parameters of the dust and stellar emission
models, largely due to differences in the far-ultraviolet emission available
for reprocessing. This may help to reconcile the discrepancy between the cosmic
star formation rate and stellar mass density histories. Notably the inclusion
of a dusty stellar birth cloud component in the dust emission model provides
more flexibility in accommodating the stellar population model, as its
reemission is highly sensitive to the ultraviolet radiation field spectrum and
density. Binary populations favour a longer birth cloud dissipation timescale
than is found when assuming only single star population synthesis.

considers radiative cooling (including that induced by dust) and a
state-of-the-art population synthesis model for the coeval cluster. As shown
before, a superbubble embedded into a clumpy medium becomes highly distorted,
expanding mostly due to the hot gas streaming through low density channels. Our
results indicate that in the case of massive ($\sim10^7$M$_{\odot}$) molecular
clouds, hosting a super star cluster ($\sim5.6\times10^5$M$_{\odot}$), grain
growth increments the dust mass at a rate $\sim4.8\times10^{-5}$M$_{\odot}$

levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a
conformally invariant trans-Planckian phase and a sub-Planckian or Higgs phase
described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos
evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first
phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness,
and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by
means of Weyl conformal invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of
the theory. In the second phase, once conformal symmetry is spontaneously
broken, logarithmic quantum corrections to the action make both the primordial
tensor spectrum (from graviton fluctuations) and the scalar spectrum (from
thermal fluctuations) quasi scale invariant. Although nonlocal quantum gravity
is an explicit realization of this scenario, any finite conformal theory with
quadratic limit would yield the same results. In particular, the value of the
scalar spectral index only depends on two parameters and is consistent with
observations. The theory also predicts a positive tensor spectral index $n_{\rm

evolution, across cosmic times, of their progenitors' properties and of their
environment. The LGRB formation rate and the luminosity function, with its
redshift evolution, are derived by reproducing the largest set of observations
collected in the last four decades, namely the observer-frame prompt emission
properties of GRB samples detected by the Fermi and Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory (CGRO) satellites and the redshift, luminosity and energy
distributions of flux-limited, redshift complete, samples of GRBs detected by
Swift. The model that best reproduces all these constraints consists of a GRB
formation rate increasing with redshift $\propto (1+z)^{3.2}$, i.e. steeper
than the star formation rate, up to $z\sim3$ followed by a decrease
$\propto(1+z)^{-3}$. On top of this, our model predicts also a moderate
evolution of the characteristic luminosity function break $\propto(1+z)^{0.6}$.
Models with only luminosity or rate evolution are excluded at $>5\sigma$
significance. The cosmic rate evolution of LGRBs is interpreted as their
preference to occur in environments with metallicity $12+\log(\rm O/H)<8.6$,
consistently with theoretical models and host galaxy observations. The LGRB
rate at $z=0$, accounting for their collimation, is $\rho_0=79^{+57}_{-33}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ (68% confidence interval). This corresponds to $\sim$1\%
of broad-line Ibc supernovae producing a successful jet in the local Universe.
This fraction increases up to $\sim$7% at $z\ge3$. Finally, we estimate that at

feedback in simulations of galaxy evolution. Rather than building a model which
attempts to match idealized, small-scale simulations or analytic
approximations, we rely on direct observational measurements of the time-scales
over which star-forming molecular clouds are disrupted by early feedback. We
combine observations of the spatial de-correlation between molecular gas and
star formation tracers on $\sim100$~pc scales with an analytic framework for
the expansion of feedback fronts driven by arbitrary sources or mechanisms, and
use these to constrain the time-scale and momentum injection rate by early
feedback. This allows us to directly inform our model for feedback from these
observations, sidestepping the complexity of multiple feedback mechanisms and
their interaction below the resolution scale. We demonstrate that this new
model has significant effects on the spatial clustering of star formation, the
structure of the ISM, and the driving of outflows from the galactic plane,
while preserving the overall regulation of the galaxy-integrated star formation
rate. We find that this new feedback model results in galaxies that regulate
star formation through the rapid disruption of star-forming clouds, rather than
by highly efficient, global galactic outflows. We also demonstrate that these
results are robust to stochasticity, degraded numerical resolution, changes in
the star formation model parameters, and variations in the single free model
parameter that is unconstrained by observations.

in observations. The C$^+$ mass is only poorly affected by stellar feedback but
the [CII] luminosity increases by $50 - 85$ per cent compared to runs without

We obtain, for both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, no clear trend of the luminosity

large scatter. Moreover, we show that assuming chemical equilibrium results in
an overestimation of H$_2$ and CO masses of up to 110 and 30 per cent,

heterostructures, moir\'e patterns emerge from twisted interfaces or from

positions is a direct, generic consequence of the moir\'e pattern, with many
implications for the physical properties. Moir\'e driven atomic relaxation may
be naively thought to be restricted to the interfacial layers and thus
irrelevant for multi-layered heterostructures. However, we provide experimental
evidence for the importance of the three dimensional nature of the relaxation
in two types of van der Waals heterostructures: First, in multi-layer graphene
twisted on graphite at small twist angles ($\theta\approx0.14^\circ$) we
observe propagation of relaxation domains even beyond 18 graphene layers.
Second, we show how for multi-layer PdTe$_2$ on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the moir\'e
lattice constant depends on the number of PdTe$_2$ layers. Motivated by the
experimental findings, we developed a continuum approach to model multi-layered
relaxation processes based on the generalized stacking fault energy functional
given by ab-initio simulations. Leveraging the continuum property of the
approach enables us to access large scale regimes and achieve agreement with
our experimental data for both systems. Furthermore it is well known that the
electronic structure of graphene sensitively depends on local lattice
deformations. Therefore we study the impact of multi-layered relaxation on the
local density of states of the twisted graphitic system. We identify measurable
implications for the system, experimentally accessible by scanning tunneling
microscopy. Our multi-layered relaxation approach is not restricted to the

of variability with multiple peaks occurring at time intervals similar to the

of the energy is released at high energies above 10 keV while we found no
cyclotron absorption line in the spectrum. Analysis of the spectral evolution
during the outburst, we find that the spectrum is softer-when-brighter, which
in turn reveals that the system is probably in the super-critical regime where
the accretion column is formed. This places an upper limit to the magnetic
field of the system of the order of 7$\times$10$^{11}$ G. The spin-evolution of
the neutron star (NS) during the outburst is consistent with an NS with a low
magnetic field ($\sim{5}\times$10$^{11}$ G), while there is evident orbital
modulation which we modelled and derived the orbital parameters. We found the

prepare all fermionic Gaussian states respecting the symmetries of the circuit.
Leveraging these results, we numerically study the interplay between these
symmetries and the locality of the target state, and find that an absence of
symmetries makes nonlocal states easier to prepare. An efficient classical
simulation of Gaussian states, with system sizes up to $80$ and deep circuits,
is employed to study the behavior of the circuit when it is overparameterized.
In this regime of optimization, we find that the number of iterations to
converge to the solution scales linearly with system size. Moreover, we observe
that the number of iterations to converge to the solution decreases
exponentially with the depth of the circuit, until it saturates at a depth
which is quadratic in system size. Finally, we conclude that the improvement in
the optimization can be explained in terms of better local linear
approximations provided by the gradients.

low-power jet fed from hot halo accretion. In more massive systems
($M_\mathrm{200}\geq 10^{14}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), hot halo accretion is
insufficient to quench the galaxies, or to keep them quenched after the first
cooling episode. These galaxies experience multiple episodes of gas cooling,
star formation and jet feedback. In the most massive galaxy cluster that we
simulate ($M_\mathrm{200}=10^{15}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find peak cold gas
masses of $10^{10}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and peak star formation rates of a few
times $100$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These values are achieved
during strong cooling flows, which also trigger the strongest jets with peak
powers of $10^{47}$ $\mathrm{erg}\hspace{0.3mm}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These jets
subsequently shut off the cooling flows and any associated star formation.
Jet-inflated bubbles draw out low-entropy gas that subsequently forms dense
cooling filaments in their wakes, as seen in observations.

debated. Many studies have argued that much of hydrogen recombination energy,
which is radiated in relatively cool and optically-thin layers, might not
thermalise in the envelope. On the other hand, helium recombination contains
30% of the total recombination energy, and occurs much deeper in the stellar
envelope. We investigate the distinct roles played by hydrogen and helium
recombination in a common-envelope interaction experienced by a 12 solar mass
red supergiant donor. We perform adiabatic, 3D hydrodynamical simulations that
(i) include hydrogen, helium, and molecular hydrogen recombination, (ii)
include hydrogen and helium recombination, (iii) include only helium
recombination, and (iv) do not include recombination energy. By comparing these
simulations, we find that the addition of helium recombination energy alone
ejects 30% more envelope mass, and leads to a 16% larger post-plunge-in
separation. Under the adiabatic assumption, adding hydrogen recombination
energy increases the amount of ejected mass by a further 40%, possibly
unbinding the entire envelope, but does not affect the post-plunge separation.
Most of the ejecta becomes unbound at relatively high (>70%) degrees of
hydrogen ionisation, where the hydrogen recombination energy is likely to
expand the envelope instead of being radiated away.

each proposed energy-metabolism to a photochemical-kinetics code and
self-consistently predict the composition of Venus's atmosphere under the
scenario that life produces the observed SO$_2$-depletion. Using this
photo-bio-chemical kinetics code, we show that all three metabolisms can
produce SO$_2$-depletions, but do so by violating other observational
constraints on Venus's atmospheric chemistry. We calculate the maximum possible
biomass density of sulfur-metabolising life in the clouds, before violating
observational constraints, to be $\sim10^{-5}\,-\,10^{-3}\,{\rm mg\,m^{-3}}$.

Gaia has been in operations since 2014. The third Gaia data release
expands from the early data release (EDR3) in 2020 by providing 34 months of
multi-epoch observations that allowed us to probe, characterise and classify
systematically celestial variable phenomena.
  Aims. We present a summary of the variability processing and analysis of the
photometric and spectroscopic time series of 1.8 billion sources done for Gaia
DR3.
  Methods. We used statistical and Machine Learning methods to characterise and
classify the variable sources. Training sets were built from a global revision
of major published variable star catalogues. For a subset of classes, specific
detailed studies were conducted to confirm their class membership and to derive
parameters that are adapted to the peculiarity of the considered class.
  Results. In total, 10.5 million objects are identified as variable in Gaia
DR3 and have associated time series in G, GBP, and GRP and, in some cases,
radial velocity time series. The DR3 variable sources subdivide into 9.5
million variable stars and 1 million Active Galactic Nuclei/Quasars. In
addition, supervised classification identified 2.5 million galaxies thanks to
spurious variability induced by the extent of these objects. The variability
analysis output in the DR3 archive amounts to 17 tables containing a total of
365 parameters. We publish 35 types and sub-types of variable objects. For 11
variable types, additional specific object parameters are published. An
overview of the estimated completeness and contamination of most variability
classes is provided.
  Conclusions. Thanks to Gaia we present the largest whole-sky variability
analysis based on coherent photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data.
Later Gaia data releases will more than double the span of time series and the
number of observations, thus allowing for an even richer catalogue in the
future.

population summary, anti-poverty experiments often seek to unpack the effect
variation around the ATE by conditioning (CATE) on tabular variables such as
age and ethnicity that were measured during the RCT data collection. Although
such variables are key to unpacking CATE, using only such variables may fail to
capture historical, geographical, or neighborhood-specific contributors to
effect variation, as tabular RCT data are often only observed near the time of
the experiment. In global poverty research, when the location of the experiment
units is approximately known, satellite imagery can provide a window into such
factors important for understanding heterogeneity. However, there is no method
that specifically enables applied researchers to analyze CATE from images. In
this paper, using a deep probabilistic modeling framework, we develop such a
method that estimates latent clusters of images by identifying images with
similar treatment effects distributions. Our interpretable image CATE model
also includes a sensitivity factor that quantifies the importance of image
segments contributing to the effect cluster prediction. We compare the proposed
methods against alternatives in simulation; also, we show how the model works
in an actual RCT, estimating the effects of an anti-poverty intervention in
northern Uganda and obtaining a posterior predictive distribution over effects
for the rest of the country where no experimental data was collected. We make
all models available in open-source software.

Turing machine. We show that the problem of the local machine computing
\textbf{simulation properties} of its global simulator is undecidable in the
same sense as the Halting problem. Then, we show that computing the time,
space, or error accumulated by the global simulator are simulation properties
and therefore are undecidable. These simulation properties give rise to special
relativistic effects in the relative model which we use to construct a relative
Church-Turing-Deutsch thesis where a global, classical Turing machine computes
quantum mechanics for a local machine with the same constant-time local
computational complexity as experienced in our universe.

learning visual representations without self-attention. However, existing MLP
models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of
human body configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal
representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet
effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines
MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical
unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the
graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific
demand of the 3D human pose, while allowing for both local and global spatial
interactions. Furthermore, we propose to flexibly and efficiently extend the
GraphMLP to the video domain and show that complex temporal dynamics can be
effectively modeled in a simple way with negligible computational cost gains in
the sequence length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MLP-Like
architecture for 3D human pose estimation in a single frame and a video
sequence. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

approach, called {\it repro samples method}, to conduct statistical inference.
The approach studies the performance of artificial samples, referred to as {\it
repro samples}, obtained by mimicking the true observed sample to achieve
uncertainty quantification and construct confidence sets for parameters of
interest with guaranteed coverage rates. Both exact and asymptotic inferences
are developed. An attractive feature of the general framework developed is that
it does not rely on the large sample central limit theorem and is
likelihood-free. As such, it is thus effective for complicated inference
problems which we can not solve using the large sample central limit theorem.
The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of problems, including many
open questions where solutions were previously unavailable, for example, those
involving discrete or non-numerical parameters. To reduce the large
computational cost of such inference problems, we develop a unique matching
scheme to obtain a data-driven candidate set. Moreover, we show the advantages
of the proposed framework over the classical Neyman-Pearson framework. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various models
throughout the paper and provide a case study that addresses an open inference
question on how to quantify the uncertainty for the unknown number of
components in a normal mixture model. To evaluate the empirical performance of
our repro samples method, we conduct simulations and study real data examples
with comparisons to existing approaches. Although the development pertains to
the settings where the large sample central limit theorem does not apply, it
also has direct extensions to the cases where the central limit theorem does
hold.

observing the reward of every visited state-action pair. In many real world
applications, however, an agent can observe only a score that represents the
quality of the whole trajectory, which is referred to as the {\em
trajectory-wise reward}. In such a situation, it is difficult for standard RL
methods to well utilize trajectory-wise reward, and large bias and variance
errors can be incurred in policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel
offline RL algorithm, called Pessimistic vAlue iteRaTion with rEward
Decomposition (PARTED), which decomposes the trajectory return into per-step
proxy rewards via least-squares-based reward redistribution, and then performs
pessimistic value iteration based on the learned proxy reward. To ensure the
value functions constructed by PARTED are always pessimistic with respect to
the optimal ones, we design a new penalty term to offset the uncertainty of the
proxy reward. For general episodic MDPs with large state space, we show that
PARTED with overparameterized neural network function approximation achieves an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(D_{\text{eff}}H^2/\sqrt{N})$ suboptimality, where $H$ is
the length of episode, $N$ is the total number of samples, and $D_{\text{eff}}$
is the effective dimension of the neural tangent kernel matrix. To further
illustrate the result, we show that PARTED achieves an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dH^3/\sqrt{N})$ suboptimality with linear MDPs, where $d$
is the feature dimension, which matches with that with neural network function
approximation, when $D_{\text{eff}}=dH$. To the best of our knowledge, PARTED
is the first offline RL algorithm that is provably efficient in general MDP

to facilitate large-scale quantum computations is through a distributed network
of quantum computers. In this work, we consider the problem of distributing
quantum programs represented as quantum circuits across a quantum network of
heterogeneous quantum computers, in a way that minimizes the overall
communication cost required to execute the distributed circuit. We consider two
ways of communicating: cat-entanglement that creates linked copies of qubits
across pairs of computers, and teleportation. The heterogeneous computers
impose constraints on cat-entanglement and teleportation operations that can be
chosen by an algorithm. We first focus on a special case that only allows
cat-entanglements and not teleportations for communication. We provide a
two-step heuristic for solving this specialized setting: (i) finding an
assignment of qubits to computers using Tabu search, and (ii) using an
iterative greedy algorithm designed for a constrained version of the set cover
problem to determine cat-entanglement operations required to execute gates
locally.

two algorithms that subdivide the quantum circuit into several portions and
apply the heuristic for the specialized setting on each portion. Teleportations
are then used to stitch together the solutions for each portion. Finally, we
simulate our algorithms on a wide range of randomly generated quantum networks

near the $\Gamma$ point in the ($k_x,k_y$) plane of the first Brillouin zone
can be adjusted by a parameter $\alpha $. When $ \alpha=0 $, these bands touch
each other along a continuous closed loop but the opening of a band gap
corresponding to finite values of $\alpha$ and the varying of the carrier
concentration can be adjusted by placing the NLSM in a suitably configured
field effect device. This provides a tunable semiconductor gap, around $\Gamma$
and the valence and conduction bands can meet at a pair of points within the
Brillouin zone. The optical conductivity of such a NLSM is calculated using the
Kubo formula with emphasis on the optical spectral weight redistribution,
deduced from appropriate Green's functions, brought about by changes in gap and
chemical potential due to modifying $\alpha$. We derived closed-form analytic
expressions for the longitudinal and transverse components of the optical
conductivity for these model systems of NLSM and compare results for chosen
$\alpha$ and chemical potential.

extremely useful to assess associations between patients' predictors and
outcomes of interest. However, these datasets often suffer from missing values
in a high proportion of cases and the simple removal of these cases may
introduce severe bias. For these reasons, several multiple imputation
algorithms have been proposed to attempt to recover the missing information.
Each algorithm presents strengths and weaknesses, and there is currently no
consensus on which multiple imputation algorithms works best in a given
scenario. Furthermore, the selection of each algorithm parameters and
data-related modelling choices are also both crucial and challenging. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework to numerically evaluate strategies for
handling missing data in the context of statistical analysis, with a particular
focus on multiple imputation techniques. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach on a large cohort of type-2 diabetes patients provided by the National
COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Enclave, where we explored the influence of
various patient characteristics on outcomes related to COVID-19. Our analysis
included classic multiple imputation techniques as well as simple complete-case
Inverse Probability Weighted models. The experiments presented here show that
our approach could effectively highlight the most valid and performant
missing-data handling strategy for our case study. Moreover, our methodology
allowed us to gain an understanding of the behavior of the different models and
of how it changed as we modified their parameters. Our method is general and
can be applied to different research fields and on datasets containing

therefore commonly resampled onto the same grid, as a pre-processing step.
However, the resampling operation introduces partial volume effects and
blurring, thereby changing the effective resolution and reducing the contrast

handles resolution mismatches in the input data. This layer pushes each image
onto a mean space where the forward pass is performed. As the splat operator is
the adjoint to the resampling operator, the mean-space prediction can be pulled
back to the native label space, where the loss function is computed. Thus, the
need for explicit resolution adjustment using interpolation is removed. We show
on two publicly available datasets, with simulated and real multi-modal

investigation of their privacy leakage is needed. We introduce our 3-D

are conditioned on tumour masks as a case study. We define quantitative
measures of image fidelity, utility and privacy for our model. These metrics
are evaluated in the course of training to identify ideal fidelity, utility and
privacy trade-offs and establish the relationships between these parameters. We
show that the discriminator of the TrGAN is vulnerable to attack, and that an
attacker can identify which samples were used in training with almost perfect
accuracy (AUC = 0.99). We also show that an attacker with access to only the
generator cannot reliably classify whether a sample had been used for training
(AUC = 0.51). This suggests that TrGAN generators, but not discriminators, may
be used for sharing synthetic 3-D PET data with minimal privacy risk while
maintaining good utility and fidelity.

action potential output by apical dendritic input and its regulation by
dendritic inhibition. We find that two of the decompositions produce much
larger estimates of synergy and shared information than the others, as well as
large levels of unique misinformation. When within-neuron differences in the
components are examined, the five methods produce more similar results for all
but the shared information component, for which two methods produce a different
statistical conclusion from the others. There are some differences in the
expression of unique information asymmetry among the methods. It is
significantly larger, on average, under dendritic inhibition. Three of the
methods support a previous conclusion that apical amplification is reduced by
dendritic inhibition. The second study used a detailed compartmental model to
produce action potentials for many combinations of the numbers of basal and
apical synaptic inputs. Two analyses of decompositions are conducted on subsets
of the data. In the first, the decompositions reveal a bifurcation in unique
information asymmetry. For three of the methods this suggests that apical drive
switches to basal drive as the strength of the basal input increases, while the
other two show changing mixtures of information and misinformation.
Decompositions produced using the second set of subsets show that all five

learning to software engineering tasks. Learning code representation from a
multilingual source code dataset has been shown to be more effective than
learning from single-language datasets separately, since more training data
from multilingual dataset improves the model's ability to extract
language-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multilingual
training overlooks the language-specific information which is crucial for
modeling source code across different programming languages, while only
focusing on learning a unified model with shared parameters among different
languages for language-agnostic information modeling. To address this problem,
we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code
representation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for the
feature extractor according to the specific programming language type of the
input code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostic and
language-specific information with dynamic parameters in the feature extractor.
We conduct experiments on the code summarization and code completion tasks to
verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach with significant improvements on state-of-the-art

meaningful embedding space, where samples of similar semantic contents are
close to each other. Most of the recent representation learning methods
maximize cosine similarity or minimize the distance between the embedding
features of different views from the same sample usually on the $l2$ normalized
unit hypersphere. To prevent the trivial solutions that all samples have the
same embedding feature, various techniques have been developed, such as
contrastive learning, stop gradient, variance and covariance regularization,
etc. In this study, we propose MUlti-Segmental Informational Coding (MUSIC) for
self-supervised representation learning. MUSIC divides the embedding feature
into multiple segments that discriminatively partition samples into different
semantic clusters and different segments focus on different partition
principles. Information theory measurements are directly used to optimize MUSIC
and theoretically guarantee trivial solutions are avoided. MUSIC does not
depend on commonly used techniques, such as memory bank or large batches,
asymmetry networks, gradient stopping, momentum weight updating, etc, making
the training framework flexible. Our experiments demonstrate that MUSIC
achieves better results than most related Barlow Twins and VICReg methods on
ImageNet classification with linear probing, and requires neither deep

of density estimation, the standard nonparametric Bayesian approach is to
target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process mixture model. In
general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so
methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an
intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula
updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density

address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an
autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior. While the

serious diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, based on the uptake

Recently, a novel imaging mode known as positronium lifetime imaging (PLI) has
been shown possible with time-of-flight (TOF) PET as well. PLI is also of
practical interest because it can provide complementary disease information
reflecting conditions of the tissue microenvironment via mechanisms that are
independent of tracer uptake. However, for the present practical systems that
have a finite TOF resolution, the PLI reconstruction problem has yet to be
fully formulated for the development of accurate reconstruction algorithms.
This paper addresses this challenge by developing a statistical model for the
PLI data and deriving from it a maximum-likelihood algorithm for reconstructing
lifetime images alongside the uptake images. By using realistic computer
simulation data, we show that the proposed algorithm can produce quantitatively
accurate lifetime images for a 570~ps TOF PET system.

estimate the timescale of supernova debris deposition beginning $\sim 3$ Myr

all cases the best-fit 60Fe pulse durations are $>1.6$ Myr when all the data is
combined. This timescale far exceeds the $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr pulse that would be
expected if 60Fe was entrained in the supernova blast wave plasma. We interpret
the long signal duration as evidence that 60Fe arrives in the form of supernova
dust, whose dynamics are separate from but coupled to the evolution of the
blast plasma. In this framework, the $>1.6$ Myr is that for dust stopping due
to drag forces. This scenario is consistent with the simulations in Fry et. al

thereby confined around regions of the remnant dominated by supernova ejects,
where magnetic fields are low. This picture fits naturally with models of
cosmic-ray injection of refractory elements as sputtered supernova dust grains

is primarily expected to improve the robustness of these models under covariate
shift. In this paper, we revisit the significance of shape-biases for the
classification of skin lesion images. Our analysis shows that different skin
lesion datasets exhibit varying biases towards individual image features.
Interestingly, despite deep feature extractors being inclined towards learning
entangled features for skin lesion classification, individual features can
still be decoded from this entangled representation. This indicates that these
features are still represented in the learnt embedding spaces of the models,
but not used for classification. In addition, the spectral analysis of
different datasets shows that in contrast to common visual recognition,
dermoscopic skin lesion classification, by nature, is reliant on complex
feature combinations beyond shape-bias. As a natural consequence, shifting away
from the prevalent desire of shape-biasing models can even improve skin lesion
classifiers in some cases.

Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting where accurate
causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels. This self-supervised
ISL utilizes invariant causality proposals by iteratively setting different

accurately discovers the causal structure, outperforms alternative methods, and

The bolometric light curves based on a recently computed extensive set of

range in metal content and transformed into the Rubin-LSST photometric system.
Predicted Rubin-LSST mean magnitudes and pulsation amplitudes have been adopted
to built the Bailey diagrams (luminosity amplitude vs period) and the
color-color diagrams in these bands. The current findings indicate that the
gLSST-rLSST, rLSST-iLSST colors obey to a well defined linear relation with the
metal content. Moreover, the Period Luminosity relations display in the reddest
filters (rLSST,iLSST,zLSST,yLSST) a significant dependence on the assumed metal
abundance. In particular, more metal-rich RR Lyrae are predicted to be fainter
at fixed period. Metal-dependent Period-Wesenheit relations for different
combinations of optical and NIR filters are also provided. These represent
powerful tools to infer individual distances independently of reddening
uncertainties, once the metal abundance is known and no relevant deviations

the dynamics and material composition of the slow solar wind that originates
from near coronal hole boundaries. To explore the implications of this process
we simulate the dynamic evolution of a solar wind stream along a newly-opened
magnetic flux tube. The initial condition is composed of a piecewise continuous
dynamic equilibrium in which the regions above and below the reconnection site
are extracted from steady-state solutions along open and closed field lines.
The initial discontinuity at the reconnection site is highly unstable and
evolves as a Riemann problem, decomposing into an outward-propagating shock and
inward-propagating rarefaction that eventually develop into a classic N-wave
configuration. This configuration ultimately propagates into the heliosphere as
a coherent structure and the entire system eventually settles to a quasi-steady
wind solution. In addition to simulating the fluid evolution we also calculate
the time-dependent non-equilibrium ionization of oxygen in real time in order
to construct in situ diagnostics of the conditions near the reconnection site.
This idealized description of the plasma dynamics along a newly-opened magnetic
field line provides a baseline for predicting and interpreting the implications
of interchange reconnection for the slow solar wind. Notably, the density and
velocity within the expanding N-wave are generally enhanced over the ambient
wind, as is the O7+/O6+ ionization ratio, which exhibits a discontinuity across
the reconnection site that is transported by the flow and arrives later than
the propagating N-wave.

is limited by the restriction that only pairwise dependencies are visible and
potentially higher-order structures are missed. In this work, we explore how
multivariate information theory can reveal higher-order, synergistic
dependencies in the human brain. Using the O-information, a measure of whether
the structure of a system is redundancy- or synergy-dominated, we show that
synergistic subsystems are widespread in the human brain. We provide a
mathematical analysis of the O-information to locate it within a larger
taxonomy of multivariate complexity measures. We also show the O-information is
related to a previously established measure, the Tononi-Sporns-Edelman
complexity, and can be understood as an expected difference in integration
between system scales. Highly synergistic subsystems typically sit between
canonical functional networks, and may serve to integrate those networks. We
then use simulated annealing to find maximally synergistic subsystems, finding
that such systems typically comprise $\approx$10 brain regions, also recruited
from multiple canonical brain systems. Though ubiquitous, highly synergistic
subsystems are invisible when considering pairwise functional connectivity,
suggesting that higher-order dependencies form a kind of ``shadow structure""
that has been unrecognized by established network-based analyses. We assert

$A(G)$ of $G$ and the maximum cardinality of its minimal element is the acyclic
b-chromatic number $A_b(G)$ of $G$. We present several properties of $A_b(G)$.
In particular, we derive $A_b(G)$ for several known graph families, derive some

the performance a student model using predictions from a teacher model.
However, recent work has shown that gains in average efficiency are not uniform
across subgroups in the data, and in particular can often come at the cost of
accuracy on rare subgroups and classes. To preserve strong performance across
classes that may follow a long-tailed distribution, we develop distillation
techniques that are tailored to improve the student's worst-class performance.
Specifically, we introduce robust optimization objectives in different
combinations for the teacher and student, and further allow for training with
any tradeoff between the overall accuracy and the robust worst-class objective.
We show empirically that our robust distillation techniques not only achieve
better worst-class performance, but also lead to Pareto improvement in the
tradeoff between overall performance and worst-class performance compared to
other baseline methods. Theoretically, we provide insights into what makes a
good teacher when the goal is to train a robust student.

how screening mechanisms, which hide the deviations of these theories from the

formation. In this work we approach this problem by using a combination of
analytic and numerical methods to describe chameleon screening in the context
of cosmic voids. We apply a finite element method (FEM) code, SELCIE, to solve
the chameleon equation of motion for a number of void profiles derived from
observational data and simulations. The obtained results indicate a complex
relationship between the properties of cosmic voids and the size of the
chameleon acceleration of a test particle. We find that the fifth force on a
test particle in a void is primarily related to the depth and the inner density
gradient of the void. For realistic void profiles, the obtained
chameleon-to-Newtonian acceleration ratios range between $a_{\phi}/a_{\rm Newt}
\approx 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}$. However, it should be noted that in unusually deep
voids with large inner density gradients, the acceleration ratios can be
significantly higher. Similarly, other chameleon models, such as $f(R)$
Hu-Sawicki theory allow for significantly higher acceleration ratios. Given
these results, we also discuss the optimal density profiles for detecting the
fifth force in the upcoming observational surveys.

continual learning. In this manuscript we consider predictions expressed as
General Value Functions: temporally extended estimates of the accumulation of a

agent can independently select predictions that resolve partial-observability,
resulting in performance similar to expertly specified GVFs. By learning,
rather than manually specifying these predictions, we enable the agent to
identify useful predictions in a self-supervised manner, taking a step towards
truly autonomous systems.

that SSL-based visual encoders can yield general -- not tailored to a specific

Bayesian posterior (or pseudo-posterior) using the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin
algorithm (MALA). MALA first applies a discrete-time Langevin SDE to propose a
new state, and then adjusts the proposed state using Metropolis-Hastings
rejection. Most existing theoretical analysis of MALA relies on the smoothness
and strongly log-concavity properties of the target distribution, which
unfortunately is often unsatisfied in practical Bayesian problems. Our analysis
relies on the statistical large sample theory, which restricts the deviation of
the Bayesian posterior from being smooth and log-concave in a very specific
manner. Specifically, we establish the optimal parameter dimension dependence
of $d^{1/3}$ in the non-asymptotic mixing time upper bound for MALA after the
burn-in period without assuming the smoothness and log-concavity of the target
posterior density, where MALA is slightly modified by replacing the gradient
with any subgradient if non-differentiable. In comparison, the well-known
scaling limit for the classical Metropolis random walk (MRW) suggests a linear
$d$ dimension dependence in its mixing time. Thus, our results formally verify
the conventional wisdom that MALA, as a first-order method using gradient
information, is more efficient than MRW as a zeroth-order method only using
function value information in the context of Bayesian computation.

correlation of the SPOD modes with preceding and succeeding snapshots, and
their spatial correlation with the surrounding data at the same time instant.
For each gap, the algorithm first computes the SPOD of the remaining,
unaffected data. In the next step, the compromised data are projected onto the

problem and yields expansion coefficients that permit the reconstruction in the

improving neural network robustness to adversarial perturbations and common
corruptions in the last few years. Algorithm design of AT and its variants are
focused on training models at a specified perturbation strength $\epsilon$ and
only using the feedback from the performance of that $\epsilon$-robust model to
improve the algorithm. In this work, we focus on models, trained on a spectrum
of $\epsilon$ values. We analyze three perspectives: model performance,
intermediate feature precision and convolution filter sensitivity. In each, we
identify alternative improvements to AT that otherwise wouldn't have been
apparent at a single $\epsilon$. Specifically, we find that for a PGD attack at
some strength $\delta$, there is an AT model at some slightly larger strength
$\epsilon$, but no greater, that generalizes best to it. Hence, we propose
overdesigning for robustness where we suggest training models at an $\epsilon$
just above $\delta$. Second, we observe (across various $\epsilon$ values) that
robustness is highly sensitive to the precision of intermediate features and
particularly those after the first and second layer. Thus, we propose adding a
simple quantization to defenses that improves accuracy on seen and unseen
adaptive attacks. Third, we analyze convolution filters of each layer of models
at increasing $\epsilon$ and notice that those of the first and second layer
may be solely responsible for amplifying input perturbations. We present our
findings and demonstrate our techniques through experiments with ResNet and
WideResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C datasets.

  Optimization",,,,,"stat.CO stat.AP stat.ME stat.ML stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computing proposed exact $G$-optimal designs for response surface models is a
difficult computation that has received incremental improvements via algorithm
development in the last two-decades. These optimal designs have not been
considered widely in applications in part due to the difficulty and cost
involved with computing them. Three primary algorithms for constructing exact
$G$-optimal designs are presented in the literature: the coordinate exchange
(CEXCH), a genetic algorithm (GA), and the relatively new $G$-optimal via
$I_\lambda$-optimality algorithm ($G(I_\lambda)$-CEXCH) which was developed in
part to address large computational cost. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has
achieved widespread use in many applications, but to date, its broad-scale
success notwithstanding, has seen relatively few applications in optimal design
problems. In this paper we develop an extension of PSO to adapt it to the
optimal design problem. We then employ PSO to generate optimal designs for
several scenarios covering $K = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ design factors, which are common
experimental sizes in industrial experiments. We compare these results to all
$G$-optimal designs published in last two decades of literature. Published
$G$-optimal designs generated by GA for $K=1, 2, 3$ factors have stood
unchallenged for 14 years. We demonstrate that PSO has found improved
$G$-optimal designs for these scenarios, and it does this with comparable
computational cost to the state-of-the-art algorithm $G(I_\lambda)$-CEXCH.
Further, we show that PSO is able to produce equal or better $G$-optimal
designs for $K= 4, 5$ factors than those currently known. These results suggest
that PSO is superior to existing approaches for efficiently generating highly
$G$-optimal designs.

In the absence of defects, activity gradients drive flows which re-orient the

activity, defects are created and the system transitions into active
turbulence, a chaotic flow state characterized by strong vorticity. We find
that in two-dimensional (2D) systems active torques robustly align $+1/2$
defects parallel to activity gradients, with defect heads pointing towards
contractile regions. In three-dimensional (3D) active nematics disclination
lines preferentially lie in the plane perpendicular to activity gradients due
to active torques acting on line segments. The average orientation of the
defect structures in the plane perpendicular to the line tangent depends on the
defect type, where wedge-like $+1/2$ defects align parallel to activity
gradients, while twist defects are aligned anti-parallel. Understanding the
response of active nematic fluids to activity gradients is an important step
towards applying physical theories to biology, where spatial variations of

  for scalar field dark matter","to be submitted to Phys Rev D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.106.103002",,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the timescale on which quantum corrections alter the
predictions of classical field theory for scalar field dark matter. This is
accomplished by including second order terms in the evolution proportional to
the covariance of the field operators. When this covariance is no longer small
compared to the mean field value, we say that the system has reached the
``quantum breaktime"" and the predictions of classical field theory will begin
to differ from those of the full quantum theory. While holding the classical
field theory evolution fixed, we determine the change of the quantum breaktime
as total occupation number is increased. This provides a novel numerical
estimation of the breaktime based at high occupations $n_{tot}$ and mode number
$N=256$. We study the collapse of a sinusoidal overdensity in a single spatial
dimension. We find that the breaktime scales as $\log(n_{tot})$ prior to shell
crossing and then then as a powerlaw following the collapse. If we assume that
the collapsing phase is representative of halos undergoing nonlinear growth,
this implies that the quantum breaktime of typical systems may be as large as
$\sim 30$ of dynamical times even at occupations of $n_{tot}\sim 10^{100}$.

the rise of photon-based quantum computing. In this theoretical work, we
propose a system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) side-coupled to a
superconducting nanowire. The coupling opens a gap in both the QD mode and the
Majorana zero mode (MZM) at the nanowire edge, enabling photon absorption in
the system. We show that the absorbed photoelectron decays via rapid
(sub-nanosecond to nanosecond) nonradiative heat transfer to the nanowire
phonon modes rather than by spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we calculate the
temperature increase and associated resistance increase induced by the
absorption of a photon for a given appropriate set of material and
environmental parameters, yielding a temperature increase in the millikelvin
range and a resistance increase in the kiloohm range, vastly exceeding the
photon-absorption-induced temperature and resistance increases for competing
2D-3D hybrid systems by 5 and 9 orders of magnitude, respectively. Lastly, we
determine the detector efficiency and discuss the system density required for
deterministic photon number measurement, demonstrating that a photon absorption
probability of over 99.9 percent can be achieved for an integrated system
consisting of an array of nanowire-QD complexes on-chip inside a cavity. Our
results thus provide a basis for a deterministic microwave photon number

a variety of domains recently. However, it is costly to update the entire
parameter set of large pre-trained models. Although recently proposed
parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) techniques allow updating a small
subset of parameters (e.g. only using 2% of parameters) inside a pre-trained
backbone network for a new task, they only reduce the training memory
requirement by up to 30%. This is because the gradient computation for the
trainable parameters still requires backpropagation through the large
pre-trained backbone model. To address this, we propose Ladder Side-Tuning
(LST), a new PETL technique that can reduce training memory requirements by
more substantial amounts. Unlike existing parameter-efficient methods that
insert additional parameters inside backbone networks, we train a ladder side
network, a small and separate network that takes intermediate activations as
input via shortcut connections (called ladders) from backbone networks and
makes predictions. LST has significantly lower memory requirements than
previous methods, because it does not require backpropagation through the
backbone network, but instead only through the side network and ladder
connections. We evaluate our method with various models (T5 and CLIP-T5) on
both NLP (GLUE) and vision-and-language (VQA, GQA, NLVR2 , MSCOCO) tasks. LST
saves 69% of the memory costs to fine-tune the whole network, while other
methods only save 26% of that in similar parameter usages (hence, 2.7x more
memory savings). Moreover, LST achieves higher accuracy than Adapter and LoRA
in a low-memory regime. To further show the advantage of this better memory
efficiency, we also apply LST to larger T5 models, attaining better GLUE
performance than full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. The
accuracy-efficiency trade-off also holds on VL tasks.

solutions. Two processes influence the overall dynamics of these devices: the
formation of electrical double layers and chemical conversion due to redox
reactions. However, due to the presence of multiple length and time scales, it
is challenging to simulate both processes directly from the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Therefore, common modeling approaches ignore
one of the processes, assume the two are independent, or extrapolate the
results from reaction-free systems. To overcome these limitations, we formulate
and derive an asymptotic model by solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations
for an arbitrary number of ions in the thin-double-layer limit. Our analysis
reveals that there are two distinct timescales in the system: double-layer
charging and bulk diffusion. Our model displays excellent quantitative
agreement with direct numerical simulations. Further, our approach is
computationally efficient and numerically stable, even for large potentials. We
investigate the dynamics of charging for a binary electrolyte and three-ion
system, and find that redox reactions impact the double-layer charging process
at short times whereas they modify the double-layer capacitance at long times.
Overall, the proposed theoretical framework advances our ability to simulate
electrochemical devices that contain multiple ions and widens opportunities for
future research in the field.

the design and analysis of robot autonomy algorithms in simulation and reality.
The software, which is open source, containerized, and operating system (OS)
independent, has three main components: a ROS 2 interface to a C++ vehicle
simulation framework (Chrono), which provides high-fidelity wheeled/tracked
vehicle and sensor simulation; a basic ROS 2-based autonomy stack for algorithm
design and testing; and, a development ecosystem which enables visualization,
and hardware-in-the-loop experimentation in perception, state estimation, path
planning, and controls. The accompanying hardware platform is a 1/6th scale
vehicle augmented with reconfigurable mountings for computing, sensing, and
tracking. Its purpose is to allow algorithms and sensor configurations to be
physically tested and improved. Since this vehicle platform has a digital twin
within the simulation environment, one can test and compare the same algorithms
and autonomy stack in simulation and reality. This platform has been built with
an eye towards characterizing and managing the simulation-to-reality gap.
Herein, we describe how this platform is set up, deployed, and used to improve
autonomy for mobility applications.

solutions described by the Doi-Edwards-Marrucci-Grizzuti (DEMG) model and the
Rolie-Poly (RP) model. Both models capture polymer reptation, finite rates of
chain retraction and finite extensibility of single polymer molecules, while
differing slightly in their final form regarding to the convective constraint
release. We calculate numerically the filament thinning profiles predicted by
the two models with realistic entanglement densities, assuming cylindrical
filament shapes and no fluid inertia. Both results reveal an early
tube-reorientation regime, followed by a brief intermediate elasto-capillary
regime, and finally a finite-extensibility regime close to the pinch-off
singularity. The results presented in this work reveal two critical features in
the transient extensional rheology of entangled polymer solutions that have
been reported from previous experimental studies, but are poorly described by
the widely-used FENE-P model. First, the relaxation time obtained from
capillary breakup extensional rheometry is notably smaller than that from
steady-shear rheometry. Their ratio can be expressed as a universal function of
the entanglement state and the polymer concentration, which agrees well with
the experimental data for a range of entangled polymer solutions. Second, the
filament thinning dynamics at sufficiently high polymer concentrations are
governed by the tube reorientation at intermediate strain-rates, and the
apparent extensional viscosity shows a noticeably rate-thinning response. We
finally evaluate the filament thinning dynamics of aqueous polyethylene oxide
solutions (1 MDa) over dilute and entangled regimes. As the concentration
increases, the profiles deviate from the well-studied exponential-thinning
trends beyond the entangled threshold, becoming increasingly power-law in
character.

  Assessment",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep-learning based techniques have contributed to the remarkable progress in
the field of automatic image quality assessment (IQA). Existing IQA methods are
designed to measure the quality of an image in terms of Mean Opinion Score
(MOS) at the image-level (i.e. the whole image) or at the patch-level (dividing
the image into multiple units and measuring quality of each patch). Some
applications may require assessing the quality at the pixel-level (i.e. MOS
value for each pixel), however, this is not possible in case of existing
techniques as the spatial information is lost owing to their network
structures. This paper proposes an IQA algorithm that can measure the MOS at
the pixel-level, in addition to the image-level MOS. The proposed algorithm
consists of three core parts, namely: i) Local IQA; ii) Region of Interest
(ROI) prediction; iii) High-level feature embedding. The Local IQA part outputs
the MOS at the pixel-level, or pixel-by-pixel MOS - we term it 'pMOS'. The ROI
prediction part outputs weights that characterize the relative importance of
region when calculating the image-level IQA. The high-level feature embedding
part extracts high-level image features which are then embedded into the Local
IQA part. In other words, the proposed algorithm yields three outputs: the pMOS
which represents MOS for each pixel, the weights from the ROI indicating the
relative importance of region, and finally the image-level MOS that is obtained
by the weighted sum of pMOS and ROI values. The image-level MOS thus obtained
by utilizing pMOS and ROI weights shows superior performance compared to the
existing popular IQA techniques. In addition, visualization results indicate
that predicted pMOS and ROI outputs are reasonably aligned with the general
principles of the human visual system (HVS).

that the set of critical points for the map $\pi \circ \varepsilon$ is a smooth
(possibly multi-component) $1$-manifold, $\mathscr{C} \subset S_g$. We say
$\mathscr{C}$ is the crease set of $\varepsilon$ and two embeddings are in the
same isotopy class if there exists an isotopy between them that has
$\mathscr{C}$ being an invariant set. The case where $\pi \circ
\varepsilon|_\mathscr{C}$ restricts to an immersion is readily accessible,
since the turning number function of a smooth curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ supplies
us with a natural map of components of $\mathscr{C}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$. The
Gauss-Bonnet Theorem beautifully governs the behavior of $\pi \circ \varepsilon
(\mathscr{C})$, as it implies $\chi(S_g) = 2 \sum_{\gamma \in \mathscr{C}}
t(\pi \circ \varepsilon (\gamma))$, where $t$ is the turning number function.
Focusing on when $S_g \cong S^2$, we give a necessary and sufficient condition
for when a disjoint collection of curves $\mathscr{C} \subset S^2$ can be
realized as the crease set of an embedding $\varepsilon: S^2 \hookrightarrow

solution is Data Augmentation (DA), that can artificially generate new images
out of original samples. Image augmentation strategies can vary by dataset, as
different data types might require different augmentations to facilitate model
training. However, the design of DA policies has been largely decided by the
human experts with domain knowledge, which is considered to be highly
subjective and error-prone. To mitigate such problem, a novel direction is to
automatically learn the image augmentation policies from the given dataset
using Automated Data Augmentation (AutoDA) techniques. The goal of AutoDA
models is to find the optimal DA policies that can maximize the model
performance gains. This survey discusses the underlying reasons of the
emergence of AutoDA technology from the perspective of image classification. We
identify three key components of a standard AutoDA model: a search space, a
search algorithm and an evaluation function. Based on their architecture, we
provide a systematic taxonomy of existing image AutoDA approaches. This paper
presents the major works in AutoDA field, discussing their pros and cons, and

work, we report the observation of both effects in the ferromagnetic
Weyl-semimetal Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ with tunable Fe vacancies. With decreasing Fe
vacancies, the anomalous Hall conductivity evolves as a function of the
longitudinal conductivity from the hopping region to the region where the

change caused by the Fe vacancies. Combining these results with
first-principles calculations, we argue that the Fe-vacancy concentration plays
a unique role in simultaneously tuning the chemical potential and
ferromagnetism, which in turn controls the Berry curvature contribution in this
family of ferromagnetic topological semimetals.

(1) extracts objects from existing images to construct an object corpus; (2)
inserts an object into an image via novel object resizing and location tuning
algorithms; and (3) reports image pairs whose captions do not exhibit

errors: misclassification, omission, and incorrect quantity. We visualize the
errors reported by MetaIC, which shows that flexible overlapping setting
facilitates IC testing by increasing and diversifying the reported errors. In
addition, MetaIC can be further generalized to detect label errors in the

coherently-driven, dispersive resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearity. It is
widely accepted that such solitons react to parameter inhomogeneities by
experiencing a temporal drift whose rate is governed by the gradient of the
parameter at the soliton's position. This result, however, assumes that the
gradient of the inhomogeneity is constant across the soliton, which may not
hold true under all situations, e.g. when using bichromatic driving or in the
presence of third-order dispersion that gives rise to an extended dispersive
wave tail. Here we report on theoretical and numerical results pertaining to
the behavior of dissipative temporal Kerr cavity solitons under conditions
where parameter inhomogeneities vary nonlinearly across the width of the
soliton. In this case, the soliton velocity is dictated by the full overlap
between its so-called neutral mode and the parameter perturbation, which we
show can yield dynamics that are manifestly at odds with the common wisdom of
motion dependent solely upon the gradient of the inhomogeneity. We also
investigate how the presence of third-order dispersion and the associated
dispersive wave tail changes the motion induced by parameter inhomogeneities.
We find that the dispersive wave tail as such does not contribute to the
soliton motion; instead, higher-order dispersion yields counter-intuitive
influences on the soliton motion. Our results provide new insights to the
behavior of temporal cavity solitons in the presence of parameter
inhomogeneities, and can impact systems employing pulsed or bichromatic pumping
and/or resonators with non-negligible higher-order dispersion.

energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors, and environmental
technologies such as electrochemical carbon capture and capacitive
deionization. Recent studies on flat-plate electrodes have demonstrated that
asymmetries in ion properties, such as valences and diffusivities, lead to
intriguing and counter-intuitive physical phenomena. Yet, the consequences of
such asymmetries to ion transport have seldom been explored in porous
geometries. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a perturbation expansion
of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations in a cylindrical pore in the limit of
small potentials for a binary electrolyte with arbitrary valences and
diffusivities. We obtain good agreement between the perturbation analysis and
direct numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals that the charge and the salt
transport are coupled with each other. Further, the coupling between the charge
and salt transport processes is enhanced with an increase in valence and
diffusivity asymmetries of ions. We observe that the mismatch of the ionic
diffusivities induces a non-trivial salt dynamics, producing either transient
depletion or enhancement of salt in the pore. In the regime of high static
diffusion layer conductance, we obtain an analytical solution to our
perturbation model. The solution elucidates how electrolyte asymmetry induces
two charging timescales that are set by the relative pore size. In the
overlapping-double-layer regime, these timescales reduce to the diffusion times
of each ion such that the transport of the two ions appears to be decoupled.
Overall, our work underscores that the asymmetry in cation and anion
diffusivities fundamentally alters the behavior of ionic transport inside a
charged cylindrical pore and opens up new avenues of research on electrolyte
transport in porous materials.

performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where its goal is to distill
knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it
is actually difficult to train a satisfactory teacher GNN due to the well-known
over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge
transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first
Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via Reinforcement learning for
GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper
well-optimized teacher GNN. The core idea of our work is to collaboratively
build two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via
reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical
GNN model often has better and worse performances at different nodes during
training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy
that consists of two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the
directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two
networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local
structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. In essence,
our FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally
compatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five
benchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large
margin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD
has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that
distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.

changes has become a norm for learning various language downstream tasks.
However, for non-language downstream tasks, a common practice is to employ
task-specific designs for input, output layers, and loss functions. For
instance, it is possible to fine-tune an LM into an MNIST classifier by
replacing the word embedding layer with an image patch embedding layer, the
word token output layer with a 10-way output layer, and the word prediction
loss with a 10-way classification loss, respectively. A natural question
arises: Can LM fine-tuning solve non-language downstream tasks without changing
the model architecture or loss function? To answer this, we propose
Language-Interfaced Fine-Tuning (LIFT) and study its efficacy and limitations
by conducting an extensive empirical study on a suite of non-language
classification and regression tasks. LIFT does not make any changes to the
model architecture or loss function, and it solely relies on the natural
language interface, enabling ""no-code machine learning with LMs."" We find that
LIFT performs comparably well across a wide range of low-dimensional
classification and regression tasks, matching the performances of the best
baselines in many cases, especially for the classification tasks. We also
report experimental results on the fundamental properties of LIFT, including
inductive bias, robustness, and sample complexity. We also analyze the effect
of pretraining on LIFT and a few properties/techniques specific to LIFT, e.g.,
context-aware learning via appropriate prompting, calibrated predictions, data
generation, and two-stage fine-tuning. Our code is available at

turbulence, a large-scale dynamo, categorized as the $\alpha^2$-type, can be
excited when the spin rate is large enough. In this paper, the rotational
dependence of the $\alpha^2$-type dynamo and the cause of it are explored by
mean-field (MF) dynamo models coupled with direct numerical simulations (DNSs)
of MHD convections. Bearing the application to the solar/stellar dynamo in
mind, we adopt a strongly-stratified polytrope as a model of the convective
atmosphere. Our DNS models show that the $\alpha^2$-type dynamo is excited when
${\rm Ro} \lesssim 0.1$ where ${\rm Ro}$ is the Rossby number defined with the
volume-averaged mean convective velocity. From the corresponding MF models, we
demonstrate that the rotational dependence of the $\alpha^2$-type dynamo is
mainly due to the change in the magnitude of the turbulent magnetic diffusion.
With increasing the spin rate, the turbulent magnetic diffusion weakens while
the $\alpha$-effect remains essentially unchanged over the convection zone,
providing the critical point for the excitation of the large-scale dynamo. The
${\rm Ro}$-dependence of the stellar magnetic activity observable in the cool
star is also discussed from the viewpoint of the rotational dependence of the
turbulent electro-motive force. Overall our results suggest that, to get a
better grasp of the stellar dynamo activity and its ${\rm Ro}$-dependence, it
should be quantified how the convection velocity changes with the stellar spin
rate with taking account of the rotational quenching and the Lorentz force
feedback from the magnetic field on the convective turbulence.

combination of indicator functions for sets of permutations with fixed values
in $k$ positions. Summarizing prior work by Diaconis, Ellis-Friedgut-Pilpel and
others, we explain why local functions are best understood as `low-frequency'
with respect to the Fourier transform of the symmetric group. When a $k$-local
function is also a class function, we give an explicit rule for calculating its
expansion in the basis $\{ \chi^{\lambda} \}$ of irreducible
$\mathfrak{S}_n$-characters. To do so, we introduce a new {\em path power sum
basis} $\{ \vec{p}_{\mu} \}$ of the ring of symmetric functions and prove a
Path Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule for the Schur expansion of $\vec{p}_{\mu}$. This
rule involves novel ribbon tableau combinatorics distinct from the classical
Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule and gives a formula for the character sums $\sum_w
\chi^{\lambda}(w)$ over permutations $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ with fixed values
in certain positions.
  We also introduce a family of local functions we call {\em regular} that
count weighted occurrences of patterns. Using the theory of character
polynomials for the symmetric group, we show regular class functions can be
interpreted as multivariate rational functions. This allows us to generalize
results of Dimitrov-Khare, Gaetz-Pierson, Gaetz-Ryba on moments for permutation
pattern counting statistics and recover a result of Khare-Lorentz-Yan on
pattern counting in perfect matchings. We compute conditional expectations for
regular statistics applied to uniformly random permutations with a fixed cycle
type. As a consequence, we show many regular statistics satisfy a law of large
numbers for conjugation invariant probability distributions, depending only on
the limiting proportion of fixed points.

each cube satellite delivers requested data to user clusters under its

the satellites, such that the ground users can be directly served with the
pre-stored data. This pre-storing and routing design problem is formulated as a
decentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP) in which we seek to find the
optimal strategy that maximizes the pre-store hit rate, i.e., the fraction of
users being directly served with the pre-stored data. To obtain the optimal
strategy, a distributed distribution-robust meta reinforcement learning
(D2-RMRL) algorithm is proposed that consists of three key ingredients:
value-decomposition for achieving the global optimum in distributed setting
with minimum communication overhead, meta learning to obtain the optimal
initial to reduce the training time under dynamic conditions, and pre-training
to further speed up the meta training procedure. Simulation results show that,
using the proposed value decomposition and meta training techniques, the
satellite networks can achieve a 31.8% improvement of the pre-store hits and a
40.7% improvement of the convergence speed, compared to a baseline

equivalently by a quark-quark-meson coupling at the quark level. Through the

the model efficiency by up to 3.5x without sacrificing the accuracy. Our code

remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the underlying physics
as well as complex occlusion and lighting in captures. Existing solutions
either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple
fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for
real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the
first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics
(ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos
without taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary
conditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene
representation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity
solution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects.
With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid
interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without
additional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural
radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from
the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization
from sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to
progressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models
with a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color
ambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained
density-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to
avoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills
physical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed
constraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and
real flow captures.

paper is twofold: (i) we consider a regression problem in a wireless setting

analyze the effectiveness of adversarial training as a defensive technique in
adversarial settings and show that the robustness of DL-based wireless system
against attacks improves significantly. Specifically, the wireless application
considered in this paper is the DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a
multicell massive multi-input-multi-output system, where the goal of the attack
is to yield an infeasible solution by the DL model. We extend the
gradient-based adversarial attacks: fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum
iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent method to analyze the
susceptibility of the considered wireless application with and without
adversarial training. We analyze the deep neural network (DNN) models

  Independent Component Analysis","Accepted to ICML 2022, 19 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) aims at recovering
statistically independent latent components that are mixed by unknown nonlinear
functions. Central to nICA is the identifiability of the latent components,
which had been elusive until very recently. Specifically, Hyv\""arinen et al.
have shown that the nonlinearly mixed latent components are identifiable (up to
often inconsequential ambiguities) under a generalized contrastive learning
(GCL) formulation, given that the latent components are independent conditioned
on a certain auxiliary variable. The GCL-based identifiability of nICA is
elegant, and establishes interesting connections between nICA and popular
unsupervised/self-supervised learning paradigms in representation learning,
causal learning, and factor disentanglement. However, existing identifiability
analyses of nICA all build upon an unlimited sample assumption and the use of
ideal universal function learners -- which creates a non-negligible gap between
theory and practice.
  Closing the gap is a nontrivial challenge, as there is a lack of established
``textbook'' routine for finite sample analysis of such unsupervised problems.
This work puts forth a finite-sample identifiability analysis of GCL-based
nICA. Our analytical framework judiciously combines the properties of the GCL
loss function, statistical generalization analysis, and numerical
differentiation. Our framework also takes the learning function's approximation
error into consideration, and reveals an intuitive trade-off between the
complexity and expressiveness of the employed function learner. Numerical
experiments are used to validate the theorems.

restriction places an intrinsic limitation on the model. As a result, a number
is computable by an LPP if and only if it is algebraic, namely, not a single
transcendental number can be computed under this notion.
  In this paper, we lift the finitary requirement on equilibria. That is, we
consider systems with a continuum of equilibria. We show that essentially all
numbers in [0,1] that are computable by bounded general-purpose analog
computers (GPACs) or chemical reaction networks (CRNs) can also be computed by
LPPs under this new definition. This implies a rich series of numbers (e.g.,

this paper proposes three modifications to improve its accuracy and
interoperability with existing surface analysis tools, while not sacrificing

Second, we devise a routine to produce smoother template meshes avoiding mesh

Last, we recast pial surface prediction as the deformation of the predicted
white surface leading to a one-to-one mapping between white and pial surface

cortical morphometry. We name the resulting method CorticalFlow$^{++}$. Using
large-scale datasets, we demonstrate the proposed changes provide more

anomaly detector in recent years due to its general effectiveness across
different benchmarks and strong scalability. Nevertheless, its linear
axis-parallel isolation method often leads to (i) failure in detecting hard
anomalies that are difficult to isolate in
high-dimensional/non-linear-separable data space, and (ii) notorious
algorithmic bias that assigns unexpectedly lower anomaly scores to artefact
regions. These issues contribute to high false negative errors. Several iForest
extensions are introduced, but they essentially still employ shallow, linear
data partition, restricting their power in isolating true anomalies. Therefore,
this paper proposes deep isolation forest. We introduce a new representation
scheme that utilises casually initialised neural networks to map original data
into random representation ensembles, where random axis-parallel cuts are
subsequently applied to perform the data partition. This representation scheme
facilitates high freedom of the partition in the original data space
(equivalent to non-linear partition on subspaces of varying sizes), encouraging
a unique synergy between random representations and random partition-based
isolation. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves significant
improvement over state-of-the-art isolation-based methods and deep detectors on

an infalling-rotating envelope model, and the protostellar mass and the radius

related to the small emitting region of iCOMs. In addition, we detect emission
lines of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CCH associated with the protostar, revealing a warm

complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose the plug-and-play
graph-based pseudo label correction network (GLC) to refine the pseudo labels
in the manner of supervised clustering. GLC is trained to perceive the varying
data distribution at each epoch of the self-training with the supervision of
initial pseudo labels generated by any clustering method. It can learn to
rectify the initial noisy labels by means of the relationship constraints
between samples on the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) graph and early-stop training
strategy. Specifically, GLC learns to aggregate node features from neighbors
and predict whether the nodes should be linked on the graph. Besides, GLC is
optimized with 'early stop' before the noisy labels are severely memorized to
prevent overfitting to noisy pseudo labels. Consequently, GLC improves the
quality of pseudo labels though the supervision signals contain some noise,
leading to better Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments in USL and UDA
person Re-ID on Market-1501 and MSMT17 show that our method is widely
compatible with various clustering-based methods and promotes the
state-of-the-art performance consistently.

we delve into this problem and propose a simple yet effective LabelMatch
framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e.,
distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to
approximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the
labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sampling. Guided by this weakly
supervision cue, we introduce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages
adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to generate unbiased
pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an
overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To
remedy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mechanism for
self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the
proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to
match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both
MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of our

for many real-world applications. Since SpGEMM is a well-known memory-bounded
application with vast and irregular memory accesses, considering the memory
access efficiency is of critical importance for SpGEMM's performance. Yet, the
existing methods put less consideration into the memory subsystem and achieved
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the memory access
patterns of SpGEMM and their influences on the memory subsystem. Based on the
analysis, we propose a novel and more efficient accumulation method named
BRMerge for the multi-core CPU architectures.
  The BRMerge accumulation method follows the row-wise dataflow. It first
accesses the $B$ matrix, generates the intermediate lists for one output row,
and stores these intermediate lists in a consecutive memory space, which is
implemented by a ping-pong buffer. It then immediately merges these
intermediate lists generated in the previous phase two by two in a tree-like
hierarchy between two ping-pong buffers. The architectural benefits of BRMerge
are 1) streaming access patterns, 2) minimized TLB cache miss rate, and 3)
reasonably high L1/L2 cache hit rates, which result in both low access latency
and high bandwidth utilization when performing SpGEMM. Based on the BRMerge
accumulation method, we propose two SpGEMM libraries named BRMerge-Upper and
BRMerge-Precise, which use different allocation methods. Performance
evaluations with 26 commonly used benchmarks on two CPU servers show that the
proposed SpGEMM libraries significantly outperform the state-of-the-art SpGEMM
libraries.

many machine learning tasks in recent years. This success is intrinsically
related to the capability of handling long sequences and the presence of
context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism. We argue that these
capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of
trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its
policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention
mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement

the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories
to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show
that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the
Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best
actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control
environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL
presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and
out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these

visual grounding. The previous methods generally address the core problem of
visual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with
manually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated
but also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this,
we first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by
Transformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box
coordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be
replaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher
performance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone
against uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited
visual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to
sub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make
two-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely
Transformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature
encoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that
removes external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for
vision-language fusion at the intermediate layers. We conduct extensive
experiments on five prevalent datasets, and report a series of state-of-the-art

boosting the adaptation performance of numerous models in the model bank. To
tackle this problem, we develop a Stochastic EnsEmble Distillation method to

inter-model interaction and intra-model adaptation, we augment the existing
bi-classifier domain confusion architecture into an Optimization-Separated

adaptation is leveraged via our proposed Unsupervised Performance Evaluation

invasive tumors in the tumor bed, has been widely used to quantify the response
of breast cancer to NAT. Therefore, automatic TC estimation is significant in
clinical practice. However, existing state-of-the-art methods usually take it
as a TC score regression problem, which ignores the ambiguity of TC labels
caused by subjective assessment or multiple raters. In this paper, to
efficiently leverage the label ambiguities, we proposed an Uncertainty-aware
Label disTRibution leArning (ULTRA) framework for automatic TC estimation. The
proposed ULTRA first converted the single-value TC labels to discrete label
distributions, which effectively models the ambiguity among all possible TC
labels. Furthermore, the network learned TC label distributions by minimizing
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted and ground-truth TC
label distributions, which better supervised the model to leverage the
ambiguity of TC labels. Moreover, the ULTRA mimicked the multi-rater fusion
process in clinical practice with a multi-branch feature fusion module to
further explore the uncertainties of TC labels. We evaluated the ULTRA on the
public BreastPathQ dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the ULTRA
outperformed the regression-based methods for a large margin and achieved

computationally expensive task and one needs to resort to enhanced sampling
methods such as importance sampling. Since we can formulate the problem of
finding optimal importance sampling controls as a stochastic optimization
problem, this then brings additional numerical challenges and the convergence
of corresponding algorithms might as well suffer from metastabilty. In this
article, we address this issue by combining systematic control approaches with
the heuristic adaptive metadynamics method. Crucially, we approximate the
importance sampling control by a neural network, which makes the algorithm in
principle feasible for high dimensional applications. We can numerically
demonstrate in relevant metastable problems that our algorithm is more
effective than previous attempts and that only the combination of the two
approaches leads to a satisfying convergence and therefore to an efficient
sampling in certain metastable settings.

build human activity recognition (HAR) models. Training on existing data often
makes the model biased towards the distribution of the training data, thus the

Although existing efforts on transfer learning and domain adaptation try to
solve the above problem, they still need access to unlabeled data on the target
domain, which may not be possible in real scenarios. Few works pay attention to
training a model that can generalize well to unseen target domains for HAR. In
this paper, we propose a novel method called Semantic-Discriminative Mixup
(SDMix) for generalizable cross-domain HAR. Firstly, we introduce
semantic-aware Mixup that considers the activity semantic ranges to overcome
the semantic inconsistency brought by domain differences. Secondly, we
introduce the large margin loss to enhance the discrimination of Mixup to
prevent misclassification brought by noisy virtual labels. Comprehensive
generalization experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SDMix
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with 6% average
accuracy improvement on cross-person, cross-dataset, and cross-position HAR.

redshifts of $z=0.3-1.4$, based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC-SSP) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST). We
use the $k$-nearest neighbor method to measure the local galaxy number density
around our radio galaxy sample. We find that the overdensities of the radio
galaxies are weakly but significantly anti-correlated with redshift. This is
consistent with the known result that the relative abundance of less-massive
radio galaxies increases with redshift, because less-massive radio galaxies
reside in relatively low density regions. Massive radio galaxies with stellar
mass of $M_* >10^{11}M_\odot$ are found in high density environments compared
with the control sample galaxies with radio-non-detection and
matched-stellar-mass. Less-massive radio galaxies with $M_* <10^{11}M_\odot$
reside in average density environments. The fraction of the radio galaxies
associated with the neighbors within a typical major merger scale, $<70$ kpc,
is higher than (comparable to) that of the control galaxies at $M_*
>10^{11}M_\odot$ ($M_* <10^{11}M_\odot$). We also find that the local densities
around the radio galaxies are anti-correlated with the radio luminosities and
black hole mass accretion rates at fixed stellar mass. These findings suggest
that massive radio galaxies have matured through galaxy mergers in the past,
and have supermassive black holes whose mass accretion almost ceased at
$z>1.4$, while less-massive radio galaxies undergo active accretion just at
this epoch, as they have avoided such merger events.

nonlinear elastic continuum has been considered with various levels of
representation of phonon dispersion and Brillouin zone shape, and with
Gr\""uneisen parameter used as an average measure of crystal anharmonicity. In
addition, thermal conductivity prediction of different models for the treatment
of the off-diagonal elements of phonon collision operator are compared. For a
model system, argon, with a relatively high anisotropy ratio, the results show
that accounting for anisotropy is critical for accurate determination of
available phase space for 3-phonon scattering and scattering rates. Moreover,
widely spread approximations such as isotropic continuum and Single Mode
Relaxation Time are found unreliable, even for cubic systems. The success of
these approximations is demonstrated to be a direct result of error
cancellations. By benchmarking against our iterative solution of Boltzmann
Transport Equation, which achieves excellent agreement with experimental
thermal conductivity data for solid argon (2-80 K), we show the essential
importance of considering coupling terms of phonon scattering kernel at phonon
mode level, and not in a statistical average sense as, for example, Callaway
model does. Moreover, our results manifest the role played by coherent phonon
scattering near the melting temperature, in agreement with molecular dynamics
findings, which serves as an evidence for the crossover between heat diffusion
mediated by particle-like phonons (incoherent scattering) and wave-like heat
propagation due to phonon coherent scattering. Furthermore, sensitivity of
conductivity prediction to phonon spectrum is revealed to change over
temperature.

throungh the double threshold-based boundary simplification and the convex

typical scenes verify the effectiveness and robustness. In addition, the
quantitative evaluation shows the superior performance on making use of fewer

spin-orbit coupling. The two distinct superconducting gaps, one for each

Their different amplitudes are due to different normal densities of states of

  Diversity and Complexity","10 figures, 4 tables",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most prominent interannual
climate variability in the tropics and exhibits diverse features in
spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, a simple multiscale intermediate
coupled stochastic model is developed to capture the ENSO diversity and
complexity. The model starts with a deterministic and linear coupled
interannual atmosphere, ocean and sea surface temperature (SST) system. It can
generate two distinct dominant linear solutions that represent the eastern
Pacific (EP) and the central Pacific (CP) El Ni\~nos, respectively. In addition
to adopting a stochastic model for characterizing the intraseasonal wind
bursts, another simple stochastic process is developed to describe the decadal
variation of the background Walker circulation. The latter links the two
dominant modes in a simple nonlinear fashion and advances the modulation of the
strength and occurrence frequency of the EP and the CP events. Finally, a cubic
nonlinear damping is adopted to parameterize the relationship between
subsurface temperature and thermocline depth. The model succeeds in reproducing
the spatiotemporal dynamical evolution of different types of the ENSO events.
It also accurately recovers the strongly non-Gaussian probability density
function, the seasonal phase locking, the power spectrum and the temporal
autocorrelation function of the SST anomalies in all the three Ni\~no regions
(3, 3.4 and 4) across the equatorial Pacific. Furthermore, both the composites
of the SST anomalies for various ENSO events and the strength-location
bivariate distribution of equatorial Pacific SST maxima for the El Ni\~no
events from the model simulation highly resemble those from the observations.

invest more effort to get a larger share. However, if everyone acts similarly,
they all get the same piece they would obtain without extra effort. This is the
involution game dilemma that can be detected in several real-life situations.
It is also a realistic assumption that resources are not uniform in space and
time, which may influence the system's resulting involution level. We here
introduce spatio-temporal heterogeneity of social resources and explore their
consequences on involution. When spatial heterogeneity is applied, network
reciprocity can mitigate the involution for rich resources, which would be
critical otherwise in a homogeneous population. Interestingly, when the
resource level is modest, spatial heterogeneity causes more intensive
involution in a system where most cooperator agents, who want to keep
investment at a low level, are present. This picture is partly the opposite in
the extreme case when more investment is less effective. Spatial heterogeneity
can also produce a counterintuitive effect when the presence of alternative
resource levels cannot explain the emergence of involution. If we apply
temporal heterogeneity additionally, then the impact of spatial heterogeneity
practically vanishes, and we turn back to the behavior observed in a
homogeneous population earlier. Our observations are also supported by solving
the corresponding replicator equations numerically.

ability to characterize tissue properties. As speckle is dependent on the
underlying tissue architecture, modelling it may aid in tasks like segmentation

commonly used to investigate dysfunction, it is currently unknown which
statistical distribution best characterises such speckle. This is especially
true for the regions of the transplanted kidney: the cortex, the medulla and
the central echogenic complex. Furthermore, it is unclear how these
distributions vary by patient variables such as age, sex, body mass index,
primary disease, or donor type. These traits may influence speckle modelling
given their influence on kidney anatomy. We are the first to investigate these
two aims. N=821 kidney transplant recipient B-mode images were automatically
segmented into the cortex, medulla, and central echogenic complex using a
neural network. Seven distinct probability distributions were fitted to each
region. The Rayleigh and Nakagami distributions had model parameters that
differed significantly between the three regions (p <= 0.05). While both had
excellent goodness of fit, the Nakagami had higher Kullbeck-Leibler divergence.
Recipient age correlated weakly with scale in the cortex (Omega: rho = 0.11, p
= 0.004), while body mass index correlated weakly with shape in the medulla (m:
rho = 0.08, p = 0.04). Neither sex, primary disease, nor donor type
demonstrated any correlation. We propose the Nakagami distribution be used to
characterize transplanted kidneys regionally independent of disease etiology

20] x 10e14 Msun, and lies at redshifts 0.05<z<1.13. Using XMM-Newton
observations, we derive an average ICM density profile for the SZE-selected
systems and determine its scaling with mass and redshift. This average profile
evolves slightly stronger than self-similar (a_z = 2.09+/-0.02), and has
significant dependence on mass (a_M = 0.22 +/- 0.01). Deviations from the
average scaling with radius indicate different evolution for the core regions
and the bulk. We measure the radial variation of the intrinsic scatter, finding
a slight evolution with redshift. The average profile of the SZE-selected
systems describes that of X-ray-selected systems at low redshift. The scaled
core properties are positively skewed at later times, suggesting an increased
incidence of centrally peaked objects at lower redshifts. The relation between
LXc and MYx has an intrinsic scatter of 13%. Using simulations, we investigate
the impact of selection effects, intrinsic scatter, and covariance on this
relation. The slope is insensitive to selection and intrinsic scatter between
quantities; however, the scatter is very dependent on the covariance between
LXc and Yx. Accounting for our use of the Yx proxy to determine the mass, we
estimate an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter with respect to the true mass
of 22%. We probe the connection between the scatter in density profiles and
that in the LXc-M relation. Our results suggest that the ICM bulk evolves
approximately self-similarly, with the core regions evolving separately;
indicate a variation of the gas content with mass; and show that LXc has a
tight relation to the underlying mass.

fundamental discrepancy between the common practice in teacher network training
and the distillation objective. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
student-oriented teacher network training framework SoTeacher, inspired by
recent findings that student performance hinges on teacher's capability to
approximate the true label distribution of training samples. We theoretically
established that (1) the empirical risk minimizer with proper scoring rules as
loss function can provably approximate the true label distribution of training
data if the hypothesis function is locally Lipschitz continuous around training
samples; and (2) when data augmentation is employed for training, an additional
constraint is required that the minimizer has to produce consistent predictions
across augmented views of the same training input. In light of our theory,
SoTeacher renovates the empirical risk minimization by incorporating Lipschitz
regularization and consistency regularization. It is worth mentioning that
SoTeacher is applicable to almost all teacher-student architecture pairs,
requires no prior knowledge of the student upon teacher's training, and induces
almost no computation overhead. Experiments on two benchmark datasets confirm
that SoTeacher can improve student performance significantly and consistently
across various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs.

searches for the best combination candidate within a finite collection.
Motivated by this characteristic, we solve N:M sparsity in an efficient

$C_{\text{M}}^{\text{N}}$ combination subsets of a fixed size N. Then, we
conquer the combinatorial problem by assigning each combination a learnable

contrast among different tissues. To this end, we propose a novel method Online
Easy Example Mining (OEEM) that encourages the network to focus on credible
supervision signals rather than noisy signals, therefore mitigating the
influence of inevitable false predictions in pseudo-masks. According to the
characteristics of glandular datasets, we design a strong framework for gland
segmentation. Our results exceed many fully-supervised methods and
weakly-supervised methods for gland segmentation over 4.4% and 6.04% at mIoU,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/OEEM.

to systems like a social network of humans and a network of cities and

money as a proxy for the resources. Here we extend the model of resource
dependencies in networks that was recently proposed by one of us, by
incorporating the concept of money so that the vertices of a network can sell
and buy required resources among themselves. We simulate the model using the
configuration model as a substrate for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous
degree distributions and using various exchange strategies. We show that a
moderate amount of initial heterogeneity in the money on the vertices can
significantly improve the survivability of Scale-free networks but not that of

an increase in the star luminosity through their annihilation process. We show
that when the WIMP interacts with the nuclear targets within the WD through
inelastic scattering and its mass exceeds a few tens GeV the data on
low-temperature large-mass WDs in the Messier 4 globular cluster can probe
values of the mass splitting $\delta\lesssim$ 40 MeV. Such value largely
exceeds those ensuing from direct detection and from solar neutrino searches.
We apply such improved constraint to the specific DM scenario of a
self-conjugate bi-doublet in the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), where the
standard $SU(2)_L$ group with coupling $g_L$ is extended by an additional
$SU(2)_R$ with coupling $g_R$. We show that bounds from WDs significantly
reduce the cosmologically viable parameter space of such scenario, in
particular requiring $g_R>g_L$. For instance, for $g_R/g_L$ = 1.8 we find the
two viable mass ranges 1.2 TeV $\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim$ 3 TeV and 5 TeV
$\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim$ 10 TeV, when the charged $SU(2)_R$ gauge boson mass
$M_{W_2}$ is lighter than $\simeq$ 12 TeV. We also discuss the ultraviolet
completion of the LRSM model, when the latter is embedded in a Grand Unified
Theory. We show that such low-energy parameter space and compatibility to
proton-decay bounds require a non-trivial extension of the particle content of
the minimal model. We provide a specific example where $M_{W_2}\lesssim$ 10 TeV
is achieved by extending the LRSM at high energy with color triplets that are
singlets under all other groups, and $g_R/g_L>$1 is obtained by introducing
$SU(2)_L$ triplets with no $SU(2)_R$ counterparts, i.e. by breaking the
symmetry between the multiplets of $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$.

drone) are being utilized in important applications such as emergency response,
environment and infrastructure monitoring, defense and security, and commerce.
In such networks, swarms of UAVs cooperate in executing one or more missions to
achieve the application's objectives. The UAVs communicate with terrestrial
networks by connecting to fixed or mobile ground control stations (GCS). The
ability of drones to connect to online applications and offer services to
Internet users has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Drones (IoD).
However, IoD applications are highly vulnerable to many types of cyberattacks.
Hence, mechanisms must be deployed to secure the IoD operations and data.
Recently, the blockchain has been proposed as a solution to detect and prevent
malicious attacks on the UAV network (UAVN). Due to the UAV's limited
resources, it becomes a challenge to integrate the blockchain into the IoD. In
this paper, we propose a model that enables a drone to store the important data
that it requires during its flight within a lightweight blockchain system. In
addition, we propose a new blockchain consensus mechanism in which several
miners produce their blocks in parallel, which decreases the time needed to add
transactions securely to the blockchain and meets the requirements of
delay-sensitive applications. Our simulations prove the advantages of the
proposed model in decreasing the transaction-to-blockchain delay, the average
drone energy consumption, and the blockchain block size as compared to other
IoD blockchain systems.

introducing an approach for determinant-free training of flows inspired by

We empirically demonstrate that energy flows achieve competitive generative

place within a material subjected to a constant applied stress smaller than its
athermal, time-independent strength. This time-dependence is classically
attributed to thermal activation of local deformation events. The phenomenology
of creep is characterized by several ubiquitous but empirical rheological and
scaling laws. We focus here on primary creep following the onset of loading,
for which a power law decay of the strain-rate is observed, with the exponent p
varying between '0.4 and 1, this upper bound defining the so-called logarithmic
creep. Although this phenomenology is known for more than a century, the
physical origin of Andrade-like (p <1) creep remains unclear and debated. Here
we show that p <1 values arise from the interplay between thermal activation
and elastic stress redistribution. The latter stimulates creep dynamics from a
shortening of waiting times between successive events, is associated to
material damage and possibly, at high temperature and/or stresses, gives rise
to avalanches of deformation events.

hiring, loan granting, etc.). The big impediment to the use of causality to
address fairness, however, is the unavailability of the causal model (typically
represented as a causal graph). Existing causal approaches to fairness in the
literature do not address this problem and assume that the causal model is
available. In this paper, we do not make such assumption and we review the
major algorithms to discover causal relations from observable data. This study
focuses on causal discovery and its impact on fairness. In particular, we show
how different causal discovery approaches may result in different causal models
and, most importantly, how even slight differences between causal models can
have significant impact on fairness/discrimination conclusions. These results
are consolidated by empirical analysis using synthetic and standard fairness
benchmark datasets. The main goal of this study is to highlight the importance
of the causal discovery step to appropriately address fairness using causality.

state-of-the-art machine learning methods in some specialized settings. For
example, quantum kernel methods have been shown to provide an exponential
speedup on a learning version of the discrete logarithm problem. Understanding
the generalization of quantum models is essential to realizing similar speedups
on problems of practical interest. Recent results demonstrate that
generalization is hindered by the exponential size of the quantum feature
space. Although these results suggest that quantum models cannot generalize
when the number of qubits is large, in this paper we show that these results
rely on overly restrictive assumptions. We consider a wider class of models by
varying a hyperparameter that we call quantum kernel bandwidth. We analyze the
large-qubit limit and provide explicit formulas for the generalization of a
quantum model that can be solved in closed form. Specifically, we show that
changing the value of the bandwidth can take a model from provably not being
able to generalize to any target function to good generalization for
well-aligned targets. Our analysis shows how the bandwidth controls the
spectrum of the kernel integral operator and thereby the inductive bias of the
model. We demonstrate empirically that our theory correctly predicts how
varying the bandwidth affects generalization of quantum models on challenging
datasets, including those far outside our theoretical assumptions. We discuss
the implications of our results for quantum advantage in machine learning.

mixing parameters of quarks and leptons which the SM takes as inputs from

Hence, to the accuracy that these two sets of parameters agree in value, and

(ii) a mixing between the standard Higgs with a new scalar boson also in the

enhancement of the $W$ mass over the SM value \cite{zmixed}, and (ii$'$)

threat of land degradation and bioproductivity-loss. Self-organized vegetation
patterns are a remarkable characteristic of these ecosystems; apart from being
visually captivating, patterns modulate the system-response to increasing
environmental stress. Empirical studies hinted that herbivory is one the key
regulatory mechanism behind pattern formation and overall ecosystem
functioning. However most of the mathematical models have taken a mean-field
strategy to grazing; foraging has been considered to be independent of spatial
distribution of vegetation. To this end, an extended version of the celebrated
plant-water model due to Klausmeier, has been taken as the base here. To
encompass the effect of heterogeneous vegetation distribution on foraging
intensity and subsequent impact on entire ecosystem, grazing is considered here
to depend on spatially weighted average vegetation density, instead of density
at a particular point. Moreover, varying influence of vegetation at any
location over gazing elsewhere, is incorporated by choosing suitable averaging
function. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that inclusion of spatial
non-locality, alters the understanding of system dynamics significantly. The
grazing ecosystem is found to be more resilient to increasing aridity than it
was anticipated to be in earlier studies on non-local grazing. The
system-response to rising environmental pressure is also observed to vary
depending on the grazer. Obtained results also suggest possibility of
multi-stability due the history-dependence of system-response. Overall, this
work indicates that the spatial heterogeneity in grazing intensity has a
decisive role to play in the functioning of water-limited ecosystems.

of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in

COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that
evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region,
predicts COVID-19 statistics (the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and
deaths), and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation
measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of
COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new
infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external
factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature,
humidity), different variants of concern, vaccination rate, and mitigation
measures. Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that we are
experiencing a deadly new wave that will peak on 26 January 2022, which is very
similar in numbers to the wave we had in February 2020. The policy-makers have
only one choice that is to increase the strength of the currently applied
mitigation measures for 30 days. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model
accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations,
and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to
modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental
conditions and mitigation measures. We release the source code of the
COVIDHunter implementation at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/COVIDHunter.

method. Current decoy-state QKD setups operate at GHz repetition rates, a
regime where memory effects in the modulators and electronics that control them
create correlations between the intensities of the emitted pulses. This
translates into information leakage about the selected intensities, which
cripples a crucial premise of the decoy-state method, thus invalidating the use
of standard security analyses. To overcome this problem, a novel security proof
that exploits the Cauchy-Schwarz constraint has been introduced recently. Its
main drawback is, however, that the achievable key rate is significantly lower
than that of the ideal scenario without intensity correlations. Here, we
improve this security proof technique by combining it with a fine-grained
decoy-state analysis, which can deliver a tight estimation of the relevant
parameters that determine the secret key rate. This results in a notable
performance enhancement, being now the attainable distance double than that of
previous analyses for certain parameter regimes. Also, we show that when the
probability density function of the intensity fluctuations, conditioned on the
current and previous intensity choices, is known, our approach provides a key
rate very similar to the ideal scenario, which highlights the importance of an
accurate experimental characterization of the correlations.

formulating treatment plans. Although previous work has produced impressive
results in classifying interstitial lung diseases, there is still room for
improving the accuracy of these techniques, mainly to enhance automated
decision-making. In order to improve the classification precision, our study
proposes a convolutional neural networks-based framework with auxiliary
information. Firstly, ILD images are added with their medical information by
re-scaling the original image in Hounsfield Units. Secondly, a modified CNN
model is used to produce a vector of classification probability for each
tissue. Thirdly, location information of the input image, consisting of the
occurrence frequencies of different diseases in the CT scans on certain
locations, is used to calculate a location weight vector. Finally, the Hadamard
product between two vectors is used to produce a decision vector for the
prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the results using a
publicly available ILD database show the potential of predicting these using
different auxiliary information.

it has been proposed that operators charged under global symmetries in CFTs, in
three dimensions or higher, should satisfy certain convexity properties on
their spectrum. A key element of this proposal is the charge at which convexity
must appear, which was proposed to never be parametrically large. In this
paper, we develop this constraint in the context of multiple Abelian global
symmetries. We propose the statement that the convex directions in the
multi-dimensional charge space should generate a sub-lattice of the total
lattice of charged operators, such that the index of this sub-lattice cannot be
made parametrically large. In the special case of two-dimensional CFTs, the
index can be made parametrically large, which we prove by an explicit example.
However, we also prove that in two dimensions there always exist convex
directions generating a sub-lattice with an index bounded by the current levels
of the global symmetry. Therefore, in two dimensions, the conjecture should be
slightly modified to account for the current levels, and then it can be proven.
In more than two dimensions, we show that the index of the sub-lattice
generated by marginally convex charge vectors associated to BPS operators only,
can be made parametrically large. However, we do not find evidence for
parametric delay in convexity once all operators are considered.

phenomenon. However, although retracted paper information is publicly available
via publishers, it is somewhat distributed and inconsistent. Objective: The aim
is to assess: (i) the extent and nature of retracted research in Computer
Science (CS) (ii) the post-retraction citation behaviour of retracted works and
(iii) the potential impact on systematic reviews and mapping studies. Method:
We analyse the Retraction Watch database and take citation information from the
Web of Science and Google scholar. Results: We find that of the 33,955 entries
in the Retraction watch database (16 May 2022), 2,816 are classified as CS,
i.e., approximately 8.3%. For CS, 56% of retracted papers, provide little or no
information as to the reasons. This contrasts with 26% for other disciplines.
There is also a remarkable disparity between different publishers, a tendency
for multiple versions of a retracted paper over and above the Version of Record
(VoR), and for new citations long after a paper is officially retracted.
Conclusions: Unfortunately retraction seems to be a sufficiently common outcome
for a scientific paper that we as a research community need to take it more
seriously, e.g., standardising procedures and taxonomies across publishers and
the provision of appropriate research tools. Finally, we recommend particular
caution when undertaking secondary analyses and meta-analyses which are at risk
of becoming contaminated by these problem primary studies.

cycling critically relies on a sufficiently developed bicycle infrastructure.
However, designing efficient bike path networks constitutes a complex problem
that requires balancing multiple constraints while still supporting all cycling
demand. Here, we propose a framework to create families of efficient bike path
networks by explicitly taking into account the demand distribution and
cyclists' route choices based on safety preferences. By reversing the network
formation process and iteratively removing bike paths from an initially
complete bike path network and continually updating cyclists' route choices, we
create a sequence of networks that is always adapted to the current cycling
demand. We illustrate the applicability of this demand-driven planning scheme
for two cities. A comparison of the resulting bike path networks with those
created for homogenized demand enables us to quantify the importance of the
demand distribution for network planning. The proposed framework may thus
enable quantitative evaluation of the structure of current and planned bike
path networks and support the demand-driven design of efficient
infrastructures.

the third in a series of three papers describing the work done within CU8 for

summarise their objectives, the methods they employ, their performance, and the
results they produce for Gaia DR3. We further advise how to use these data
products and highlight some limitations. Methods. The Discrete Source
Classifier (DSC) module provides classification probabilities associated with
five types of sources: quasars, galaxies, stars, white dwarfs, and physical
binary stars. A subset of these sources are processed by the Outlier Analysis
(OA) module, which performs an unsupervised clustering analysis, and then
associates labels with the clusters to complement the DSC classification. The
Quasi Stellar Object Classifier (QSOC) and the Unresolved Galaxy Classifier
(UGC) determine the redshifts of the sources classified as quasar and galaxy by
the DSC module. Finally, the Total Galactic Extinction (TGE) module uses the
extinctions of individual stars determined by another CU8 module to determine
the asymptotic extinction along all lines of sight for Galactic latitudes |b| >
5 deg. Results. Gaia DR3 includes 1591 million sources with DSC
classifications; 56 million sources to which the OA clustering is applied; 1.4
million sources with redshift estimates from UGC; 6.4 million sources with QSOC
redshift; and 3.1 million level 9 HEALPixes of size 0.013 squared degree, where
the extinction is evaluated by TGE.

from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE). The overall polarization degree of $1.8 \pm 0.3$% is detected
by summing over a large region, assuming circular symmetry for the polarization
vectors. The measurements imply an average polarization degree for the
synchrotron component of $\sim 2.5$%, and close to 5% for the X-ray
synchrotron-domimated forward-shock region. These numbers are based on an
assessment of the thermal and non-thermal radiation contributions, for which we
used a detailed spatial-spectral model based on Chandra X-ray data. A
pixel-by-pixel search for polarization provides a few tentative detections from
discrete regions at the $\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level. Given the number of
pixels, the significance is {insufficient} to claim a detection for individual
pixels, but implies considerable turbulence on scales smaller than the angular
resolution. Cas A's X-ray continuum emission is dominated by synchrotron
radiation from regions within $\lesssim 10^{17}$ cm of the forward- and reverse
shocks. We find that i) the measured polarization angle corresponds to a
radially-oriented magnetic field, similar to what has been inferred from radio
observations; ii) the X-ray polarization degree is lower than in the radio band
($\sim 5$%). Since shock compression should impose a tangential magnetic field
structure, the IXPE results imply that magnetic-fields are reoriented within
$\sim 10^{17}$cm of the shock. If the magnetic-field alignment is due to
locally enhanced acceleration near quasi-parallel shocks, the preferred X-ray
polarization angle suggests a size of $3\times 10^{16}$ cm for cells with
radial magnetic fields.

the GGM is able to detect the most discriminative joint interactions and that
it outperforms five related interpretable models in correct classification rate

many downstream tasks. Recent shape modeling methods mostly adopt implicit
neural representation to fit a signed distance field (SDF) and optimize the
network by \emph{unsigned} supervision. However, these methods occasionally
have difficulty in finding the coarse shape for complicated objects, especially
suffering from the ``ghost'' surfaces (\ie, fake surfaces that should not
exist). To guide the network quickly fit the coarse shape, we propose to
utilize the signed supervision in regions that are obviously outside the object
and can be easily determined, resulting in our semi-signed supervision. To
better recover high-fidelity details, a novel importance sampling based on
tracked region losses and a progressive positional encoding (PE) prioritize the
optimization towards underfitting and complicated regions. Specifically, we
voxelize and partition the object space into \emph{sign-known} and
\emph{sign-uncertain} regions, in which different supervisions are applied.
Besides, we adaptively adjust the sampling rate of each voxel according to the
tracked reconstruction loss, so that the network can focus more on the
complicated under-fitting regions. To this end, we propose our semi-signed
prioritized (SSP) neural fitting, and conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate that SSP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets
including the ABC subset and various challenging data. The code will be
released upon the publication.

this paper for islanded ac microgrids fed by multiple PV-battery based
distributed generators (DG). The stochastic and unequal irradiation results in
unequal PV output, which causes an unequal state-of-charge (SoC) among the
batteries of the DGs. This effect may cause the difference in the SoCs to
increase considerably over time, leading to some batteries reaching their SoC
limits. These batteries would no longer be able to control the dc-link of the
hybrid grid forming DG. The proposed NN-EMS ensures SoC balancing by learning
an optimal state-action mapping using the outputs of an optimal power flow
(OPF). The training dataset has been generated by executing a mixed-integer
linear programming based OPF for droop-based island microgrids considering a
practical generation-load profile. The resultant NN-EMS controller inherits the
information of optimal states and the network behaviour. Compared to
traditional time-ahead centralized methods, the proposed strategy does not
require accurate generation-load forecasting. Further, it can also respond to
the variations in the PV power in near-real-time without resorting to solving
an OPF. The proposed NN-EMS controller has been validated by case studies on a
CIGRE LV microgrid containing PV-battery hybrid DGs. The proposed concept can
also be extended to synthesize decentralized controllers that can cooperate
among themselves to achieve a global objective without communication.

structures, need to be exploited for not only investigating the intricacies at
the fundamental level in the material properties themselves but also for
improving their performance for broadband and high-power THz emission. Here, we
report ultrafast THz emission from CoFeB/Ta bilayer at varying sample
temperatures in a large range to unravel the role of intrinsic and extrinsic
spin to charge conversion processes. In addition to an enhancement in the THz
emission, its temperature dependence shows a THz signal polarity reversal if
the CoFeB/Ta sample is annealed at an elevated temperature. We extract the
behaviour of the spin Hall resistivity, determine the intrinsic spin Hall
conductivity contribution in it and compare those with the standard Fe/Pt
system. Our results clearly demonstrate a giant interfacial contribution to the
overall spin Hall angle arising from the modified interface in the annealed
CoFeB/Ta, where a sign reversal in the corresponding spin Hall angle is
manifested from the THz amplitude variation with the temperature.

IPs may lack a closed-form expression but are easy to sample from. Examples
include, among others, Bayesian neural networks or neural samplers. IPs can be
used as priors over functions, resulting in flexible models with
well-calibrated prediction uncertainty estimates. Methods based on IPs usually
carry out function-space approximate inference, which overcomes some of the
difficulties of parameter-space approximate inference. Nevertheless, the
approximations employed often limit the expressiveness of the final model,
resulting, e.g., in a Gaussian predictive distribution, which can be
restrictive. We propose here a multi-layer generalization of IPs called the
Deep Variational Implicit process (DVIP). This generalization is similar to
that of deep GPs over GPs, but it is more flexible due to the use of IPs as the
prior distribution over the latent functions. We describe a scalable
variational inference algorithm for training DVIP and show that it outperforms
previous IP-based methods and also deep GPs. We support these claims via
extensive regression and classification experiments. We also evaluate DVIP on
large datasets with up to several million data instances to illustrate its good

unrealistic in practice: formalizing system requirements is notoriously
difficult, error-prone, and requires substantial training. To alleviate this
severe hurdle, we propose a fundamentally novel approach to writing formal
specifications, named specification sketching for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
The key idea is that an engineer can provide a partial LTL formula, called an
LTL sketch, where parts that are hard to formalize can be left out. Given a set
of examples describing system behaviors that the specification should or should
not allow, the task of a so-called sketching algorithm is then to complete a
given sketch such that the resulting LTL formula is consistent with the
examples. We show that deciding whether a sketch can be completed falls into
the complexity class NP and present two SAT-based sketching algorithms. We also
demonstrate that sketching is a practical approach to writing formal
specifications using a prototype implementation.

for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) using technical

so, it may occur that the market is not favorable to purchase on certain days,

another method should be used. So, a hybrid model composed of empirical mode

decomposes the series into several sub-series, and thus the main omponent

the prediction of the next element of component. If the value predicted by the
ELM is greater than the last value, then the purchase of the stock is
confirmed. The method was applied in a universe of 50 stocks in the Brazilian

the random selection and the return generated by the Bovespa index.
Confirmation with the EMD-ELM hybrid model was able to increase the percentage

performance for the regression and classification task has always been achieved

extract invariant density features in preparation for the matching. The graph

Subsequently, we propose a theoretically-sound and efficient adversarial attack

acceleration of compositional inhomogeneities in nozzles with viscous
dissipation (non-isentropic nozzles). First, we derive the
quasi-one-dimensional equations from the conservation laws of multicomponent
flows. Second, we validate the proposed model with the experimental data
available in the literature for binary mixtures of four gases. Third, we
calculate the nozzle transfer functions for different Helmholtz numbers and
friction factors, in both subsonic and supersonic flows with/without shock
waves. We show that friction has a significant effect on the generation of
indirect noise, for which the physical mechanism is identified and explained.
Fourth, we find a semi-analytical solution with path integrals, which provide
an asymptotic expansion with respect to the Helmholtz number. Fifth, we
introduce the compositional noise scaling factor, which is applied to quickly
estimate compositional noise from the knowledge of only one single-component
gas transfer function. The approximation error is less than $1\%$. The proposed
low-order model provides accurate estimates of the transfer functions and
physical insight into indirect noise for multicomponent gases. This opens up
new possibilities to accurately predict, and understand, sound generation in
gas turbines.

building and road inspections. While recent studies have made significant
improvements in accuracy, they typically heavily depend on pixel-level crack
annotations, which are time-consuming to obtain. In earlier work, we proposed
to reduce the annotation cost bottleneck by reformulating the crack
segmentation problem as a weakly-supervised problem -- i.e. the annotation
process is expedited by sacrificing the annotation quality. The loss in
annotation quality was remedied by refining the inference with per-pixel
brightness values, which was effective when the pixel brightness distribution
between cracks and non-cracks are well separated, but struggled greatly for
lighter-colored cracks as well as non-crack targets in which the brightness
distribution is less articulated. In this work, we propose an annotation
refinement approach which takes advantage of the fact that the regions falsely
annotated as cracks have similar local visual features as the background.
Because the proposed approach is data-driven, it is effective regardless of a
dataset's pixel brightness profile. The proposed method is evaluated on three
crack segmentation datasets as well as one blood vessel segmentation dataset to
test for domain robustness, and the results show that it speeds up the
annotation process by factors of 10 to 30, while the detection accuracy stays
at a comparable level.

nonlinear model, which was previously verified by authors, is used to design a
constrained control law that allows us to achieve a steady-state distribution
of the temperature in one of the cylinders in much less time than the
characteristic time of transient processes. The initial-boundary value problem
is exactly linearized over temperature by means of feedback linearization.
Although the resulting system is nonlinear in a control function, it is
possible to construct a finite-dimensional approximation based on analytical
solution of the corresponding eigenproblem for a constant control signal. The
time-optimal control problem is studied numerically by using this eigenfunction
decomposition. To construct admissible control laws, an auxiliary unconstrained
optimization problem is introduced. Its cost functional represents a weighted
sum of temperature deviation from the desired zero distribution and a penalty
for violating an electric power constraint. The control time interval is split
into several parts, and on each subinterval the control signal is taken
constant. The optimal piecewise constant feedforward control is found
numerically by applying the gradient descent method. We analyze the proposed
control law with respect to the shortest admissible time of the process.

However, significant time is required to learn these expressions and the
resulting expressions can either become very complex or inaccurate in the
presence of dirty data. The alternative of manually writing regular expressions
becomes unattractive when faced with a large number of values which must be
matched.
  As an alternative, we propose learning from a large corpus of manually
authored, but uncurated regular expressions mined from a public repository. The
advantage of this approach is that we are able to extract salient features from
a set of strings with limited overhead to feature engineering. Since the set of
regular expressions covers a wide range of application domains, we expect them
to widely applicable.
  To demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our approach, we train a model
using the extracted corpus of regular expressions for the class of semantic
type classification. While our approach generally yields results that are
inferior to the state of the art, our training data is much smaller and simpler
and a closer analysis of the performance results suggests this approach holds
significant promise. We also demonstrate the possibility of using uncurated

this finding, we carry out a variant of this analysis by fitting the data to an

as a function of distance. We find that both the exponent and normalization
constant show only a marginal variation with distance, and are consistent with
a constant value, to within $2\sigma$. We also checked to see if there is a
statistically significant difference between the BTFR results after bifurcating
the dataset at distances of 9 and 17 Mpc. We find that almost all the sets of
subsamples obey the BTFR with $\chi^2$/dof close to 1 and the best-fit
parameters consistent across the subsamples. Only the subsample with $D<17$ Mpc
shows a marginal discrepancy (at $1.75\sigma$) with respect to the BTFR.

they break crystal symmetries that can protect the topological states. On the

source of nontrivial topology. Motivated by recent experiments on
three-dimensional (3D) topological systems such as Bi$_2$TeI and
Bi$_{14}$Rh$_3$I$_9$, we examine the effect of stacking faults on the
electronic properties of weak topological insulators (WTIs). Working with a
simple model consisting of a 3D WTI formed by weakly-coupled two-dimensional
(2D) topological layers separated by trivial spacers, we find that 2D stacking
faults can carry their own, topologically nontrivial gapless states. Depending
on the WTI properties, as well as the way in which the stacking fault is
realized, the latter can form a topologically protected 2D semimetal, but also
a 2D topological insulator which is embedded in the higher-dimensional WTI
bulk. This suggests the possibility of using stacking faults in real materials
as a source of topologically nontrivial, symmetry-protected conducting states.

scenarios, rain and haze, two often co-occurring common weather phenomena, can
greatly degrade the clarity and quality of the scene images, leading to a
performance drop in the visual applications, such as autonomous driving.
However, jointly removing the rain and haze in scene images is ill-posed and
challenging, where the existence of haze and rain and the change of atmosphere
light, can both degrade the scene information. Current methods focus on the
contamination removal part, thus ignoring the restoration of the scene
information affected by the change of atmospheric light. We propose a novel
deep neural network, named Asymmetric Dual-decoder U-Net (ADU-Net), to address
the aforementioned challenge. The ADU-Net produces both the contamination
residual and the scene residual to efficiently remove the rain and haze while
preserving the fidelity of the scene information. Extensive experiments show
our work outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable

activity detection for grant-free (GF) uplink transmission in wireless
communication networks. In particular, we consider mobile devices located in an
area where the direct link to an access point (AP) is blocked. Thus, the
devices try to connect to the AP via a reflected link provided by an RIS.
Therefore, a RIS phase-shift design is desired that covers the entire blocked
area with a wide reflection beam because the exact locations and times of
activity of the devices are unknown in GF transmission. In order to study the
impact of the phase-shift design on the device activity detection, we derive a
generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based detector and present an
analytical expression for the probability of detection. Assuming knowledge of
statistical CSI, we formulate an optimization problem for the phase-shift
design for maximization of the guaranteed probability of detection for all
locations within a given coverage area. To tackle the non-convexity of the
problem, we propose two different approximations of the objective function. The
first approximation leads to a design that aims to reduce the variations of the
end-to-end channel while taking system parameters such as transmit power, noise
power, and probability of false alarm into account. The second approximation
can be adopted for versatile RIS deployments because it only depends on the
line-of-sight component of the end-to-end channel and is not affected by system
parameters. For comparison, we also consider a phase-shift design maximizing
the average channel gain and a baseline analytical phase-shift design for large
blocked areas. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed
approximations result in phase-shift designs that guarantee high probability of
detection across the coverage area and outperform the baseline designs.

operations is that they are probabilistic in nature. In this article, we study
the trade-off between teleportation fidelity and success probability for
optimal performance of the teleportation protocol, which to the best of our
knowledge, has never been studied before. To this end, we first derive a
unified expression for the Wigner characteristic function describing three
non-Gaussian states, photon subtracted, photon added, and photon catalyzed
two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We then utilize it to obtain the fidelity of
teleportation for input coherent and squeezed vacuum states using the
aforementioned non-Gaussian resource states. We optimize the product of the
relative enhancement in fidelity and the probability of state preparation by
tuning the transmissivity of the beam splitters involved in implementing
non-Gaussian operations. This leads to a scenario that can be effectively
implemented in a lab to enhance fidelity. It turns out that among all the
considered non-Gaussian resource states, the symmetric one-photon subtracted
TMSV state is the most advantageous. We provide the associated optimal
squeezing and beam splitter transmissivity values for the considered
non-Gaussian resource states, which will be of significant interest to the
experimental community. We also consider the effect of imperfect photon
detectors on teleportation fidelity. Further, we expect the derived Wigner
characteristic function to be useful in state characterization and other
quantum information processing protocols.

algorithms achieve tight gap-dependent regret bounds of $O(\sum_{i: \Delta_i>0}

horizon $T$. As Audibert et al. [2007] have shown, however, that the
performance can be improved in stochastic environments with low-variance arms.
In fact, they have provided a stochastic MAB algorithm with
gap-variance-dependent regret bounds of $O(\sum_{i: \Delta_i>0}
(\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i} + 1) \log T )$ for loss variance $\sigma_i^2$ of
arm $i$. In this paper, we propose the first BOBW algorithm with
gap-variance-dependent bounds, showing that the variance information can be
used even in the possibly adversarial environment. Further, the leading
constant factor in our gap-variance dependent bound is only (almost) twice the
value for the lower bound. Additionally, the proposed algorithm enjoys multiple
data-dependent regret bounds in adversarial settings and works well in
stochastic settings with adversarial corruptions. The proposed algorithm is
based on the follow-the-regularized-leader method and employs adaptive learning
rates that depend on the empirical prediction error of the loss, which leads to
gap-variance-dependent regret bounds reflecting the variance of the arms.

learn on a sequential data stream from multiple sites rather than a

during the continual learning process, existing methods are usually restricted
in either network memorizability on previous sites or generalizability on
unseen sites. This paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of Synchronous
Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG) and to simultaneously improve
performance on both previous and unseen sites, with a novel proposed
SMG-learning framework. First, we propose a Synchronous Gradient Alignment
(SGA) objective, which not only promotes the network memorizability by
enforcing coordinated optimization for a small exemplar set from previous sites
(called replay buffer), but also enhances the generalizability by facilitating
site-invariance under simulated domain shift. Second, to simplify the
optimization of SGA objective, we design a Dual-Meta algorithm that
approximates the SGA objective as dual meta-objectives for optimization without
expensive computation overhead. Third, for efficient rehearsal, we configure
the replay buffer comprehensively considering additional inter-site diversity
to reduce redundancy. Experiments on prostate MRI data sequentially acquired
from six institutes demonstrate that our method can simultaneously achieve
higher memorizability and generalizability over state-of-the-art methods. Code

exchanged between systems. As the number of devices, systems and data produced
grows up, the risk of security breaches increases. This is all the more
relevant in times of COVID-19, which has affected not only the health and lives
of human beings' but also the lifestyle of society, i.e., the digital
environment has replaced the physical. This has led to an increase in cyber
security threats of various nature. While security breaches and different
security protection mechanisms have been widely covered in the literature, the
concept of a primitive artifact such as data management system seems to have
been more neglected by researchers and practitioners. But are data management
systems always protected by default? Previous research and regular updates on
data leakages suggest that the number and nature of these vulnerabilities are
high. It also refers to little or no DBMS protection, especially in case of
NoSQL, which are thus vulnerable to attacks. The aim of this paper is to
examine whether traditional vulnerability registries provide a sufficiently
comprehensive view of DBMS security, or they should be intensively and
dynamically inspected by DBMS owners by referring to Internet of Things Search
Engines moving towards a sustainable and resilient digitized environment. The
paper brings attention to this problem and makes the reader think about data
security before looking for and introducing more advanced security and
protection mechanisms, which, in the absence of the above, may bring no value.

to numerically solve real world viscous flow problems (computational fluid
dynamics (CFD)). However, despite the rapid advancements in the performance of
central processing units (CPUs), the computational cost of simulating transient
flows with extremely small time/grid scale physics is still unrealistic. In
recent years, machine learning (ML) technology has received significant
attention across industries, and this big wave has propagated various interests
in the fluid dynamics community. Recent ML CFD studies have revealed that
completely suppressing the increase in error with the increase in interval
between the training and prediction times in data driven methods is
unrealistic. The development of a practical CFD acceleration methodology that
applies ML is a remaining issue. Therefore, the objectives of this study were
developing a realistic ML strategy based on a physics-informed transfer
learning and validating the accuracy and acceleration performance of this
strategy using an unsteady CFD dataset. This strategy can determine the timing
of transfer learning while monitoring the residuals of the governing equations
in a cross coupling computation framework. Consequently, our hypothesis that
continuous fluid flow time series prediction is feasible was validated, as the
intermediate CFD simulations periodically not only reduce the increased
residuals but also update the network parameters. Notably, the cross coupling
strategy with a grid based network model does not compromise the simulation
accuracy for computational acceleration. The simulation was accelerated by 1.8
times in the laminar counterflow CFD dataset condition including the parameter
updating time. Open source CFD software OpenFOAM and open-source ML software
TensorFlow were used in this feasibility study.

consistent optimization directions among the clients, which inevitably leads to
performance reduction and unstable convergence. The core problems lie in that:
1) Domain-specific attributes, which are non-causal and only locally valid, are
indeliberately mixed into global aggregation. 2) The one-stage optimizations of
entangled attributes cannot simultaneously satisfy two conflicting objectives,
i.e., generalization and personalization. To cope with these, we proposed
disentangled federated learning (DFL) to disentangle the domain-specific and
cross-invariant attributes into two complementary branches, which are trained
by the proposed alternating local-global optimization independently.
Importantly, convergence analysis proves that the FL system can be stably
converged even if incomplete client models participate in the global
aggregation, which greatly expands the application scope of FL. Extensive
experiments verify that DFL facilitates FL with higher performance, better
interpretability, and faster convergence rate, compared with SOTA FL methods on
both manually synthesized and realistic attributes skew datasets.

solvency, notably the CARE-TDL model (integration of human and natural capital
alongside financial capital on the liabilities side of the balance sheet). In
an ecosystemic framework, this solvency of virtuous companies would compensate
in accounting terms for the lack of financial solvency. The State would then be
the guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by
Basel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of
financing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with
public guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green
investments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios
differentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank
balance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership. Facilitating
the financing of green companies would green capital but increase it, partly
neutralising the positive environmental impact. It is therefore necessary to
limit the credit expansion of ''brown'' companies. This would reduce risky
operations and favour less leveraged investments more connected to the real
economy, reducing systemic financial risk. -- The Agenda 2030 Policy Briefs

understanding of stellar interiors and stellar magnetism. Recently, fully
compressible hydrodynamical simulations of full-star models have demonstrated
the feasibility of studying the excitation and propagation of pressure and
internal gravity waves in stellar interiors, which would allow for a direct
comparison with asteroseismological measurements. However, the impact of
magnetic fields on such waves has not been taken into account yet in
three-dimensional simulations. We conduct a proof of concept for the
realization of three-dimensional, fully compressible, magneto-hydrodynamical
numerical simulations of stellar interiors with the RAMSES code. We adapted the
RAMSES code to deal with highly subsonic turbulence, typical of stellar
convection, by implementing a well-balanced scheme in the numerical solver. We
then ran and analyzed three-dimensional hydrodynamical and
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with different resolutions of a
plane-parallel convective envelope on a Cartesian grid. Both hydrodynamical and
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations develop a quasi-steady, turbulent convection
layer from random density perturbations introduced over the initial profiles.
The convective flows are characterized by small-amplitude fluctuations around
the hydrodynamical equilibrium of the stellar interior, which is preserved over
the whole simulation time. Using our compressible well-balanced scheme, we were
able to model flows with Mach numbers as low as $\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{-3}$, but
even lower Mach number flows are possible in principle. In the
magneto-hydrodynamical runs, we observe an exponential growth of magnetic
energy consistent with the action of a small-scale dynamo. (Abridged)

we introduce reXcor, a new AGN X-ray ($0.3$-$100$ keV) spectral fitting model
that self-consistently combines the effects of both ionized relativistic

energy liberated in the inner disc is distributed between a warm corona, a
lamppost X-ray source, and the accretion disc. The emission and ionized
reflection spectrum from the inner $400$ $r_g$ of the disc is computed,
incorporating the effects of relativistic light-bending and blurring. The
resulting spectra predict a variety of soft excess shapes and sizes that depend
on the fraction of energy dissipated in the warm corona and lamppost. We
illustrate the use of reXcor by fitting to the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR
observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxies HE 1143-1820 and NGC 4593, and find that
both objects require a warm corona contribution to the soft excess. Eight

many hand-designed components in object detection but introduces a decoder

issues, we propose a novel decoder-free fully transformer-based (DFFT) object
detector, achieving high efficiency in both training and inference stages, for
the first time. We simplify objection detection into an encoder-only

  Power Flexibility","11 pages, 14 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have witnessed a
rapid growth. However, effective management of charging stations is challenging
due to individual EV owners' privacy concerns, competing interests of different
stations, and the coupling distribution network constraints. To cope with this
challenge, this paper proposes a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, the
aggregate EV power flexibility region is derived by solving an optimization
problem. We prove that any trajectory within the obtained region corresponds to
at least one feasible EV dispatch strategy. By submitting this flexibility
region instead of the detailed EV data to the charging station operator, EV
owners' privacy can be preserved and the computational burden can be reduced.
In the second stage, a distributed coordination mechanism with a clear physical
interpretation is developed with consideration of AC power flow constraints. We
prove that the proposed mechanism is guaranteed to converge to the centralized
optimum. Case studies validate the theoretical results. Comprehensive
performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed scheme.

play an important role in the perception of increasingly autonomous systems.
Due to the merely implicit definition of their behavior mainly based on the
data used for training, DDM outputs are subject to uncertainty. This poses a
challenge with respect to the realization of safety-critical perception tasks
by means of DDMs. A promising approach to tackling this challenge is to
estimate the uncertainty in the current situation during operation and adapt
the system behavior accordingly. In previous work, we focused on runtime
estimation of uncertainty and discussed approaches for handling uncertainty
estimations. In this paper, we present additional architectural patterns for
handling uncertainty. Furthermore, we evaluate the four patterns qualitatively
and quantitatively with respect to safety and performance gains. For the
quantitative evaluation, we consider a distance controller for vehicle
platooning where performance gains are measured by considering how much the
distance can be reduced in different operational situations. We conclude that
the consideration of context information of the driving situation makes it
possible to accept more or less uncertainty depending on the inherent risk of
the situation, which results in performance gains.

wrapping around the foreign particle. The deformability of the membrane itself

underneath the membrane. It has been shown that size, shape, and orientation of
the particles influence on their entry into the cell. Here, we study the role
of particle local curvature in the cellular uptake by investigating the
wrapping of an elastic membrane around a long cylindrical object with an
elliptical cross section. The membrane itself is adhered to a substrate
mimicking the cytoskeleton. Membrane wrapping proceeds differently whether the
initial contact occurs at the particle's highly curved tip (prolate) or along
its long side (oblate). We obtain a wrapping phase diagram as a function of the
membrane-cytoskeleton and the membrane-target adhesion energy, which includes
three distinct regimes of engulfment(unwrapped, partially wrapped, and fully

expressions for the boundary between the different regimes which confirm that

of the essential basic quality controls of CMR images is to investigate the

assessment. This study examines the full cardiac coverage using a 3D
convolutional model and then reduces the number of false predictions using an
innovative salient region detection model. Salient regions are extracted from
the short-axis cine CMR stacks using a three-step proposed algorithm. Combining
the 3D CNN baseline model with the proposed salient region detection model
provides a cascade detector that can reduce the number of false negatives of
the baseline model. The results obtained on the images of over 6,200
participants of the UK Biobank population cohort study show the superiority of
the proposed model over the previous state-of-the-art studies. The dataset is
the largest regarding the number of participants to control the cardiac
coverage. The accuracy of the baseline model in identifying the
presence/absence of basal/apical slices is 96.25\% and 94.51\%, respectively,
which increases to 96.88\% and 95.72\% after improving using the proposed
salient region detection model. Using the salient region detection model by
forcing the baseline model to focus on the most informative areas of the images
can help the model correct misclassified samples' predictions. The proposed
fully automated model's performance indicates that this model can be used in
image quality control in population cohort datasets and also real-time

behavior of lattice materials via numerical simulations in two-dimensional beam

mechanically isotropic materials with high connectivity, and mechanically
anisotropic materials with intermediate connectivity. Introducing disorder
generates spatial fluctuations in the elasticity tensor at the local (joint)
scale. Proper coarse-graining reveals a well-defined continuum-level scale
elasticity tensor. Increasing disorder aids in making initially anisotropic
materials more isotropic. The disorder impact on the material stiffness depends
on the lattice connectivity: Increasing the disorder softens lattices with high
connectivity and stiffens those with low connectivity, without modifying the
scaling between elastic modulus and density (linear scaling for high
connectivity and cubic scaling for low connectivity). Introducing disorder in
lattices with intermediate fixed connectivity reveals both scaling: the linear
scaling occurs for low density, the cubic one at high density, and the
crossover density increases with disorder. Contrary to classical formulations,
this work demonstrates that connectivity is not the sole parameter governing
elastic modulus scaling. It offers a promising route to access novel mechanical
properties in lattice materials via disordering the architectures.

systems, yet current models fail to explain the transport of coarse-mode
particles (>5 $\mu$m) to great distances from their sources. For particles
larger than a few microns, electrostatic effects have been invoked to account
for longer-than-predicted atmospheric residence times. Although much effort has
focused on elucidating the charging processes, comparatively little effort has
been expended understanding the stability of charge on particles once
electrified. Overall, electrostatic-driven transport requires that charge
remain present on particles for days to weeks. Here, we present a set of
experiments designed to explore the longevity of electrostatic charge on
levitated airborne particles after a single charging event. Using an acoustic
levitator, we measured the charge on particles of different material
compositions suspended in atmospheric conditions for long periods of time. In
dry environments, the total charge on particles decayed in over 1 week. The
decay timescale decreased to days in humid environments. These results were
independent of particle material and charge polarity. However, exposure to UV
radiation could both increase or decrease the decay time depending on polarity.
Our work suggests that the rate of charge decay on airborne particles is solely
determined by ion capture from the air. Furthermore, using a one-dimensional
sedimentation model, we predict that atmospheric dust of order 10 $\mu$m will
experience the largest change in residence time due to electrostatic forces.

adversarial attack. Traveling along the gradient to the decision boundary is no
more an adversarial attack but becomes a counterfactual explanation, explicitly
transporting from one class to the other. Through extensive experiments on XAI
metrics, we find that the simple saliency map method, applied on such networks,
becomes a reliable explanation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art
explanation approaches on unconstrained models. The proposed networks were
already known to be certifiably robust, and we prove that they are also
explainable with a fast and simple method.

to study the interactions of dark matter (DM) with standard model particles.
After supernova (SN) explosions, DM with mass $m_\chi\lesssim\mathcal{O}({\rm
MeV})$ in the halo can be boosted by SN neutrinos (SN$\nu$) to relativistic
speed. The SN$\nu$ boosted DM (BDM) arrives on Earth with TOF which depends
only on $m_\chi$ and is independent of the cross section. These BDMs can
interact with detector targets in low-background experiments and manifest as
afterglow events after the arrival of SN$\nu$. The characteristic TOF spectra
of the BDM events can lead to large background suppression and unique
determination of $m_\chi$. New cross section constraints on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi
e} \sigma_{\chi\nu}}$ are derived from SN1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud
with data from the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments. Potential
sensitivities for the next galactic SN with Hyper-Kamiokande are projected.
This analysis extends the existing bounds on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi e}\sigma_{\chi
\nu}}$ over a broad range of $r_\chi=\sigma_{\chi \nu}/\sigma_{\chi e}$. In
particular, the improvement is by 1-3 orders of magnitude for
$m_\chi<\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm keV})$ for $\sigma_{\chi e}\sim\sigma_{\chi
\nu}$. Prospects of exploiting TOF information in other astrophysical systems
to probe exotic physics with other DM candidates are discussed.

effectively modulated or even turned into optomechanically induced

proton therapy though clinical evidence of varying RBE was raised. Clinical
studies on RBE variability have been conducted for decades for carbon
radiation, which could advance the understanding of the clinical proton RBE
given an ion-independent RBE model. In this work, such a model, linear and
simple, using the beam quantity Q = Z^2/E (Z = ion charge, E = kinetic energy
per nucleon) was tested and compared to the commonly used, proton-specific and
linear energy transfer (LET) based Wedenberg RBE model. Material and methods:
The Wedenberg and Q models, both predicting RBEmax and RBEmin (i.e., RBE at
vanishing and very high dose, respectively), are compared in terms of
ion-dependence and prediction power. An experimental in-vitro data ensemble
covering 115 publications for various ions was used as dataset. Results: The
model parameter of the Q model was observed to be similar for different ions
(in contrast to LET). The Q model was trained without any prior knowledge of
proton data. For proton RBE, the differences between experimental data and
corresponding predictions of the Wedenberg or the Q model were highly
comparable. Conclusions: A simple linear RBE model using Q instead of LET was
proposed and tested to be able to predict proton RBE using model parameter
trained based on only RBE data of other particles in a clinical proton energy
range for a large in-vitro dataset. Adding (pre)clinical knowledge from carbon
ion therapy may, therefore, reduce the dominating biological uncertainty in
proton RBE modelling. This would translate in reduced RBE related uncertainty
in proton therapy treatment planning.

(\#10,310,842). Similarly, we did the same exercise for OA publications in

period 2010-2020. The results showed that there is no OACA for publications in
fully OA journals, and that there is rather a disadvantage. Conversely, the
OACA seems to be a reality in hybrid journals, suggesting that a better
accessibility in this context tends to improve the visibility of publications.
The lack of OACA for publications in fully OA journals is to be expected, as a
great proportion of OA journals are newly created and less attractive to
high-impact senior researchers.Another striking result of this paper is the
fall of the OACA from 2016. The citation advantage fell from 70% to 9% between
2016 and 2020 (for publications in hybrid journals). We wonder if this fall is
linked to the increase in the notoriety of pirate sites (eg Sci-Hub) from 2016.
In other words, the democratization of pirate sites instantly cancels the
positive effect of OA publication insofar as the question of access to

in numerical simulations of quantum algorithms for benchmarking purposes, are a
good representation of larger instances in terms of hardness. We approach this
through a numerical analysis of the hardness of MAX 2-SAT problem instances for
various continuous-time quantum algorithms and a comparable classical
algorithm. Our results can be used to predict the viability of hybrid
approaches that combine multiple algorithms in parallel to take advantage of
the variation in the hardness of instances between the algorithms. We find
that, while there are correlations in instance hardness between all of the
algorithms considered, they appear weak enough that a hybrid strategy would
likely be desirable in practice. Our results also show a widening range of
hardness of randomly generated instances as the problem size is increased,
which demonstrates both the difference in the distribution of hardness at small
sizes and the value of a hybrid approach that can reduce the number of
extremely hard instances. We identify specific weaknesses that can be overcome
with hybrid techniques, such as the inability of these quantum algorithms to
efficiently solve satisfiable instances (which is easy classically).

emerging secure routing backbones and extend their security properties to the

  We design and deploy an architecture to bootstrap secure routing. Our key
insight is to abstract the secure routing backbone as a virtual Autonomous
System (AS), called Secure Backbone AS (SBAS). While SBAS appears as one AS to
the Internet, it is a federated network where routes are exchanged between
participants using a secure backbone. SBAS makes BGP announcements for its
customers' IP prefixes at multiple locations (referred to as Points of Presence
or PoPs) allowing traffic from non-participating hosts to be routed to a nearby
SBAS PoP (where it is then routed over the secure backbone to the true prefix
owner). In this manner, we are the first to integrate a federated secure
non-BGP routing backbone with the BGP-speaking Internet.
  We present a real-world deployment of our architecture that uses SCIONLab to
emulate the secure backbone and the PEERING framework to make BGP announcements
to the Internet. A combination of real-world attacks and Internet-scale
simulations shows that SBAS substantially reduces the threat of routing
attacks. Finally, we survey network operators to better understand optimal
governance and incentive models.

substitution or intercalation is necessary for the introduction of charge
carriers, and its influence on the electronic state is at the heart of a great
debate in physics. Here based on the microscopic octet scattering model, the
influence of the impurity scattering on the electronic structure of cuprate
superconductors is investigated in terms of the self-consistent T-matrix
approach. The impurity scattering self-energy is evaluated firstly in the
Fermi-arc-tip approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering
processes, and the obtained results show that the decisive role played by the
impurity scattering self-energy in the particle-hole channel is the further
renormalization of the quasiparticle band structure with a reduced
quasiparticle lifetime, while the impurity scattering self-energy in the
particle-particle channel induces a strong deviation from the d-wave behaviour
of the superconducting gap, leading to the existence of a finite gap over the
entire electron Fermi surface. Moreover, these impurity scattering
self-energies are employed to study the exotic features of the line-shape in
the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and the autocorrelation of the
quasiparticle excitation spectra, and the obtained results are then compared
with the corresponding experimental data. The theory therefore also indicates
that the unconventional features of the electronic structure in cuprate
superconductors is generated by both the strong electron correlation and
impurity scattering.

their perspective, rigor is neither opposed to intuition nor understood as a
unitary phenomenon - Enriques distinguishes between small-scale rigor and
large-scale rigor and Severi between formal rigor and substantial rigor.
Finally, we turn to the notion of mathematical objectivity. We draw from our
case study in order to advance a multi-dimensional analysis of objectivity.
Specifically, we suggest that various types of rigor may be associated with
different conceptions of objectivity: namely objectivity as faithfulness to
facts and objectivity as intersubjectivity.

Furthermore, we craft two benchmarks named PandasEval and NumpyEval to evaluate
library-oriented code generation. Experimental results demonstrate the

new setup, we develop a new KIE model named Region-based Document Understanding

representations. Then, a list of candidate regions is generated from the
representations via a Region Proposal Module inspired by computer vision models
widely applied for object detection. Finally, a Region Categorization Module

valid and select the one with the largest probability from all proposed regions

  conditions",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of finding surrogate models for
large-scale second-order linear time-invariant systems with inhomogeneous
initial conditions. For this class of systems, the superposition principle
allows us to decompose the system behavior into three independent components.
The first behavior corresponds to the transfer between the input and output
having zero initial conditions. In contrast, the other two correspond to the
transfer between the initial position and the initial velocity conditions
having zero input, respectively. Based on this superposition of systems, our
goal is to propose model reduction schemes allowing to preserve the
second-order structure in the surrogate models. To this aim, we introduce
tailored second-order Gramians for each system component and compute them
numerically, solving Lyapunov equations. As a consequence, two methodologies
are proposed. The first one consists in reducing each of the components
independently using a suitable balanced truncation procedure. The sum of these
reduced systems provides an approximation of the original system. This
methodology allows flexibility on the order of the reduced-order model. The
second proposed methodology consists in extracting the dominant subspaces from
the sum of Gramians to build the projection matrices leading to a surrogate
model. Additionally, we discuss error bounds for the overall output
approximation. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated by means of
benchmark problems.

successfully restores the formants of the speeches distorted by transmission

service quality and operation of transit systems; for example, it can help
passengers make better decisions on departure time, route choice, and even
transport mode choice and also support transit operators to make informed
decisions on tasks such as crew/vehicle scheduling and timetabling. However,
most existing approaches in bus travel time forecasting are based on
deterministic models that provide only point estimation. To this end, we
develop in this paper a Bayesian probabilistic forecasting model for bus travel
time. To characterize the strong dependencies/interactions between consecutive
buses, we concatenate the link travel time vectors and the headway vector from
a pair of two adjacent buses as a new augmented variable and model it with a
constrained Multivariate Gaussian mixture distributions. This approach can
naturally capture the interactions between adjacent buses (e.g., correlated
speed and smooth variation of headway), handle missing values in data, and
depict the multimodality in bus travel time distributions. Next, we assume
different periods in a day share the same set of Gaussian components but
different mixing coefficients to characterize the systematic temporal
variations in bus operation. For model inference, we develop an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm to obtain the posterior
distributions of model parameters and make probabilistic forecasting. We test
the proposed model using the data from a twenty-link bus route in Guangzhou,
China. Results show our approach significantly outperforms baseline models that
overlook bus-to-bus interactions in terms of both predictive means and
distributions. Besides forecasting, the parameters of the proposed model
contain rich information for understanding/improving the bus service.

the primary star at a rate that cannot be accommodated by its secondary
companion. A common envelope forms which is subsequently ejected resulting in a
system with a binary period frequently between 2 and 3 hours. Where
circumbinary companions are predicted, it remains unclear whether they form
before or after the common envelope ejection. From observations of eclipse time
variations (ETVs), exoplanet databases e.g. NASA Exoplanet Archive, list
typically a dozen systems with confirmed circumbinary planets. Here we examine
seven of these systems, discuss other possible causes and consider whether, for
these dynamic systems, the ETV methodology is a reliable indicator of planetary
companions. The systems selected were those where we could determine precise
eclipse timings, free from significant extraneous effects such as pulsations,
and present 163 new times of minima permitting us to test existing models. Over
thirty circumbinary models have been proposed for these seven systems and note
all, other than the latest model for NY Vir which remains to be fully tested,
fail within a year to accurately predict eclipse times. In examining
alternative mechanisms we find that magnetic effects could contribute
significantly in two of the seven systems studied. We conclude that the
structure of these dynamic systems, with the extreme temperature differences
and small binary separations, are not fully understood and that many factors
may contribute to the observed ETVs.

small target detection is one of the most difficult problems in the field of
computer vision. In most existing studies, semantic segmentation methods are
typically used to achieve better results. The centroid of each target is
calculated from the segmentation map as the detection result. In contrast, we
propose a novel end-to-end framework for infrared small target detection and
segmentation in this paper. First, with the use of UNet as the backbone to
maintain resolution and semantic information, our model can achieve a higher
detection accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods by attaching a simple
anchor-free head. Then, a pyramid pool module is used to further extract
features and improve the precision of target segmentation. Next, we use
semantic segmentation tasks that pay more attention to pixel-level features to
assist in the training process of object detection, which increases the average
precision and allows the model to detect some targets that were previously not
detectable. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task framework for infrared small
target detection and segmentation. Our multi-task learning model reduces
complexity by nearly half and speeds up inference by nearly twice compared to
the composite single-task model, while maintaining accuracy. The code and
models are publicly available at https://github.com/Chenastron/MTUNet.

empirical relation between color and luminosity ($\beta$) and do not account
for varying host-galaxy dust properties. However, from studies of dust in large
samples of galaxies, it is known that dust attenuation can vary significantly.
Here we take advantage of state-of-the-art modeling of galaxy properties to
characterize dust parameters (dust attenuation $A_V$, and a parameter
describing the dust law slope $R_V$) for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SN Ia
host galaxies using the publicly available \texttt{BAGPIPES} code. Utilizing
optical and infrared data of the hosts alone, we find three key aspects of host
dust that impact SN Ia cosmology: 1) there exists a large range ($\sim1-6$) of
host $R_V$ 2) high stellar mass hosts have $R_V$ on average $\sim0.7$ lower
than that of low-mass hosts 3) there is a significant ($>3\sigma$) correlation
between the Hubble diagram residuals of red SNe Ia that when corrected for
reduces scatter by $\sim13\%$ and the significance of the ``mass step'' to
$\sim1\sigma$. These represent independent confirmations of recent predictions
based on dust that attempted to explain the puzzling ``mass step'' and
intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) in SN Ia analyses. We also find that
red-sequence galaxies have both lower and more peaked dust law slope
distributions on average in comparison to non red-sequence galaxies. We find
that the SN Ia $\beta$ and $\sigma_{\rm int}$ both differ by $>3\sigma$ when
determined separately for red-sequence galaxy and all other galaxy hosts. The
agreement between fitted host-$R_V$ and SN Ia $\beta$ \& $\sigma_{\rm int}$
suggests that host dust properties play a major role in SN Ia color-luminosity
standardization and supports the claim that SN Ia intrinsic scatter is driven
by $R_V$ variation.

architectures relies on a training procedure that needs to be carefully crafted
to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients, particularly as the depth $L$
increases. No consensus has been reached on how to mitigate this issue,
although a widely discussed strategy consists in scaling the output of each
layer by a factor $\alpha_L$. We show in a probabilistic setting that with
standard i.i.d. initializations, the only non-trivial dynamics is for $\alpha_L
= 1/\sqrt{L}$ (other choices lead either to explosion or to identity mapping).
This scaling factor corresponds in the continuous-time limit to a neural
stochastic differential equation, contrarily to a widespread interpretation
that deep ResNets are discretizations of neural ordinary differential
equations. By contrast, in the latter regime, stability is obtained with
specific correlated initializations and $\alpha_L = 1/L$. Our analysis suggests
a strong interplay between scaling and regularity of the weights as a function
of the layer index. Finally, in a series of experiments, we exhibit a
continuous range of regimes driven by these two parameters, which jointly
impact performance before and after training.

Nevertheless, the assumption may not always hold especially for the regions

attention block, namely Stand-alone Inter-Frame Attention (SIFA), that novelly
delves into the deformation across frames to estimate local self-attention on
each spatial location. Technically, SIFA remoulds the deformable design via
re-scaling the offset predictions by the difference between two frames. Taking
each spatial location in the current frame as the query, the locally deformable
neighbors in the next frame are regarded as the keys/values. Then, SIFA
measures the similarity between query and keys as stand-alone attention to
weighted average the values for temporal aggregation. We further plug SIFA

classification. The major drawback is the lack of standardized solutions for
classification and high-level visualization. In this study, a sentiment
analyzer dashboard for online social networking analysis is proposed. This, to
enable people gaining insights in topics interesting to them. The tool allows
users to run the desired sentiment analysis algorithm in the dashboard. In

bounded uncertainty of the channel state information (CSI) and the total power
constraint, and jointly optimize the transceiver (Tx-Rx) and the RIS phase
design from the perspective of worst-case robustness by minimizing the mean
squared error (MSE) of the computation. To solve this intractable nonconvex
problem, we develop an efficient alternating algorithm where both solutions to
the robust sub-problem and to the joint design of Tx-Rx and RIS are obtained in

manually, requiring experience and great skill, while being time-consuming and
prone to error. Thus machine learning algorithms have been widely adopted
because of their ability to perform complex data analysis. Features derived
from the points of interest in ECG - mainly Q, R, and S, are widely used for
arrhythmia detection. In this work, we demonstrate improved performance for ECG
classification using hybrid features and three different models, building on a

An RR interval features based model proposed in this work achieved an accuracy
of 98.98%, which is an improvement over the baseline model. To make the model
immune to noise, we updated the model using frequency features and achieved
good sustained performance in presence of noise with a slightly lower accuracy
of 98.69%. Further, another model combining the frequency features and the RR
interval features was developed, which achieved a high accuracy of 99% with
good sustained performance in noisy environments. Due to its high accuracy and
noise immunity, the proposed model which combines multiple hybrid features, is
well suited for ambulatory wearable sensing applications.

crucial, as they help enhance the machining quality by offering comprehension
of the inter-relationships between the laser processing parameters. On the
other hand, experimental processing parameter optimization recommends a
systematic, and consequently time-consuming, investigation over the available
processing parameter space. An intelligent strategy is to employ machine
learning (ML) techniques to capture the relationship between picosecond laser
machining parameters for finding proper parameter combinations to create the
desired cuts on industrial-grade alumina ceramic with deep, smooth and
defect-free patterns. Laser parameters such as beam amplitude and frequency,
scanner passing speed and the number of passes over the surface, as well as the
vertical distance of the scanner from the sample surface, are used for
predicting the depth, top width, and bottom width of the engraved channels

is shown that Neural Networks (NN) are the most efficient in predicting the
outputs. Equipped with an ML model that captures the interconnection between
laser parameters and the engraved channel dimensions, one can predict the

clouds must be almost everywhere in the surface of the object. In this article,
with a main purpose to build the point clouds covering the entire surface of

Based on the new geo-feature, if there are several (given) initial world points
on the object's surface along with all accurately estimated projection
matrices, some new world points on the geodesics connecting any two of these

velocity model. In this search problem, there is an oracle who knows the
instantaneous location of the target at any time. Our task is to query the
oracle as few times as possible to accurately estimate the location of the
target at any specified time. We first study the case where the oracle's answer
to each query is corrupted by discrete noise and then generalize our results to
the case of additive white Gaussian noise. In our formulation, the performance
criterion is the resolution, which is defined as the maximal $L_\infty$
distance between the true locations and estimated locations. We characterize
the minimal resolution of an optimal non-adaptive query procedure with a finite
number of queries by deriving non-asymptotic and asymptotic bounds. Our bounds
are tight in the first-order asymptotic sense when the number of queries
satisfies a certain condition and our bounds are tight in the stronger
second-order asymptotic sense when the target moves with a constant velocity.
To prove our results, we relate the current problem to channel coding, borrow
ideas from finite blocklength information theory and construct bounds on the
number of possible quantized target trajectories.

  typos",,,,"q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A central question in computational neuroscience is how structure determines
function in neural networks. The emerging high-quality large-scale connectomic
datasets raise the question of what general functional principles can be
gleaned from structural information such as the distribution of
excitatory/inhibitory synapse types and the distribution of synaptic weights.
Motivated by this question, we developed a statistical mechanical theory of
learning in neural networks that incorporates structural information as
constraints. We derived an analytical solution for the memory capacity of the
perceptron, a basic feedforward model of supervised learning, with constraint
on the distribution of its weights. Our theory predicts that the reduction in
capacity due to the constrained weight-distribution is related to the
Wasserstein distance between the imposed distribution and that of the standard
normal distribution. To test the theoretical predictions, we use optimal
transport theory and information geometry to develop an SGD-based algorithm to
find weights that simultaneously learn the input-output task and satisfy the
distribution constraint. We show that training in our algorithm can be
interpreted as geodesic flows in the Wasserstein space of probability
distributions. We further developed a statistical mechanical theory for
teacher-student perceptron rule learning and ask for the best way for the
student to incorporate prior knowledge of the rule. Our theory shows that it is
beneficial for the learner to adopt different prior weight distributions during
learning, and shows that distribution-constrained learning outperforms
unconstrained and sign-constrained learning. Our theory and algorithm provide
novel strategies for incorporating prior knowledge about weights into learning,
and reveal a powerful connection between structure and function in neural
networks.

  direction and speed using ocean data","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural networks are increasingly being used in a variety of settings to
predict wind direction and speed, two of the most important factors for
estimating the potential power output of a wind farm. However, these
predictions are arguably of limited value because classical neural networks
lack the ability to express uncertainty. Here we instead consider the use of
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), for which the weights, biases and outputs are
distributions rather than deterministic point values. This allows for the
evaluation of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and leads to
well-calibrated uncertainty predictions of both wind speed and power. Here we
consider the application of BNNs to the problem of offshore wind resource
prediction for renewable energy applications. For our dataset, we use
observations recorded at the FINO1 research platform in the North Sea and our
predictors are ocean data such as water temperature and current direction.
  The probabilistic forecast predicted by the BNN adds considerable value to
the results and, in particular, informs the user of the network's ability to
make predictions of out-of-sample datapoints. We use this property of BNNs to
conclude that the accuracy and uncertainty of the wind speed and direction
predictions made by our network are unaffected by the construction of the
nearby Alpha Ventus wind farm. Hence, at this site, networks trained on
pre-farm ocean data can be used to accurately predict wind field information
from ocean data after the wind farm has been constructed.

highly responsive to changes in external pressure. Owing to their efficient
opto-acousto-mechanical coupling, thermal-displacement-noise limited
sensitivity is achieved at low optical interrogation powers and for modest
optical (Q ~ 10^3) and mechanical (Q ~ 10^2) quality factors. We predict and
verify broadband (up to ~ 5 MHz), air-coupled ultrasound detection with
noise-equivalent pressure (NEP) as low as ~ 30-100 $\mu$Pa/Hz^1/2. This
corresponds to an ultrasonic force sensitivity ~ 2 x 10^-13 N/Hz^1/2 and
enables the detection of MHz-range signals propagated over distances as large
as ~ 20 cm in air. In water, thermal-noise-limited sensitivity is demonstrated
over a wide frequency range (up to ~ 30 MHz), with NEP as low as ~ 100-800
$\mu$Pa/Hz^1/2. These cavities exhibit a nearly omnidirectional response, while
being ~ 3-4 orders of magnitude more sensitive than piezoelectric devices of
similar size. Easily realized as large arrays and naturally suited to direct
coupling by free-space beams or optical fibers, they offer significant
practical advantages over competing optical devices, and thus could be of
interest for several emerging applications in medical and industrial ultrasound
imaging.

  Multi-label Few-shot Aspect Category Detection","Accepted to KDD 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-label aspect category detection allows a given review sentence to
contain multiple aspect categories, which is shown to be more practical in
sentiment analysis and attracting increasing attention. As annotating large
amounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs
frequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect
category detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and
few methods are available. In this paper, we propose a novel label-enhanced
prototypical network (LPN) for multi-label few-shot aspect category detection.
The highlights of LPN can be summarized as follows. First, it leverages label
description as auxiliary knowledge to learn more discriminative prototypes,
which can retain aspect-relevant information while eliminating the harmful
effect caused by irrelevant aspects. Second, it integrates with contrastive
learning, which encourages that the sentences with the same aspect label are
pulled together in embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart the
sentences with different aspect labels. In addition, it introduces an adaptive
multi-label inference module to predict the aspect count in the sentence, which
is simple yet effective. Extensive experimental results on three datasets
demonstrate that our proposed model LPN can consistently achieve
state-of-the-art performance.
