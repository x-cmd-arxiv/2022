We further incorporate an efficient ensemble mechanism, namely batch-ensemble,
to construct the batch-ensemble stochastic neural networks (BE-SNNs) and
overcome the feature collapse problem. We compare the performance of the
proposed BE-SNNs with the other state-of-the-art approaches and show that
BE-SNNs yield superior performance on several OOD benchmarks, such as the
Two-Moons dataset, the FashionMNIST vs MNIST dataset, FashionMNIST vs NotMNIST

  We recently showed that proton treatments with the patient in an upright

imaging which enables multiple possible patient orientations during a
treatment. In this study, we evaluate if this new treatment geometry could
enable high quality treatment plans without a gantry. We created pencil beam
scanning (PBS) treatment plans for seven patients with head-and-neck or brain
tumors. Each patient was planned with two scenarios: one with a gantry with the
patient in supine position and the other with a gantry-less fixed horizontal
beam-line with the patient sitting upright. For the treatment plans,
dose-volume-histograms (DVHs), target homogeneity index (HI), mean dose, D_2
and D_98 are reported. A robustness analysis of one plan was performed with
+/-2.5 mm setup errors and +/-3.5% range uncertainties with nine scenarios.
  Most of the PBS-gantry-less plans had similar target HI and OAR mean dose as
compared to PBS-gantry plans, and similar robustness with respect to range
uncertainties and setup errors.
  Pencil beam scanning provides sufficient power to deliver high quality
treatment plans without requiring a gantry for head-and-neck or brain tumors.
In combination with the development of the new positioning and immobilization
methods required to support this treatment geometry, this work suggests the
feasibility of further development of a compact proton therapy system with a
fixed horizontal beam-line to treat patients in sitting and reclined positions.

Organic-Aqueous Systems (OAS). The nanoparticles synthesized in the presence of

synthesis can be developed using an Aqueous Two-Phase System (ATPS). These
systems are characterized by interfacial tensions, which are two orders of
magnitude lower than typical organic aqueous systems. In this work, flow
patterns and hydrodynamics of ATPS are investigated as a first step.
Polyethylene glycol -trisodium citrate system was chosen as ATPS. The objective
of this work is to see if any new physics arises in an ATPS system. The low
interfacial tension results in high Capillary numbers (Ca >> 3) in a
microfluidic system. Consequently, the flow observed here is parallel or
core-annular. However, in a millichannel, the capillary number becomes lower
(Ca << 1) for an ATPS system. In this work, experiments were carried out in a
millichannel to span different flow patterns. The pattern formation was
analyzed and classified into three categories, i.e., slug flow (interfacial
tension dominated), transition flow, and core annular flow (inertia dominated).
Flow regime maps based on the Reynolds number, Capillary number, and Weber
number of each phase were found to be qualitatively similar to those of OAS.
Simulations were performed for various interfacial tension values. An
interfacial tension value of 1.25x10-4 N/m was found to yield slug sizes which

various identification problems in the social sciences, nonlinear dynamic

non-common confounders, with respect to which the instruments are exogenous.

that activity temporal boundaries labelled for model training are determined

labelling precisely when an activity starts and ends over time. Such
uncertainties in temporal labelling are currently ignored in model training,

Elastic Moment Bounding (EMB) to accommodate flexible and adaptive activity
temporal boundaries towards modelling universally interpretable video-text

annotations. Specifically, we construct elastic boundaries adaptively by mining
and discovering frame-wise temporal endpoints that can maximise the alignment
between video segments and query sentences. To enable both more accurate
matching (segment content attention) and more robust localisation (segment
elastic boundaries), we optimise the selection of frame-wise endpoints subject
to segment-wise contents by a novel Guided Attention mechanism. Extensive
experiments on three video activity localisation benchmarks demonstrate
compellingly the EMB's advantages over existing methods without modelling

neural network (CNN) with its ability to capture global long-range dependencies
for visual representation learning. Besides ViT, contrastive learning is
another popular research topic recently. While previous contrastive learning
works are mostly based on CNNs, some recent studies have attempted to combine
ViT and contrastive learning for enhanced self-supervised learning. Despite the
considerable progress, these combinations of ViT and contrastive learning
mostly focus on the instance-level contrastiveness, which often overlook the
global contrastiveness and also lack the ability to directly learn the
clustering result (e.g., for images). In view of this, this paper presents a
novel deep clustering approach termed Vision Transformer for Contrastive
Clustering (VTCC), which for the first time, to our knowledge, unifies the
Transformer and the contrastive learning for the image clustering task.
Specifically, with two random augmentations performed on each image, we utilize
a ViT encoder with two weight-sharing views as the backbone. To remedy the
potential instability of the ViT, we incorporate a convolutional stem to split
each augmented sample into a sequence of patches, which uses multiple stacked
small convolutions instead of a big convolution in the patch projection layer.
By learning the feature representations for the sequences of patches via the
backbone, an instance projector and a cluster projector are further utilized to
perform the instance-level contrastive learning and the global clustering
structure learning, respectively. Experiments on eight image datasets
demonstrate the stability (during the training-from-scratch) and the
superiority (in clustering performance) of our VTCC approach over the
state-of-the-art.

set of metrics, tools, and techniques to predict which classes, methods, lines,
or commits are buggy. However, most existing work in this domain treats all
bugs the same, which is not the case in practice. The more severe the bugs the
higher their consequences. Therefore, it is important for a defect prediction
method to estimate the severity of the identified bugs, so that the higher
severity ones get immediate attention. In this paper, we provide a quantitative
and qualitative study on two popular datasets (Defects4J and Bugs.jar), using
10 common source code metrics, and also two popular static analysis tools
(SpotBugs and Infer) for analyzing their capability in predicting defects and
their severity. We studied 3,358 buggy methods with different severity labels
from 19 Java open-source projects. Results show that although code metrics are
powerful in predicting the buggy code (Lines of the Code, Maintainable Index,
FanOut, and Effort metrics are the best), they cannot estimate the severity
level of the bugs. In addition, we observed that static analysis tools have
weak performance in both predicting bugs (F1 score range of 3.1%-7.1%) and
their severity label (F1 score under 2%). We also manually studied the
characteristics of the severe bugs to identify possible reasons behind the weak
performance of code metrics and static analysis tools in estimating the
severity. Also, our categorization shows that Security bugs have high severity
in most cases while Edge/Boundary faults have low severity. Finally, we show
that code metrics and static analysis methods can be complementary in terms of
estimating bug severity.

a well-defined sample which includes OB stars and young open clusters, in total
comprising about 47,700 objects. To break the sample down into groupings
resembling associations, we applied the HDBSCAN$^{*}$ clustering algorithm. We
used a Monte Carlo method to estimate the kinematic ages of the resulting
clusters and the Student's $t$-test to assess the significance of the linear
correlations between proper motions and coordinates, indicating the presence of
possible cluster expansion signatures. The ages of the majority of clusters
demonstrating a general expansion at a 1$\sigma$ confidence level are several
tens of Myr, which is in agreement with the expected ages of OB associations.
We found 32 open clusters which turned out to be members of the resulting
groupings; their ages are consistent with one another within the uncertainties.
Comparison of the clusters thus obtained with the historical composition of OB
associations in the literature shows a correspondence between their positions
in the Galaxy but an apparent absence of good one-to-one stellar matches.
Therefore, we suggest that the historical composition of OB associations needs
to be revised.

The model is identical in form to the original Kuramoto model, but written in

decision-makers (DMs). The decisions of DMs can be nudged or manipulated when
their risk preferences are influenced by factors like the perception of losses

propose a Stackelberg risk preference design (STRIPE) problem to capture a

levels. In the lower-level, individual DMs in a population, known as the
followers, respond to uncertainties according to their risk preference types
that specify their risk measures. In the upper-level, the leader influences the
distribution of the types to induce targeted decisions and steers the
follower's preferences to it. Our analysis centers around the solution concept
of approximate Stackelberg equilibrium that yields suboptimal behaviors of the
players. We show the existence of the approximate Stackelberg equilibrium. The
primitive risk perception gap, defined as the Wasserstein distance between the
original and the target type distributions, is important in estimating the
optimal design cost. We connect the leader's optimality tolerance on the cost
with her ambiguity tolerance on the follower's approximate solutions leveraging
Lipschitzian properties of the lower-level solution mapping. To obtain the
Stackelberg equilibrium, we reformulate STRIPE into a single-level optimization
problem using the spectral representations of law-invariant coherent risk
measures. We create a data-driven approach for computation and study its
performance guarantees. We apply STRIPE to contract design problems to mitigate
the intensity of moral hazard. Moreover, we connect STRIPE with meta-learning

mathematical general relativity, intuitively the simplest is the weak energy
condition $\mu\geq 0$ which simply states that the observed mass-energy density
must be non-negative. This energy condition has not received as much attention
as the so-called dominant energy condition. When the natural question of the
Penrose inequality in the context of the weak energy condition arose, we could
not find any results in the literature, and it was not immediately clear
whether the inequality would hold, even in spherical symmetry. This led us to
constructing a spherically symmetric asymptotically flat initial data set
satisfying the weak energy condition which violates the ""usual"" formulations of
the Penrose conjecture. The construction itself is quite elementary. However,
the consequences of the counterexample are quite interesting. The Penrose
inequality was conjectured by Penrose in \cite{Penrose} using certain heuristic
arguments which, as we discuss, continue to hold in the case of the weak energy
condition. Yet, a counter example exists. Moreover, the methods developed
naturally led to the construction of a counter example to the positive mass
theorem assuming the weak energy condition. The counter example can be
constructed to be diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$ and to contain no minimal

reformulations in an extended network space, a technique that has been key in
convexification, bound strengthening, and search mechanisms for a large array
of nonlinear problems. In this paper, we expand this methodology and propose
constrained shortest-path models for challenging discrete variants of bilevel
and robust optimization, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine)
are not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we
propose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces
side constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral
representation, or as state variables in shortest-path calculations. We show
that the first case generalizes a common class of combinatorial bilevel
problems where the follower's decisions are separable with respect to the
leader's decisions. In this setting, the side constraints are indicator
functions associated with arc flows, and we leverage polyhedral structure to
derive an alternative single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. The
case where side constraints are incorporated as node states, in turn,
generalizes classical robust optimization. For this scenario, we leverage
network structure to derive an iterative augmenting state-space strategy akin
to an L-shaped method. We evaluate both strategies on a bilevel competitive
project selection problem and the robust traveling salesperson with time
windows, observing considerable improvements in computational efficiency as
compared to current state-of-the-art methods in the respective areas.

self-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This
biology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but is rarely

self-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control

dangerous threat of offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker who
has stolen the cryptographic hash of a user's password can check as many
password guesses as s/he likes limited only by the resources that s/he is
willing to invest to crack the password. Pepper and key-stretching are two
techniques that have been proposed to deter an offline attacker by increasing
guessing costs. Pepper ensures that the cost of rejecting an incorrect password
guess is higher than the (expected) cost of verifying a correct password guess.
This is useful because most of the offline attacker's guesses will be
incorrect. Unfortunately, as we observe the traditional peppering defense seems
to be incompatible with modern memory hard key-stretching algorithms such as
Argon2 or Scrypt. We introduce an alternative to pepper which we call
Cost-Asymmetric Memory Hard Password Authentication which benefits from the
same cost-asymmetry as the classical peppering defense i.e., the cost of
rejecting an incorrect password guess is larger than the expected cost to
authenticate a correct password guess. When configured properly we prove that
our mechanism can only reduce the percentage of user passwords that are cracked
by a rational offline attacker whose goal is to maximize (expected) profit
i.e., the total value of cracked passwords minus the total guessing costs. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our mechanism on empirical password datasets
against a rational offline attacker. Our empirical analysis shows that our
mechanism can reduce significantly the percentage of user passwords that are
cracked by a rational attacker by up to 10%.

alteration and improve classification and diagnostic accuracy. We tested this
hypothesis using a single, widely available, and conventional T1-weighted MRI
scan, from which we extracted the 3D whole-brain structure using standard
post-processing methods. A deep learning model was then developed, optimized,
and evaluated on three open datasets with T1-weighted MRI scans of patients

was also trained with structural MR images using a 3D CNN architecture. Our
model is capable of almost perfectly (area under the ROC curve = 0.987)
distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy controls on unseen

ventricles as the most predictive brain regions. Subcortical structures serve a
pivotal role in cognitive, affective, and social functions in humans, and
structural abnormalities of these regions have been associated with
schizophrenia. Our finding corroborates that schizophrenia is associated with
widespread alterations in subcortical brain structure and the subcortical
structural information provides prominent features in diagnostic
classification. Together, these results further demonstrate the potential of
deep learning to improve schizophrenia diagnosis and identify its structural
neuroimaging signatures from a single, standard T1-weighted brain MRI.

memristive spiking neural networks (MSNNs). Our approach harnesses intrinsic
device dynamics to trigger naturally arising voltage spikes. These spikes
emitted by memristive dynamics are analog in nature, and thus fully
differentiable, which eliminates the need for surrogate gradient methods that
are prevalent in the spiking neural network (SNN) literature. Memristive neural
networks typically either integrate memristors as synapses that map
offline-trained networks, or otherwise rely on associative learning mechanisms
to train networks of memristive neurons. We instead apply the backpropagation
through time (BPTT) training algorithm directly on analog SPICE models of
memristive neurons and synapses. Our implementation is fully memristive, in
that synaptic weights and spiking neurons are both integrated on resistive RAM
(RRAM) arrays without the need for additional circuits to implement spiking
dynamics, e.g., analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) or thresholded comparators.
As a result, higher-order electrophysical effects are fully exploited to use
the state-driven dynamics of memristive neurons at run time. By moving towards
non-approximate gradient-based learning, we obtain highly competitive accuracy
amongst previously reported lightweight dense fully MSNNs on several

  Retrieval with Dense Retrieval Systems",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, several dense retrieval (DR) models have demonstrated competitive
performance to term-based retrieval that are ubiquitous in search systems. In
contrast to term-based matching, DR projects queries and documents into a dense
vector space and retrieves results via (approximate) nearest neighbor search.
Deploying a new system, such as DR, inevitably involves tradeoffs in aspects of
its performance. Established retrieval systems running at scale are usually
well understood in terms of effectiveness and costs, such as query latency,
indexing throughput, or storage requirements. In this work, we propose a
framework with a set of criteria that go beyond simple effectiveness measures
to thoroughly compare two retrieval systems with the explicit goal of assessing
the readiness of one system to replace the other. This includes careful
tradeoff considerations between effectiveness and various cost factors.
Furthermore, we describe guardrail criteria, since even a system that is better
on average may have systematic failures on a minority of queries. The
guardrails check for failures on certain query characteristics and novel
failure types that are only possible in dense retrieval systems. We demonstrate
our decision framework on a Web ranking scenario. In that scenario,
state-of-the-art DR models have surprisingly strong results, not only on
average performance but passing an extensive set of guardrail tests, showing
robustness on different query characteristics, lexical matching,
generalization, and number of regressions. It is impossible to predict whether
DR will become ubiquitous in the future, but one way this is possible is
through repeated applications of decision processes such as the one presented
here.

e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely
time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images.
Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product
image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to
achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce.
To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier
(MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule
violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the
additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide
extra semantic information. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the
proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we
also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as
primary image selection, noncompliant content detection, and image
deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and
efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework
has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves
13.6% in reject rate.

a weaker condition than for a mutually connected component in interdependent
networks, in which any two vertices must be connected by a path within each of
the layers. The effect of the overlaps on weak percolation turns out to be
opposite to that on the giant mutually connected component. While for the giant
mutually connected component, overlaps do not change the critical phenomena,
our theory shows that in two layers any (nonzero) concentration of overlaps
drives the weak percolation transition to the ordinary percolation universality
class. In three layers, the phase diagram of the problem contains two lines --
of a continuous phase transition and of a discontinuous one -- connected in
various ways depending on how the layers overlap. In the case of only doubled
overlapped edges, two of the end points of these lines coincide, resulting in a
tricritical point like that seen in heterogeneous $k$-core percolation.

Precision medicine can be applied to neuromodulatory techniques, where focused
brain stimulation treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) are used to modulate brain circuits and alleviate clinical
symptoms. rTMS is well-tolerated and clinically effective for
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and other neuropsychiatric disorders.
However, despite its wide stimulation parameter space (location, angle,
pattern, frequency, and intensity can be adjusted), rTMS is currently applied
in a one-size-fits-all manner, potentially contributing to its suboptimal
clinical response (~50%). In this review, we examine components of rTMS that
can be optimized to account for inter-individual variability in neural function
and anatomy. We discuss current treatment options for TRD, the neural
mechanisms thought to underlie treatment, differences in FDA-cleared devices,
targeting strategies, stimulation parameter selection, and adaptive closed-loop
rTMS to improve treatment outcomes. We suggest that better understanding of the
wide and modifiable parameter space of rTMS will greatly improve clinical
outcome.

heat transfer between hairpin vortices formed in wakes behind staggered hills
in a laminar boundary layer. Hairpin vortices are periodically shed in the wake
of a row of hills, causing interference between the hairpin vortices. As the
spanwise distance between the hills decreases, interference increases and the
hairpin vortices become strong. At that time, because the interference between
the legs of the hairpin vortex and the Q2 ejection becomes strong, the head of
each hairpin vortex rises sharply. When the hill spacing decreases, the
turbulence caused by the head and both legs of the hairpin vortex generated
from a hill in the second row increases remarkably. In addition, the secondary
vortex also generates turbulence. The hairpin vortex and the secondary vortex
are attracted to adjacent hairpin vortices, causing widespread high turbulence
in the spanwise direction near the wall surface. Regardless of the hill
spacing, Q2 ejection and Q4 sweep due to the hairpin vortex occur, and the
secondary vortex forms around the hairpin vortex, activating heat transport and
increasing the heat transfer coefficient in the wake. When the hill spacing
becomes narrower, the interference between the hairpin vortices strengthens the
legs of each hairpin vortex and secondary vortex, and heat transport near the
wall surface becomes very active. The heat transfer increases over a wide range
of the wake because the legs of hairpin vortices flowing downstream are spread
in the spanwise direction.

equipment (UE), estimating the speed of cellular-connected unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) carries critical importance since this can help to improve the
quality of service of the cellular network. The 3GPP LTE standard uses the
number of handovers made by a UE during a predefined time period to estimate
the speed and the mobility state efficiently. In this paper, we introduce an
approximation to the probability mass function of handover count (HOC) as a
function of a cellular-connected UAV's height and velocity, HOC measurement
time window, and different ground base station (GBS) densities. Afterward, we
derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the speed estimate of a UAV, and
also provide a simple biased estimator for the UAV's speed which depends on the
GBS density and HOC measurement period. Interestingly, for a low
time-to-trigger (TTT) parameter, the biased estimator turns into a minimum
variance unbiased estimator (MVUE). By exploiting this speed estimator, we
study the problem of detecting the mobility state of a UAV as low, medium, or
high mobility as per the LTE specifications. Using CRLBs and our proposed MVUE,
we characterize the accuracy improvement in speed estimation and mobility state
detection as the GBS density and the HOC measurement window increase. Our
analysis also shows that the accuracy of the proposed estimator does not vary

are highly uniformly distributed, the highest selectivity occurs at an
intermediate binding energy and can be significantly greater than the weak
binding limit. This is caused by an exponential relationship between the bound

experiments with a different frequency of probe light were designed and
performed. The varying-frequency TOF (VFTOF) experiments demonstrated that the
fall acceleration of test atoms is dependent on the detuning of the probe light
frequency with respect to the atomic transition frequency. In appropriately
designed experiments, if the scalar field in the model accounts for the
accelerated expansion of the Universe entirely, the field will result in an
observable fifth force. Meanwhile, the trapped quintessence model still
satisfies all experimental bounds on deviations from general relativity due to
both the saturation effect and the short interaction range of the scalar field.
The scalar saturates at a value corresponding to the cosmological constant when
the microscopic nonrelativistic matter density is large enough. The interaction
range of the scalar is inversely proportional to the square root of the
microscopic nonrelativistic matter density. The interaction range has been
estimated to be several $\mu \rm{m}$ in the current cosmic density. The
Universe is assumed to be permeated with fuzzy dark matter, which means that
the microscopic nonrelativistic matter density defined through the quantum
wavefunctions of the ultralight particles can be used on the cosmic scale.
  By measuring the fall acceleration of the test atoms with the TOF method
step-by-step in the detuning frequency domain of the probe light, we derived
the dispersion curves of the measured acceleration versus the frequency
detuning of the probe light. When the nonrelativistic matter density of the
source increased due to the energy gained from the laser light, the test atoms
were pulled to the center of the source, and vice versa.

inversely related to the number of jobseekers. With such symmetry, the labor
market is efficient when there are as many jobseekers as vacancies ($u = v$),
too tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers ($v > u$), and too
slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies ($u > v$). Accordingly, the
efficient unemployment rate is the geometric average of the unemployment and

people, and it is critical to diagnose this disorder as early as possible.
Detecting depression from voice signals can be of great help to physicians and
can be done without any invasive procedure. Since relevant labelled data are
scarce, we propose a modified Instance Discriminative Learning (IDL) method, an
unsupervised pre-training technique, to extract augment-invariant and
instance-spread-out embeddings. In terms of learning augment-invariant
embeddings, various data augmentation methods for speech are investigated, and
time-masking yields the best performance. To learn instance-spread-out
embeddings, we explore methods for sampling instances for a training batch
(distinct speaker-based and random sampling). It is found that the distinct
speaker-based sampling provides better performance than the random one, and we
hypothesize that this result is because relevant speaker information is
preserved in the embedding. Additionally, we propose a novel sampling strategy,
Pseudo Instance-based Sampling (PIS), based on clustering algorithms, to
enhance spread-out characteristics of the embeddings. Experiments are conducted
with DepAudioNet on DAIC-WOZ (English) and CONVERGE (Mandarin) datasets, and
statistically significant improvements, with p-value 0.0015 and 0.05,

these conditions to an efficient algorithm for verifying safety of a UAM

proposes a speech intelligibility enhancement in noisy environment by applying
voice conversion method on non-professional voice. We discovered that the
professional announcers and non-professional speakers are clusterized into
different clusters on the speaker embedding plane. This implies that the speech
intelligibility can be controlled as an independent feature of speaker

the speech intelligibility of converted voice is higher than that of original

in recent label noise learning methods. To exploit this effect, the model

outputs of DNNs in the early stage of learning to correct noisy labels.
However, we observe that the model will make mistakes during label prediction,
resulting in unsatisfactory performance. By contrast, the produced features in
the early stage of learning show better robustness. Inspired by this
observation, in this paper, we propose a novel feature embedding-based method
for deep learning with label noise, termed LabEl NoiseDilution (LEND). To be
specific, we first compute a similarity matrix based on current embedded
features to capture the local structure of training data. Then, the noisy
supervision signals carried by mislabeled data are overwhelmed by nearby
correctly labeled ones (\textit{i.e.}, label noise dilution), of which the
effectiveness is guaranteed by the inherent robustness of feature embedding.
Finally, the training data with diluted labels are further used to train a
robust classifier. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world noisy datasets by comparing our LEND with several
representative robust learning approaches. The results verify the effectiveness
of our LEND.

result to solving more general operations on string ranges, in

distant joints relations and long-range temporal information that are vital to
distinguishing various actions. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale
spatial graph convolution (MS-GC) module and a multi-scale temporal graph
convolution (MT-GC) module to enrich the receptive field of the model in
spatial and temporal dimensions. Concretely, the MS-GC and MT-GC modules
decompose the corresponding local graph convolution into a set of sub-graph
convolution, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing
additional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of
sub-graph convolutions, and each node could complete multiple spatial and
temporal aggregations with its neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive
field is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of capturing both short- and

deep-learning-based watermarking technique is being extensively studied. Most
existing approaches adopt a similar encoder-driven scheme which we name END
(Encoder-NoiseLayer-Decoder) architecture. In this paper, we revamp the
architecture and creatively design a decoder-driven watermarking network dubbed
De-END which greatly outperforms the existing END-based methods. The motivation
for designing De-END originated from the potential drawback we discovered in
END architecture: The encoder may embed redundant features that are not
necessary for decoding, limiting the performance of the whole network. We
conducted a detailed analysis and found that such limitations are caused by
unsatisfactory coupling between the encoder and decoder in END. De-END
addresses such drawbacks by adopting a Decoder-Encoder-Noiselayer-Decoder
architecture. In De-END, the host image is firstly processed by the decoder to
generate a latent feature map instead of being directly fed into the encoder.
This latent feature map is concatenated to the original watermark message and
then processed by the encoder. This change in design is crucial as it makes the
feature of encoder and decoder directly shared thus the encoder and decoder are
better coupled. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that
this framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) END-based deep
learning watermarking both in visual quality and robustness. On the premise of
the same decoder structure, the visual quality (measured by PSNR) of De-END

analyze the convergence behavior of these two algorithms in the non-convex

$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{d\log(1/\delta)}{N^2\epsilon^2}}\right)$ of
the gradient norm for a $d$-dimensional model, $N$ samples and
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP, which improves over previous bounds under much weaker
assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a regularizing factor in DP-NSGD and
show that it is crucial in the convergence proof and subtly controls the bias

This version fixes a typo in eq 33",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The acquisition function, a critical component in Bayesian optimization (BO),

restrictions must be placed on the surrogate model and utility function. To
extend BO to a broader class of models and utilities, we propose
likelihood-free BO (LFBO), an approach based on likelihood-free inference. LFBO
directly models the acquisition function without having to separately perform
inference with a probabilistic surrogate model. We show that computing the
acquisition function in LFBO can be reduced to optimizing a weighted
classification problem, where the weights correspond to the utility being
chosen. By choosing the utility function for expected improvement (EI), LFBO
outperforms various state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods on several
real-world optimization problems. LFBO can also effectively leverage composite
structures of the objective function, which further improves its regret by
several orders of magnitude.

studying mean-field approximations and dynamics in a variety of applications.
Although usually derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or

characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of
random matrix ensembles.
  We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms
tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions
hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles,
including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise
variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to
rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over
matrix ensembles whose eigenvector bases satisfy only sign and permutation
invariances, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or
Fourier transforms and diagonal operators.
  We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP
universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors
along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the
aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with
respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness
for traces of matrix products.

structural limitations of using U-Net directly for noise SV tasks and further
proposed Extended U-Net to reduce these drawbacks. We evaluated the models on
the noise-synthesized VoxCeleb1 test set and VOiCES development set recorded in

introduce magnetism into topological insulators. One scheme is to introduce
ferromagnetic dopants in topological insulators. However, it is generally
challenging and requires carefully engineered growth/heterostructures or
relatively low temperatures to observe the QAHI due to issues such as the added
disorder with ferromagnetic dopants. Another promising scheme is using the
magnetic proximity effect with a magnetic insulator to magnetize the
topological insulator. Most of these heterostructures are synthesized so far by
growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and metallic organic chemical
vapor deposition. These are not readily applicable to allow mixing and matching
many of the available ferromagnetic and topological insulators due to
difference in growth conditions and lattice mismatch. Here, we demonstrate that
the magnetic proximity effect can still be obtained in stacked heterostructures
assembled via the dry transfer of exfoliated micrometer-sized thin flakes of
van der Waals topological insulator and magnetic insulator materials
(BiSbTeSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6), as evidenced in the observation of an anomalous Hall

modulation of the AHE when controlling the carrier density via electrostatic
gating. These results show that simple mechanical transfer of magnetic van der

overcome resource constraints (e.g., in lightweight IoT devices), facilitate
collaborative analysis (e.g., under distributed or multi-party scenarios), and
benefit from lower costs and specialized expertise (e.g., of Managed Security
Service Providers). Despite such benefits, a data owner may feel reluctant to
outsource anomaly detection without sufficient privacy protection. To that end,
most existing privacy solutions would face a novel challenge, i.e., preserving
privacy usually requires the difference between data entries to be eliminated
or reduced, whereas anomaly detection critically depends on that difference.
Such a conflict is recently resolved under a local analysis setting with
trusted analysts (where no outsourcing is involved) through moving the focus of
differential privacy (DP) guarantee from ""all"" to only ""benign"" entries. In
this paper, we observe that such an approach is not directly applicable to the
outsourcing setting, because data owners do not know which entries are ""benign""
prior to outsourcing, and hence cannot selectively apply DP on data entries.
Therefore, we propose a novel iterative solution for the data owner to
gradually ""disentangle"" the anomalous entries from the benign ones such that
the third-party analyst can produce accurate anomaly results with sufficient DP
guarantee. We design and implement our Differentially Private Outsourcing of
Anomaly Detection (DPOAD) framework, and demonstrate its benefits over baseline
Laplace and PainFree mechanisms through experiments with real data from
different application domains.

attraction between the legs stabilizes the columnar dimer (CD) phase in the
highly frustrated regime $J_\perp\approx 2J_\times$, especially for
ferromagnetic $J_{\perp, \times}<0$. By means of effective field theory and
numerical analyses, we extend this analysis to the XXZ model, and obtain a rich

symmetry breaking: the rung singlet (RS) and Haldane phases as well as their
twisted variants, the RS* and Haldane* phases, which are all distinct in the

improvement opportunities based on event logs. A common roadblock to process
mining is that event logs may contain private information that cannot be used
for analysis without consent. An approach to overcome this roadblock is to
anonymize the event log so that no individual represented in the original log
can be singled out based on the anonymized one. Differential privacy is an
anonymization approach that provides this guarantee. A differentially private
event log anonymization technique seeks to produce an anonymized log that is as
similar as possible to the original one (high utility) while providing a
required privacy guarantee. Existing event log anonymization techniques operate
by injecting noise into the traces in the log (e.g., duplicating, perturbing,
or filtering out some traces). Recent work on differential privacy has shown
that a better privacy-utility tradeoff can be achieved by applying subsampling
prior to noise injection. In other words, subsampling amplifies privacy. This
paper proposes an event log anonymization approach called Libra that exploits
this observation. Libra extracts multiple samples of traces from a log,
independently injects noise, retains statistically relevant traces from each
sample, and composes the samples to produce a differentially private log. An
empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach leads to a considerably
higher utility for equivalent privacy guarantees relative to existing
baselines.

Further, explicit formulas are given not only for the maximum value of $n$ such

Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The use of
DIDs empowers users by helping them to have complete control over their

legitimate before proceeding with the charging services using VC. Key recovery

system appears as a diffusively connected system of mathematical models of

neural circuit. The stimuli in the conduction path that will address the myelin
sheath that has lost its function are received by the axons and are conveyed
externally to the target organ, aiming to solve the problem of decreased nerve
conduction. In the NEURON simulation environment, one can create a neuron model
and define biophysical events that take place within the system for study. In
this environment, signal transmission between cells and dendrites is obtained
graphically. The simulated potassium and sodium conductance are replicated
adequately, and the electronic action potentials are quite comparable to those
measured experimentally. In this work, we propose an analog and digital coupled
neuron model comprising individual excitatory and inhibitory neural circuit
blocks for a low-cost and energy-efficient system. Compared to digital design,
our analog design performs in lower frequency but gives a 32.3\% decreased
energy efficiency. Thus, the resulting coupled analog hardware neuron model can
be a proposed model for the simulation of reduced nerve conduction. As a
result, the analog coupled neuron, (even with its greater design complexity)
serious contender for the future development of a wearable sensor device that

especially when accompanied by an experimental demonstration. Most of the
realizations use plasmonic platforms, and some also use all-dielectric

have been very little explored. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate
single subwavelength hybrid dielectric-plasmonic optical nanoantennas coupled
to localized quantum dot emitters that constitute efficient and bright
unidirectional photon sources under optical pumping. To achieve this, we
devised a silicon nanoring sitting on a gold mirror with a 10 nm gap
in-between, where an assembly of colloidal quantum dots is embedded. Such a
structure supports both (radiative) antenna mode and (nonradiative) gap mode
resonances, which we exploit for the dual purpose of out-coupling the light
emitted by the quantum dots into the far-field with out-of-plane directivity,
and for enhancing the excitation of the dots by the optical pump. Moreover,
almost independent control of the resonance spectral positions can be achieved
by simple tuning of geometrical parameters such as the ring inner and outer
diameters, allowing us to conveniently adjust these resonances with respect to
the quantum dots emission and absorption wavelengths. Using the proposed
architecture, we obtain experimentally average fluorescence enhancement factors
up to $654\times$ folds mainly due to high radiative efficiencies, and
associated with a directional emission of the photoluminescence into a cone of
$\pm 17\degree$ in the direction normal to the sample plane. We believe the
solution presented here to be viable and relevant for the next generation of
light-emitting devices.

the Decision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster

sufficient to obtain low regret for adversarial decision making. However,
compared to the stochastic setting, one must apply the Decision-Estimation
Coefficient to the convex hull of the class of models (or, hypotheses) under

rewards or dynamics is governed by the behavior of the model class under
convexification, and recovers a number of existing results -- both positive and
negative. En route to obtaining these guarantees, we provide new structural

traditional handcrafted features and give us more reason to progress towards
using end-to-end deep neural networks and more recent techniques. We use
Sincnet architecture as our baseline. We get E2E deep learning models, which we
call WSTnet and CWTnet, respectively, by replacing the Sinc layer with the
Wavelet Scattering and Continuous wavelet transform layers. The fusion model
achieved 62% and 17% relative improvement over traditional handcrafted models
and our Sincnet baseline when evaluated on the modern spoofing attacks in
ASVspoof 2019.
  The final scale distribution and the number of scales used in CWTnet are far
from optimal for the task at hand. So to solve this problem, we replaced the
CWT layer with a Wavelet Deconvolution(WD) (Khan and Yener, 2018) layer in our
CWTnet architecture. This layer calculates the Discrete-Continuous Wavelet

back-propagation. The WDnet model achieved 26% and 7% relative improvement over

the slow manifold for certain two-scale dynamical systems. It works by solving
a modified version of the system as a boundary value problem in time, where the
nonlinear terms are adiabatically ramped up from zero to the fully nonlinear
dynamics. A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly
available. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem
is repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary
conditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In
this paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the
termination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic
error of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially
small. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an
effective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem

to the same factors. Based on this assumption, we propose an algorithm to focus
on social relationships useful for recommendation systems through mutual
constraints from both types of information. We test the performance of our
algorithm on four types of users, including all users, active users, inactive
users and cold-start users. Results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmarks in four types of scenarios subject to recommendation
accuracy and diversity metrics. We further design a randomization model to
explore the contribution of social relationships to recommendation performance,
and the result shows that the contribution of social relationships in the
proposed algorithm depends on the coupling strength of social relationships and
historical behaviors.

the tiny siliques as the main traits targeted. PST is composed of: (i) a
dynamic voxel feature encoder (DVFE) to aggregate the point features with the
raw spatial resolution; (ii) the dual window sets attention blocks to capture
the contextual information; and (iii) a dense feature propagation module to
obtain the final dense point feature map. The results proved that PST and
PST-PointGroup (PG) achieved superior performance in semantic and instance

While a useful tool for model selection (i.e., the model most likely to perform
the best OOD is the one with highest ID accuracy), this fact does not help
estimate the actual OOD performance of models without access to a labeled OOD
validation set. In this paper, we show a similar but surprising phenomenon also
holds for the agreement between pairs of neural network classifiers: whenever

agreement can be estimated with just unlabeled data. Our prediction algorithm
outperforms previous methods both in shifts where agreement-on-the-line holds

a new random projection method (RPM) for efficiently solving this problem.
Compared with existing RPMs, our proposed algorithm features two useful
algorithmic ideas. First, at each iteration, instead of projection onto a
subset of the feasible region, our algorithm requires only a relaxed projection
in the sense that only the projection onto a half-space approximation of the
subset is needed. This significantly reduces the per iteration computational
cost as the relaxed projection admits a closed-form formula. Second, to exploit
the structure that the objective function is a large sum of convex functions,
the variance reduction technique is incorporated into our algorithm to improve
the empirical convergence behaviour. As our theoretical contributions, under an
error bound-type condition and some other standard conditions, we prove that
almost surely the proposed algorithm converges to an optimal solution and that
both the optimality and feasibility gaps decrease to zero, with rates
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\log(K)/ K)$, respectively. As a
side contribution, we also show that the said error bound-type condition holds
some mild assumptions, which could be of independent interest. Numerical
results on synthetic problem instances are also presented to demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of the variance reduction technique and the superiority

address the average coverage guarantee, which is not ideal compared to the
stronger conditional coverage guarantee. Existing methods of approximating
conditional coverage require additional models or time effort, which makes them
not easy to scale. In this paper, we propose a modified non-conformity score by
leveraging the local approximation of the conditional distribution using kernel
density estimation. The modified score inherits the spirit of split conformal

performs well is fascinating. In this work, we move toward the answer with one
more step by connecting zero stability and model performance. Specifically, we
found that if a discrete solver of an ordinary differential equation is zero
stable, the CNN corresponding to that solver performs well. We first give the
interpretation of zero stability in the context of deep learning and then
investigate the performance of existing first- and second-order CNNs under
different zero-stable circumstances. Based on the preliminary observation, we
provide a higher-order discretization to construct CNNs and then propose a
zero-stable network (ZeroSNet). To guarantee zero stability of the ZeroSNet, we
first deduce a structure that meets consistency conditions and then give a zero
stable region of a training-free parameter. By analyzing the roots of a
characteristic equation, we theoretically obtain the optimal coefficients of
feature maps. Empirically, we present our results from three aspects: We
provide extensive empirical evidence of different depth on different datasets
to show that the moduli of the characteristic equation's roots are the keys for
the performance of CNNs that require historical features; Our experiments show
that ZeroSNet outperforms existing CNNs which is based on high-order
discretization; ZeroSNets show better robustness against noises on the input.

finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an
exposure game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms including modern
factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly
innocuous algorithmic choices -- e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained
factorization -- significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash)
equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models like
ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify
misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement
post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we
propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and
illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among

engineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote
using the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated
neural networks. Later on, the strong form which has a higher order of
derivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the
physical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem is
applied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The
proposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the
physical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through
various comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs
and FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and
its energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear
interpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element
nodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids to
show the capability of deep learning for predicting the solution in a complex
environment under different boundary conditions. The performance of the
proposed PINN model is checked against the solution from FEM on two prototype
problems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem).
We concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the
deep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous
domain without any available initial data from other sources. Finally,
discussions are provided on the combination of PINN and FEM for a fast and

against representative trust prediction tools. The attacks are formulated as
hard bi-level optimization problems, for which we propose several efficient

attack detectors we designed. To address this issue, we further refine the
basic attacks by integrating some conflicting metrics as penalty terms into the

successfully evade attack detectors with high probability while sacrificing
little attack performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate
that the basic attacks can severely disrupt trust prediction, the basic attacks

included in the matter sector along with the Standard Model fermions. Two such
colour singlet fermions, $N$ and $l_S$, transforming as bi-doublet and singlet

Assignment of $U(1)$ charges for the matter fields restricts some of the exotic
fermions to interact with the SM fermions. We study in some details the
prospect of such fermionic dark matters by calculating relic densities and
direct detection cross-sections by treating these particles as stand alone
relic particles in turn. $N$, when treated as relic particle, would produce a
direct-detection cross-section very high compared to the experimental upper
limits. However, the interaction rate of $N$ can be controlled by introducing a
dimension-6 operator involving two $N$ fields and two SM fermions and
appropriately choosing the coupling constant. This in turn, makes the
interaction rate of $N$ very high and yields a small relic density. On the
other hand, $l_S$ for some chosen mass window, can give us right amount of
relic, but its direct detection cross-section is too small. Keeping these in
mind, we propose two-component model of DM, where both $N$ and $l_S$ contribute
to the relic density, albeit with unequal proportion while the direct detection
cross-section limits can be satisfied mainly by $N$ in presence of an extra
dimension-6 interaction. We derive limits on such an interaction from XENON

change detection task from the perspective of sequence transduction.
Specifically, we propose a novel encoder-decoder framework that directly
converts the input feature sequence to the speaker identity sequence. The
difference-based continuous integrate-and-fire mechanism is designed to support
this framework. It detects speaker changes by integrating the speaker
difference between the encoder outputs frame-by-frame and transfers encoder
outputs to segment-level speaker embeddings according to the detected speaker
changes. The whole framework is supervised by the speaker identity sequence, a
weaker label than the precise speaker change points. The experiments on the AMI
and DIHARD-I corpora show that our sequence-level method consistently
outperforms a strong frame-level baseline that uses the precise speaker change
labels.

However, previous works mainly consider static, pair-wise interactions with

proposed prediction system leverages the Gaussian mixture model, multiple

stability and trajectory smoothness, respectively. Extensive experiments show
that: 1)DynGroupNet can capture time-varying group behaviors, infer
time-varying interaction category and interaction strength during trajectory
prediction without any relation supervision on physical simulation datasets;

performance of the histopathological whole slide images analysis. The previous
representation learning methods followed the supervised learning paradigm.
However, manual annotation for large-scale WSIs is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Hence, the self-supervised contrastive learning has recently
attracted intensive attention. The present contrastive learning methods treat
each sample as a single class, which suffers from class collision problems,
especially in the domain of histopathology image analysis. In this paper, we
proposed a novel contrastive representation learning framework named
Lesion-Aware Contrastive Learning (LACL) for histopathology whole slide image
analysis. We built a lesion queue based on the memory bank structure to store
the representations of different classes of WSIs, which allowed the contrastive
model to selectively define the negative pairs during the training. Moreover,
We designed a queue refinement strategy to purify the representations stored in
the lesion queue. The experimental results demonstrate that LACL achieves the
best performance in histopathology image representation learning on different
datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different WSI

only a small amount of data and little additional computation time. The same
behaviour holds for ensembles of deep learning models typically superior to a
single model. However, a transfer of deep neural networks ensemble demands
relatively high computational expenses. The probability of overfitting also
increases.
  Our approach for the transfer learning of ensembles consists of two steps:
(a) shifting weights of encoders of all models in the ensemble by a single
shift vector and (b) doing a tiny fine-tuning for each individual model
afterwards. This strategy leads to a speed-up of the training process and gives
an opportunity to add models to an ensemble with significantly reduced training
time using the shift vector.
  We compare different strategies by computation time, the accuracy of an
ensemble, uncertainty estimation and disagreement and conclude that our
approach gives competitive results using the same computation complexity in
comparison with the traditional approach. Also, our method keeps the ensemble's

Different from previous methods that construct correspondences only in the

to improve registration accuracy. Specifically, we extract per-point semantic
labels with advanced semantic segmentation networks and build a prior semantic
part-to-part correspondence. Then we incorporate the semantic information into
a learning-based registration pipeline, consisting of three core modules: a
semantic-based farthest point sampling module to efficiently filter out
outliers and dynamic objects; a semantic-augmented feature extraction module
for learning more discriminative point descriptors; a semantic-refined
transformation estimation module that utilizes prior semantic matching as a
mask to refine point correspondences by reducing false matching for better
convergence. We evaluate the proposed SARNet extensively by using real-world

benefits him more, compared to the ones when he truthfully behaves.
  We study the follower's optimal manipulation via such strategic behaviors in
extensive-form games. Followers' different attitudes are taken into account. An
optimistic follower maximizes his true utility among all game outcomes that can
be induced by some payoff function. A pessimistic follower only considers
misreporting payoff functions that induce a unique game outcome. For all the

We modelled simultaneously radial velocity curves and times of eclipse for each

that this third body could in turn be a binary composed by two $\sim$1.4

in the CE$\nu$NS, the tensor operators can contribute to the process through
either direct or indirect way. As a result, the indirect contributions
including nonperturbative and perturbative parts for all couplings become
negligible in comparison with the direct ones. As the nonperturbative

the extraction of limits on the tensor LNEFT Wilson coefficients. We compute

contribute a significant fraction of dark matter at wide mass range, they will
cause microlensing in the GW signals with long wavelengths that are distinct
from the lensing effects of electromagnetic signals from astrophysical objects.
In this paper, we apply the lensing effect of GW from BBH to derive constraints
on the abundance of compact DM for the Cosmic Explorer, a third-generation
ground-based GW detector. We firstly consider two channels of formation of BBH
that contribute to low and high redshift GW sources, including the
astrophysical origin BBH scenario, and the primordial origin BBH scenario.
Secondly, comparing with the method of optical depth, we use the Bayesian
analysis to derive constraints on the abundance of compact DM with different
mass function of lens taken into consideration. For a null search with $1000$
detected GW events of BBH, we find that the abundance of compact DM could be
constrained to $\lesssim0.1\%$ in the mass range $\geq500~M_{\odot}$ at $68\%$
confidence level. In addition, if a GW event lensed by a compact DM object with
$M_{\rm l}\in[100~M_{\odot},300~M_{\odot}]$ is detected in $100$ detected GW
events of BBH, we can derive that the estimation of the abundance of compact DM
is from $2.3\%$ to $25.2\%$ in this mass range with the Bayesian analysis.

systems' security and stability. In this work, a Cyber-Resilient Economic
Dispatch (CRED) framework is presented to mitigate the destabilizing effect of
LAAs while minimizing the overall operational cost by dynamically optimizing
the frequency droop control gains of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). The
system frequency dynamics incorporating both LAAs and the IBR droop control are
modeled. The system stability constraints are explicitly derived based on
parametric sensitivities. To incorporate them into the CRED model and minimize
the error of the sensitivity analysis, a recursive linearization method is
further proposed. A distributionally robust approach is applied to account for
the uncertainty associated with the LAA detection/parameter estimation. The
overall performance of the proposed CRED model is demonstrated through
simulations in a modified IEEE reliability test system.

localization for multi-robot systems (MRS) under measurement uncertainty in
GNSS-limited scenarios. Specifically, we address the issue of accurately
predicting the probability of a future connection between two robots equipped
with range-based measurement devices. Due to the limited range of the equipped
sensors, edges in the network connection topology will be created or destroyed
as the robots move with respect to one another. Accurately predicting the
future existence of an edge, given imperfect state estimation and noisy
actuation, is therefore a challenging task. An adaptive power series expansion
(or APSE) algorithm is developed based on current estimates and control
candidates. Such an algorithm applies the power series expansion formula of the
quadratic positive form in a normal distribution. Finite-term approximation is
made to realize the computational tractability. Further analyses are presented
to show that the truncation error in the finite-term approximation can be
theoretically reduced to a desired threshold by adaptively choosing the
summation degree of the power series. Several sufficient conditions are
rigorously derived as the selection principles. Finally, extensive simulation
results and comparisons, with respect to both single and multi-robot cases,
validate that a formally computed and therefore more accurate probability of
future topology can help improve the performance of active planning under
uncertainty.

  https://yingyichen-cyy.github.io/CompressFeatNoisyLabels/",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised learning can be viewed as distilling relevant information from
input data into feature representations. This process becomes difficult when
supervision is noisy as the distilled information might not be relevant. In
fact, recent research shows that networks can easily overfit all labels
including those that are corrupted, and hence can hardly generalize to clean
datasets. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning with noisy labels
and introduce compression inductive bias to network architectures to alleviate
this over-fitting problem. More precisely, we revisit one classical
regularization named Dropout and its variant Nested Dropout. Dropout can serve
as a compression constraint for its feature dropping mechanism, while Nested
Dropout further learns ordered feature representations w.r.t. feature
importance. Moreover, the trained models with compression regularization are
further combined with Co-teaching for performance boost.
  Theoretically, we conduct bias-variance decomposition of the objective
function under compression regularization. We analyze it for both single model
and Co-teaching. This decomposition provides three insights: (i) it shows that
over-fitting is indeed an issue for learning with noisy labels; (ii) through an
information bottleneck formulation, it explains why the proposed feature
compression helps in combating label noise; (iii) it gives explanations on the
performance boost brought by incorporating compression regularization into
Co-teaching. Experiments show that our simple approach can have comparable or
even better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks with
real-world label noise including Clothing1M and ANIMAL-10N. Our implementation

widespread applications across different areas such as machine learning and
statistics. In most real-world scenarios, however, linear regression problems
are often ill-posed or the underlying model suffers from overfitting, leading
to erroneous or trivial solutions. This is often dealt with by adding extra
constraints, known as regularization. In this paper, we use the frameworks of
block-encoding and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) to design the
first quantum algorithms for quantum least squares with general
$\ell_2$-regularization. These include regularized versions of quantum ordinary
least squares, quantum weighted least squares, and quantum generalized least
squares. Our quantum algorithms substantially improve upon prior results on
quantum ridge regression (polynomial improvement in the condition number and an
exponential improvement in accuracy), which is a particular case of our result.
  To this end, we assume approximate block-encodings of the underlying matrices
as input and use robust QSVT algorithms for various linear algebra operations.
In particular, we develop a variable-time quantum algorithm for matrix
inversion using QSVT, where we use quantum eigenvalue discrimination as a
subroutine instead of gapped phase estimation. This ensures that substantially
fewer ancilla qubits are required for this procedure than prior results. Owing
to the generality of the block-encoding framework, our algorithms are
applicable to a variety of input models and can also be seen as improved and
generalized versions of prior results on standard (non-regularized) quantum
least squares algorithms.

factor that evolves over time. This factor is estimated based on the

characterized by cationic chemical disorder, which entails that U and Pu
cations are randomly distributed on the cation sublattice. In the present work,
we study the impact of disorder on point-defect formation energies in (U,Pu)O_2
using interatomic-potential and Density Functional Theory (DFT+U) calculations.
We focus on bound Schottky defects (BSD) that are among the most stable defects
in these oxides. As a first step, we estimate the distance R_D around the BSD
up to which the local chemical environment significantly affects their
formation energy. To this end, we propose an original procedure in which the
formation energy is computed for several supercells at varying levels of
disorder. We conclude that the first three cation shells around the BSD have a
non-negligible influence on their formation energy (R_{D} = 7.0 \{AA}). We
apply then a systematic approach to compute the BSD formation energies for all
the possible cation configurations on the first and second nearest neighbor
shells around the BSD. We show that the formation energy can range in an
interval of 0.97 eV, depending on the relative amount of U and Pu neighboring
cations. Based on these results, we propose an interaction model that describes
the effect of nominal and local composition on the BSD formation energy.
Finally, the DFT+U benchmark calculations show a satisfactory agreement for
configurations characterized by a U-rich local environment, and a larger
mismatch in the case of a Pu-rich one. In summary, this work provides valuable
insights on the properties of BSD defects in (U,Pu)O_2, and can represent a
valid strategy to study point defect properties in disordered compounds.

scaling regimes with signatures of chaos at large scales and an apparently
random behavior at small scales. These features are usually investigated
quantitatively by studying the properties of the underlying attractor, the
compact object asymptotically hosting the trajectories of the system with their
invariant density in the phase-space. This multi-scale nature of natural
systems makes it practically impossible to get a clear picture of the
attracting set as it spans over a wide range of spatial scales and may even
change in time due to non-stationary forcing. Here we combine an adaptive
decomposition method with extreme value theory to study the properties of the
instantaneous scale-dependent dimension, which has been recently introduced to
characterize such temporal and spatial scale-dependent attractors in turbulence
and astrophysics. To provide a quantitative analysis of the properties of this
metric, we test it on the well-known low-dimensional deterministic Lorenz-63
system perturbed with additive or multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that the
properties of the invariant set depend on the scale we are focusing on and that
the scale-dependent dimensions can discriminate between additive and
multiplicative noise, despite the fact that the two cases exhibit very similar
stochastic attractors at large scales. The proposed formalism can be generally
helpful to investigate the role of multi-scale fluctuations within complex
systems, allowing us to deal with the problem of characterizing the role of
stochastic fluctuations across a wide range of physical systems.

category symmetry $\mathrm{SRep}(\mathcal{H}^u)$, which is the supercategory of
super representations of a weak Hopf superalgebra $\mathcal{H}^u$. The weak
Hopf superalgebra $\mathcal{H}^u$ depends not only on $H$ but also on a choice
of a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$ that is used
for the fermionization. We derive a general formula for $\mathcal{H}^u$ by
explicitly constructing fermionic TQFTs with $\mathrm{SRep}(\mathcal{H}^u)$
symmetry. We also construct lattice Hamiltonians of fermionic gapped phases
when the symmetry is non-anomalous. As concrete examples, we compute the
fermionization of finite group symmetries, the symmetries of finite gauge
theories, and duality symmetries. We find that the fermionization of duality
symmetries depends crucially on $F$-symbols of the original fusion categories.

(e.g., Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Ceph) have gained momentum for their
relatively low per-GB costs and high availability. However, as increasingly
more sensitive data is being accrued, the need to natively integrate privacy
controls into the storage is growing in relevance. Today, due to the poor
object storage interface, privacy controls are enforced by data curators with
full access to data in the clear. This motivates the need for a new approach to
data privacy that can provide strong assurance and control to data owners. To
fulfill this need, this paper presents EGEON, a novel software-defined data
protection framework for object storage. EGEON enables users to declaratively
set privacy policies on how their data can be shared. In the privacy policies,
the users can build complex data protection services through the composition of
data transformations, which are invoked inline by EGEON upon a read request. As
a result, data owners can trivially display multiple views from the same data
piece, and modify these views by only updating the policies. And all without
restructuring the internals of the underlying object storage system. The EGEON
prototype has been built atop OpenStack Swift. Evaluation results shows promise
in developing data protection services with little overhead directly into the
object store. Further, depending on the amount of data filtered out in the
transformed views, end-to-end latency can be low due to the savings in network
communication.

bands with multi-GHz of available spectrum. However, operation at mmWave bands
raises two challenges: high penetration loss and susceptibility to objects
blocking the line-of-sight. As a remedy, transmitters point their antennas to
their receivers using beamforming to contain the signal in the direction of the
intended receiver. To avoid loss of connectivity due to blockers or other
factors such as rain, users can be connected to multiple base stations (BS).
While these two features, beamforming and multi-connectivity, can mitigate the
challenges of mmWave bands, it is not trivial to find the optimal user
association which can maintain the minimum rate requirements of the users. In
this paper, we first formulate a throughput-maximizing user association scheme
considering beamforming and multi-connectivity, and investigate the behavior of
the optimal scheme to devise a simple, yet efficient heuristic that does not
require global network information. Our proposal, dubbed beam-align, which only
uses local information at a BS, performs close to the optimal in terms of
per-user capacity and user satisfaction levels and has only polynomial
complexity. Our numerical analysis shows that beam-align outperforms the
frequently-used association schemes based on SNR. To investigate the
performance of beam-align also under various challenging settings, we consider
three scenarios: presence of blockers, different levels of rain intensity, and
presence of clustered users. From simulations, we observe that beam-align is
robust against different conditions, as it maintains a stable performance under
the studied scenarios.

grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to
precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of ``affiliation'' between the
ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration
between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive
interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a
normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is
better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps
the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained
visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our

of healthcare providers, in particular hospitals. Established approaches to the
design of such indicators are subject to distortions due to indirect
standardization and high variance of estimators. Indicators for geographical
regions are rarely considered.
  Objectives: To develop and evaluate a methodology of Multilevel Quality
Indicators (MQI) for both healthcare providers and geographical regions.
  Research Design: We formally derived MQI from a statistical multilevel model,
which may include characteristics of patients, providers, and regions. We used
Monte Carlo simulation to assess the performance of MQI relative to established
approaches based on the standardized mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR) and the
risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR).
  Measures: Rank correlation between true provider/region effects and quality
indicator estimates; shares of the 10% best and 10% worst providers identified
by the quality indicators.
  Results: The proposed MQI are 1) standardized hospital outcome rate (SHOR),
2) regional SHOR (RSHOR), and 3) regional standardized patient outcome rate
(RSPOR). Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the SHOR provides substantially
better estimates of provider performance than the SMR and RSMR in almost all
scenarios. RSPOR was slightly more stable than the regional SMR. We also found
that modeling of regional characteristics generally improves the adequacy of
provider-level estimates.
  Conclusions: MQI methodology facilitates adequate and efficient estimation of

Our contributions are as follows: (i) We propose a Spinal Context Transformer
(SCT), a deep-learning architecture suited for the analysis of repeated
anatomical structures in medical imaging such as vertebral bodies (VBs). Unlike
previous related methods, SCT considers all VBs as viewed in all available
image modalities together, making predictions for each based on context from
the rest of the spinal column and all available imaging modalities. (ii) We
apply the architecture to a novel and important task: detecting spinal
metastases and the related conditions of cord compression and vertebral
fractures/collapse from multi-series spinal MR scans. This is done using
annotations extracted from free-text radiological reports as opposed to bespoke
annotation. However, the resulting model shows strong agreement with
vertebral-level bespoke radiologist annotations on the test set. (iii) We also
apply SCT to an existing problem: radiological grading of inter-vertebral discs
(IVDs) in lumbar MR scans for common degenerative changes.We show that by
considering the context of vertebral bodies in the image, SCT improves the
accuracy for several gradings compared to previously published model.

measurements performed under almost ideal hydrostatic-pressure conditions yield
that the phase transition to zigzag-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N$ = 7.3
K can be rapidly suppressed to about 6.1 K. A further suppression with
increasing pressure is impeded due to the occurrence of a pressure-induced
structural transition at $p \geq$ 104 MPa, accompanied by a strong dimerization
of Ru-Ru bonds, which gives rise to a collapse of the magnetic susceptibility.
Whereas the dimerization transition is strongly first order, as reflected by
large discontinuous changes in $\chi$ and pronounced hysteresis effects, the
magnetic transition under varying pressure and magnetic field also reveals
indications for a weakly first-order transition. We assign this observation to
a strong magnetoelastic coupling in this system. Measurements of $\chi$ under
varying pressure in the paramagnetic regime ($T > T_N$) and before dimerization
($p <$ 100 MPa) reveal a considerable increase of $\chi$ with pressure. These
experimental observations are consistent with the results of ab-initio Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on the pressure-dependent structure and
the corresponding pressure-dependent magnetic model. Comparative susceptibility

contained in quantum states. Typically, different entanglement measures do not
have to be partially ordered. The presence of a definite partial order between
two entanglement measures for all quantum states, however, allows for
meaningful conceptualization of sensitivity to entanglement, which will be
greater for the entanglement measure that produces the larger numerical values.
Here, we have investigated the partial order between the normalized versions of
four entanglement measures based on Schmidt decomposition of bipartite pure
quantum states, namely, concurrence, tangle, entanglement robustness and
Schmidt number. We have shown that among those four measures, the concurrence
and the Schmidt number have the highest and the lowest sensitivity to quantum
entanglement, respectively. Further, we have demonstrated how these measures
could be used to track the dynamics of quantum entanglement in a simple quantum
toy model composed of two qutrits. Lastly, we have employed state-dependent
entanglement statistics to compute measurable correlations between the outcomes
of quantum observables in agreement with the uncertainty principle. The
presented results could be helpful in quantum applications that require
monitoring of the available quantum resources for sharp identification of
temporal points of maximal entanglement or system separability.

employed in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of
accretion onto black holes. To counter this, we have developed a
self-consistent approach to study magnetised and radiatively cooled
two-temperature accretion flows around a Kerr black hole in two spatial
dimensions. The approach includes several heating processes, radiative cooling,
and a coupling between the electrons and the ions via Coulomb interaction. We
test our approach by performing axisymmetric GRMHD simulations of magnetised
tori accreting onto a Kerr black hole under various astrophysical scenarios. In
this way, we find that the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction and the
radiative cooling impacts the thermodynamical properties of both the ions and
electrons, changing significantly the temperature distribution of the latter,
and underlining the importance of a two-temperature approach when imaging these
flows. In addition, we find that the accretion rate influences the bulk
properties of the flow as well as the thermodynamics of the electrons and ions.
Interestingly, we observe qualitatively distinct temperature properties for
SANE and MAD accretion modes while maintaining the same accretion rates, which
could help distinguishing MAD and SANE accretion flows via observations.
Finally, we propose two new relations for the temperature ratios of the
electrons, ions, and of the gas in terms of the plasma-$\beta$ parameter. The
new relations represent a simple and effective approach to treat
two-temperature accretion flows on supermassive black holes such as Sgr A* and

that the AGN radiation preferably escapes through the ionization cone. We find
enhanced velocity dispersions ($\sim 100\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$) traced by the
H$\alpha$ emission line in localized zones within the ionization cones.
Interpreting these kinematic features as signatures of interaction between an
AGN-driven ionized gas outflow and the host galaxy interstellar medium, we
derive mass outflow rates of $\sim 0.008-1.6\, M_\odot \,$yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic
injection rates of $\sim 10^{39}-10^{42} \,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, which yield
extremely low coupling efficiencies of $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. These findings add
to the growing body of recent observational evidence that AGN feedback is
highly ineffective in the host galaxies of nearby AGNs.

investigates a group of agents working concurrently to solve similar

improve regret. Hence, we note that it is essential to decide when to

Jordanova (2018) considered a model where a shock event contributes to the
total claim amount with one and the same value of the claim sizes to different
types of polices. Jordanova and Veleva (2021) went a step closer to real-life
situations and allowed a shock event to cause different claim sizes to
different types of polices. In that paper, the counting process is assumed to
be Multinomial. Here it is replaced with different independent homogeneous
Poison processes. The bivariate claim counting process is expressed in two
different ways. Its marginals and conditional distributions are totally
described. The mean square regression of these processes is computed. The
Laplace-Stieltjes transforms and numerical characteristics of the total claim
amount processes are obtained. The risk reserve process and the probabilities
of ruin in infinite time are discussed. The risk reserve just before the ruin
and the deficit (or the severity) at ruin are thoroughly investigated in the
case when the initial capital is zero. Their means, probability mass functions,
and probability generating functions are obtained.
  Although the model is constructed by a multivariate counting process, along
the paper it is shown that the total claim amount process is stochastically
equivalent to a univariate compound Poisson process. These allow us to reduce
the considered risk model to a Cramer-Lundberg risk model, to use the
corresponding results, and to make the conclusions for the new model. Analogous
results can be obtained for more types of polices and more types of shock
events.
  The results are applied in case when the claim sizes are exponentially
distributed.
  Stochastically equivalent models could be analogously constructed in queuing
theory.

backscatter devices (BDs) reuse not only the spectrum but also the power of the
active primary users to transmit their own information. In return, the primary
communication links can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the

due to the severe double-fading attenuation of the passive backscattering
links, the enhancement of the primary link provided by one single BD is
extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic

is widely recognized among the research community to consolidate acquired

replication to understand the evolution of the experimental validity across a
family of studies. Unfortunately, the lack of proposals undermines these
objectives.
  Objective. The main goal of our work is to provide researchers in CS, and in
other areas of research, with a systematic, tool-supported approach for the
reporting of changes in the replications of their empirical studies.
  Method: Applying DSR, we have developed and validated a composite artifact
consisting of (i) a metamodel of the relevant concepts of replications and
their changes; (ii) templates and linguistic patterns for reporting those
concepts; and (iii) a proof-of-concept model-based software tool that supports
the proposed approach. For its validation, we have carried out a multiple case
study including 9 families of empirical studies from CS and Agrobiology. The 9
families encompass 23 replication studies and 92 replication changes, for which
we have analyzed the suitability of our proposal.
  Results: The multiple case study revealed some initial limitations of our
approach related to threats to experimental validity or context variables.
After several improvement iterations, all the 92 replication changes could be
properly specified, including also their qualitatively estimated effects on
experimental validity across the family of experiments and its corresponding
visualization.
  Conclusions: Our proposal for the specification of replication changes seems
to fit the needs not only of replications in CS, but also in other research
areas. Nevertheless, further research is needed to improve it and to
disseminate its use among the research community.

deuterium abundance becomes smaller as the electron mass at the BBN time

Neural Networks'' [Nat Mach Intell 4 (2022) 367] introduces a physics-inspired
unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) to solve combinatorial optimization
problems on sparse graphs. To test the performances of these GNNs, the authors
of the work show numerical results for two fundamental problems: maximum cut
and maximum independent set (MIS). They conclude that ""the graph neural network
optimizer performs on par or outperforms existing solvers, with the ability to
scale beyond the state of the art to problems with millions of variables.""
  In this comment, we show that a simple greedy algorithm, running in almost
linear time, can find solutions for the MIS problem of much better quality than
the GNN. The greedy algorithm is faster by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to
the GNN for problems with a million variables. We do not see any good reason
for solving the MIS with these GNN, as well as for using a sledgehammer to
crack nuts.
  In general, many claims of superiority of neural networks in solving
combinatorial problems are at risk of being not solid enough, since we lack
standard benchmarks based on really hard problems. We propose one of such hard
benchmarks, and we hope to see future neural network optimizers tested on these
problems before any claim of superiority is made.

visualization of a STC based on a user-driven projection of the spatial and

also encode additional numerical and categorical data. Additionally, we propose
a set of tools allowing the user to filter and manipulate the 3D STC which
benefits from the visualization, exploration and interaction possibilities
offered by VR. Finally, we evaluated the proposed visualization method in the
context of the visualization of spatio-temporal biological data. Several
biology experts accompanied the application design to provide insight on how
the STC visualization could be used to explore such data. We report a user

of, against, or neutral to a given target. The main challenge of this task
comes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and the
lack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus on
solving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing
noisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this
paper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to
introduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide
essential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning
via prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection
task, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of
mapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a
vector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the
stance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing
with varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill
the information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the
superior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot
scenarios.

$h_{3}$ and V/$\sigma$ (using the $\xi_{3}$ parameter), and the kinematic
misalignment angle between the photometric and kinematic position angles (using
the $\Psi$ parameter), and note clear differences between these parameter
distributions of the fast and slow rotating BGEs. We find that all 10 of our

consistent with an oblate galaxy shape, whereas the slow rotators are spread
over all three classes: oblate (1/8), triaxial (4/8), and prolate (3/8). We
place the results into context using known radio properties, X-ray properties,

from observations for the fast-rotating BGEs, indicating that they experienced
gas-rich mergers or interactions, and these are very likely the origin of the

to assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical
studies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative
traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimum phenotype, whose
value is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population
fate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the
moving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the
system of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their
interactions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative
measures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from
the entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its
shape.We investigate two different models of reproduction (asexual and
infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with general forms of selection.In
particular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away
from the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse
of the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our
unified framework furthermore allows highlighting the underlying mechanisms
that lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities
and discrepancies between the two reproduction models, the latter being
ultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the
phenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population
crucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the sexual
infinitesimal model, in contrast with the asexual model.In the asexual model,
we also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels
with higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness,
especially in fast changing environments.

approach to deal with mixed-integer recourse (MIR) models under distributional

techniques are generally computationally extremely challenging when integer
decision variables are involved. That is why we propose a fundamentally
different approach for MIR models under distributional uncertainty aimed at
obtaining models with improved computational tractability. For the special case
of simple integer recourse (SIR) models, we show that tractable models can be
obtained by pragmatically selecting the uncertainty set. Here, we consider
uncertainty sets based on the Wasserstein distance and also on generalized
moment conditions. We compare our approach with standard DRO and discuss
potential generalizations of our ideas to more general MIR models. An important
side-result of our analysis is the derivation of performance guarantees for
convex approximations of SIR models. In contrast with the literature, these
error bounds are not only valid for continuous distribution, but hold for any

knowledge to bridge within- and cross-domain items for CDR. Then we propose a
new framework, KG-aware Neural Collective Matrix Factorization (KG-NeuCMF),
leveraging KG to enrich item representations. It first learns item embeddings
by graph convolutional autoencoder to capture both domain-specific and
domain-general knowledge from adjacent and higher-order neighbours in the KG.
Then, we maximize the mutual information between item embeddings learned from
the KG and user-item matrix to establish cross-domain relationships for better

  Detection",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, which imposes heavy
negative impacts on one's daily life. Diagnosing depression based on the
interview is usually in the form of questions and answers. In this process, the
audio signals and their text transcripts of a subject are correlated to
depression cues and easily recorded. Therefore, it is feasible to build an
Automatic Depression Detection (ADD) model based on the data of these
modalities in practice. However, there are two major challenges that should be
addressed for constructing an effective ADD model. The first challenge is the
organization of the textual and audio data, which can be of various contents
and lengths for different subjects. The second challenge is the lack of
training samples due to the privacy concern. Targeting to these two challenges,
we propose the TOpic ATtentive transformer-based ADD model, abbreviated as
TOAT. To address the first challenge, in the TOAT model, topic is taken as the
basic unit of the textual and audio data according to the question-answer form
in a typical interviewing process. Based on that, a topic attention module is
designed to learn the importance of of each topic, which helps the model better
retrieve the depressed samples. To solve the issue of data scarcity, we
introduce large pre-trained models, and the fine-tuning strategy is adopted
based on the small-scale ADD training data. We also design a two-branch
architecture with a late-fusion strategy for building the TOAT model, in which
the textual and audio data are encoded independently. We evaluate our model on
the multimodal DAIC-WOZ dataset specifically designed for the ADD task.
Experimental results show the superiority of our method. More importantly, the
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in the TOAT
model.

time, are macroscopic observables which provide important dynamical information
on the underlying microscopic stochastic process. A direct estimation using
simulations of microscopic trajectories over long time scales is typically
computationally intractable in metastable situations. To overcome this issue,
several numerical methods rely on a potential-theoretic identity, sometimes
attributed to Hill in the computational statistical physics litterature, which
expresses statistics of transitions in terms of the invariant measure of the
sequence of configurations by which the underlying process enters metastable
sets. The use of this identity then allows to replace the long time simulation
problem with a rare event sampling problem, for which efficient algorithms are
available. In this article, we rigorously analyse such a method for molecular
systems modelled by the Langevin dynamics. Our main contributions are twofold.
First, we prove the Hill relation in the fairly general context of positive
Harris recurrent chains, and show that this formula applies to the Langevin
dynamics. Second, we provide an explicit expression of the invariant measure
involved in the Hill relation, and describe an elementary exact simulation
procedure. Overall, this yields a simple and complete numerical method to
estimate statistics of transitions.

modified exciton dynamics. Previously, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been
derived to describe the excited states of molecules coupled to surface plasmons
(i.e. plexcitons), and these operators have been successfully used in the
description of linear and third order optical response. In this article, we
rigorously derive non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the response function formalism
of nonlinear spectroscopy by means of Feshbach operators, and apply them to
explore spectroscopic signatures of plexcitons. In particular we analyze the
optical response below and above the exceptional point that arises for matching
transition energies for plasmon and molecular components, and study their
decomposition using double-sided Feynman diagrams. We find a clear distinction
between interference and Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy, and a
qualitative change in the symmetry of the lineshape of the nonlinear signal
when crossing the exceptional. This change corresponds to one in the symmetry
of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Our work presents an approach for
simulating the optical response of sublevels within an electronic system, and
opens new applications of nonlinear spectroscopy to examine the different

synthesis (SHS) using the raw powder mixture at the atomic ratio of
1Mo/1.3Al/1B. The reaction mechanism in SHS process was obtained by analyzing
the corresponding composition changes of starting materials. Furthermore, the
thermodynamic prediction for the SHS reaction of Mo + (1+y)Al + B = MoAlB + yAl
is consistent with the present experiments, where the preparation of MoAlB also
conforms to two common self-propagating conditions of SHS. Enthalpy vs

give qualities of telecommunications speech (e.g., noisiness, intelligibility,

evaluate. Our initial WAWEnet publication introduced four WAWEnets and each
emulated the output of an established full-reference speech quality or
intelligibility estimation algorithm.
  We have updated the WAWEnet architecture to be more efficient and effective.
Here we present a single WAWEnet that closely tracks seven different quality

four subjective speech quality dimensions. We offer a third network that
focuses on just subjective quality scores and achieves very high levels of

recompute here the first three heat kernel coefficients in perturbative quantum

renormalize the one-loop effective action in four dimensions. They may be
evaluated at arbitrary dimensions $D$, in which case they identify only a
subset of the divergences appearing in the effective action for $D\geq 6$.
Generically, these coefficients depend on the gauge-fixing choice adopted in
quantizing the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, they become gauge-invariant
once evaluated on-shell, i.e. using Einstein's field equations with
cosmological constant. We identify them and use them as a benchmark for
checking alternative approaches to perturbative quantum gravity. One such
approach describes the graviton in first-quantization through the use of the
action of the ${\cal N}=4$ spinning particle, characterized by four
supersymmetries on the worldline and a set of worldline gauge invariances. This
description has been used for computing the gauge-invariant coefficients as
well. We verify their correctness at $D=4$, but find a mismatch at arbitrary
$D$ when comparing with the benchmark fixed earlier. We interpret this result
as signaling that the path integral quantization of the ${\cal N}=4$ spinning
particle should be amended. We perform this task by fixing the correct
counterterm that must be used in the worldline path integral quantization of
the ${\cal N}=4$ spinning particle to make it consistent in arbitrary

Lipschitz constant of the Lipschitz continuous gradient. Meanwhile, numerical
evaluations of Adam and its variants have clarified that using small constant
learning rates without depending on the Lipschitz constant and hyperparameters

to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The main contribution is to show
theoretical evidence that Adam using small learning rates and hyperparameters

over multiple sensors into a compact, yet rich, collection of latent
representations. These latent representations, after being processed by a
series of self-attention blocks, are then reprojected with a second
cross-attention in the BEV space. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the
best previous works using transformers on nuScenes. The code and trained models

imaging to statistically analyze temporal dynamics or capture disease
progression. Although deep-learning-based generative models for natural images
have been extensively studied, approaches for temporal medical image generation
such as 4D cardiac volume data are limited. In this work, we present a novel
deep learning model that generates intermediate temporal volumes between source
and target volumes. Specifically, we propose a diffusion deformable model (DDM)
by adapting the denoising diffusion probabilistic model that has recently been
widely investigated for realistic image generation. Our proposed DDM is
composed of the diffusion and the deformation modules so that DDM can learn
spatial deformation information between the source and target volumes and
provide a latent code for generating intermediate frames along a geodesic path.
Once our model is trained, the latent code estimated from the diffusion module
is simply interpolated and fed into the deformation module, which enables DDM
to generate temporal frames along the continuous trajectory while preserving
the topology of the source image. We demonstrate the proposed method with the
4D cardiac MR image generation between the diastolic and systolic phases for
each subject. Compared to the existing deformation methods, our DDM achieves
high performance on temporal volume generation.

Varying the energy of the incident beam instead of rocking the sample and

properties, such as refractive index and grain size often need to be known.
They can be constrained both ex-situ, e.g., by microscopy, and in-situ by
polarimetry, i.e., analyzing the polarization state of scattered light.
Polarimetry has the advantage of temporal resolution and real-time measurement,
but the analysis is often limited by the assumption of single scattering and
thus optically thin dust clouds. This limits the investigation of the growth
process typically to grain sizes smaller than about 200 nm. Using 3D polarized
radiative transfer simulations, however, it is possible to consider multiple
scattering and to analyze the properties of dense particle clouds.
  We study the impact of various properties of dust clouds on the scattering
polarization, namely the optical depth of the cloud, the spatial density
distribution of the particles, their refractive index as well as the particle
size dispersion. We find that ambiguities can occur regarding optical depth and
spatial density distribution as well as regarding refractive index and particle
size dispersion. Determining the refractive index correctly is especially
important as it has a strong impact on the derived particle sizes. With this
knowledge, we are able to design an in-situ diagnostics strategy for the
investigation of the particle growth process based on radiative transfer
simulations which are used to model the polarization over the whole growth
process. The application of this strategy allows us for the first time to
analyze the polarization measured during a growth experiment in a reactive
argon-acetylene plasma for particle radii up to 280 nm.

secure communication in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system.
A multi-antenna dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) base station (BS)
serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users and senses for targets
simultaneously, where already identified targets are treated as potential
single-antenna eavesdroppers. The DFRC BS scans a sector with a sequence of
dedicated beams, and the ISAC system takes a snapshot of the environment during
the transmission of each beam. Based on the sensing information, the DFRC BS
can acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers.
Different from existing works that focused on the resource allocation design
for a single snapshot, in this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework
that jointly optimizes the communication and sensing resources over a sequence
of snapshots with adjustable durations. To this end, we jointly optimize the
duration of each snapshot, the beamforming vector, and the covariance matrix of
the AN for maximization of the system sum secrecy rate over a sequence of
snapshots while guaranteeing a minimum required average achievable rate and a
maximum information leakage constraint for each legitimate user. The resource
allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem,
where we account for the imperfect CSI of both the legitimate users and the
potential eavesdroppers. To make the problem tractable, we derive a bound for
the uncertainty region of the potential eavesdroppers' small-scale fading based
on a safe approximation, which facilitates the development of a block
coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm for obtaining an efficient
suboptimal solution.

that spatial filtering can be used to complement the tempo-spectral processing.
In a traditional setting, linear spatial filtering (beamforming) and
single-channel post-filtering are commonly performed separately. In contrast,
there is a trend towards employing deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a joint
spatial and tempo-spectral non-linear filter, which means that the restriction
of a linear processing model and that of a separate processing of spatial and
tempo-spectral information can potentially be overcome. However, the internal
mechanisms that lead to good performance of such data-driven filters for
multi-channel speech enhancement are not well understood. Therefore, in this
work, we analyse the properties of a non-linear spatial filter realized by a
DNN as well as its interdependency with temporal and spectral processing by
carefully controlling the information sources (spatial, spectral, and temporal)
available to the network. We confirm the superiority of a non-linear spatial
processing model, which outperforms an oracle linear spatial filter in a
challenging speaker extraction scenario for a low number of microphones by 0.24
POLQA score. Our analyses reveal that in particular spectral information should
be processed jointly with spatial information as this increases the spatial
selectivity of the filter. Our systematic evaluation then leads to a simple
network architecture, that outperforms state-of-the-art network architectures

ability to dynamically control thermal infrared radiation. Although previous
studies were mainly focused on the metasurfaces with infinite unit cells, the
finite-size effect can be a critical design factor for developing thermal
metasurfaces with fast response and broad temperature uniformity in practice.
Here, we study the thermal metasurfaces consisting of gold nanorods with a
finite array size, which, with only several periods, can achieve a resonance
close to that of the infinite case. More importantly, such a small footprint
due to the finite array size results in the response time down to a nanosecond
level. Furthermore, the number of the unit cells in the direction perpendicular
to the axis of the nanorods is found to be insensitive to the resonance and
response time, thus providing a tunability in aspect ratio that can boost the
temperature uniformity in the sub-Kelvin level.

using an effective two-body cluster approach. The renormalization of the theory
for the relevant amplitudes is assessed in a cutoff-regulator range between

  Most remarkably, we find a cutoff-stable/RG-invariant resonance in the $^4$H

shallow two-body state and the introduction of a three-body $s$-wave scale set

consequence for the powercounting of the pionless theory. Specifically, it
suggests the appearance of similar resonant states also in larger nuclei, like
16-oxygen, in which the theory's leading order does not predict stable states.
Those resonances would provide a starting state to be moved to the correct
physical position by the perturbative insertion of sub-leading orders, possibly
resolving the discrepancy between data and contact EFT.

imaginary time, is used to model thermal systems. In this work, it is taken a
step further to systems with spatial thermal variation, by developing an
equivalence between the spatial variation of temperature in a thermal bath and
the curvature of the Euclidean space. The variation in temperature is recast as
a variation in the metric, leading to a curved Euclidean space. The equivalence
is substantiated by analyzing the Polyakov loop, the partition function and the
periodicity of the correlation function. The bulk thermodynamic properties like
the energy, entropy and the Helmholtz free energy are calculated from the
partition function, for small metric perturbations, for a neutral scalar field.
The Dirac equation for an external Dirac spinor, traversing in a thermal bath
with spatial thermal gradients, is solved in the curved Euclidean space. The
fundamental behavior exhibited by the Dirac spinor eigenstate, may provide a
possible mechanism to validate the theory, at a more basal level, than
examining only bulk thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, in order to verify
the equivalence at the level of classical mechanics, the geodesic equation is
analyzed in a classical backdrop. The mathematical apparatus is borrowed from
the physics of quantum theory in a gravity-induced space-time curvature. As
spatial thermal variations are obtainable at QCD or QED energies, it may be
feasible for the proposed formulation to be validated experimentally.

range indeed reside in galactic dark matter halos, they must necessarily
collide with galactic neutron stars (NSs). These collisions must, again
necessarily, form light black holes (LBHs) with masses of typical NSs, $M_{\rm
LBH} \approx \,1-2\,M_{\odot}$. LBHs may be behind events already detected by
ground-based gravitational-wave detectors (GW170817, GW190425, and others such
as a mixed stellar black hole-neutron star mass event GW191219_163120), and
most recently by microlensing (OGLE-BLG-2011-0462). Although the status of
these observations as containing LBHs is not confirmed, there is no question
that gravitational-wave detectors and microlensing are in principle and in
practice capable of detecting LBHs. We have calculated the creation rate of
LBHs resulting from these light primordial black hole collisions with neutron
stars. On this basis, we claim that if improved gravitational-wave detectors
and microlensing statistics of the LBH events would indicate that the number of
LBHs is significantly lower that what follows from the calculated creation
rate, then this would be an unambiguous proof that there is no significant
light PBH contribution to the galactic dark matter halos. Otherwise, if
observed and calculated numbers of LBHs roughly agree, then the hypothesis of
primordial black hole existence gets strong observational support, and in
addition their collisions with neutron stars may be considered a natural
creation channel for the LBHs, solving the problem of their origin, as it is
known that they cannot be a product of standard stellar evolution.

  Reservoir Computing","CoLLAs 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine learning recently proved efficient in learning differential equations
and dynamical systems from data. However, the data is commonly assumed to
originate from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling
real-world dynamical processes, the data distribution often shifts due to
changes in the underlying system dynamics. Continual learning of these
processes aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt system changes without forgetting
previous dynamical regimes. This work proposes an approach to continual
learning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art method for training
recurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems.
Reservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot be
forgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose
to train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by
neuroscience's predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate,
laterally inhibiting and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting
induced by interfering parameter updates. We show that this multi-head
reservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic forgetting on several
dynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the chaotic Lorenz
attractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our results
suggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for the
continual learning of dynamical systems. We provide our code for data

integrable models by combining the single-site crystals into crystal chains by
a coproduct of the algebra, which we determine by a combination of
representation-theoretical and gauge-theoretical arguments. For non-chiral

with the vacuum equation of the quiver gauge theory, thus confirming the
corresponding Gauge/Bethe correspondence. For more general chiral quivers,
however, we find obstructions to the $R$-matrices satisfying the Yang-Baxter

recognized to be powerful tools for virtual drug screening. The recently
reported ML- or DL-based scoring functions have shown exciting performance in
predicting protein-ligand binding affinities with fruitful application
prospects. However, the differentiation between highly similar ligand
conformations, including the native binding pose (the global energy minimum
state), remains challenging which could greatly enhance the docking. In this
work, we propose a fully differentiable framework for ligand pose optimization
based on a hybrid scoring function (SF) combined with a multi-layer perceptron
(DeepRMSD) and the traditional AutoDock Vina SF. The DeepRMSD+Vina, which
combines (1) the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the docking pose with
respect to the native pose and (2) the AutoDock Vina score, is fully
differentiable thus is capable of optimizing the ligand binding pose to the
energy-lowest conformation. Evaluated by the CASF-2016 docking power dataset,
the DeepRMSD+Vina reaches a success rate of 95.4%, which is by far the best
reported SF to date. Based on this SF, an end-to-end ligand pose optimization
framework was implemented to improve the docking pose quality. We demonstrated
that this method significantly improves the docking success rate (by 15%) in
redocking and crossdocking tasks, revealing the high potentialities of this
framework in drug design and discovery.

replaces convolving Gaussian Processes with a distance-preserving affine
operator on distributions. Our experiments on brain tissue-segmentation show
that the resulting architecture approaches the performance of well-established
deterministic segmentation algorithms (U-Net), which has not been achieved with
previous hierarchical Gaussian Processes. Moreover, by applying the same
segmentation model to out-of-distribution data (i.e., images with pathology
such as brain tumors), we show that our uncertainty estimates result in
out-of-distribution detection that outperforms the capabilities of previous
Bayesian networks and reconstruction-based approaches that learn normative

this work, we present a generic approach to tackle the problem of malicious
account takeovers, even in the presence of malware. To this end, we define a
new paradigm to improve two-factor authentication that involves the concepts of
one-out-of-two security and transaction authentication. Web authentication
schemes following this paradigm can protect security-critical transactions
against manipulation, even if one of the factors is completely compromised.
Analyzing existing authentication schemes, we find that they do not realize
one-out-of-two security. We give a blueprint of how to design secure web
authentication schemes in general. Based on this blueprint we propose FIDO2
With Two Displays (FIDO2D), a new web authentication scheme based on the FIDO2
standard and prove its security using Tamarin. We hope that our work inspires a
new wave of more secure web authentication schemes, which protect
security-critical transactions even against attacks with malware.

The widespread use of Hawkes process in different fields calls for fast,

offer a technique to perform approximate Bayesian inference of Hawkes process
parameters based on the use of the R-package \inlabru. The \inlabru R-package,
in turn, relies on the INLA methodology to approximate the posterior of the
parameters. Our Hawkes process approximation is based on a decomposition of the
log-likelihood in three parts, which are linearly approximated separately. The
linear approximation is performed with respect to the mode of the parameters'
posterior distribution, which is determined with an iterative gradient-based
method. The approximation of the posterior parameters is therefore
deterministic, ensuring full reproducibility of the results. The proposed
technique only requires the user to provide the functions to calculate the
different parts of the decomposed likelihood, which are internally linearly
approximated by the R-package \inlabru. We provide a comparison with the

scaling for the growth of the mixing region, which was observed in recent
two-dimensional simulations. To this purpose, we use a Hele-Shaw cell. The flow
configuration consists of a heavy fluid layer overlying a lighter fluid layer,
initially separated by a horizontal, flat interface. When small perturbations
of concentration and velocity fields occur at the interface, convective mixing
is eventually produced: Perturbations grow and evolve into large finger-like
convective structures that control the transition from the initial
diffusion-dominated phase of the flow to the subsequent convection-dominated
phase. As the flow evolves, diffusion acts to reduce local concentration
gradients across the interface of the fingers. When the gradients become
sufficiently small, the system attains a stably-stratified state and diffusion
is again the dominant mixing mechanisms. We employ an optical method to obtain
high-resolution measurements of the density fields and we perform experiments
for values of the Rayleigh-Darcy number (i.e., the ratio between convection and
diffusion) sufficiently large to exhibit all the flow phases just described,

half-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC$_{50}$). Both the
amplitude and the EC$_{50}$ are key quantities commonly used in
pharmaco-dynamic modelling, yet a comprehensive mathematical investigation of
the behaviour of these two metrics is still outstanding; for a large (and

This is done by implementing one centralized and two decentralized continuous

more with early convergence than the other approaches. Our findings indicate
that duplicated decentralized networks are beneficial when evolving both the

algorithms involve singular value decomposition (SVD) at each iteration, which
renders their applicability challenging in the case of massive data. In this
paper, we propose a multilevel approach for the solution of PCP and CPCP

novel expressions for practical air-to-ground and ground-to-air channels, while
taking into account the practical implementation of imperfect successive

magnetic field behavior is found to be sophisticated: while the first-harmonic
response shows the known anomalous Hall hysteresis in FGT, the second-harmonic
Hall voltage is characterized by the pronounced high-field hysteresis and flat
($B$-independent) region with curves touching at low fields. The high-field
hysteresis strongly depends on the magnetic field sweep rate, so it reflects
some slow relaxation process. For the lowest rates, it is also accomplished by
multiple crossing points. Similar shape of the second-harmonic hysteresis is
known for skyrmion spin textures in non-linear optics. Since skyrmions have

is not that easy to grasp. According to some researchers, many existing systems
do involve the notion of action, but in an obscure way. In Unified Modeling
Language (UML), an action is a single atomic step within an activity, i.e., it
is not further decomposed within the activity. Activity represents a behavior
that is composed of actions. This paper contributes to the establishment of a
broader interdisciplinary understanding of the notion of action in conceptual
modeling based on a model called the thinging machine (TM). The TM uses only
five primitive actions: create, process, release, transfer, and receive. The
goal of such a venture is to improve the process of developing conceptual
models by refining basic concepts such as action and event. To demonstrate how
TM modeling represents actions, UML activity and Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) diagrams are re-modeled in terms of the five TM actions. The
results reveal the viability of the TM s five actions in modeling and relate

lower than predicted from MW dust models heated by stronger radiation fields.
Regions with higher I(250um)/I(500um) are preferentially closer to the galactic
center and have a higher overall (stellar+gas) surface density and molecular
fraction. The results do not depend strongly on the adopted CO-to-molecular
conversion factor and do not appear to be affected by the mixing of heating
conditions. Conclusions: Our results confirm the validity of MW dust models at
low density, but are at odds with predictions for grain evolution in higher
density environments. If the lower-than-expected emissivity at high
I(250um)/I(500um) is the result of intrinsic variations in the dust properties,
it would imply an underestimation of the dust mass surface density of up to a
factor ~2 when using current dust models.

Deep Network (DN) with a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method, and using this
network on downstream tasks but with its last few layers entirely removed. This
usually skimmed-over trick is actually critical for SSL methods to display
competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30
points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one
would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by
the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for
best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this
study sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine
Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable form of regularization
that has also been used to improve generalization performance in transfer
learning scenarios. In this work, through theory and experiments, we formalize
GR and identify the underlying reasons behind its success in SSL methods. Our
study shows that the use of this trick is essential to SSL performance for two
main reasons: (i) improper data-augmentations to define the positive pairs used

variety of text changes in font, size, color, and orientation. Most existing
regression based methods resort to regress the masks or contour points of text
regions to model the text instances. However, regressing the complete masks
requires high training complexity, and contour points are not sufficient to
capture the details of highly curved texts. To tackle the above limitations, we
propose a novel light-weight anchor-free text detection framework called
TextDCT, which adopts the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to encode the text
masks as compact vectors. Further, considering the imbalanced number of
training samples among pyramid layers, we only employ a single-level head for
top-down prediction. To model the multi-scale texts in a single-level head, we
introduce a novel positive sampling strategy by treating the shrunk text region
as positive samples, and design a feature awareness module (FAM) for
spatial-awareness and scale-awareness by fusing rich contextual information and
focusing on more significant features. Moreover, we propose a segmented
non-maximum suppression (S-NMS) method that can filter low-quality mask
regressions. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging datasets,
which demonstrate our TextDCT obtains competitive performance on both accuracy

rarely or never available for real-world surfaces [3-6]. The present challenge
is to experimentalists: we will send you samples of two materials (one smoother
and one rougher); you determine the surface topography of these materials. We
call on you to measure such surfaces however you wish, using contact-based
techniques, light scattering, microscopy, or other techniques. Examples of
quantities of interest are: root-mean-square (RMS) parameters; the power
spectral density (PSD); or the autocorrelation function (ACF). For the

several transfer learning approaches have been proposed, where the knowledge of
a trained model is transferred into another to improve performance with
different data. However, most of these approaches require additional training
steps, or they suffer from catastrophic forgetting that occurs when a trained
model has overwritten previously learnt knowledge. We address both problems
with a novel transfer learning approach that uses network aggregation. We train
dataset-specific networks together with an aggregation network in a unified
framework. The loss function includes two main components: a task-specific loss
(such as cross-entropy) and an aggregation loss. The proposed aggregation loss
allows our model to learn how trained deep network parameters can be aggregated
with an aggregation operator. We demonstrate that the proposed approach learns
model aggregation at test time without any further training step, reducing the
burden of transfer learning to a simple arithmetical operation. The proposed
approach achieves comparable performance w.r.t. the baseline. Besides, if the
aggregation operator has an inverse, we will show that our model also
inherently allows for selective forgetting, i.e., the aggregated model can
forget one of the datasets it was trained on, retaining information on the
others.

comprehensive numerical simulations and acoustic micro-tapping OCE experiments

interpretable, as it represents the classifiers avoidable loss of accuracy due
to statistical corruptions. On 2D and image data, we show that the metric
reflects different levels of classifier robustness. Furthermore, we observe
unexpected optima in classifiers robust accuracy through training and testing
classifiers with different levels of noise. While researchers have frequently
reported on a significant tradeoff on accuracy when training robust models, we
strengthen the view that a tradeoff between accuracy and corruption robustness

to the overall damage process, we conduct triaxial cyclic loading experiments
on Westerly granite, and monitor volumetric strain and elastic wave velocity
and anisotropy. Cyclic loading tests show large hysteresis in axial
stress-strain behaviour that can be explained entirely by slip. Elastic wave
velocity variations are observed only past a yield point, and show hysteresis
with incomplete reversibility upon unloading. Irrecoverable volumetric strain
and elastic wave velocity drop and anisotropy increase with increasing maximum
stress, are amplified during hydrostatic decompression, and decrease
logarithmically with time during hydrostatic hold periods after deformation
cycles. The mechanical data and change in elastic properties are used to
determine the proportion of mechanical work required to generate tensile
cracks, which increases as the rock approaches failure but remains small, up to
around 10\% of the net dissipated work per cycle. The pre-rupture deformation
behaviour of rocks is qualitatively compatible with the mechanics of wing
cracks. While tensile cracks are the source of large changes in rock physical
properties, they are not systematically associated with significant energy
dissipation and their aperture and growth is primarily controlled by friction,
which exerts a dominant control on rock rheology in the brittle regime.
Time-dependent friction along preexisting shear interfaces explains how tensile
cracks can close under static conditions and produce recovery of elastic wave
velocities over time.

and those emitted in the allowed $\beta$-decay of the initial nucleus. The
electron wave functions are obtained with the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater
self-consistent method, and we ensure the orthogonality between the continuum
and bound electron states, in the potential of the final atom, by modifying the
last iteration of the self-consistent method. We show that orthogonality plays
an essential role in calculating the exchange correction. After imposing the
orthogonality, we found considerable differences in magnitude and energy
dependence compared to previous results. We argue that our findings can solve
the mismatch between the previous predictions and experimental measurements in
the low-energy region of the $\beta$ spectrum. First, we calculate the exchange
effect for the low-energy $\beta$ transitions in $^{14}$C, $^{45}$Ca,
$^{63}$Ni, and $^{241}$Pu, recently investigated in the literature. Next, we
compute the total exchange correction for a large number of $\beta$ emitters,
with $Z$ from $1$ to $102$. From the systematic study, we found that for
ultra-low energy, i.e., $5$ eV, the $Z$ dependence of total exchange effect is
affected by $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ orbitals closure. We also show that the
contributions from orbitals higher than $2s_{1/2}$ orbital are essential for
correctly calculating the total effect, especially for low energies and heavy
$\beta$ emitters. Finally, we provide an analytical expression of the total
exchange correction for each atomic number for easy implementation in
experimental investigations.

$R$ and $\Lambda$ enter with the same form into nonlocal version as they are in

corresponding equations of motion for gravitational field $g_{\mu\nu}$ are
presented. The first step in finding some exact cosmological solutions is
solving the equation $\Box \sqrt{R-2\Lambda} = q \sqrt{R-2\Lambda} , $ where $
q =\zeta \Lambda \quad (\zeta \in \mathbb{R})$ is an eigenvalue and
$\sqrt{R-2\Lambda}$ is an eigenfunction of the operator $\Box .$ We presented

computation, given an input piecewise linear scalar field $f$ defined on a

seminal algorithm ""PairSimplices"" [31], [103] with discrete Morse theory (DMT)
[34], [80], which greatly reduces the number of input simplices to consider.
Further, we also extend to DMT and accelerate the stratification strategy
described in ""PairSimplices"" for the fast computation of the $0^{th}$ and $(d -
1)^{th}$ diagrams, noted $D_0(f)$ and $D_{d-1}(f)$. Minima-saddle persistence
pairs ($D_0(f)$) and saddle-maximum persistence pairs ($D_{d-1}(f)$) are
efficiently computed by processing, with a Union-Find, the unstable sets of
$1$-saddles and the stable sets of $(d - 1)$-saddles. This fast pre-computation
for the dimensions $0$ and $(d - 1)$ enables an aggressive specialization of
[4] to the 3D case, which results in a drastic reduction of the number of input
simplices for the computation of $D_1(f)$, the intermediate layer of the
sandwich. Finally, we document several performance improvements via
shared-memory parallelism. We provide an open-source implementation of our
algorithm for reproducibility purposes. We also contribute a reproducible
benchmark package, which exploits three-dimensional data from a public
repository and compares our algorithm to a variety of publicly available
implementations. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by
two orders of magnitude the time performance of the seminal ""PairSimplices""
algorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and time
performance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial
gain over the fastest available approaches, while producing a strictly

externally-forced components. Yet, underlying mechanisms and their relative
contributions remain insufficiently understood, especially on decadal to
centennial timescales. Important reasons for this are difficulties in isolating
internal and externally-forced variability. Here, we provide a
physically-motivated emulation of global mean surface temperature (GMST)
variability, which allows for the separation of internal and external
variations. To this end, we introduce the ``ClimBayes'' software package, which
infers climate parameters from a stochastic energy balance model (EBM) with a
Bayesian approach. We apply our method to GMST data from temperature
observations and 20 last millennium simulations from climate models of
intermediate to high complexity. This yields the best estimates of the EBM's
forced and forced + internal response, which we refer to as emulated
variability. The timescale-dependent variance is obtained from spectral
analysis. In particular, we contrast the emulated forced and forced + internal
variance on interannual to centennial timescales with that of the GMST target.
Our findings show that a stochastic EBM closely approximates the power spectrum
and timescale-dependent variance of GMST as simulated by modern climate models.
Small deviations at interannual timescales can be attributed to the simplified
representation of internal variability and, in particular, the absence of
(pseudo-)oscillatory modes in the stochastic EBM. Altogether, we demonstrate
the potential of combining Bayesian inference with conceptual climate models to
emulate statistics of climate variables across timescales.

extract finite automata from RNNs. Existing approaches such as exact learning
are effective in extracting finite-state models to characterize the state
dynamics of RNNs for formal languages, but are limited in the scalability to
process natural languages. Compositional approaches that are scablable to
natural languages fall short in extraction precision. In this paper, we

approach, which is scalable to natural language processing models and effective

(CE) in their setups to encode a high-dimensional scene in a single or multiple
snapshots and decode it by using computational algorithms. The performance of
COI systems highly depends on the design of its main components: the CE pattern
and the computational method used to perform a given task. Conventional
approaches rely on random patterns or analytical designs to set the
distribution of the CE. However, the available data and algorithm capabilities
of deep neural networks (DNNs) have opened a new horizon in CE data-driven
designs that jointly consider the optical encoder and computational decoder.
Specifically, by modeling the COI measurements through a fully differentiable
image formation model that considers the physics-based propagation of light and
its interaction with the CEs, the parameters that define the CE and the
computational decoder can be optimized in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. Moreover,
by optimizing just CEs in the same framework, inference tasks can be performed
from pure optics. This work surveys the recent advances on CE data-driven
design and provides guidelines on how to parametrize different optical elements
to include them in the E2E framework. Since the E2E framework can handle
different inference applications by changing the loss function and the DNN, we
present low-level tasks such as spectral imaging reconstruction or high-level
tasks such as pose estimation with privacy preserving enhanced by using optimal
task-based optical architectures. Finally, we illustrate classification and 3D
object recognition applications performed at the speed of the light using
all-optics DNN.

sub-symbolic distributed representation learning with the capability to reason
at a higher level of abstraction. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a class of
neuro-symbolic systems based on a differentiable, first-order logic grounded
into a deep neural network. LTNs replace the classical concept of training set
with a knowledge base of fuzzy logical axioms. By defining a set of
differentiable operators to approximate the role of connectives, predicates,
functions and quantifiers, a loss function is automatically specified so that
LTNs can learn to satisfy the knowledge base. We focus here on the subsumption
or \texttt{isOfClass} predicate, which is fundamental to encode most semantic
image interpretation tasks. Unlike conventional LTNs, which rely on a separate
predicate for each class (e.g., dog, cat), each with its own set of learnable
weights, we propose a common \texttt{isOfClass} predicate, whose level of truth
is a function of the distance between an object embedding and the corresponding
class prototype. The PROTOtypical Logic Tensor Networks (PROTO-LTN) extend the
current formulation by grounding abstract concepts as parametrized class
prototypes in a high-dimensional embedding space, while reducing the number of
parameters required to ground the knowledge base. We show how this architecture
can be effectively trained in the few and zero-shot learning scenarios.
Experiments on Generalized Zero Shot Learning benchmarks validate the proposed
implementation as a competitive alternative to traditional embedding-based
approaches. The proposed formulation opens up new opportunities in zero shot
learning settings, as the LTN formalism allows to integrate background
knowledge in the form of logical axioms to compensate for the lack of labelled
examples.

between accuracy and the diversity of the dataset. Previous research has shown
that if we train a model to detect one specific malware family, we generally
obtain stronger results as compared to a case where we train a single model on
multiple diverse families. However, during the detection phase, it would be
more efficient to have a single model that can reliably detect multiple
families, rather than having to score each sample against multiple models. In
this research, we conduct experiments based on byte $n$-gram features to
quantify the relationship between the generality of the training dataset and
the accuracy of the corresponding machine learning models, all within the
context of the malware detection problem. We find that neighborhood-based
algorithms generalize surprisingly well, far outperforming the other machine

conformational states of a molecular system, eg. a folded and unfolded protein,
we aim to sample the most likely transition path between the two states.
Sampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the
existence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent
this, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along
specific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables (CVs). However,
finding CVs is not trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger
molecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these CV-based methods
biases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. Instead, this work
proposes a method for sampling transition paths that consider the entire
geometry of the molecules. To achieve this, we first relate the problem to
recent work on the Schrodinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control.
Using this relation, we construct a method that takes into account important
characteristics of molecular systems such as second-order dynamics and
invariance to rotations and translations. We demonstrate our method on the
commonly studied Alanine Dipeptide, but also consider larger proteins such as
Polyproline and Chignolin.

with extreme precision by balancing the gravitational pull on the test mass
against the electromagnetic lift force. The uncertainty in such mass
measurement is currently ~$1\times 10^{-8} $. We show how the same Kibble
balance can be used to measure the $inertial$ mass of a test mass, that too
with potentially 50% better measurement uncertainty, i.e., ~$5\times 10^{-9} $.
For measuring the inertial mass, the weight of the test mass and the assembly
holding it is precisely balanced by a counterweight. The application of the
known electromagnetic force accelerates the test mass. Measuring the velocity
after a controlled elapsed time provides the acceleration and, consequently,
the inertial mass of the accelerated assembly comprising the Kibble balance
coil and the mass holding pan. Repeating the measurement with the test mass
added to the assembly and taking the difference between the two measurements
yields the inertial mass of the test mass. Thus, the extreme precision inertial
and gravitational mass measurement of a test mass with a Kibble balance could
provide a test of the equivalence principle. We discuss how the two masses are
related to the Planck constant and other coupling constants and if the Kibble
balance could be used to test the dynamic constants theories in Dirac
cosmology.

require a flexible approach. To determine the appropriate approach needs the
data engineering in order to get the behavior associated with the data. Each
social network has the resources and the information source, but the
relationship between resources and information sources requires explanation.
This paper aimed to address the behavior of the resource as a part of social
network analysis (SNA) in the growth of social networks by using the
statistical calculations to explain the evolutionary mechanisms. To represent
the analysis unit of the SNA, this paper only considers the degree of a vertex,
where it is the core of all the analysis in the SNA and it is basic for
defining the relation between resources and SNA in SNM. There is a strong
effect on the growth of the resources of social networks. In total, the
behavior of resources has positive effects. Thus, different information sources
behave similarly and have relations with SNA.

both solid and liquid phase reactants, and range of relevant timescales
(seconds to hours). Here, we overcome this problem and demonstrate the use of
bench-top laser scanning confocal microscopy for simultaneous three-dimensional
operando measurement of lithium ion dynamics in single particles, and the
electrolyte, in batteries. We examine two technologically important cathode
materials that are known to suffer from intercalation heterogeneities: LixCoO2
and LixNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The single-particle surface-to-core transport
velocity of Li-phase fronts, and volume changes - as well as their
inter-particle heterogeneity - are captured as a function of C-rate, and
benchmarked to previous ensemble measurements. Additionally, we visualise
heterogeneities in the bulk and at the surface of particles during cycling, and
image the formation of spatially non-uniform concentration gradients within the
liquid electrolyte. Importantly, the conditions under which optical imaging can
be performed inside absorbing and multiply scattering materials such as battery
intercalation compounds are outlined.
