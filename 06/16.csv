the lack of any post-fabrication tunability of their response. To break this

provide a fast, low energy and non-volatile means to endow metasurfaces with a
switching mechanism. In this regard, great advancements have been done in the
mid infrared and near infrared spectrum using different chalcogenides. In the
visible spectral range, however, very few devices have demonstrated full phase
manipulation, high efficiencies, and reversible switching. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate a tunable all-dielectric Huygens metasurface made of
antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) PCM, a low loss and high-index material in the visible

linear program, the addition of entropic regularization has proven beneficial
both computationally and statistically, for many applications. The Sinkhorn
fixed-point algorithm is the most popular approach to solve this regularized
problem, and, as a result, multiple attempts have been made to reduce its
runtime using, e.g., annealing in the regularization parameter, momentum or
acceleration. The premise of this work is that initialization of the Sinkhorn
algorithm has received comparatively little attention, possibly due to two
preconceptions: since the regularized OT problem is convex, it may not be worth
crafting a good initialization, since any is guaranteed to work; secondly,
because the outputs of the Sinkhorn algorithm are often unrolled in end-to-end
pipelines, a data-dependent initialization would bias Jacobian computations. We
challenge this conventional wisdom, and show that data-dependent initializers
result in dramatic speed-ups, with no effect on differentiability as long as
implicit differentiation is used. Our initializations rely on closed-forms for
exact or approximate OT solutions that are known in the 1D, Gaussian or GMM
settings. They can be used with minimal tuning, and result in consistent
speed-ups for a wide variety of OT problems.

clients from all clusters to send their local updates in a pipelined manner. In
this way, instead of just waiting for the slower clients to finish their
computation, more clients can participate in each iteration. While the time
duration of a single iteration does not change, the proposed method can
significantly reduce the number of required iterations to achieve a target
accuracy. We provide a generic formulation for optimal client clustering under
different settings, and we analytically derive an efficient algorithm for
obtaining the optimal solution. We also provide numerical results to

machine learning with applications in domains such as phylogenetics, social
network analysis, and information retrieval. Specifically, we consider the
recently popularized objective function for hierarchical clustering due to
Dasgupta. Previous algorithms for (approximately) minimizing this objective
function require linear time/space complexity. In many applications the
underlying graph can be massive in size making it computationally challenging
to process the graph even using a linear time/space algorithm. As a result,
there is a strong interest in designing algorithms that can perform global
computation using only sublinear resources. The focus of this work is to study
hierarchical clustering for massive graphs under three well-studied models of
sublinear computation which focus on space, time, and communication,
respectively, as the primary resources to optimize: (1) (dynamic) streaming
model where edges are presented as a stream, (2) query model where the graph is
queried using neighbor and degree queries, (3) MPC model where the graph edges
are partitioned over several machines connected via a communication channel.
  We design sublinear algorithms for hierarchical clustering in all three
models above. At the heart of our algorithmic results is a view of the
objective in terms of cuts in the graph, which allows us to use a relaxed
notion of cut sparsifiers to do hierarchical clustering while introducing only
a small distortion in the objective function. Our main algorithmic
contributions are then to show how cut sparsifiers of the desired form can be
efficiently constructed in the query model and the MPC model. We complement our
algorithmic results by establishing nearly matching lower bounds that rule out
the possibility of designing better algorithms in each of these models.

densely packed structures, the active diffusion coefficient is significantly
smaller and depends on the number of particles in the cluster. Our analysis of
the cluster-growth dynamics shows distinct differences to processes in systems
of short-range attractive colloids in equilibrium. Specifically, the
characteristic time for the growth and decay of clusters of a particular size
is longer than that of isotropically attractive colloids, which we attribute to
the non-reciprocal nature of the directed visual perception. Our simulations
reveal a strong interplay between ABP-characteristic interactions, such as
volume exclusion and rotational diffusion, and cognitive-based interactions and
navigation.

have tremendous constraints on their energy consumption. Adding more

significantly. However, the energy capacity of the battery does not increase
proportionally. Hence, to overcome the constraints on energy consumption, two
main approaches are being undertaken by the designers to integrate more
functionalities onto the energy-constrained systems. One approach involves
reducing the inherent energy consumption of circuits, and the other involves
harvesting energy from the ambient sources and utilizing it to power the
circuits. In this thesis, both the approaches mentioned above are followed in
developing energy-saving techniques for energy-constrained CMOS circuits and
systems. Switched-capacitor-assisted power gating technique is proposed to
reduce the leakage current of large digital circuits. Benefits in overall
energy saving using nano-electromechanical switches (NEMS) for power gating is
quantified on a system-on chip for a mobile platform made using a 14 nm gate
length FinFET. For reducing the quiescent current in the analog front-end
circuits, this thesis proposes a novel technique of realizing discrete-time
(D-T) signal amplification using nano-electromechanical switches (NEMS). Apart
from the three energy reduction techniques mentioned above, harvesting energy
from mechanical vibrations using an efficient technique of power extraction

the uni-modal backbones, FIBER pushes multimodal fusion deep into the model by
inserting cross-attention into the image and text backbones, bringing gains in
terms of memory and performance. In addition, unlike previous work that is
either only pre-trained on image-text data or on fine-grained data with
box-level annotations, we present a two-stage pre-training strategy that uses
both these kinds of data efficiently: (i) coarse-grained pre-training based on

an epidemic-free phase at low contagion rates to the epidemic state for rates
above a critical threshold. This transition can become discontinuous when two
simple contagion processes are coupled in a bi-directional symmetric way.
However, in many cases, the coupling is not symmetric and the processes can be
of a different nature. For example, risky social behaviors -- such as not
wearing masks or engaging in large gatherings -- can affect the spread of a
disease, and their adoption dynamics via social reinforcement mechanisms are
better described by complex contagion models, rather than by the simple
contagion paradigm, which is more appropriate for disease spreading phenomena.
Motivated by this example, we consider a simplicial contagion (describing the
adoption of a behavior) that uni-directionally drives a simple contagion
(describing a disease propagation). We show that, above a critical driving
strength, such driven simple contagion can exhibit both discontinuous
transitions and bi-stability, which are instead absent in standard simple
contagions. We provide a mean-field analytical description of the phase diagram
of the system, and complement the results with Markov-chain simulations. Our
results provide a novel route for a simple contagion process to display the
phenomenology of a higher-order contagion, through a driving mechanism that may
be hidden or unobservable in many practical instances.

nearly 2700 Gaia-identified RRLs with precise $\phi_{31}$ and $R_{21}$
measurements from the light curves and metallicity estimates from spectroscopy.
Using 236 nearby RRLs with accurate distances estimated from parallax
measurements with Gaia EDR3, new $G$ band absolute magnitude-metallicity
relations and near-infrared period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations are
constructed. External checks, using other high-resolution spectroscopic sample
of field RRLs and RRL members of globular clusters (GCs), show that the typical
uncertainties in our photometric-metallicity estimates are about 0.24 and 0.16
dex for type RRab/c stars, respectively, without significant systematic bias
with respect to high-resolution spectroscopic metallicity measurements. The
accuracies of these metallicity estimates are much improved, especially for
RRab stars, when compared to those provided by the Gaia DR3 release.
Validations of our distance estimates, again by using members of GCs, show that
the typical distance errors are only 3-4%. The distance modulus
$\mu_0=18.503\pm0.001(stat)\pm0.040(syst)$ mag for the LMC and
$\mu_0=19.030\pm0.003(stat)\pm0.043(syst)$ mag for the SMC are estimated from
our RRab sample, respectively, and are in excellent agreement with previous

are also consistent with the previous determinations. Using our sample, a steep
metallicity gradient of $-0.024\pm0.001$ dex/kpc is found for the LMC, while a
negligible metallicity gradient is obtained for the SMC.

\emph{strange quantum baths} without quasiparticles, made by two
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models at temperatures $T_L\neq T_R$ and connected by a
Fermi-Liquid system. We obtain an exact expression for the nonequilibrium
energy current, valid in the limit of large bath and system size and for any

baths has direct consequences on the thermal conductance, which above a
temperature $T^*(V)\sim V^4$ is parametrically enhanced with respect to the
linear-$T$ behavior expected in systems with quasiparticles. Interestingly,
below $T^*(V)$ the linear thermal conductance behavior is restored, yet
transport is not due to quasiparticles. Rather the system gets strongly
renormalized by the strange bath and becomes Non-Fermi-Liquid and maximally
chaotic. Finally, we discuss the full nonequilibrium energy current and show
that its form is compatible with the structure
$\mathcal{J}=\Phi(T_L)-\Phi(T_R)$, with $\Phi(T)\sim T^{\gamma}$ and power law
crossing over from $\gamma=3/2$ to $\gamma=2$ below $T^*$.

a power-spectra analysis of Planck data, which improves on previous studies by
using the newly released SRoll2 maps that correct residual data systematics,
and by extending the analysis to regions near the Galactic plane. Our analysis
focuses on the lowest multipoles between l=4 and 32, and three sky areas with
sky fractions of fsky = 80%, 90%, and 97%. The mean dust SED for polarization
and the 353 GHz Q and U maps are used to compute residual maps at 100, 143 and
217 GHz, highlighting spatial variations of the dust polarization SED.
Residuals are detected at the three frequencies for the three sky areas. We
show that models based on total intensity data are underestimating by a
significant factor the complexity of dust polarized CMB foreground. Our
analysis emphasizes the need to include variations of polarization angles of
the dust polarized CMB foreground. The frequency dependence of the EE and BB
power spectra of the residual maps yields further insight. We find that the
moments expansion to the first order of the modified black-body (MBB) spectrum
provides a good fit to the EE power-spectra. This result suggests that the
residuals could follow mainly from variations of dust MBB spectral parameters.
However, this conclusion is challenged by cross-spectra showing that the
residuals maps at the three frequencies are not fully correlated, and the fact
that the BB power-spectra do not match the first order moment expansion of a
MBB SED. This work sets new requirements for simulations of the dust polarized

interest in computational biology. A popular model for this problem assumes
that we are given the set of leaves (current species) of an unknown binary tree
and the results of `experiments' on triples of leaves (a,b,c), which return the
pair with the deepest least common ancestor. If the tree is assumed to be an
ultrametric (i.e., all root-leaf paths have the same length), the experiment
can be equivalently seen to return the closest pair of leaves. In this model,
efficient algorithms are known for tree reconstruction.
  In reality, since the data on which these `experiments' are run is itself
generated by the stochastic process of evolution, these experiments are noisy.
In all reasonable models of evolution, if the branches leading to the leaves in
a triple separate from each other at common ancestors that are very close to
each other in the tree, the result of the experiment should be close to
uniformly random. Motivated by this, we consider a model where the noise on any
triple is just dependent on the three pairwise distances (referred to as
distance based noise).
  Our results are the following: 1. Suppose the length of every edge in the
unknown tree is at least $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt n})$ fraction of the length
of a root-leaf path. Then, we give an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the
topology of the tree for a broad family of distance-based noise models.
Further, we show that if the edges are asymptotically shorter, then topology
reconstruction is information-theoretically impossible.
  2. Further, for a specific distance-based noise model--which we refer to as
the homogeneous noise model--we show that the edge weights can also be
approximately reconstructed under the same quantitative lower bound on the edge
lengths.

the information content of a complex graph using a novel encoding scheme, where
it seeks to minimize the total number of bits required to encode (i) the

using a deeper imaging survey for calibration. In standard metacalibration,

the effect of shearing the noise in the image, increasing the uncertainty on

leverages a separate, deeper imaging survey to calculate calibrations with less
degradation in image noise. We demonstrate that weak lensing shear measurement
with deep-field metacalibration is unbiased up to second-order shear effects.
We provide algorithms to apply this technique to imaging surveys and describe
how to generalize it to shear estimators that rely explicitly on object
detection (e.g., metacalibration). For the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy

We conservatively estimate that the degradation in precision is reduced from
20% for metacalibration to ~ 5% or less for deep-field metacalibration, which
we attribute primarily to the increased source density and reduced pixel noise
contributions to the overall shape noise. Finally, we show that the technique
is robust to sample variance in the LSST DDFs due to their large area, with the
equivalent calibration error being ~ 0.1%. The deep-field metacalibration
technique provides higher signal-to-noise weak lensing measurements while still
meeting the stringent systematic error requirements of future surveys.

encouraging our model to pay attention to the visual stream. We demonstrate the

In this work, we propose to augment these attributes with a small set of

a linear combination of the semantic attributes, and another that is dependent
on the set of uninterpretable features. By identifying the latter, we are able
to analyze the ""unexplained"" portion of the model, obtaining insights into the

generalize to multiple models trained with the same feature space and compare
our work to two popular attribute-oriented methods, Interpretable Basis

Therefore, existing approaches often render low-resolution feature maps and
process them with an upsampling network to obtain the final image. Albeit
efficient, neural rendering often entangles viewpoint and content such that
changing the camera pose results in unwanted changes of geometry or appearance.
Motivated by recent results in voxel-based novel view synthesis, we investigate
the utility of sparse voxel grid representations for fast and 3D-consistent
generative modeling in this paper. Our results demonstrate that monolithic MLPs
can indeed be replaced by 3D convolutions when combining sparse voxel grids
with progressive growing, free space pruning and appropriate regularization. To
obtain a compact representation of the scene and allow for scaling to higher
voxel resolutions, our model disentangles the foreground object (modeled in 3D)
from the background (modeled in 2D). In contrast to existing approaches, our
method requires only a single forward pass to generate a full 3D scene. It
hence allows for efficient rendering from arbitrary viewpoints while yielding

active regions on such stars using the Flux Emergence And Transport model, we
show that the contribution of magnetic activity to the astrometric measurements
becomes increasingly significant with increasing rotation rates. We further
show that the jitter for the most variable periodic Kepler stars is high enough
to be detected by Gaia. Furthermore, due to a decrease in the facula-to-spot
area ratio for more active stars, the magnetic jitter is found to be
spot-dominated for rapid rotators. Our simulations of the astrometric jitter

pixels in an image and assigning semantic classes and object instance
identifiers to them. Research in image segmentation has become increasingly
popular due to its critical applications in robotics and autonomous driving.
The research community thereby relies on publicly available benchmark dataset
to advance the state-of-the-art in computer vision. Due to the high costs of
densely labeling the images, however, there is a shortage of publicly available
ground truth labels that are suitable for panoptic segmentation. The high
labeling costs also make it challenging to extend existing datasets to the
video domain and to multi-camera setups. We therefore present the Waymo Open
Dataset: Panoramic Video Panoptic Segmentation Dataset, a large-scale dataset
that offers high-quality panoptic segmentation labels for autonomous driving.
We generate our dataset using the publicly available Waymo Open Dataset,
leveraging the diverse set of camera images. Our labels are consistent over
time for video processing and consistent across multiple cameras mounted on the
vehicles for full panoramic scene understanding. Specifically, we offer labels
for 28 semantic categories and 2,860 temporal sequences that were captured by
five cameras mounted on autonomous vehicles driving in three different
geographical locations, leading to a total of 100k labeled camera images. To
the best of our knowledge, this makes our dataset an order of magnitude larger
than existing datasets that offer video panoptic segmentation labels. We
further propose a new benchmark for Panoramic Video Panoptic Segmentation and
establish a number of strong baselines based on the DeepLab family of models.
We will make the benchmark and the code publicly available. Find the dataset at

  https://github.com/Jiahao000/MFM",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Masked Frequency Modeling (MFM), a unified frequency-domain-based
approach for self-supervised pre-training of visual models. Instead of randomly
inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this
paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM
first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then
predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is
that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to
reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the
spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that
with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural
information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among
low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the
first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese
framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the
following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental
results on image classification and semantic segmentation, as well as several
robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness
of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we
also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image
restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency

only found recently, especially for 3D systems. Based on the Pontraygon's
Maximum Principle (MPM) and Lagrange equations, we present the necessary
conditions for optimal switches, which form the control synthesis boundaries.
We formally show that the shortest path for nearby configurations will have
similar adjoint functions and parameters, i.e., Lagrange multipliers. We
further show that the gradients of the necessary condition equation can be used
to verify whether a configuration is inside a control synthesis region or on
the boundary. We present a procedure to find the shortest kinematic paths and
control synthesis, using the gradients of the control constraints. Given the
shortest path and the corresponding control sequences, the optimal control
sequence for nearby configurations can be derived if and only if they belong to
the same control synthesis region. The proposed procedure can work for both 2D

10^5$ single-lined spectroscopic binaries, representing more than an order of
magnitude increase in sample size over all previous studies. This dataset is a
treasure trove for searches for quiescent black hole + normal star binaries. We
investigate one population of black hole candidate binaries highlighted in the
data release: sources near the main sequence in the color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) with dynamically-inferred companion masses $M_2$ larger than the
CMD-inferred mass of the luminous star. We model light curves, spectral energy
distributions, and archival spectra of the 14 such objects in DR3 with
high-significance orbital solutions and inferred $M_2 > 3\,M_{\odot}$. We find
that 100\% of these sources are mass-transfer binaries containing a highly
stripped lower giant donor ($0.2 \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 0.4$) and much
more massive ($2 \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 2.5$) main-sequence accretor.
The Gaia orbital solutions are for the donors, which contribute about half the
light in the Gaia RVS bandpass but only $\lesssim 20\%$ in the $g-$band. The
accretors' broad spectral features likely prevented the sources from being
classified as double-lined. The donors are all close to Roche lobe-filling
($R/R_{\rm Roche\,lobe}>0.8$), but modeling suggests that a majority are
detached ($R/R_{\rm Roche\,lobe}<1$). Binary evolution models predict that
these systems will soon become detached helium white dwarf + main sequence ""EL
CVn"" binaries. Our investigation highlights both the power of Gaia data for
selecting interesting sub-populations of binaries and the ways in which binary
evolution can bamboozle standard CMD-based stellar mass estimates.

long-range entanglement, and fractionalization. Starting from a simple family
of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories due to Cardy and Rabinovici, we
develop a class of FTI phases based on the physical mechanism of oblique
confinement and the modern language of generalized global symmetries. We dub
these phases oblique topological insulators. Oblique TIs arise when dyons --
bound states of electric charges and monopoles -- condense, leading to FTI
phases characterized by topological order, emergent one-form symmetries, and
gapped boundary states not realizable in 2+1-D alone. Based on the lattice
gauge theory, we present continuum topological quantum field theories (TQFTs)
for oblique TI phases involving fluctuating one-form and two-form gauge fields.
We show explicitly that these TQFTs capture both the generalized global
symmetries and topological orders seen in the lattice gauge theory. We also
demonstrate that these theories exhibit a universal ""generalized
magnetoelectric effect"" in the presence of two-form background gauge fields.
Moreover, we characterize the possible boundary topological orders of oblique
TIs, finding a new set of boundary states not studied previously for these

from an extended broken-ring structure around the Green Pea, with the strongest
emission coming from a region between GP J0213+0056 and a companion galaxy

velocity distribution, which in turn allowed Ly-alpha (and, possibly,
Lyman-continuum) emission to escape the Green Pea. Our results suggest that
such mergers, and the resulting holes in the HI distribution, are a natural way
to explain the tension between the requirements of cold gas to fuel the
starburst and the observed leakage of Ly-alpha and Lyman-continuum emission in
Green Pea galaxies and their high-redshift counterparts.

in the spherically averaged quasi-adiabatic relaxation framework that
accurately capture the dark matter response over the full range of halo mass

which consider the relative change in radius $r_f/r_i-1$ of a spherical dark
matter shell to be a function of only the relative change in its mass
$M_i/M_f-1$, do not accurately describe the measured response of most haloes in
IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. Rather, $r_f/r_i$ additionally explicitly depends upon
halo-centric distance $r_f/R_{\rm vir}$ for haloes with virial radius $R_{\rm

We also account for a previously unmodelled effect, likely driven by
feedback-related outflows, in which shells having $r_f/r_i\simeq1$ (i.e., no
relaxation) have $M_i/M_f$ significantly different from unity. Our results are
immediately applicable to a number of semi-analytical tools for modelling

is not only a globally conserved quantity, but also a material invariant that
is conserved along fluid parcel trajectories. Therefore, an open question
remains: is there a moist PV that is a material invariant, if clouds and phase
changes of water are present? In prior studies, definitions of moist PV have
been proposed based on physical and mathematical intuition. Here, a systematic
approach is used. In particular, a particle relabeling symmetry is devised for
a moist atmosphere and then Noether's theorem is employed to arrive at the
associated conservation laws for moist PV. A priori, it is not clear whether
this systematic approach will be viable, since it relies on variational
derivatives in Hamilton's principle, and phase changes introduce singularities
that could potentially prevent derivatives at cloud edge. However, it is shown
that the energy and the Lagrangian density are sufficiently smooth to allow
variational derivatives, in a moist Boussinesq system with reversible phase
transitions between water vapor and liquid cloud water.. From the particle
relabeling symmetry, a moist Kelvin circulation theorem is found, along with a
moist PV conservation law that applies not for each individual parcel but for

Many of the recent successes have come from methods that pre-specify the types

ultimately generalize well to new domains. However, na\""ive diversity based
augmentations do not work effectively for domain generalization either because
they cannot model large domain shift, or because the span of transforms that

generalization. To address this issue, we present a novel framework that uses
adversarially learned transformations (ALT) using a neural network to model
plausible, yet hard image transformations that fool the classifier. This
network is randomly initialized for each batch and trained for a fixed number
of steps to maximize classification error. Further, we enforce consistency

extensive empirical analysis, we find that this new form of adversarial
transformations achieve both objectives of diversity and hardness
simultaneously, outperforming all existing techniques on competitive benchmarks

work with existing diversity modules to produce highly distinct, and large

prescribe runtime interventions that will likely prevent negative case outcomes
or improve a process's performance. A centerpiece of a prescriptive process
monitoring method is its intervention policy: a decision function determining
if and when to trigger an intervention on an ongoing case. Previous proposals
in this field rely on intervention policies that consider only the current
state of a given case. These approaches do not consider the tradeoff between
triggering an intervention in the current state, given the level of uncertainty
of the underlying predictive models, versus delaying the intervention to a
later state. Moreover, they assume that a resource is always available to
perform an intervention (infinite capacity). This paper addresses these gaps by
introducing a prescriptive process monitoring method that filters and ranks
ongoing cases based on prediction scores, prediction uncertainty, and causal
effect of the intervention, and triggers interventions to maximize a gain
function, considering the available resources. The proposal is evaluated using
a real-life event log. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing baselines regarding total gain.

resources, it is desired to construct a small synthetic dataset with which we
can train deep learning models sufficiently. There are recent works that have
explored solutions on condensing image datasets through complex bi-level
optimization. For instance, dataset condensation (DC) matches network gradients
w.r.t. large-real data and small-synthetic data, where the network weights are
optimized for multiple steps at each outer iteration. However, existing
approaches have their inherent limitations: (1) they are not directly
applicable to graphs where the data is discrete; and (2) the condensation
process is computationally expensive due to the involved nested optimization.
To bridge the gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation tailored for
graph datasets where we model the discrete graph structure as a probabilistic
model. We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs
gradient matching for only one single step without training the network
weights. Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic
graphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs. Extensive
experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we are able to reduce the
dataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance

forecasts of the cosmological constraints from the combination of the 21cm

constraining power of these surveys on cosmological parameters, the BAO
distance functions and the growth function. We also estimate the constraining
power on dynamical dark energy and modified gravity. Finally we investigate the
constraints on the 21cm clustering bias, up to second order. We consider the
effects on the 21cm correlators of the telescope beam, instrumental noise,
foreground avoidance, the Alcock-Paczynski effect and theoretical errors in the
modelling of the correlators. Adding Planck priors, and marginalising over
nuisance parameters, HIRAX achieves sub-percent precision on the $\Lambda$CDM
parameters, with SKAO delivering slightly lower precision. The modified gravity
parameter $\gamma$ is constrained at 1% (HIRAX) and 5% (SKAO). For the dark
energy parameters $w_0,w_a$, HIRAX delivers percent-level precision while SKAO
constraints are weaker. HIRAX achieves sub-percent precision on the BAO
distance functions $D_A,H$, while SKAO reaches 1-2% for $0.6\lesssim z\lesssim
1$. The growth rate $f$ is constrained at a few-percent level for the whole
redshift range of HIRAX and for $0.6\lesssim z\lesssim 1$ by SKAO. The
different performances arise mainly since HIRAX is a packed inteferometer that
is optimised for BAO measurements, while SKAO is not optimised for
interferometer cosmology and operates better in single-dish mode, where the
telescope beam limits access to the smaller scales that are covered by an
interferometer.

the cavity shape in a circumbinary disc. We compare locally isothermal and
radiatively cooled disc models to ones with a parametrised cooling timescale

slightly, leading to a change in the precession rate of the disc. With
$\beta$-cooled models, the shape and size of the cavity changes dramatically
towards values of $\beta$=1. Based on our findings, we introduce a parametrised
$\beta$ model that accounts for the shorter cooling timescale inside the cavity

evaluating several thermodynamic quantities. While all models considered here

fact be reconstructed from the parameters of a trained neural network
classifier. We propose a novel reconstruction scheme that stems from recent
theoretical results about the implicit bias in training neural networks with
gradient-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first
to show that reconstructing a large portion of the actual training samples from
a trained neural network classifier is generally possible. This has negative
implications on privacy, as it can be used as an attack for revealing sensitive
training data. We demonstrate our method for binary MLP classifiers on a few
standard computer vision datasets.

distances has until recently been difficult to measure due to the weakness of

of main-sequence star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 6.5 - 7.8$ surveyed for
[CII]$-158\mu$m emission as part of the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line
Survey (REBELS), using a recent calibration of the [CII]-to-HI conversion
factor. We find that the HI gas mass excess in galaxies increases as a function
of redshift, with an average of $M_{\rm HI} / M_\star \approx 10$,
corresponding to HI gas mass fractions of $f_{\rm HI} = M_{\rm HI} / (M_\star +
M_{\rm HI}) = 90\%$, at $z\approx 7$. Based on the [CII]-$158\mu$m luminosity
function (LF) derived from the same sample of galaxies, we further place
constraints on the cosmic HI gas mass density in galaxies ($\rho_{\rm HI}$) at
this redshift, which we measure to be $\rho_{\rm HI} = 7.1^{+6.4}_{-3.0} \times
10^{6}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$. This estimate is substantially lower by a
factor of $\approx 10$ than that inferred from an extrapolation of damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) measurements, and largely depend on the exact
[CII] LF adopted. However, we find this decrease in $\rho_{\rm HI}$ to be
consistent with recent simulations and argue that this apparent discrepancy is
likely a consequence of the DLA sightlines predominantly probing the
substantial fraction of HI gas in high-$z$ galactic halos, whereas [CII] traces
the HI in the ISM associated with star formation. We make predictions for this
build-up of neutral gas in galaxies as a function of redshift, showing that at
$z\gtrsim 5$ only $\approx 10\%$ of the cosmic HI gas content is confined in
galaxies and associated with the star-forming ISM.

learning systems to generalize well to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Most
efforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models
to capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in
the optimization process of these OOD objectives: i) Many OOD objectives have
to be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the
ease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the
original objective; ii) The penalty terms also require careful tuning of the
penalty weights due to the intrinsic conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives.
Consequently, these compromises could easily lead to suboptimal performance of
either the ERM or OOD objective. To address these issues, we introduce a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD
optimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto
Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD
objectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby
bridging the gaps caused by the relaxations. Then PAIR approaches a Pareto
optimal solution that trades off the ERM and OOD objectives properly. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks, WILDS, show that PAIR alleviates the
compromises and yields top OOD performances.

generative models built on the theory of Optimal Transport (OT) and the
Kantorovich duality. Despite the success of WGANs, it is still unclear how well
the underlying OT dual solvers approximate the OT cost (Wasserstein-1 distance,
$\mathbb{W}_{1}$) and the OT gradient needed to update the generator. In this
paper, we address these questions. We construct 1-Lipschitz functions and use
them to build ray monotone transport plans. This strategy yields pairs of
continuous benchmark distributions with the analytically known OT plan, OT cost
and OT gradient in high-dimensional spaces such as spaces of images. We
thoroughly evaluate popular WGAN dual form solvers (gradient penalty, spectral
normalization, entropic regularization, etc.) using these benchmark pairs. Even
though these solvers perform well in WGANs, none of them faithfully compute
$\mathbb{W}_{1}$ in high dimensions. Nevertheless, many provide a meaningful
approximation of the OT gradient. These observations suggest that these solvers
should not be treated as good estimators of $\mathbb{W}_{1}$, but to some
extent they indeed can be used in variational problems requiring the
minimization of $\mathbb{W}_{1}$.

training and contrastive learning for the first time by connecting it with the
conventional variational objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of our

dance-to-music generation, text-to-image synthesis, as well as
class-conditioned image synthesis. On each, we enhance the input-output

classical gravity is coupled to the expected value of a renormalized
stress-energy tensor of a free quantum field in the Bunch-Davies state. To
achieve this, we explicitly determine the stress-energy tensor associated with
the Bunch-Davies state using the recently proposed `moment approach' on the
cosmological coordinate patch of de Sitter space. From the energy component of
the SCE we thus obtain an analytic consistency equation for the model's
parameters which has to be fulfilled by solutions to the SCE. Using this
equation we then investigate the number of solutions and the structure of the
solution set in dependency on the coupling parameter of the quantum field to
the scalar curvature and renormalization constants using analytic arguments in
combination with numerical evidence. We also identify parameter sets where
multiple expansion rates separated by several orders of magnitude are possible.
Potentially for such parameter settings, a fast (semi-stable) expansion in the

spectrum deviation in the CM frame from a reference distribution (e.g.
Boltzmann distribution on transverse mass $m_t$) is interpreted to reveal a
flowing particle source. The ALICE collaboration has applied the BW model to
identified hadron (PID) spectra for four hadron species from 5 TeV $p$-Pb
collisions. From model fits BW parameters $T_{kin}$ (freeze-out temperature)
and $\langle \beta_t \rangle$ (transverse speed) are inferred that suggest
strong radial expansion in more-central $p$-Pb collisions. Such results from
the small $p$-Pb collision system are counterintuitive given that strong radial
expansion should be driven by large density gradients. The present study is
intended to address that problem. Several methods are employed to evaluate the
quality of the BW model data description, including logarithmic derivatives and
the Z-score statistic. The stability of the BW model definition across several
applications to data is investigated. The BW model data description is compare
to that of the two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) that has been previously
applied to the same $p$-Pb PID spectra. The general conclusion is that the BW
model is falsified by $p$-Pb PID spectrum data according to standard
statistical measures and that the fitted parameter values do not convey the
intended meaning. Statistically acceptable data descriptions provided by the
TCM indicate that other collision mechanisms (projectile-nucleon dissociation,
dijet production), that are consistent with conventional QCD, are more likely
responsible for observed spectrum characteristics.

Our observations achieved a spatial resolution of $3-13$ au and revealed an
edge-on disk structure with a size of $\sim80-100$ au. The emission at 0.87 and
2.1 mm is found to be optically thick within a projected disk radius of $
r_{\rm proj}\lesssim50$ au. The emission at 3.3 and 6.8 mm shows that the
power-law index of the dust opacity ($\beta$) is $\beta\sim1.7$ around $ r_{\rm

temperature ($T_{\rm dust}$) shows a steep decrease with $T_{\rm dust}\propto
r_{\rm proj}^{-2}$ outside of the VLA clumps previously identified at $r_{\rm

$Q\lesssim1.0$. These results suggest that the VLA clumps are formed via
gravitational instability, which creates a shadow on the outside of the

masses for the VLA clumps are $\gtrsim0.1$ $M_{\rm J}$. Thus, we suggest that
Class 0/I disks can be massive enough to be gravitationally unstable, which
might be the origin of gas-giant planets in a 20 au radius. Furthermore, the
protostellar disks can be cold due to shadowing.

To investigate the grain growth, we analyze dust continuum emission toward a
disk around the Class I protostar, L1489 IRS at 0.9 and 1.3 mm wavelengths
obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dust
continuum emission extends to a disk radius ($r$) of $r\sim300$ au, and the
spectral index ($\alpha$) is derived to be $\alpha\sim3.6$ at a radius of
$r\sim100-300$ au, as similar to the interstellar dust. Therefore, the grain
growth does not occur significantly in the outer disk ($r\sim100-300$ au).
Furthermore, we tentatively identify a ring-like substructure at $r\sim90$ au
even though the spatial resolution and sensitivity are not enough to determine
this structure. If this is the real ring structure, the ring position and small
dust in the disk outer part are consistent with the idea of the growth front.

the planet formation.

Generalization): a benchmark with 15 photo-realistic domains with the same
geometry, scene layout and camera parameters as the popular 3D ScanNet dataset,

this benchmark, we investigate the impact of each of these semantic shifts on
generalization independently. Visual recognition models easily generalize to
novel lighting, but struggle with distribution shifts in materials and

serve as a bridge to help models generalize across material and viewpoint
domain shifts and propose a context-aware vision transformer along with a
contrastive loss over material and viewpoint changes to address these domain
shifts. Our approach (dubbed as CDCNet) outperforms existing domain
generalization methods by over an 18% margin. As a critical benchmark, we also
conduct psychophysics experiments and find that humans generalize equally well
across lighting, materials and viewpoints. The benchmark and computational

generalization across domains and provide initial steps towards extrapolation
to semantic distribution shifts. We include all data and source code in the

actively prompt adults to take actions on their behalf even when they have only

reconstruction from sidescan. Sidescan sonar (SSS) intensities as a function of
range do contain some information about the slope of the seabed. However, that
information must be inferred. Additionally, the navigation system provides the
estimated trajectory, and normally the altitude along this trajectory is also
available. From these we obtain a very coarse seabed bathymetry as an input.
This is then combined with the indirect but high-resolution seabed slope
information from the sidescan to estimate the full bathymetry. This sparse
depth could be acquired by single-beam echo sounder, Doppler Velocity Log
(DVL), other bottom tracking sensors or bottom tracking algorithm from sidescan
itself. In our work, a fully convolutional network is used to estimate the
depth contour and its aleatoric uncertainty from the sidescan images and sparse
depth in an end-to-end fashion. The estimated depth is then used together with
the range to calculate the point's 3D location on the seafloor. A high-quality
bathymetric map can be reconstructed after fusing the depth predictions and the
corresponding confidence measures from the neural networks. We show the
improvement of the bathymetric map gained by using sparse depths with sidescan
over estimates with sidescan alone. We also show the benefit of confidence
weighting when fusing multiple bathymetric estimates into a single map.

evolution of complex dynamical systems. Such models, referred to as NN dynamic
models (NNDMs), use iterative noisy predictions of NN to estimate a
distribution of system trajectories over time. Despite their accuracy, safety
analysis of NNDMs is known to be a challenging problem and remains largely
unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a method of
providing safety guarantees for NNDMs. Our approach is based on stochastic
barrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov
functions with stability. We first show a method of synthesizing stochastic
barrier functions for NNDMs via a convex optimization problem, which in turn
provides a lower bound on the system's safety probability. A key step in our
method is the employment of the recent convex approximation results for NNs to
find piece-wise linear bounds, which allow the formulation of the barrier
function synthesis problem as a sum-of-squares optimization program. If the
obtained safety probability is above the desired threshold, the system is
certified. Otherwise, we introduce a method of generating controls for the
system that robustly maximizes the safety probability in a minimally-invasive
manner. We exploit the convexity property of the barrier function to formulate
the optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program. Experimental results
illustrate the efficacy of the method. Namely, they show that the method can
scale to multi-dimensional NNDMs with multiple layers and hundreds of neurons
per layer, and that the controller can significantly improve the safety
probability.

during the last decade to solve various decision-making problems such as
autonomous driving and robotics. However, these algorithms have faced great
challenges when deployed in safety-critical environments since they often
exhibit erroneous behaviors that can lead to potentially critical errors. One
way to assess the safety of DRL agents is to test them to detect possible
faults leading to critical failures during their execution. This raises the
question of how we can efficiently test DRL policies to ensure their
correctness and adherence to safety requirements. Most existing works on
testing DRL agents use adversarial attacks that perturb states or actions of
the agent. However, such attacks often lead to unrealistic states of the
environment. Their main goal is to test the robustness of DRL agents rather
than testing the compliance of agents' policies with respect to requirements.
Due to the huge state space of DRL environments, the high cost of test
execution, and the black-box nature of DRL algorithms, the exhaustive testing
of DRL agents is impossible. In this paper, we propose a Search-based Testing
Approach of Reinforcement Learning Agents (STARLA) to test the policy of a DRL
agent by effectively searching for failing executions of the agent within a
limited testing budget. We use machine learning models and a dedicated genetic
algorithm to narrow the search towards faulty episodes. We apply STARLA on
Deep-Q-Learning agents which are widely used as benchmarks and show that it
significantly outperforms Random Testing by detecting more faults related to
the agent's policy. We also investigate how to extract rules that characterize
faulty episodes of the DRL agent using our search results. Such rules can be
used to understand the conditions under which the agent fails and thus assess
its deployment risks.

expense of extremely low light efficiency for the probing mainlobe and
high-intensity sidelobes, which limits the applications in nanoscale imaging
and might cause misinterpretation of samples. Here we report a sharp probing
spot with the diffraction efficiency of 3.76% at the resolution of 38% of the
Airy spot size assisted by the two-dimensional multi-level diffractive optical
element (DOE) experimentally. The diffraction efficiency of DOE is improved by
at least two orders of magnitude at the same resolution by breaking the

metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) counterparts. At the same time, the
scalability and resource utilization of superconducting systems are major
concerns. Some of these concerns come from device-level challenges and the gap
between SCE and CMOS technology nodes, and others come from the way Josephson
Junctions (JJs) are used. Towards this end, we notice that a considerable
fraction of hardware resources are not involved in logic operations, but rather
are used for fan-out and buffering purposes. In this paper, we ask if there is
a way to reduce these overheads, propose the use of JJs at the cell boundaries
to increase the number of outputs that a single stage can drive, and establish
a set of rules to discretize critical currents in a way that is conducive to
this assignment. Finally, we explore the design trade-offs that the presented
approach opens up and demonstrate its promise through detailed analog
simulations and modeling analyses. Our experiments indicate that the introduced
method leads to a 48% savings in the JJ count for a tree with a fan-out of
1024, as well as an average of 43% of the JJ count for signal splitting and 32%
for clock splitting in ISCAS'85 benchmarks.

normal of the seabed. However, other factors such as seabed geometry as well as
its material composition also affect the return intensity. One can model these
intensity changes in a forward direction from the surface normals from
bathymetric map and physical properties to the measured intensity or
alternatively one can use an inverse model which starts from the intensities
and models the surface normals. Here we use an inverse model which leverages
deep learning's ability to learn from data; a convolutional neural network is
used to estimate the surface normal from the sidescan. Thus the internal
properties of the seabed are only implicitly learned. Once this information is
estimated, a bathymetric map can be reconstructed through an optimization
framework that also includes altimeter readings to provide a sparse depth
profile as a constraint. Implicit neural representation learning was recently
proposed to represent the bathymetric map in such an optimization framework. In
this article, we use a neural network to represent the map and optimize it
under constraints of altimeter points and estimated surface normal from
sidescan. By fusing multiple observations from different angles from several
sidescan lines, the estimated results are improved through optimization. We
demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the approach by reconstructing a
high-quality bathymetry using sidescan data from a large sidescan survey. We
compare the proposed data-driven inverse model approach of modeling a sidescan
with a forward Lambertian model. We assess the quality of each reconstruction
by comparing it with data constructed from a multibeam sensor.

data points per year are available to recognize a sufficient number of tidal
constituents to capture the trend of tidal changes on a yearly basis. To
address these issues, a novel Regularized Least-Square approach is developed to
relax the limitation to the range of satellite operating conditions. In this
method, the prior information of the regional tidal amplitudes is used to
support a least square analysis to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the
tidal constituents for water elevation time series of different lengths and
time intervals. Synthetic data experiments performed in Delaware Bay and
Galveston Bay showed that the proposed method can determine the tidal
amplitudes with high accuracy and the sampling interval can be extended to the
application level of major altimetry satellites. The proposed algorithm was
further validated using the data of the altimetry mission, Jason-3, to show its
applicability to irregular and noisy data. The new method could help identify
the changing tides with sea-level rise and anthropogenic activities in coastal
areas, informing coastal flooding risk assessment and ecosystem health

observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting
task, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial
nature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far
focused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes.
However, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental
data sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of
thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large
causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic
graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank
causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with
recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous
optimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables.
Additionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation
procedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based
on random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG
rank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is
much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus may be more suitable as a search
space in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to
assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a
scalable implementation of -DAG constrained causal discovery for
high-dimensional interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear
low-rank structural equation model and shows significant improvements compared
to state-of-the-art methods in both simulations as well as a recent large-scale
single-cell RNA sequencing data set with hundreds of genetic interventions.

the universe at redshift z >= 6. During this epoch, hydrogen atoms in the

However, it remains challenging to identify the major sources of the LyC
photons responsible for reionization. In particular, individual contributions
of quasars (or active galactic nuclei, AGNs) and galaxies are still under
debate. Here we construct the far-ultraviolet (far-UV) luminosity function for
type 1 quasars at z >= 6 that spans 10 magnitudes (-19 < M_UV < -29),
conclusively showing that quasars made a negligible contribution to
reionization. We mainly search for quasars in the low-luminosity range of M_UV
> -23 mag that is critical to determine quasars' total LyC photon production
but has been barely explored previously. We find that the quasar population can
only provide less than 7% (95% confidence level) of the total photons needed to
keep the universe ionized at z = 6.0 - 6.6. Our result suggests that galaxies,
presumably low-luminosity star-forming systems, are the major sources of
hydrogen reionization.

We show that the prior derandomization approach is almost maximally
metric-unfair, and that a simple ``random threshold'' derandomization achieves
optimal fairness preservation but with weaker output approximation. We then
devise a derandomization procedure that provides an appealing tradeoff between

locality-sensitive hash (LSH) family, then our derandomized $\hat{f}$ is, with
high probability, $O(\alpha)$-metric fair and a close approximation of $f$. We
also prove generic results applicable to all (fair and unfair) classifier

imprints and the constraints imposed by the string theory dualities and
symmetries on the effective field theory representations of quantum gravity.
The most celebrated example of this approach is mirror symmetry. Mirror
symmetry was first observed in worldsheet contructions of string
compactifications. It was completely unexpected from the effective field theory
point of view, and its implications in that context were astounding. In terms
of the moduli parameters of toroidally compactified Narain spaces, mirror
symmetry can be regarded as arising from mappings of the moduli of the internal
compactified space. Spinor-vector duality, which was discovered in worldsheet
constructions of string vacua, is an extension of mirror symmetry that arises
from mappings of the Wilson line moduli, and provide a probe to constrain and
explore the moduli spaces of $(2,0)$ string compactifications. Mirror symmetry
and spinor-vector duality are mere two examples of a much wider symmetry
structure, whose implications are yet to be unravelled. A mapping between
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric vacua is briefly discussed. $T$-duality
is another important property of string theory, and can be thought of as
phase-space duality in compact space. I propose that manifest phase-space
duality, and the related equivalence postulate of quantum mechanics, provide
the background independent overarching principles underlying quantum gravity.

algorithms that perform well on some distribution shifts fail on others, and no
state-of-the-art DG algorithm performs consistently well on all shifts.
Moreover, real-world data often has multiple distribution shifts over different
attributes; hence we introduce multi-attribute distribution shift datasets and
find that the accuracy of existing DG algorithms falls even further. To explain
these results, we provide a formal characterization of generalization under
multi-attribute shifts using a canonical causal graph. Based on the
relationship between spurious attributes and the classification label, we
obtain realizations of the canonical causal graph that characterize common
distribution shifts and show that each shift entails different independence
constraints over observed variables. As a result, we prove that any algorithm
based on a single, fixed constraint cannot work well across all shifts,
providing theoretical evidence for mixed empirical results on DG algorithms.
Based on this insight, we develop Causally Adaptive Constraint Minimization
(CACM), an algorithm that uses knowledge about the data-generating process to
adaptively identify and apply the correct independence constraints for
regularization. Results on fully synthetic, MNIST, small NORB, and Waterbirds
datasets, covering binary and multi-valued attributes and labels, show that
adaptive dataset-dependent constraints lead to the highest accuracy on unseen
domains whereas incorrect constraints fail to do so. Our results demonstrate
the importance of modeling the causal relationships inherent in the

neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical scenarios, but often demands tedious
computations to establish. The main hurdle lies in the massive amount of
non-linearity in large DNNs. To trade off the DNN expressiveness (which calls
for more non-linearity) and robustness certification scalability (which prefers
more linearity), we propose a novel solution to strategically manipulate
neurons, by ""grafting"" appropriate levels of linearity. The core of our
proposal is to first linearize insignificant ReLU neurons, to eliminate the
non-linear components that are both redundant for DNN performance and harmful
to its certification. We then optimize the associated slopes and intercepts of
the replaced linear activations for restoring model performance while
maintaining certifiability. Hence, typical neuron pruning could be viewed as a
special case of grafting a linear function of the fixed zero slopes and
intercept, that might overly restrict the network flexibility and sacrifice its
performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network backbones
show that our linearity grafting can (1) effectively tighten certified bounds;
(2) achieve competitive certifiable robustness without certified robust
training (i.e., over 30% improvements on CIFAR-10 models); and (3) scale up
complete verification to large adversarially trained models with 17M

fail, we show queried unlabeled data can continue to benefit, and seamlessly
extend CIL-QUD into its robustified versions, RCIL-QUD. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CIL-QUD achieves substantial accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and

scheme for the inextensible string equations is validated against available
experimental data for a falling chain and further employed to explore the
phenomenon. We determine that the discretization of the equations, equivalent
to the physically discrete problem of a chain, does not provide the

geometrically singular limit, a falling perfectly-folded string, accounts
surprisingly well for the scalings of several quantities in the numerics, but
can only indirectly suggest a behavior for the curvature, one which seems to
explain prior experimental data but does not correspond to the evolution of the

anomalously slow scaling. A simple model, incorporating only knowledge of the
initial conditions along with the anomalous and singular-limit scalings,
provides reasonable estimates for the amplifications of relevant quantities.

light on the study of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Not only did it
substantiate the assumption that SGRBs originate from binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers, but it also confirms that the jet generated by this type of merger
must be structured, hence the observed energy of an SGRB depends on the viewing
angle from the observer. However, the precise structure of the jet is still
subject to debate. Moreover, whether a single unified jet model can be applied
to all SGRBs is not known. Another uncertainty is the delay timescale of BNS
mergers with respect to star formation history of the Universe. In this paper,
we conduct a global test of both delay and jet models of BNS mergers across a
wide parameter space with simulated SGRBs. We compare the simulated peak flux,
redshift and luminosity distributions with the observed ones and test the
goodness-of-fit for a set of models and parameter combinations. Our simulations
suggest that GW170817/GRB 170817A and all SGRBs can be understood within the
framework of a universal structured jet viewed at different viewing angles.
Furthermore, models invoking a jet plus cocoon structure with a lognormal delay
timescale is most favored. Some other combinations (e.g. a Gaussian delay with
a power-law jet model) are also acceptable. However, the Gaussian delay with
Gaussian jet model and the entire set of power-law delay models are disfavored.

rationale generator to reveal salient features about graph
instance-discrimination as the rationale, and then creates rationale-aware

the backbone model with the powerful representation ability, further
facilitating the fine-tuning on downstream tasks. On MNIST-Superpixel and MUTAG

lack computational models explaining such language use. To address this
challenge, we formalize learning from language in a contextual bandit setting
and ask how a human might communicate preferences over behaviors. We study two
distinct types of language: $\textit{instructions}$, which provide information
about the desired policy, and $\textit{descriptions}$, which provide
information about the reward function. We show that the agent's degree of
autonomy determines which form of language is optimal: instructions are better
in low-autonomy settings, but descriptions are better when the agent will need
to act independently. We then define a pragmatic listener agent that robustly
infers the speaker's reward function by reasoning about $\textit{how}$ the
speaker expresses themselves. We validate our models with a behavioral
experiment, demonstrating that (1) our speaker model predicts human behavior,
and (2) our pragmatic listener successfully recovers humans' reward functions.
Finally, we show that this form of social learning can integrate with and
reduce regret in traditional reinforcement learning. We hope these insights
facilitate a shift from developing agents that $\textit{obey}$ language to
agents that $\textit{learn}$ from it.

  Training and Hyper-training","Accepted by ICML 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Recently, Optimization-Derived Learning (ODL) has attracted attention from
learning and vision areas, which designs learning models from the perspective
of optimization. However, previous ODL approaches regard the training and
hyper-training procedures as two separated stages, meaning that the
hyper-training variables have to be fixed during the training process, and thus
it is also impossible to simultaneously obtain the convergence of training and
hyper-training variables. In this work, we design a Generalized
Krasnoselskii-Mann (GKM) scheme based on fixed-point iterations as our
fundamental ODL module, which unifies existing ODL methods as special cases.
Under the GKM scheme, a Bilevel Meta Optimization (BMO) algorithmic framework
is constructed to solve the optimal training and hyper-training variables
together. We rigorously prove the essential joint convergence of the
fixed-point iteration for training and the process of optimizing
hyper-parameters for hyper-training, both on the approximation quality, and on
the stationary analysis. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of BMO with
competitive performance on sparse coding and real-world applications such as
image deconvolution and rain streak removal.

  Series Classification","Accepted to ICPR 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain generalization methods aim to learn models robust to domain shift with
data from a limited number of source domains and without access to target
domain samples during training. Popular domain alignment methods for domain
generalization seek to extract domain-invariant features by minimizing the
discrepancy between feature distributions across all domains, disregarding
inter-domain relationships. In this paper, we instead propose a novel
representation learning methodology that selectively enforces prediction
consistency between source domains estimated to be closely-related.
Specifically, we hypothesize that domains share different class-informative
representations, so instead of aligning all domains which can cause negative
transfer, we only regularize the discrepancy between closely-related domains.
We apply our method to time-series classification tasks and conduct
comprehensive experiments on three public real-world datasets. Our method
significantly improves over the baseline and achieves better or competitive

  Comparisons of Replicated Studies",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context. Recently, a family of studies highlighted the unpopularity of
software testing careers among undergraduate students in software engineering
and computer science courses. The original study and its replications explored
the perception of students in universities in four countries (Cana-da, China,
India, and Malaysia), and indicated that most students do not consider a career
in software testing as an option after graduation. This scenario represents a
problem for the software industry since the lack of skilled testing
professionals might decrease the quality of software projects and increase the
number of unsuccessful projects. Goal. The present study aims to replicate, in
Brazil, the studies conducted in the other four countries to establish
comparisons and support the development of strategies to improve the visibility
and importance of software testing among undergraduate students across the
globe. Method. We followed the same protocol in the original study to collect
data using a questionnaire and analyzed the answers using descriptive
statistics and qualitative data analysis. Results. Our findings indicate
similarities among the results obtained in Brazil in comparison to those
obtained from other countries. We observed that students are not motivated to
follow a testing career in the software industry based on a belief that testing
activities lack challenges and opportunities for continuous learning.
Conclusions. In summary, students seem to be interested in learning more about
software testing. However, the lack of discussions about the theme in software
development courses, as well as the limited offer of courses focused on
software quality at the university level reduce the visibility of this area,
which causes a decrease in the interest in this career.

between the spectral and Frobenius norms of tensors, has received considerable
attention in recent years. While most values are unknown for real and complex
tensors, the asymptotic order of magnitude and tight lower bounds have been
established. However, little is known about nonnegative tensors. In this paper,
we present an almost complete picture of the ratio for nonnegative tensors. In
particular, we provide a tight lower bound that can be achieved by a wide class
of nonnegative tensors under a simple necessary and sufficient condition, which
helps to characterize the extreme tensors and obtain results such as the
asymptotic order of magnitude. We show that the ratio for symmetric tensors is
no more than that for general tensors multiplied by a constant depending only
on the order of tensors, hence determining the asymptotic order of magnitude
for real, complex, and nonnegative symmetric tensors. We also find that the
ratio is in general different to the minimum ratio between the Frobenius and
nuclear norms for nonnegative tensors, a sharp contrast to the case for real
tensors and complex tensors.

the generalization properties of overparameterized models. Many existing tools
rely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees
that the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class
of candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple
linear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be
vacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings
where UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in
two such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear
classification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth
function learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime. We
prove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise
threshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in
these two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while
any model that achieves at least a $(1 - \epsilon)$-fraction of the max-margin
generalizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail
terribly. Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under
slightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical
margin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides
insight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in
this challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,
near-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable
components and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence
of the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal
margin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.

are fed into attention blocks to explore global temporal correlations, followed
by a series of upsampling and convolution layers. Finally, the resulting

non-NVIDIA devices, CuPBoP does not require manual modification of the CUDA

than existing frameworks (56.6%) on the Rodinia benchmark. In particular, for
CPU backends, CuPBoP supports several ISAs (e.g., X86, RISC-V, AArch64) and has
close or even higher performance compared with other projects. We also compare

learning field, the goal of which is to group nodes with similar
representations into the same cluster without human annotations. Recent studies
based on graph contrastive learning method have achieved remarkable results
when exploit graph-structured data. However, most existing methods 1) do not
directly address the clustering task, since the representation learning and
clustering process are separated; 2) depend too much on data augmentation,
which greatly limits the capability of contrastive learning; 3) ignore the
contrastive message for clustering tasks, which adversely degenerate the
clustering results. In this paper, we propose a Neighborhood Contrast Framework
for Attributed Graph Clustering, namely NCAGC, seeking for conquering the
aforementioned limitations. Specifically, by leveraging the Neighborhood
Contrast Module, the representation of neighbor nodes will be 'push closer' and
become clustering-oriented with the neighborhood contrast loss. Moreover, a
Contrastive Self-Expression Module is built by minimizing the node
representation before and after the self-expression layer to constraint the
learning of self-expression matrix. All the modules of NCAGC are optimized in a
unified framework, so the learned node representation contains
clustering-oriented messages. Extensive experimental results on four attributed
graph datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NCAGC compared with 16
state-of-the-art clustering methods. The code is available at

essential component in a dialogue system. However, the research of dialogue
state tracking has largely been limited to unimodality, in which slots and slot

restaurant name and price range) and are defined by specific database schema.
In this paper, we propose to extend the definition of dialogue state tracking
to multimodality. Specifically, we introduce a novel dialogue state tracking
task to track the information of visual objects that are mentioned in
video-grounded dialogues. Each new dialogue utterance may introduce a new video
segment, new visual objects, or new object attributes, and a state tracker is
required to update these information slots accordingly. We created a new
synthetic benchmark and designed a novel baseline, Video-Dialogue Transformer
Network (VDTN), for this task. VDTN combines both object-level features and
segment-level features and learns contextual dependencies between videos and
dialogues to generate multimodal dialogue states. We optimized VDTN for a state
generation task as well as a self-supervised video understanding task which
recovers video segment or object representations. Finally, we trained VDTN to
use the decoded states in a response prediction task. Together with
comprehensive ablation and qualitative analysis, we discovered interesting

of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for determining the ground

results show that the duplicate circuit approach performs superior to the QEC
method in the presence of the hardware noise. A significant impact of
cross-talk noise was observed when multiple mappings of the duplicate circuit
and the QEC method were implemented simultaneously $-$ again the duplicate
circuit approach overall performed better than the QEC method. To gain further
insights into the performance of the studied error mitigation techniques, we
also performed quantum simulations on IBM system with varying strengths of
depolarising circuit noise and read-out errors which further supported the main

realistic operations. To address this issue, this work adopts control barrier
functions over reinforcement learning, and proposes a compensated algorithm to
completely maintain safety. Specifically, a sum-of-squares programming has been
exploited to search for the optimal controller, and tune the learning
hyperparameters simultaneously. Thus, the control actions are pledged to be
always within the safe region. The effectiveness of proposed method is
demonstrated via an inverted pendulum model. Compared to quadratic programming
based reinforcement learning methods, our sum-of-squares programming based
reinforcement learning has shown its superiority.

applications by relying on extremely large and heavily overparameterized neural
networks. However, such networks have been shown to be very brittle, not
generalize well to new uses cases, and are often difficult if not impossible to
deploy on resources limited platforms. Model pruning, i.e., reducing the size
of the network, is a widely adopted strategy that can lead to more robust and
generalizable network -- usually orders of magnitude smaller with the same or
even improved performance. While there exist many heuristics for model pruning,
our understanding of the pruning process remains limited. Empirical studies
show that some heuristics improve performance while others can make models more
brittle or have other side effects. This work aims to shed light on how
different pruning methods alter the network's internal feature representation,
and the corresponding impact on model performance. To provide a meaningful
comparison and characterization of model feature space, we use three geometric
metrics that are decomposed from the common adopted classification loss. With
these metrics, we design a visualization system to highlight the impact of
pruning on model prediction as well as the latent feature embedding. The
proposed tool provides an environment for exploring and studying differences
among pruning methods and between pruned and original model. By leveraging our
visualization, the ML researchers can not only identify samples that are
fragile to model pruning and data corruption but also obtain insights and

class imbalance, that is highly skewed datasets where non buggy modules
dominate the buggy modules. In the past, data resampling approaches have been
applied to within-projects defect prediction models to help alleviate the
negative effects of class imbalance in the datasets. To address the class

The authors' examined six defect prediction models on 34 datasets extracted

be compressed so far until they buckle, adopting an intrinsically bent state
that may be unable to bear a compressive load. In the low-temperature limit and
for a constant compressive force, Euler buckling theory predicts a sudden
transition from a compressed to a bent state in these slender rods. In this
paper, we use a mean-field theory to show that if a semiflexible chain is
compressed at a finite temperature with a fixed end-to-end distance (permitting
fluctuations in the compressive forces), it exhibits a continuous phase
transition to a buckled state at a critical level of compression, and we
determine a quantitatively accurate prediction of the transverse position
distribution function of the midpoint of the chain that indicates the
transition. We find the mean compressive forces are non-monotonic as the
extension of the filament varies, consistent with the observation that strongly
buckled filaments are less able to bear an external load. We also find that for
the fixed extension (isometric) ensemble that the buckling transition does not
coincide with the local minimum of the mean force (in contrast to Euler
buckling). We also show the theory is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
length, and that the buckling transition can still be accurately recovered by
accounting for those fluctuations. These predictions may be useful in
understanding the behavior of filamentous biomolecules compressed by

standout advantages: (i) it does not require any sophisticated algorithms to

A smaller size of the defect in the broken-symmetry block gives rise to the
resonance with a larger Q factor. Importantly, this relationship can be tuned
by changing the structural parameter, resulting from the modulation of the
topological configuration of BICs. Consequently, a Q factor of more than 3,000

sharp resonance, the intensity of the third harmonic generation signal in the
patterned structure can be 368 times larger than that of the flat silicon film.

in three key examples of regularized regression estimators: the Ridge, Lasso
and regularized robust regression estimators, where new universality properties
of risk asymptotics and/or distributions of regression estimators and other
related quantities are proved. As a major statistical implication of the Lasso
universality results, we validate inference procedures using the
degrees-of-freedom adjusted debiased Lasso under general design and error
distributions. We also provide a counterexample, showing that universality
properties for regularized regression estimators do not extend to general
isotropic designs.

spectroscopically derived atmospheric parameters for more than five million

parallax-based distances to compute, via an isochrone fitting method, the ages,
initial stellar masses and reddenings for the stars with spectroscopic

pericentre and Zmax) for all of the stars with measured radial velocities and
astrometry, adopting two sets of line-of-sight distances from the literature
and an axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy. Comparisons with reference
catalogues of field and cluster stars suggest that reliable ages are obtained
for stars younger than 9-10Gyr when the estimated relative age uncertainty is
<50%. For older stars, ages tend to be under-estimated. The most reliable
stellar type for age determination are turn-off stars, even when the input
atmospheric parameters have large uncertainties. Ages for giants and
main-sequence stars are retrieved with uncertainties of ~2Gyr when extinction
towards the star's line-of sight is smaller than A_V<2.5mag. The full catalogue

time-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate
time-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on
point predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts
distributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also
impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution
which does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works
also silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given
hierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show
deviation from this assumption. We close both these gaps and propose PROFHIT,
which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly
models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHIT uses a flexible
probabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency
regularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast
distribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to
datasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHIT over wide
range of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and
calibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full distribution, we observed
that PROFHIT can robustly provide reliable forecasts even if up to 10% of input
time-series data is missing where other methods' performance severely degrade

the distance matching condition, the critical transition positions on the slow

strengths are obtained. The critical transition positions on the slow manifold
with non-monotonic potential differences exhibit a staircase-like dependence on
the noise strength, which is also revealed by the stepwise change in the period
of the stochastic periodic orbit. The noise-tuned bursting is more coherent
within each step while displaying mixed-mode oscillations near the boundaries
between the steps. When noise is large enough, noise-induced trapping of the
slow variable can be observed, where the number of coexisting traps increases
with the noise strength. It is argued that the robustness of SISR underlies the

on the Small-Sized Telescope (SST) and Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) designs
from CTA. Angular resolution improved with larger baseline distances up to 277m
between telescopes, and energy thresholds were lower at 1000m altitude than at
0m. The $\sim$300 GeV energy threshold of MSTs proved more suitable for
observing transients than the $\sim$1.2 TeV threshold of SSTs. An array of four
MSTs at 1000m was estimated to give a 5.7$\sigma$ detection of an RS
Ophiuchi-like nova eruption from a 4-hour observation. We conclude that an
array of four MST-class IACTs at an Australian site would ideally complement
the capabilities of CTA.

address observability of a hypothetical class of neutron stars -- HOt and Fast
Non Accreting Rotators, HOFNARs. These objects are heated due to the r-mode
instability. With surface temperatures $\sim 10^6$~K they are expected to be
thermal soft X-ray emitters. We perform a population synthesis modeling of
HOFNARs to predict the number of potentially detectable sources in the eROSITA
all-sky survey. For surface temperatures $\sim 10^6$~K we obtain $\sim 500$
sources above the detection limit 0.01~cts~s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 100$ easier
identifiable sources with $>0.1$~cts~s$^{-1}$. Temperatures $\gtrsim 1.2\times
10^6$~K start to be in contradiction with non-detection of HOFNARs by ROSAT.
Only for $T\lesssim 5\times 10^5$~K numbers predicted for eROSITA turn out to
be so low that identification does not look possible. We conclude that eROSITA
has good chances to discover HOFNARs, if they exist. Non-detection will put
very stringent limits on the properties of this type of neutron stars.

high-density LiDAR is a critical research problem because of the expense of
LiDAR systems compared to cameras and other sensors. Recent research has
developed a variety of camera-only methods, where features are differentiably
""lifted"" from the multi-camera images onto the 2D ground plane, yielding a
""bird's eye view"" (BEV) feature representation of the 3D space around the

topics by embedding them to a homogeneous feature space, which shows higher
interpretability. However, there are no explicit constraints for the training
of embeddings, leading to a larger optimization space. Also, a clear
description of the changes in embeddings and the impact on model performance is
still lacking. In this paper, we propose an embedding regularized neural topic
model, which applies the specially designed training constraints on word
embedding and topic embedding to reduce the optimization space of parameters.
To reveal the changes and roles of embeddings, we introduce \textbf{uniformity}
into the embedding-based neural topic model as the evaluation metric of
embedding space. On this basis, we describe how embeddings tend to change
during training via the changes in the uniformity of embeddings. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the impact of changes in embeddings in embedding-based neural
topic models through ablation studies. The results of experiments on two
mainstream datasets indicate that our model significantly outperforms baseline
models in terms of the harmony between topic quality and document modeling.
This work is the first attempt to exploit uniformity to explore changes in
embeddings of embedding-based neural topic models and their impact on model
performance to the best of our knowledge.

an enhanced production of PBHs and GWs in such cosmologies, which may lead to
observable in principle patterns in the profile of GWs during the radiation

Dark Matter in this Universe. For comparison, we also discuss a two-stage

activity in the cortex, starting from the generic Hodgkin-Huxley equations for
microscopic cell dynamics. For simplicity, and to maintain focus on the
essential elements of the derivation, the discussion is confined to excitatory
neural fields. The fundamental assumption of the procedure is that mesoscale
processes are macroscopic with respect to cell-scale activity, and emerge as
the average behavior of a large population of cells. Because of their duration,
action-potential details are assumed not observable at mesoscale; the essential
mesoscopic function of action potentials is to redistribute energy in the
neural field. The Hodgkin-Huxley dynamical model is first reduced to a set of
equations that describe subthreshold dynamics. An ensemble average over a cell
population then produces a closed system of equations involving two mesoscopic
state variables: the density of kinetic energy J, carried by sodium ionic
currents, and the excitability H of the neural field, which could be described
as the average state of gating variable h. The resulting model is represented
as essentially a subthreshold process; and the dynamical role of the firing
rate is naturally reassessed as describing energy transfers. The linear
properties of the equations are consistent with expectations for the dynamics
of excitatory neural fields: the system supports oscillations of progressive
waves, with shorter waves typically having higher frequencies, propagating
slower, and decaying faster. Extending the derivation to include more complex
cell dynamics (e.g., including other ionic channels, e.g., calcium channels)
and multiple-type, excitatory-inhibitory, neural fields is straightforward, and
will be presented elsewhere.

performance, via characterising the image set in terms of a non-singular
covariance matrix on a symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. To adapt to
complicated visual scenarios better, several Riemannian networks (RiemNets) for
SPD matrix nonlinear processing have recently been studied. However, it is
pertinent to ask, whether greater accuracy gains can be achieved by simply
increasing the depth of RiemNets. The answer appears to be negative, as deeper
RiemNets tend to lose generalization ability. To explore a possible solution to
this issue, we propose a new architecture for SPD matrix learning.
Specifically, to enrich the deep representations, we adopt SPDNet [1] as the
backbone, with a stacked Riemannian autoencoder (SRAE) built on the tail. The
associated reconstruction error term can make the embedding functions of both
SRAE and of each RAE an approximate identity mapping, which helps to prevent
the degradation of statistical information. We then insert several
residual-like blocks with shortcut connections to augment the representational
capacity of SRAE, and to simplify the training of a deeper network. The
experimental evidence demonstrates that our DreamNet can achieve improved
accuracy with increased depth of the network.

by a continuity equation and a chosen constitutive law. The latter, depending
on the problem at hand, may be a nonlinear relation between the fluid's
pressure gradient and velocity. The actual shape of this relation is normally
chosen at the outset of the problem, even though, in practice, the fluid may
experience velocities outside of its range of applicability. We propose here an
adaptive model, so that the most appropriate law is locally selected depending
on the computed velocity. From the analytical point of view, we show
well-posedness of the problem when the law is monotone in velocity and show
existence in one space dimension otherwise. From the computational point of
view, we present a new approach based on regularizing via mollification the
underlying dissipation, i.e., the power lost by the fluid to the porous medium
through drag. The resulting regularization is shown to converge to the original
problem using $\Gamma$-convergence on the dissipation in the monotone case.
This approach gives rise to a variational numerical scheme which applies to
very general problems and which we validate on three test cases.

in the kinematic space which are a specific class of convex realisations of the
associahedron. These realisations are obtained by scaling and translating the
kinematic space associahedron discovered by by Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan
(ABHY). We call the resulting polytopes, deformed realisations of the
associahedron. The deformed realisations shed new light on the CHY formula. One
of the striking discoveries in [2] was the fact that the CHY scattering
equations generate diffeomorphism between the (compactified) CHY moduli space
and the ABHY associahedron. As we argue, the deformed realisation of the
associahedron can also be interpreted as an diffeomorphic image of the CHY
moduli space under scattering equations that we call deformed scattering
equations. The canonical form in the kinematic space is thus once again the
push-forward of the Parke-Taylor form . A natural off-shoot of our analysis is
the universality of the Parke-Taylor form as a CHY Integrand for a class of
(tree-level and planar) multi-scalar field amplitudes. These ideas help us in
proving the existence of positive geometries for certain specific multi-scalar
interactions. We prove that in a field theory with a massless and a massive
bi-adjoint scalar fields which interact via cubic interaction, the tree-level
S-matrix with massless external states and at most one massive propagator is a
weighted sum over the canonical forms defined by certain deformed realisations
of the associahedron. Finally, we show that these ideas admit an extension to
one-loop. In particular, the one loop S-matrix integrand with at most one
massive propagator is a weighted sum over canonical forms of a family of
deformed realisations of the type-D cluster polytope, discovered in [3,4].

Network (TFN) we propose a graph structure for the analysis of research topic
flows between scientific authors and their respective research fields.
  Based on a multi-graph and a topic model, our proposed network structure
accounts for intratopic as well as intertopic flows. Our method requires for
the construction of a TFN solely a corpus of publications (i.e., author and
abstract information). From this, research topics are discovered automatically
through non-negative matrix factorization. The thereof derived TFN allows for
the application of social network analysis techniques, such as common metrics
and community detection. Most importantly, it allows for the analysis of
intertopic flows on a large, macroscopic scale, i.e., between research topic,
as well as on a microscopic scale, i.e., between certain sets of authors.
  We demonstrate the utility of TFNs by applying our method to two
comprehensive corpora of altogether 20 Mio. publications spanning more than 60
years of research in the fields computer science and mathematics. Our results
give evidence that TFNs are suitable, e.g., for the analysis of topical

applications, which usually requires integrating multimodal streams including
visual, verbal and acoustic behaviors. To improve the robustness of multimodal
fusion, some of the existing methods let different modalities communicate with
each other and modal the crossmodal interaction via transformers. However,
these methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction
but forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels
of semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by
transformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data. In this
paper, we propose a multi-scale cooperative multimodal transformer (MCMulT)
architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis. On the whole, the ""multi-scale""
mechanism is capable of exploiting the different levels of semantic information
of each modality which are used for fine-grained crossmodal interactions.
Meanwhile, each modality learns its feature hierarchies via integrating the
crossmodal interactions from multiple level features of its source modality. In
this way, each pair of modalities progressively builds feature hierarchies
respectively in a cooperative manner. The empirical results illustrate that our
MCMulT model not only outperforms existing approaches on unaligned multimodal
sequences but also has strong performance on aligned multimodal sequences.

from the point of view of realization of topological edge solitons because they
do not require external or artificial magnetic fields or longitudinal
modulations of the underlying potential for the emergence of the topological
phases. Here we report on the diverse types of vector valley Hall edge solitons
forming at the domain walls between superhoneycomb lattices, including
bright-dipole, bright-tripole, dark-bright, and dark-dipole solitons. In
contrast to conventional scalar topological solitons, such vector states can be
constructed as envelope solitons on the edge states from different branches and
with different Bloch momenta. Such vector solitons can be remarkably robust,
they show stable long-distance propagation and can bypass sharp bends of the
domain wall. The existence of the counter-propagating valley Hall edge solitons
at the same domain wall allows us to study their structural robustness upon
collisions that can be nearly elastic. Our results illustrate richness of
soliton families in the valley Hall systems and open new prospects for the

significant progress in deep learning models and their ability to effectively

refining model, which uses an attention-on-attention mechanism to extract the

combining the desired signals constructively at receivers, thereby
significantly enhancing the performance of communication system. In this paper,
we consider a green multi-user multi-antenna cellular network, where multiple
RISs are deployed to provide energy-efficient communication service to end
users. We jointly optimize the phase shifts of RISs, beamforming of the base
stations, and the active RIS set with the aim of minimizing the power
consumption of the base station (BS) and RISs subject to the quality of service
(QoS) constraints of users and the transmit power constraint of the BS.
However, the problem is mixed combinatorial and non-convex, and there is a
potential infeasibility issue when the QoS constraints cannot be guaranteed by
all users. To deal with the infeasibility issue, we further investigate a user
admission control problem to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, RIS
phase shifts, and the admitted user set. Specifically, we first decompose the
original non-convex problem into several rank-one constrained optimization
subproblems via matrix lifting. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is then
developed to solve each decomposed subproblem. The proposed AO framework
efficiently minimizes the power consumption of wireless networks as well as
user admission control when the QoS constraints cannot be guaranteed by all
users. To further address the complexity-sensitive issue for practical
implementation, we propose an alternative low-complexity beamforming and RISs
phase shifts design algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) to enable the green

improve their performance further by utilizing the architectural advantages of

tasks for SSL do not enjoy the benefit, i.e., they are architecture-agnostic.
In particular, we focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which have gained much
attention recently as a better architectural choice, often outperforming
convolutional networks for various visual tasks. The unique characteristic of
ViT is that it takes a sequence of disjoint patches from an image and processes
patch-level representations internally. Inspired by this, we design a simple
yet effective visual pretext task, coined SelfPatch, for learning better
patch-level representations. To be specific, we enforce invariance against each
patch and its neighbors, i.e., each patch treats similar neighboring patches as
positive samples. Consequently, training ViTs with SelfPatch learns more
semantically meaningful relations among patches (without using human-annotated
labels), which can be beneficial, in particular, to downstream tasks of a dense
prediction type. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that it can
significantly improve the performance of existing SSL methods for various
visual tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.
Specifically, SelfPatch significantly improves the recent self-supervised ViT,
DINO, by achieving +1.3 AP on COCO object detection, +1.2 AP on COCO instance
segmentation, and +2.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

segmentation arts of learning with noisy labels merely perform a pixel-wise
manner to preserve semantics, such as pixel-wise label correction, but neglect
the pair-wise manner. In fact, we observe that the pair-wise manner capturing
affinity relations between pixels can greatly reduce the label noise rate.
Motivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective for noisy
mitigation by incorporating both pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, where
supervisions are derived from noisy class and affinity labels, respectively.
Unifying the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, we propose a robust Joint
Class-Affinity Segmentation (JCAS) framework to combat label noise issues in
medical image segmentation. Considering the affinity in pair-wise manner
incorporates contextual dependencies, a differentiated affinity reasoning (DAR)
module is devised to rectify the pixel-wise segmentation prediction by
reasoning about intra-class and inter-class affinity relations. To further
enhance the noise resistance, a class-affinity loss correction (CALC) strategy
is designed to correct supervision signals via the modeled noise label
distributions in class and affinity labels. Meanwhile, CALC strategy interacts
the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners through the theoretically derived
consistency regularization. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and

neural network parameter space to control forgetting. Contemporary Continual
Learning (CL) methods focus on training neural networks efficiently from a
stream of data, while reducing the negative impact of catastrophic forgetting,
yet they do not provide any firm guarantees that network performance will not
deteriorate uncontrollably over time. In this work, we show how to put bounds
on forgetting by reformulating continual learning of a model as a continual
contraction of its parameter space. To that end, we propose Hyperrectangle
Training, a new training methodology where each task is represented by a
hyperrectangle in the parameter space, fully contained in the hyperrectangles
of the previous tasks. This formulation reduces the NP-hard CL problem back to
polynomial time while providing full resilience against forgetting. We validate
our claim by developing InterContiNet (Interval Continual Learning) algorithm
which leverages interval arithmetic to effectively model parameter regions as
hyperrectangles. Through experimental results, we show that our approach
performs well in a continual learning setup without storing data from previous
tasks.

$M$-ary frequency-modulated differential chaos shift keying (RIS-$M$-FM-DCSK)
schemes. In scheme I, the RIS is regarded as a transmitter at the source to
incorporate the $M$-ary phase-shift-keying ($M$-PSK) symbols into the FM
chaotic signal and to reflect the resultant $M$-ary FM chaotic signal toward
the destination. The information bits of the source are carried by both the
positive/negative state of the FM chaotic signal and the $M$-PSK symbols. In
scheme II, the RIS is treated as a relay so that both the source and relay can
simultaneously transmit their information bits to the destination. The
information bits of the source and relay are carried by the positive/negative
state of the FM chaotic signal and $M$-PSK symbols generated by the RIS,
respectively. The proposed RIS-$M$-FM-DCSK system has an attractive advantage
that it does not require channel state information for detection, thus avoiding
complex channel estimation. Moreover, we derive the theoretical expressions for
bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed RIS-$M$-FM-DCSK system with both scheme
I and scheme II over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Simulations results
not only verify the accuracy of the theoretical derivations, but also
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system. The proposed
RIS-$M$-FM-DCSK system is a promising low-cost, low-power, and high-reliability
alternative for wireless communication networks.

inferring, from data, the diffusion and kinetic parameters that describe these
stochastic processes. In this work, we investigate a multi-state diffusion
process that arises in the context of single particle tracking (SPT), wherein
the motion of a particle is governed by a discrete set of diffusive states, and
the tendency of the particle to switch between these states is modeled as a
random process. We consider two models for this behavior: a mixture model and a
hidden Markov model (HMM). For both, we adopt a Bayesian approach to sample the
distributions of the underlying parameters and implement a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) scheme to compute the posterior distributions, as in Das, Cairo,
Coombs (2009). The primary contribution of this work is a study of the
robustness of this method to infer parameters of a three-state HMM, and a
discussion of the challenges and degeneracies that arise from considering three
states. Finally, we investigate the problem of determining the number of
diffusive states using model selection criteria. We present results from
simulated data that demonstrate proof of concept, as well as apply our method
to experimentally measured single molecule diffusion trajectories of monomeric
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) on a synthetic target membrane where
it can associate with its binding partner protein kinase C alpha isoform
(PKC$\alpha$) to form a heterodimer detected by its significantly lower
diffusivity.

that, unlike electric power, heat has different grades and cannot be considered
as homogenized commodity. Accordingly, an energy-grade double pricing rule is
proposed in this paper. Heat energy and grade prices are explained as the
shadow prices related to the nodal heat balance constraints and temperature
requirements constraints at the optimal solution. The resulting merchandise
surplus at each dispatch interval can be decomposed into several explainable
parts, namely, congestion rent, impact from the last period, and impact from
the upcoming period. And the total merchandise surplus over all dispatch
intervals can be decomposed into several non-negative interpretable parts,
including congestion rent and impact from the initial state, thus guaranteeing
the revenue adequacy for the heat system operator. Simulations verify the
effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

solved with techniques known as ensembles (use of several machine learning

in terms of computational capacity, making it impossible to deploy them in IoT

complexity of mismatching devices (the audios provided are recorded by
different sources of information). This technical report makes a comparative

this study, the temperature dependent photocarrier dynamics in Cd3As2 film has
been investigated with time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy. The experimental
results demonstrate that photoexcitation results in abrupt increase in THz
photoconductivity, and the subsequent relaxation shows a single exponential
relaxation for various temperatures and pump fluences. The relaxation time
increase from 4.7 ps at 5 K to 7.5 ps at 220 K, while the lifetime remains
almost constant of ~7.5 ps with temperature above 220 K. A Rothwarf-Taylor
model was employed to fit the temperature dependent relaxation time, and a
narrow energy gap of ~35 meV is obtained, which occurs around the Dirac node.
Our THz spectroscopy results demonstrate that the photocarrier relaxation in
Cd3As2 shows a semiconductor-like behavior, rather than hot carrier scatterings

scales. With several upcoming surveys, it is expected that there will be a
many-fold increase in the quantity and quality of data, and hence it is
important to develop efficient simulations to forward model these data sets.
One such semi-numerical method is based on the assumption that the baryonic
densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. In
this work, we test the robustness of the lognormal model of the Ly$\alpha$
forest in recovering a set of IGM parameters by comparing with high-resolution
Sherwood SPH simulations. We study the recovery of the parameters $T_0$

verify the validity of our results at different baryon smoothing filter, SNR,
box size & resolution, and data seed and confirm that the lognormal model can
be used as an efficient tool for modelling the Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux at

rule termed OptiNet (Kontorovich, Sabato, and Urner 2016; Kontorovich, Sabato,
and Weiss 2017; Hanneke et al. 2021). Beyond its computational merits, this
rule has been recently shown to be universally consistent in any metric
instance space that admits a universally consistent rule--the first learning
algorithm known to enjoy this property. However, its error and compression
rates have been left open. Here we derive such rates in the case where
instances reside in Euclidean space under commonly posed smoothness and tail
conditions on the data distribution. We first show that OptiNet achieves
non-trivial compression rates while enjoying near minimax-optimal error rates.
We then proceed to study a novel general compression scheme for further
compressing prototype rules that locally adapts to the noise level without
sacrificing accuracy. Applying it to OptiNet, we show that under a geometric
margin condition, further gain in the compression rate is achieved.
Experimental results comparing the performance of the various methods are

different outflow stages, a quiescent one and a more active one. We try to
model that phenomenon. Aims. We have performed new 2.5D magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations of the possible accretion-outflow environment of RY Tau based on
analytical solutions to reduce the relaxation time. Methods. We used as initial
conditions the analytical self-similar solution we used to model the RY Tau
micro jet. In the closed field line region of the magnetosphere we have
reversed the direction of the flow and increased the accretion rate by
increasing the density and the velocity. We have also implemented the heating
rate and adjusted it according to the velocity of the flow. The accretion disk
is treated as a boundary condition. Results. The simulations show that the
stellar jet and the accreting magnetosphere attain a steady state in only a few
stellar rotations, confirming the robustness and stability of self-similar
solutions. Additionally, two types of behavior were observed similar to the one
observed in RY Tau. Either the steady stellar outflow and magnetospheric inflow
are separated by a low static force free region or the interaction between the
stellar jet and the magnetospheric accretion creates coronal episodic mass
ejections originating from the disk and bouncing back onto the star.
Conclusions. The ratio of mass loss rate to mass accretion rate that coincides
with the change of behaviour observed in RY Tau, lays within the range of
ratios that have been measured during the period of the micro jet initial
analysis.

  Reinforcement Learning Approaches",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  To understand the real world using various types of data, Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the most used technique nowadays. While finding the
pattern within the analyzed data represents the main task. This is performed by
extracting representative features step, which is proceeded using the
statistical algorithms or using some specific filters. However, the selection
of useful features from large-scale data represented a crucial challenge. Now,
with the development of convolution neural networks (CNNs), the feature
extraction operation has become more automatic and easier. CNNs allow to work
on large-scale size of data, as well as cover different scenarios for a
specific task. For computer vision tasks, convolutional networks are used to
extract features also for the other parts of a deep learning model. The
selection of a suitable network for feature extraction or the other parts of a
DL model is not random work. So, the implementation of such a model can be
related to the target task as well as the computational complexity of it. Many
networks have been proposed and become the famous networks used for any DL
models in any AI task. These networks are exploited for feature extraction or
at the beginning of any DL model which is named backbones. A backbone is a
known network trained in many other tasks before and demonstrates its
effectiveness. In this paper, an overview of the existing backbones, e.g. VGGs,
ResNets, DenseNet, etc, is given with a detailed description. Also, a couple of
computer vision tasks are discussed by providing a review of each task
regarding the backbones used. In addition, a comparison in terms of performance
is also provided, based on the backbone used for each task.

$2\ln N+D$ for the single-magnon states, two-magnon bound states and two-magnon
continuum, respectively, based on the Bethe ansatz solutions of the
ferromagnetic spin chain with $N$ sites. The $\ln N$ divergence for the bound
states reveals the two magnons emerge as a new quasiparticle. More importantly,
the nonzero intercepts ($D_k,D$) embody the many-body effects of two-magnon
states. In particular, an exact relation between the intercept of EEs and an
observable quantity, the two-magnon distance, is established for the bound
states. In such a case, we quantify the two-magnon confinement in a spin system
by the increasing entanglement with the distance as a particle physics
analogue. Moreover, the EEs can also be used to study the evolution of the
excitations. When the bound states are immersed in the continuum in the
alternating chain, they undergo an oscillating confinement-deconfinement
crossover, shown by the oscillations of the EEs and two-magnon distance with

to Alzheimer's disease is a significant clinical challenge. Longitudinal
variations and complementary information inherent in longitudinal and
multimodal data are crucial for MCI conversion prediction, but persistent issue
of missing data in these data may hinder their effective application.
Additionally, conversion prediction should be achieved in the early stages of
disease progression in clinical practice, specifically at baseline visit (BL).
Therefore, longitudinal data should only be incorporated during training to
capture disease progression information. To address these challenges, a
multi-view imputation and cross-attention network (MCNet) was proposed to
integrate data imputation and MCI conversion prediction in a unified framework.
First, a multi-view imputation method combined with adversarial learning was
presented to handle various missing data scenarios and reduce imputation
errors. Second, two cross-attention blocks were introduced to exploit the
potential associations in longitudinal and multimodal data. Finally, a
multi-task learning model was established for data imputation, longitudinal
classification, and conversion prediction tasks. When the model was
appropriately trained, the disease progression information learned from
longitudinal data can be leveraged by BL data to improve MCI conversion
prediction at BL. MCNet was tested on two independent testing sets and
single-modal BL data to verify its effectiveness and flexibility in MCI
conversion prediction. Results showed that MCNet outperformed several
competitive methods. Moreover, the interpretability of MCNet was demonstrated.
Thus, our MCNet may be a valuable tool in longitudinal and multimodal data
analysis for MCI conversion prediction. Codes are available at

effectively capture such global semantic similarities among entities. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, which introduces a set of

Exact nonnegative matrix factorization (Exact NMF) decomposes $R$ as the
product of two nonnegative matrices, $C$ and $S$ with $r$ columns, such as $R =

which such a decomposition is unique/identifiable, up to trivial ambiguities.
In this paper, we focus on partial identifiability, that is, the uniqueness of
a subset of columns of $C$ and $S$. We start our investigations with the
data-based uniqueness (DBU) theorem from the chemometrics literature. The DBU
theorem analyzes all feasible solutions of Exact NMF, and relies on sparsity
conditions on $C$ and $S$. We provide a mathematically rigorous theorem of a
recently published restricted version of the DBU theorem, relying only on
simple sparsity and algebraic conditions: it applies to a particular solution
of Exact NMF (as opposed to all feasible solutions) and allows us to guarantee
the partial uniqueness of a single column of $C$ or $S$. Second, based on a
geometric interpretation of the restricted DBU theorem, we obtain a new partial
identifiability result. This geometric interpretation also leads us to another
partial identifiability result in the case $r=3$. Third, we show how partial
identifiability results can be used sequentially to guarantee the
identifiability of more columns of $C$ and $S$. We illustrate these results on
several examples, including one from the chemometrics literature.

merger dynamics presents a surprisingly simple behaviour consistent with
effective linearity. On the other hand, energy loss through the event horizon
and by scattering to infinity renders the system non-conservative. Hence, the
infinitesimal generator of the (effective) linear dynamics is a non-selfadjoint

differentiable manner. The rendered images include realistic shading with
specular reflection, optical distortion, defocus and motion blur, color
alteration, imaging noise, and shape deformation of markers. Lastly, a trained
marker detector seeks the regions of interest and recognizes multiple marker
patterns simultaneously via inverse deformation transformation. The deformable
marker creator and detector networks are jointly optimized via the
differentiable photorealistic renderer in an end-to-end manner, allowing us to
robustly recognize a wide range of deformable markers with high accuracy. Our
deformable marker system is capable of decoding 36-bit messages successfully at

trapped gas-phase molecular ions. A brief description of the theory and
experimental approaches involved in fluorescence spectroscopy, together with
state-of-the-art LIFS experiments employing ion traps, is presented. Quadrupole
ion traps are commonly used for spatial confinement of ions. One of the main
challenges involved in such experiments is poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
arising due to weak gas-phase fluorescence emission, high background noise, and
small solid angle for the fluorescence collection optics. The experimental
approaches based on the integrated high-finesse optical cavities provide a
better (typically an order of magnitude more) SNR in the detected fluorescence
than the single-pass detection schemes. Another key to improving the SNR is to
exploit the maximum solid angle of light collection by choosing high numerical
aperture (NA) collection optics. The latter part of the review summarises the
current state-of-the-art intrinsic fluorescence measurement techniques employed
for gas-phase studies. Also, the scope of these recent advances in LIFS
instrumentation for detailed spectral characterisation of a fluorophore of weak
gas-phase fluorescence emission is discussed, considering fluorescein as one
example.

by the reflection of X-rays from the corona off the accretion disc that feeds

electrons, coupled with accretion disc fluctuations give rise to the highly

relativistic reflection model RELXILL and explore parameter correlations. The
known scaling relationship between the black hole mass and time lag is well
recovered and the continuum flux is coupled strongly to the disc reflection
flux. We also find that 1H 0707-495 and IRAS 13224-3809 are well described
using reflection and absorption modelling in a variety of flux states. The
reflection fraction is strongly coupled to the power law photon index and may
be linked to dynamics of the emitting region. The data reveals hints of the
power law evolutionary turnover when the 2 - 10 keV Eddington fraction is
$\sim0.02$, the origin of which is not fully understood. Finally, we report the
covering fraction is inversely correlated with the flux and power law photon

Empathy is the active attempt by humans to get inside the interlocutor in

prosody features for predicting appropriate dialogue context. As such, it can
be regarded as an extension of the conventional linguistic-feature-based
dialogue history modeling. To train the empathetic DSS model effectively, we
investigate 1) a self-supervised learning model pretrained with large speech

utterance to be predicted by the dialogue context embedding, 3) a cross-modal
attention to combine text and speech modalities, and 4) a sentence-wise

prosodic contexts of the dialogue history does not improve the quality of
speech in empathetic DSS and 2) introducing style-guided training and
sentence-wise embedding modeling achieves higher speech quality than that by
the conventional method.

crystallinity with short-range order; the defects result in a high density of
trap states that limit the device performance. Despite the extensive electronic
applications of CuSCN, its defect properties have not been studied in detail.
Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, pristine CuSCN prepared from the
standard diethyl sulfide-based recipe is found to contain under-coordinated Cu
atoms, pointing to the presence of SCN vacancies. A defect passivation strategy
is introduced by adding solid I$_2$ to the processing solution. At small
concentrations, the iodine is found to exist as I$^-$ which can substitute for
the missing SCN$^-$ ligand, effectively healing the defective sites and
restoring the coordination around Cu. Applying I$_2$-doped CuSCN as a p-channel
in thin-film transistors shows that the hole mobility increases by more than
five times at the optimal doping concentration of 0.5 mol%. Importantly, the
on/off current ratio and the subthreshold characteristics also improve as the
I$_2$ doping method leads to the defect healing effect while avoiding the
creation of detrimental impurity states. An analysis of the capacitance-voltage
characteristics corroborates that the trap state density is reduced upon I$_2$
addition. The contact resistance and bias-stress stability of the devices also
improve. This work shows a simple and effective route to improve hole transport
properties of CuSCN which is applicable to wide-ranging electronic and
optoelectronic applications.

the current work are inclusion of quasars from more recent catalogs and
consideration of a realistic observing strategy for a dedicated redshift drift
experiment that maximizes $\dot{v}/\sigma_{\dot{v}}$. We find that using a
dedicated facility and our designed observing plan, the redshift drift can be
detected at $3\sigma$ significance in 15 years with a 25m telescope, given a
spectrograph with long term stability with $R=50,000$ and 25% total system

quasars, with observing time weighted based upon $\dot{v}/\sigma_{\dot{v}}$ and
object visibility. This optimized strategy leads to a 9% decrease in the

neighboring quantum dots in a chain via both electron tunneling and crossed
Andreev reflection. While both processes have been observed in semiconducting
nanowires and carbon nanotubes, crossed-Andreev interaction was neither easily
tunable nor strong enough to induce coherent hybridization of dot states. Here
we demonstrate the simultaneous presence of all necessary ingredients for an
artificial Kitaev chain: two spin-polarized quantum dots in an InSb nanowire
strongly coupled by both elastic co-tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection.

is predicted to appear. At this sweet spot, the transport characteristics
satisfy the theoretical predictions for such a system, including pairwise
correlation, zero charge, and stability against local perturbations of the
Majorana state. While the simple system presented here can be scaled to

existing studies consider the time interval information among items, which is
essential in the sequential recommendation for characterizing different items

a new graph-based solution, namely TiDA-GCN, to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we first link users and items in each domain as a graph. Then, we
devise a domain-aware graph convolution network to learn userspecific node

items, two effective attention mechanisms are further developed to selectively
guide the message passing process. Moreover, to further enhance item- and

a large number of applications. In particular, leverage scores, which relate
the columns of a matrix to the subspaces spanned by its leading singular
vectors, are helpful in revealing column subsets to approximately factorize a
matrix with quality guarantees. As such, they provide a solid foundation for a
variety of machine-learning methods. In this paper we extend the definition of
leverage scores to relate the columns of a matrix to arbitrary subsets of
singular vectors. We establish a precise connection between column and
singular-vector subsets, by relating the concepts of leverage scores and
principal angles between subspaces. We employ this result to design
approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for two well-known problems:
generalized column subset selection and sparse canonical correlation analysis.
We run numerical experiments to provide further insight on the proposed
methods. The novel bounds we derive improve our understanding of fundamental
concepts in matrix approximations. In addition, our insights may serve as
building blocks for further contributions.

Kolmogorov-Hinze framework. Yet, a quantitative theory is lacking at higher
concentrations when strong interactions between the phases and coalescence
become relevant, which is common in most flows. Here, we address this issue
through a fully-coupled numerical study of the droplet dynamics in a turbulent
flow at high Reynolds number. By means of time-space spectral statistics, not
currently accessible to experiments, we demonstrate that the characteristic
scale of the process, the Hinze scale, can be precisely identified as the scale
at which the net energy exchange due to capillarity is zero. Droplets larger
than this scale preferentially break up absorbing energy from the flow; smaller
droplets, instead, undergo rapid oscillations and tend to coalesce releasing
energy to the flow. Further, we link the droplet-size-distribution with the
probability distribution of the turbulent dissipation. This shows that key in
the fragmentation process is the local flux of energy which dominates the
process at large scales, vindicating its locality.

(BNSP) with unequal viscosities are given. The space-time estimate of electric
field $\nabla\phi$ is the most important thing when deducing generalized
Huygens' principle for BNSP since this estimate only can be obtained by
$\nabla\phi=\frac{\nabla}{\Delta}(\rho-n)$ from the Poisson equation. Thus, it
requires to prove that the space-time estimate of $\rho-n$ only contains
diffusion wave. The appearance of these unequal coefficients results that one
cannot follow ideas for the special case, where the original system was
rewritten as a compressible NS system and a compressible (unipolar) NSP system
after a linear combination of unknowns. This linear combination brings special
structure for nonlinear terms, and this structure was also used to get desired
space-time estimate for $\rho-n$. Moreover, Green's function of the subsystem
NSP does not contain Huygens wave is equally important in [36]. However, for
the general case, the benefits from this linear combination will not exist any
longer. First, we have to directly consider an $8\times8$ Green's matrix of the
original system. Second, all of entries in Green's function in low frequency
actually contain wave operators. This generally produces the Huygens' wave for
each entry in Green's function, as a result, one cannot achieve that the
space-time estimate of $\rho-n$ only contains the diffusion wave as usual. We
overcome this difficulty by taking more detailed spectral analysis and
developing new estimates arising from subtle cancellations in Green's function.
Third, due to loss of the special structure of nonlinear terms from the linear
combination, we shall develop new nonlinear convolution estimates such that we
can ultimately obtain the expected space-time estimate for $\nabla\phi$ and
further verify the generalized Huygens' principle.

Noetherian spectrum, something that should be contrasted with the fact that
these rings are not Noetherian in general; a lower-bound to the dimension of

viscous flow over the surface of the microcrystals. This surprising, unusual

of a rescaled NN in terms of a Gaussian stochastic process; ii) the study of
the large-width training dynamics of NNs, which characterizes the infinitely
wide dynamics in terms of a deterministic kernel, referred to as the neural
tangent kernel (NTK), and shows that, for a sufficiently large width, the

we consider these problems for $\alpha$-Stable NNs, namely NNs whose weights
are initialized as $\alpha$-Stable distributions with $\alpha\in(0,2]$. First,
for $\alpha$-Stable NNs with a ReLU activation function, we show that if the
NN's width goes to infinity then a rescaled NN converges weakly to an
$\alpha$-Stable stochastic process. As a difference with respect to the
Gaussian setting, our result shows that the choice of the activation function
affects the scaling of the NN, that is: to achieve the infinitely wide
$\alpha$-Stable process, the ReLU activation requires an additional logarithmic
term in the scaling with respect to sub-linear activations. Then, we study the
large-width training dynamics of $\alpha$-Stable ReLU-NNs, characterizing the
infinitely wide dynamics in terms of a random kernel, referred to as the
$\alpha$-Stable NTK, and showing that, for a sufficiently large width, the
gradient descent achieves zero training error at a linear rate. The randomness
of the $\alpha$-Stable NTK is a further difference with respect to the Gaussian

not applicable when the dynamics of the system are unknown. We propose a

finite number of trajectories. The growth bound together with the sampled
trajectories are then used to construct the abstraction and synthesise a

  Our approach casts the computation of the growth bound as a robust convex
optimisation program (RCP). Since the unknown dynamics appear in the
optimisation, we formulate a scenario convex program (SCP) corresponding to the
RCP using a finite number of sampled trajectories. We establish a sample
complexity result that gives a lower bound for the number of sampled
trajectories to guarantee the correctness of the growth bound computed from the
SCP with a given confidence. We also provide a sample complexity result for the
satisfaction of the specification on the system in closed loop with the
designed controller for a given confidence. Our results are founded on
estimating a bound on the Lipschitz constant of the system and provide
guarantees on satisfaction of both finite and infinite-horizon specifications.
We show that our data-driven approach can be readily used as a model-free

distributions in a sample of 219 local galaxies. We introduce a new adaptive
binning technique to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of weak lines, which we
use to produce well-filled metallicity maps for these galaxies. We show that
the two-point correlation functions computed from the metallicity distributions
after removing radial gradients are in most cases well described by a simple
injection-diffusion model. Fitting the data to this model yields the
correlation length $l_{\rm corr}$, which describes the characteristic
interstellar medium mixing length scale. We find typical correlation lengths
$l_{\rm corr} \sim 1$ kpc, with a strong correlation between $l_{\rm corr}$ and
stellar mass, star formation rate, and effective radius, a weak correlation
with Hubble type, and significantly elevated values of $l_{\rm corr}$ in
interacting or merging galaxies. We show that the trend with star formation
rate can be reproduced by a simple transport+feedback model of interstellar
medium turbulence at high star formation rate, and plausibly also at low star
formation rate if dwarf galaxy winds have large mass-loading factors. We also
report the first measurements of the injection width that describes the initial
radii over which supernova remnants deposit metals. Inside this radius the
metallicity correlation function is not purely the product of a competition
between injection and diffusion. We show that this size scale is generally
smaller than 60 pc.

of the superposition principle. In this article we show that the right choice
of basis to be used to estimate coherence is the separable basis. The quantum
coherence estimated using the Bell basis does not represent the coherence in
the system, since there is a coherence in the system due to the choice of the
basis states. We first compute the entanglement and quantum coherence in the
two qubit mixed states prepared using the Bell states and one of the states
from the computational basis. The quantum coherence is estimated using the
l1-norm of coherence, the entanglement is measured using the concurrence and
the mixedness is measured using the linear entropy. Then we estimate these
quantities in the Bell basis and establish that coherence should be measured
only in separable basis, whereas entanglement and mixedness can be measured in
any basis. We then calculate the teleportation fidelity of these mixed states
and find the regions where the states have a fidelity greater than the
classical teleportation fidelity. We also examine the violation of the
Bell-CHSH inequality to verify the quantum nonlocal correlations in the system.
The estimation of the above mentioned quantum correlations, teleportation
fidelity and the verification of Bell-CHSH inequality is also done for
bipartite states obtained from the tripartite systems by the tracing out of one
of their qubits. We find that for some of these states teleportation is
possible even when the Bell-CHSH inequality is not violated, signifying that
nonlocality is not a necessary condition for quantum teleportation.

phase and obtain the approximate analytical description of thermal motions
caused by a source on an isotopic defect of an arbitrary mass in a 1D harmonic
crystal. It is well known that localized oscillation is possible in this system
in the case of a light defect. We consider the unsteady heat propagation and
obtain formulae, which provide continualization (everywhere excepting a
neighbourhood of a defect) and asymptotic uncoupling of the thermal motion into
the sum of the slow and fast components. The slow motion is related with
ballistic heat transport, whereas the fast motion is energy oscillation related
with transformation of the kinetic energy into the potential one and in the
opposite direction. To obtain the propagating component of the fast and slow
motions we estimate the exact solution in the integral form at a moving point
of observation. We demonstrate that the propagating parts of the slow and the
fast motions are ""anti-localized"" near the defect. The physical meaning of the
anti-localization is a tendency for the unsteady propagating wave-field to
avoid a neighbourhood of a defect. The effect of anti-localization increases
with the absolute value of the difference between the alternated mass and the
mass of a regular particle, and, therefore, more energy concentrates just
behind the leading wave-front of the propagating component. The obtained
solution is valid in a wide range of a spatial co-ordinate (i.e., a particle
number), everywhere excepting a neighbourhood of the leading wavefront.

vision. In most methods, the density maps are generated by convolving with a
Gaussian kernel from the ground-truth dot maps which are marked around the
center of human heads. Due to the fixed geometric structures in CNNs and
indistinct head-scale information, the head features are obtained incompletely.
Deformable convolution is proposed to exploit the scale-adaptive capabilities
for CNN features in the heads. By learning the coordinate offsets of the
sampling points, it is tractable to improve the ability to adjust the receptive
field. However, the heads are not uniformly covered by the sampling points in
the deformable convolution, resulting in loss of head information. To handle
the non-uniformed sampling, an improved Normed-Deformable Convolution
(\textit{i.e.,}NDConv) implemented by Normed-Deformable loss
(\textit{i.e.,}NDloss) is proposed in this paper. The offsets of the sampling
points which are constrained by NDloss tend to be more even. Then, the features
in the heads are obtained more completely, leading to better performance.

computation burden with Deformable Convolution. In the extensive experiments,

on SCSR are mainly based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Neural
Network (GNN) but they ignore the fact that although multiple users share a
single account, it is mainly occupied by one user at a time. This observation
motivates us to learn a more accurate user-specific account representation by
attentively focusing on its recent behaviors. Furthermore, though existing
works endow lower weights to irrelevant interactions, they may still dilute the
domain information and impede the cross-domain recommendation. To address the
above issues, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, namely
RL-ISN, which consists of a basic cross-domain recommender and a reinforcement
learning-based domain filter. Specifically, to model the account representation
in the shared-account scenario, the basic recommender first clusters users'
mixed behaviors as latent users, and then leverages an attention model over
them to conduct user identification. To reduce the impact of irrelevant domain
information, we formulate the domain filter as a hierarchical reinforcement
learning task, where a high-level task is utilized to decide whether to revise
the whole transferred sequence or not, and if it does, a low-level task is
further performed to determine whether to remove each interaction within it or
not. To evaluate the performance of our solution, we conduct extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our RL-ISN method compared with the

  on Extending Database Technology (EDBT), 28th March-31st March, 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.DB cs.IR stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) in high dimensional spaces is
crucial for many real-life applications (e.g., e-commerce, web, multimedia,
etc.) dealing with an abundance of data. This paper proposes an end-to-end
learning framework that couples the partitioning (one critical step of ANNS)
and learning-to-search steps using a custom loss function. A key advantage of
our proposed solution is that it does not require any expensive pre-processing
of the dataset, which is one of the critical limitations of the
state-of-the-art approach. We achieve the above edge by formulating a
multi-objective custom loss function that does not need ground truth labels to
quantify the quality of a given data-space partition, making it entirely
unsupervised. We also propose an ensembling technique by adding varying input
weights to the loss function to train an ensemble of models to enhance the
search quality. On several standard benchmarks for ANNS, we show that our
method beats the state-of-the-art space partitioning method and the ubiquitous
K-means clustering method while using fewer parameters and shorter offline
training times. We also show that incorporating our space-partitioning strategy
into state-of-the-art ANNS techniques such as ScaNN can improve their
performance significantly. Finally, we present our unsupervised partitioning
approach as a promising alternative to many widely used clustering methods,
such as K-means clustering and DBSCAN.

\boldsymbol{\eta}$, where an adversary oblivious to the design $X \in
\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ may choose $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ to corrupt all but a
(possibly vanishing) fraction of the observations $\boldsymbol{y}$ in an
arbitrary way. Recent work [dLN+21, dNS21] has introduced efficient algorithms
for consistent recovery of the parameter vector. These algorithms crucially
rely on the design matrix being well-spread (a matrix is well-spread if its
column span is far from any sparse vector).
  In this paper, we show that there exists a family of design matrices lacking
well-spreadness such that consistent recovery of the parameter vector in the
above robust linear regression model is information-theoretically impossible.
  We further investigate the average-case time complexity of certifying
well-spreadness of random matrices. We show that it is possible to efficiently
certify whether a given $n$-by-$d$ Gaussian matrix is well-spread if the number
of observations is quadratic in the ambient dimension. We complement this
result by showing rigorous evidence -- in the form of a lower bound against
low-degree polynomials -- of the computational hardness of this same
certification problem when the number of observations is $o(d^2)$.

  Recordings",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE q-bio.NC stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neuroscientists and neuroengineers have long relied on multielectrode neural
recordings to study the brain. However, in a typical experiment, many factors
corrupt neural recordings from individual electrodes, including electrical
noise, movement artifacts, and faulty manufacturing. Currently, common practice
is to discard these corrupted recordings, reducing already limited data that is
difficult to collect. To address this challenge, we propose Deep Neural
Imputation (DNI), a framework to recover missing values from electrodes by
learning from data collected across spatial locations, days, and participants.
We explore our framework with a linear nearest-neighbor approach and two deep
generative autoencoders, demonstrating DNI's flexibility. One deep autoencoder
models participants individually, while the other extends this architecture to
model many participants jointly. We evaluate our models across 12 human
participants implanted with multielectrode intracranial electrocorticography
arrays; participants had no explicit task and behaved naturally across hundreds
of recording hours. We show that DNI recovers not only time series but also
frequency content, and further establish DNI's practical value by recovering
significant performance on a scientifically-relevant downstream neural decoding
task.

and having the Schwarzschild--de-Sitter (SdS) metric as a solution in the
Einstein gauge, we consider whether one may conformally rescale this solution
to obtain flat rotation curves, such as those observed in galaxies, without the
need for dark matter. Contrary to recent claims in the literature, we show that
if one works in terms of quantities that can be physically measured, then in
any conformal frame the trajectories followed by `ordinary' matter particles
are merely the timelike geodesics of the SdS metric, as one might expect. This
resolves the apparent frame dependence of physical predictions and
unambiguously yields rotation curves with no flat region. We also show that
attempts to model rising rotation curves by fitting the coefficient of the
quadratic term in the SdS metric individually for each galaxy are precluded,
since this coefficient is most naturally interpreted as proportional to a
global cosmological constant. We further extend our analysis beyond static,
spherically-symmetric systems to show that the invariance of particle dynamics
to the choice of conformal frame holds for arbitrary metrics, again as
expected. Moreover, we show that this conclusion remains valid for conformally
invariant gravity theories defined on more general Weyl--Cartan spacetimes,
which include Weyl, Riemann--Cartan and Riemannian spacetimes as special cases.

electron microscopy and been used to demonstrate efficient electron phase
modulation and electron-photon correlations. Here, we quantitatively analyze
the feasibility of high fidelity and high purity quantum state heralding using
a free electron and a photonic integrated circuit with parametric coupling, and
propose schemes to shape useful electron and photonic states in different
application scenarios. Adopting a dissipative quantum electrodynamics
treatment, we formulate a framework for the coupling of free electrons to
waveguide spatial-temporal modes. To avoid multimode-coupling induced state
decoherence, we show that with proper waveguide design, the interaction can be
reduced to a single-mode coupling to a quasi-TM00 mode. In the single-mode
coupling limit, we go beyond the conventional state ladder treatment, and show
that the electron-photon energy correlations within the ladder subspace can
still lead to a fundamental purity and fidelity limit on complex optical and
electron state preparations through heralding schemes. We propose applications
that use this underlying correlation to their advantage, but also show that the
imposed limitations for general applications can be overcome by using photonic
integrated circuits with an experimentally feasible interaction length, showing
its promise as a platform for free-electron quantum optics.

an alternative approach to the long-standing joint source-channel coding (JSCC)
problem. Very promising initial results, superior to popular digital schemes
that utilize separate source and channel codes, have been demonstrated for
wireless image and video transmission using deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, end-to-end training of such schemes requires a differentiable channel
input representation; hence, prior works have assumed that any complex value
can be transmitted over the channel. This can prevent the application of these
codes in scenarios where the hardware or protocol can only admit certain sets
of channel inputs, prescribed by a digital constellation. Herein, we propose
DeepJSCC-Q, an end-to-end optimized JSCC solution for wireless image
transmission using a finite channel input alphabet. We show that DeepJSCC-Q can
achieve similar performance to prior works that allow any complex valued
channel input, especially when high modulation orders are available, and that
the performance asymptotically approaches that of unconstrained channel input
as the modulation order increases. Importantly, DeepJSCC-Q preserves the
graceful degradation of image quality in unpredictable channel conditions, a
desirable property for deployment in mobile systems with rapidly changing
channel conditions.

  Representation Learning Perspective","Preprint",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class incremental learning (CIL) is the process of continually learning new
object classes from incremental data while not forgetting past learned classes.
While the common method for evaluating CIL algorithms is based on average test
accuracy for all learned classes, we argue that maximizing accuracy alone does
not necessarily lead to effective CIL algorithms. In this paper, we
experimentally analyze neural network models trained by CIL algorithms using
various evaluation protocols in representation learning and propose a new
analysis method. Our experiments show that most state-of-the-art algorithms
prioritize high stability and do not significantly change the learned
representation, and sometimes even learn a representation of lower quality than
a naive baseline. However, we observe that these algorithms can still achieve
high test accuracy because they learn a classifier that is closer to the
optimal classifier. We also found that the base model learned in the first task
varies in representation quality across different algorithms, and changes in
the final performance were observed when each algorithm was trained under
similar representation quality of the base model. Thus, we suggest that
representation-level evaluation is an additional recipe for more objective
evaluation and effective development of CIL algorithms.

gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Such a source normally consists of a
stellar-mass black hole (BH) and a Kerr supermassive BH (SMBH), but recent
astrophysical models predict that the small body could also be a stellar-mass
binary BH (BBH). A BBH reaching several gravitational radii of a SMBH will
induce rich observable signatures in the waveform, but the current numerical
tools are insufficient to simulate such a triple system while capturing the
essential relativistic effects. Here we solve the problem by studying the
dynamics in a frame freely falling alongside the BBH. Since the BBH is normally
non-relativistic and much smaller than the curvature radius of the Kerr
background, the evolution in the free-fall frame reduces to essentially
Newtonian dynamics, except for a perturbative gravito-electromagnetic (GEM)
force induced by the curved background. We use this method to study the BBHs on
near-circular orbits around a SMBH and track their evolution down to a distance
of $2-3$ gravitational radii from the SMBH. Our simulations reveal a series of
dynamical effects which are not shown in the previous studies using
conventional methods. The most notable one is a radial oscillation and
azimuthal drift of the BBH relative to the SMBH. These results provide new
insight into the evolution and detection of the EMRIs containing BBHs.

this parameter. We first show that this parameter is related to list coloring

to color dominating vertices, chromatic numbers and degree of vertices, are

optimization with privacy protection, we propose a private variant of online
Frank-Wolfe algorithm with recursive gradients for variance reduction to update

differential privacy analysis, our online algorithm achieves in linear time the
optimal excess risk when $1<p\leq 2$ and the state-of-the-art excess risk
meeting the non-private lower ones when $2<p\leq\infty$. Our algorithm can also
be extended to the case $p=1$ to achieve nearly dimension-independent excess
risk. While previous variance reduction results on recursive gradient have
theoretical guarantee only in the independent and identically distributed
sample setting, we establish such a guarantee in a non-stationary setting. To

expressed as partially or fully discretized Gaussian linear regressions.
Besides including basic Gaussian response settings, this class also encompasses
probit, multinomial probit and tobit regression, among others, thereby yielding
to one of the most widely-implemented families of models in applications. The
relevance of such representations has stimulated decades of research in the
Bayesian field, mostly motivated by the fact that, unlike for Gaussian linear
regression, the posterior distribution induced by such models does not seem to
belong to a known class, under the commonly-assumed Gaussian priors for the
coefficients. This has motivated several solutions for posterior inference
relying on sampling-based strategies or on deterministic approximations that,
however, still experience computational and accuracy issues, especially in high
dimensions. The scope of this article is to review, unify and extend recent
advances in Bayesian inference and computation for this class of models. To
address such a goal, we prove that the likelihoods induced by these
formulations share a common analytical structure that implies conjugacy with a
broad class of distributions, namely the unified skew-normals (SUN), that
generalize Gaussians to skewed contexts. This result unifies and extends recent
conjugacy properties for specific models within the class analyzed, and opens
avenues for improved posterior inference, under a broader class of formulations
and priors, via novel closed-form expressions, i.i.d. samplers from the exact
SUN posteriors, and more accurate and scalable approximations from VB and EP.
Such advantages are illustrated in simulations and are expected to facilitate
the routine-use of these core Bayesian models, while providing a novel
framework to study theoretical properties and develop future extensions.

field due to their potential for classifying neuropsychiatric disorders.
However, the diagnostic predictive power of the existing algorithms has been
limited by small sample sizes, lack of representativeness, data leakage, and/or
overfitting. Here, we overcome these limitations with the largest multi-site
sample size to date (n=5,356) to provide a generalizable ML classification
benchmark of major depressive disorder (MDD). Using brain measures from
standardized ENIGMA analysis pipelines in FreeSurfer, we were able to classify
MDD vs healthy controls (HC) with around 62% balanced accuracy, but when
harmonizing the data using ComBat balanced accuracy dropped to approximately
52%. Similar results were observed in stratified groups according to age of
onset, antidepressant use, number of episodes and sex. Future studies
incorporating higher dimensional brain imaging/phenotype features, and/or using
more advanced machine and deep learning methods may achieve more encouraging
prospects.

the estimation of their energy storage capacity as measured by the quality
factor (Q) is crucial. However, in MR with high/ultra-high Q, the surface-wall
roughness dominates the intrinsic Q and generates a coupling between
counter-propagating modes. This splits the usual sharp single resonance and
makes difficult the use of classical methods to assess Q. Here, we
theoretically show that an interferometric excitation can be exploited in a
Cavity Ring-Down (CRD) method to measure the ultimate Q of a MR. In fact, under
suitable conditions, the resonant doublet merges into a single Lorentzian and
the time dynamics of the MR assumes the usual behavior of a single-mode
resonator unaffected by backscattering. This allows obtaining a typical
exponential decay in the charging and discharging time of the MR, and thus,
estimating its ultimate Q by measuring the photon lifetime.

classification tasks with a shift in task distribution. Understanding the
difficulties posed by this task distribution shift is central to FSL. In this
paper, we show that a simple channel-wise feature transformation may be the key
to unraveling this secret from a channel perspective. When facing novel
few-shot tasks in the test-time datasets, this transformation can greatly
improve the generalization ability of learned image representations, while
being agnostic to the choice of training algorithms and datasets. Through an
in-depth analysis of this transformation, we find that the difficulty of
representation transfer in FSL stems from the severe channel bias problem of
image representations: channels may have different importance in different
tasks, while convolutional neural networks are likely to be insensitive, or
respond incorrectly to such a shift. This points out a core problem of the
generalization ability of modern vision systems and needs further attention in
the future. Our code is available at

any oracle algorithm that can query multiple oracles adaptively, i.e., can
decide on which oracle to query at what point dependent on previous oracle
responses, into a static algorithm that fixes these choices at the beginning of
the execution. Compared to naive ways of achieving this, our compiler controls
the blow-up in query complexity for each oracle individually, and causes a very
mild blow-up only.
  In the second part of the paper, we use our compiler to show the security of
the very efficient hash-based split-key PRF proposed by Giacon, Heuer and
Poettering (PKC 2018), in the quantum random-oracle model. Using a split-key
PRF as the key-derivation function gives rise to a secure KEM combiner. Thus,
our result shows that the hash-based construction of Giacon et al. can be
safely used in the context of quantum attacks, for instance to combine a
well-established but only classically-secure KEM with a candidate KEM that is
believed to be quantum-secure.
  Our security proof for the split-key PRF crucially relies on our
adaptive-to-static compiler, but we expect our compiler to be useful beyond
this particular application. Indeed, we discuss a couple of other, known
results from the literature that would have profitted from our compiler, in
that these works had to go though serious complications in order to deal with
adaptivity.

We are viewing ends of spaces as extra points at infinity. In order to discuss
behaviour of spaces at infinity one needs a concept (a measure) of approaching
infinity. The simplest way to do so is to list subsets of $X$ that are bounded
(i.e. far from infinity) and that list should satisfy certain basic properties.
Such a list $S_X$ we call a \textbf{scale} on a set $X$ (see Section 3). In
order to use ideas from the Stone Duality Theorem we consider sub-Boolean
algebras $BA_X$ of the power set $2^X$ of $X$ that contain $S_X$ and that leads
naturally to the concept of ends of a \textbf{scaled Boolean algebra}
$(X,S_X,BA_X)$ which can be attached to $X$ and form a new scaled Boolean
algebra $(\bar X,S_X,\overline{BA_X})$ that is \textbf{compact at infinity}.
  Given a scaled space $(X,S_X)$ the most natural scaled Boolean algebra is
$(X,S_X,2^X)$ which can be too far removed from the geometry of $X$. Therefore
we need to figure out how to trim $2^X$ to a smaller sub-Boolean algebra
$BA_X$. More generally, how to trim a sub-Boolean algebra $BA_X$ to a smaller
one. That is done using ideas from linear algebra. Namely, we consider a family
$\mathcal{F}$ of naturally arising $S_X$-linear operators on $BA_X$ and the
smaller sub-Boolean algebra $BA_{\mathcal{F}}$ consists of eigensets of
$\mathcal{F}$, an analog of eigenvectors from linear algebra. We show that all
ends defined in literature so far (Freundenthal ends, ends of finitely
generated groups, Specker ends, Cornulier ends, ends of coarse spaces) are
special cases of such a process.

the local determination of the Hubble constant and find strong evidence that SN
standardisation in the calibration sample (galaxies with observed Cepheids)
require a steeper slope of the colour correction than in the cosmological
sample (galaxies in the Hubble flow). The colour correction in the calibration
sample is consistent with being entirely due to an extinction correction due to
dust with properties similar to that of the Milky Way (R_B~4.6+/-0.4) and there
is no evidence for intrinsic scatter in the SN peak magnitudes. An immediate
consequence of this finding is that the local measurement of the Hubble
constant becomes dependent on the choice of SN reference colour, i.e., the
colour of an unreddened SN. Specifically, the Hubble constant inferred from the
same observations decreases gradually with the reference colour assumed in the
SN standardisation. We recover the Hubble constant measured by SH0ES for the
standard choice of reference colour (SALT2 colour parameter c=0) while for a
reference colour which coincides with the blue end of the observed SN colour
distribution (c~-0.13), the Hubble constant from Planck observations of the CMB
(assuming a flat LCDM cosmological model) is recovered. These results are
intriguing in that they may provide an avenue for resolving the Hubble tension.
However, since there is no obvious physical basis for the differences in colour
corrections in the two SN samples, the origin of these require further
investigations.

Bayesian parametric model that leverages joint information on spatial variation
in the disease and covariate missingness processes and can accommodate both MAR

spatial distribution of the population covariates is known and observed cases
can be associated with a spatial unit of observation. We also use a simulation

The transition from the hexagonal structure into the dodecagonal motif is made
by the collective rational motion of the particles. The DDQC consists of
clusters of dodecagonal motifs, which can be classified into several packing

than ~ 2 Gyr) are much more complex than those predicted by coeval, nonrotating

(eMSTOs) could result from variations in stellar age, stellar rotation, or
both. The physical interpretation of eMSTOs is largely based on the complex
mapping between stellar models -- themselves functions of mass, rotation,
orientation, and binarity -- and the CMD. In this paper, we compute continuous
probability densities in three-dimensional color, magnitude, and vsini space
for individual stars in a cluster's eMSTO, based on a rotating stellar
evolution model. These densities enable the rigorous inference of cluster
properties from a stellar model, or, alternatively, constraints on the stellar
model from the cluster's CMD. We use the MIST stellar evolution models to
jointly infer the age dispersion, the rotational distribution, and the binary
fraction of the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1846. We derive an age
dispersion of ~ 70-80 Myr, approximately half the earlier estimates due to
nonrotating models. This finding agrees with the conjecture that rotational
variation is largely responsible for eMSTOs. However, the MIST models do not
provide a satisfactory fit to all stars in the cluster and achieve their best
agreement at an unrealistically high binary fraction. The lack of agreement
near the main-sequence turnoff suggests specific physical changes to the
stellar evolution models, including a lower mass for the Kraft break and
potentially enhanced main sequence lifespans for rapidly rotating stars.

measurements along the Doppler, range, and azimuth dimensions. As there is no
elevation information, it is challenging to estimate the 3D bounding box of an

large-scale object detection dataset and benchmark that contains 35K frames of
4D Radar tensor (4DRT) data with power measurements along the Doppler, range,
azimuth, and elevation dimensions, together with carefully annotated 3D
bounding box labels of objects on the roads. K-Radar includes challenging
driving conditions such as adverse weathers (fog, rain, and snow) on various
road structures (urban, suburban roads, alleyways, and highways). In addition
to the 4DRT, we provide auxiliary measurements from carefully calibrated
high-resolution Lidars, surround stereo cameras, and RTK-GPS. We also provide
4DRT-based object detection baseline neural networks (baseline NNs) and show
that the height information is crucial for 3D object detection. And by
comparing the baseline NN with a similarly-structured Lidar-based neural

to its important practical significance. Unfortunately, there is no effort to
explore crowd understanding in multi-modal domain that bridges natural language

representative multi-modal task. Current REF studies focus more on grounding
the target object from multiple distinctive categories in general scenarios. It
is difficult to applied to complex real-world crowd understanding. To fill this
gap, we propose a new challenging dataset, called RefCrowd, which towards
looking for the target person in crowd with referring expressions. It not only
requires to sufficiently mine the natural language information, but also
requires to carefully focus on subtle differences between the target and a
crowd of persons with similar appearance, so as to realize the fine-grained
mapping from language to vision. Furthermore, we propose a Fine-grained
Multi-modal Attribute Contrastive Network (FMAC) to deal with REF in crowd
understanding. It first decomposes the intricate visual and language features
into attribute-aware multi-modal features, and then captures discriminative but
robustness fine-grained attribute features to effectively distinguish these
subtle differences between similar persons. The proposed method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on our RefCrowd dataset and existing

deeper research in multi-modal domain. Our dataset and code can be available

from mixture signals using a pre-recorded enrollment utterance that
characterize the voice characteristics of the target speaker. One major
difficulty of target speech extraction lies in handling variability in
``intra-speaker'' characteristics, i.e., characteristics mismatch between
target speech and an enrollment utterance. While most conventional approaches
focus on improving {\it average performance} given a set of enrollment
utterances, here we propose to guarantee the {\it worst performance}, which we
believe is of great practical importance. In this work, we propose an
evaluation metric called worst-enrollment source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) to
quantitatively measure the robustness towards enrollment variations. We also
introduce a novel training scheme that aims at directly optimizing the
worst-case performance by focusing on training with difficult enrollment cases
where extraction does not perform well. In addition, we investigate the
effectiveness of auxiliary speaker identification loss (SI-loss) as another way
to improve robustness over enrollments. Experimental validation reveals the
effectiveness of both worst-enrollment target training and SI-loss training to
improve robustness against enrollment variations, by increasing speaker
discriminability.

models including LV effects, and different theoretical models predict different
LV phenomena, from which we can verify or constrain LV effects. Here, we

due to the high energy and long propagation distance, high-energy particles
from astronomical sources can be used for LV phenomenological researches.

ability in learning representations from graph-structured data. Despite the
successful applications of GNNs in many domains, the optimization of GNNs is
less well studied, and the performance on node classification heavily suffers
from the long-tailed node degree distribution. This paper focuses on improving
the performance of GNNs via normalization.
  In detail, by studying the long-tailed distribution of node degrees in the
graph, we propose a novel normalization method for GNNs, which is termed
ResNorm (\textbf{Res}haping the long-tailed distribution into a normal-like
distribution via \textbf{norm}alization). The $scale$ operation of ResNorm
reshapes the node-wise standard deviation (NStd) distribution so as to improve
the accuracy of tail nodes (\textit{i}.\textit{e}., low-degree nodes). We
provide a theoretical interpretation and empirical evidence for understanding
the mechanism of the above $scale$. In addition to the long-tailed distribution
issue, over-smoothing is also a fundamental issue plaguing the community. To
this end, we analyze the behavior of the standard shift and prove that the
standard shift serves as a preconditioner on the weight matrix, increasing the
risk of over-smoothing. With the over-smoothing issue in mind, we design a
$shift$ operation for ResNorm that simulates the degree-specific parameter
strategy in a low-cost manner. Extensive experiments have validated the
effectiveness of ResNorm on several node classification benchmark datasets.

filters and is thus particularly effective for reducing complexity. Previous
works empirically prune networks from the point of view that filter with
smaller norm contributes less to the final results. However, such criteria has
been proven sensitive to the distribution of filters, and the accuracy may hard
to recover since the capacity gap is fixed once pruned. In this paper, we
propose a novel filter pruning method called Asymptotic Soft Cluster Pruning
(ASCP), to identify the redundancy of network based on the similarity of
filters. Each filter from over-parameterized network is first distinguished by
clustering, and then reconstructed to manually introduce redundancy into it.
Several guidelines of clustering are proposed to better preserve feature
extraction ability. After reconstruction, filters are allowed to be updated to
eliminate the effect caused by mistakenly selected. Besides, various decaying
strategies of the pruning rate are adopted to stabilize the pruning process and
improve the final performance as well. By gradually generating more identical
filters within each cluster, ASCP can remove them through channel addition
operation with almost no accuracy drop. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet datasets show that our method can achieve competitive results compared
with many state-of-the-art algorithms.

The recent developments in wireless sensing techniques make the realization of
device-free localization (DFL) feasible in wireless sensor networks. The DFL is
an emerging technology that utilizes radio signal information for detecting and
positioning a passive target while the target is not equipped with a wireless
device. However, determining the characteristics of the massive raw signals and
extracting meaningful discriminative features relevant to the localization are
highly intricate tasks. Thus, deep learning (DL) techniques can be utilized to
address the DFL problem due to their unprecedented performance gains in many
practical problems. In this direction, we propose a DFL framework consists of
multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers along with autoencoders
based on the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to construct a convolutional
deep belief network (CDBN) for features recognition and extracting. Each layer
has stochastic pooling to sample down the feature map and reduced the
dimensions of the required data for precise localization. The proposed
framework is validated using real experimental dataset. The results show that
our algorithm can achieve a high accuracy of 98% with reduced data dimensions

have been found to be adversely affected by hypomagnetic field exposure. The
effect concurred with a reduction of reactive oxygen species in the absence of
the geomagnetic field. A recent theoretic study suggests a mechanistic
interpretation of this phenomenon in the framework of the Radical Pair
Mechanism. According to this model, a flavin-superoxide radical pair, born in
the singlet spin configuration, undergoes magnetic field-dependent spin
dynamics such that the pair's recombination is enhanced as the applied magnetic
field is reduced. This model has two ostensible weaknesses: a) the assumption
of a singlet initial state is irreconcilable with known reaction pathways
generating such radical pairs, and b) the model neglects the swift spin
relaxation of free superoxide, which abolishes any magnetic sensitivity in
geomagnetic/hypomagnetic fields. We here suggest that a model based on a
radical triad and the assumption of a secondary radical scavenging reaction
can, in principle, explain the phenomenon without unnatural assumptions, thus
providing a coherent explanation of hypomagnetic field effects in biology.

pathway. A comprehensive phosphorus chemistry network is then developed using a
combination of electronic structure theory calculations and a Master Equation

film is a prominent ferromagnetic insulator, in which the robust ferromagnetic
ordering emerges owing to epitaxial strain. Whereas it is evident that strong
spin-lattice coupling induces ferromagnetism, the reported ferromagnetic
properties of epitaxially strained LaCoO3 thin films were highly consistent.
For example, even under largely modulated degree of strain, the reported Curie
temperatures of epitaxially strained LaCoO3 thin films lie within 80-85 K,
without much deviation. In this study, substantial enhancement (~18%) in the
Curie temperature of epitaxial LaCoO3 thin films is demonstrated via
crystallographic orientation dependence. By changing the crystallographic
orientation of the films from (111) to (110), the crystal-field energy was
reduced and the charge transfer between the Co and O orbitals was enhanced.
These modifications led to a considerable enhancement of the ferromagnetic
properties (including the Curie temperature and magnetization), despite the
identical nominal degree of epitaxial strain. The findings of this study
provide insights into facile tunability of ferromagnetic properties via
structural symmetry control in LaCoO3.

  Number theoretic applications include integral (non-minimal) $R=\mathbb T$

lifting for 2-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations over an imaginary
quadratic field. The proofs combine our commutative algebra results with a
generalization due to Calegari and Geraghty of the patching method of Wiles and
Taylor--Wiles and level raising arguments that go back to Ribet. The results
provide new evidence in favor of the intriguing, and as yet fledgling, torsion
analog of the classical Langlands correspondence.
  We also prove unconditional integral $R=\mathbb T$ results for Hecke algebras
$\mathbb T$ acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves over $\mathbb Q$.
This leads to a torsion Jacquet--Langlands correspondence comparing integral
Hecke algebras acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves and modular

possible to disentangle the contribution of the relic gravitons from other

putative strongly first-order phase transition at the TeV scale. Hence, any

capability of convolution in extracting local context of objects. However, the
scales of objects are diverse and current convolution can only process
single-scale input. The capability of traditional convolution with a fixed
receptive field in dealing with such a scale variance problem, is thus limited.
Multi-scale feature representation has been proven to be an effective way to
mitigate the scale variance problem. Recent researches mainly adopt partial
connection with certain scales, or aggregate features from all scales and focus
on the global information across the scales. However, the information across
spatial and depth dimensions is ignored. Inspired by this, we propose the
multi-scale convolution (MSConv) to handle this problem. Taking into
consideration scale, spatial and depth information at the same time, MSConv is
able to process multi-scale input more comprehensively. MSConv is effective and
computationally efficient, with only a small increase of computational cost.
For most of the single-stage object detectors, replacing the traditional
convolutions with MSConvs in the detection head can bring more than 2.5\%
improvement in AP (on COCO 2017 dataset), with only 3\% increase of FLOPs.
MSConv is also flexible and effective for two-stage object detectors. When
extended to the mainstream two-stage object detectors, MSConv can bring up to

class of causal inference questions, particularly in dealing with

principal strata which are determined by joint potential values of the
intermediate variable, also known as the principal causal effects, are often of
interest in these studies. Analyses of principal causal effects from observed
data in the literature mostly rely on ignorability of the treatment assignment,
which requires practitioners to accurately measure as many as covariates so
that all possible confounding sources are captured. However, collecting all
potential confounders in observational studies is often difficult and costly,
the ignorability assumption may thus be questionable. In this paper, by
leveraging available negative controls that have been increasingly used to deal
with uncontrolled confounding, we consider identification and estimation of
causal effects when the treatment and principal strata are confounded by
unobserved variables. Specifically, we show that the principal causal effects
can be nonparametrically identified by invoking a pair of negative controls

various semiparametric or parametric models. We also propose an estimation
method of principal causal effects. Extensive simulation studies show good
performance of the proposed approach and a real data application from the

whose origin is still debated. The Gaia data provide an excellent opportunity
to probe the Galactic disc at large distances and study these features. We
derive the density distributions of the average (old) whole population and the
supergiants (representative of a young population), and we use them to
constrain their warp and flare. By comparing the results, we study how the
properties of these phenomena depend on the studied population. We used Lucy's
deconvolution method to recover corrected star counts as a function of
distance, from which we derive the density distribution. We find that
supergiants have an asymmetric warp, reaching a maximum amplitude of
$z_w=0.658$ kpc and minimum amplitude of $z_w=-0.717$ kpc at a distance of
$R=[19.5,20]$ kpc, which is almost twice as high as the amplitude of the whole
population of the disc. We find a significant flare of the whole population,
especially in the thick disc. The scale height increases from
$h_{z,thick}\approx 0.8$ kpc and $h_{z,thin}\approx 0.3$ kpc in the solar
neighbourhood, to $h_{z,thick} \approx 3$ kpc and $h_{z,thin}\approx 0.7$ kpc
in the remote regions of the Milky Way ($R\approx 18$ kpc). The supergiants'
population has only a small flare.

related to acoustic event classification (AEC). Among them, self-attention is
often used in audio-only tasks to help the model recognize different acoustic
events. Self-attention relies on the similarity between time frames, and uses
global information from the whole segment to highlight specific features within
a frame. In real life, information related to acoustic events will attenuate
over time, which means the information within some frames around the event
deserves more attention than distant time global information that may be
unrelated to the event. This paper shows that self-attention may over-enhance
certain segments of audio representations, and smooth out the boundaries
between events representations and background noises. Hence, this paper
proposes an event-related data conditioning (EDC) for AEC. EDC directly works
on spectrograms. The idea of EDC is to adaptively select the frame-related
attention range based on acoustic features, and gather the event-related local
information to represent the frame. Experiments show that: 1) compared with
spectrogram-based data augmentation methods and trainable feature weighting and
self-attention, EDC outperforms them in both the original-size mode and the
augmented mode; 2) EDC effectively gathers event-related local information and
enhances boundaries between events and backgrounds, improving the performance
of AEC.

Carlo wave packet formalism [J.Chem.Phys.156, 094109 (2022)]. The method proved
to yield thermalized ensembles of wave packets when intramolecular coupling is

representation, which reduces intermode coupling up to second order.
Additionally, we use combinations of generalized raising/lowering operators to
enforce the Boltzmann distribution in the dissipation operators, which yield
perfect thermalization in the harmonic limit. The two ansatz are tested using a
model two-dimensional hamiltonian parameterized to disentangle the effects of
intramolecular potential coupling, of strong mode mixing observed in Fermi
resonances, and of anharmonicity.

twin-width. Inspired by the approach of Bonnet et al. [FOCS 2020], we introduce
a robust methodology of local types and describe their behavior in contraction
sequences -- the decomposition notion underlying twin-width. We showcase the
applicability of the methodology by proving the following two algorithmic
results. In both statements, we fix a first-order formula
$\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ and a constant $d$, and we assume that on input we
are given a graph $G$ together with a contraction sequence of width at most
$d$.
  (A) One can in time $O(n)$ construct a data structure that can answer the
following queries in time $O(\log \log n)$: given $w_1,\ldots,w_k$, decide
whether $\phi(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$ holds in $G$.
  (B) After $O(n)$-time preprocessing, one can enumerate all tuples
$w_1,\ldots,w_k$ that satisfy $\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ in $G$ with $O(1)$ delay.
  In the case of (A), the query time can be reduced to $O(1/\varepsilon)$ at
the expense of increasing the construction time to $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$, for
any fixed $\varepsilon>0$. Finally, we also apply our tools to prove the
following statement, which shows optimal bounds on the VC density of set
systems that are first-order definable in graphs of bounded twin-width.
  (C) Let $G$ be a graph of twin-width $d$, $A$ be a subset of vertices of $G$,
and $\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_l)$ be a first-order formula. Then the
number of different subsets of $A^k$ definable by $\phi$ using $l$-tuples of
vertices from $G$ as parameters, is bounded by $O(|A|^l)$.

information about its pointer states is affected when it is coupled to multiple
baths. To this end, we consider a system in contact with two baths: one --
termed the {\it accessible} environment -- which, on its own, induces a pure
dephasing mechanism on the state of the system and satisfies the conditions for
classical objectivity to be established. The second environment, which we dub
as {\it inaccessible}, affects the system in two physically relevant ways.
Firstly, we consider an interaction that commutes with the Hamiltonian
describing the interaction between system and accessible bath. It thus also
gives rise to dephasing of the system, albeit on different time scales.
Secondly, we consider a thermalising interaction, which does not commute with
the system-accessible environment Hamiltonian. While the former still allows
the system to redundantly encode its state into the accessible environment, the
latter degrades the correlations, eventually destroying them in the long-time
limit, and thus leads to a loss of the conditions necessary for classical
objectivity to be established. This sheds light on the role that commutativity
between the various system-bath interaction terms plays when establishing the
conditions for classical objectivity to be supported.

how to successfully sample the 31-dimensional space of LECs at N3LO using a

quantum solvent. This includes tagging with one or very few $p$H$\rm_2$, the
microsolvation regime, and matrix isolation. However, the fundamental coupling
between the bosonic $p$H$\rm_2$ environment and the (ro-)vibrational motion of
molecular impurities remains poorly understood. Quantum simulations can in
provide the necessary atomistic insight, but very accurate descriptions of the
involved interactions are required. Here, we present a data-driven approach for
the generation of $impurity\cdots p$H$\rm_2$ interaction potentials based on
machine learning techniques which retain the full flexibility of the impurity.
We employ the well-established adiabatic hindered rotor (AHR) averaging
technique to include the impact of the nuclear spin statistics on the
symmetry-allowed rotational quantum numbers of $p$H$\rm_2$. Embedding this
averaging procedure within the high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP)
framework enables the generation of highly-accurate AHR-averaged NNPs at
coupled cluster accuracy, namely CCSD(T$^*$)-F12a/aVTZcp in an automated
manner. We apply this methodology to the water and protonated water molecules,
as representative cases for quasi-rigid and highly-flexible molecules
respectively, and obtain AHR-averaged NNPs that reliably describe the H$\rm
_2$O$\cdots p$H$\rm_2$ and H$\rm _3$O$^+\cdots p$H$\rm_2$ interactions. Using
path integral simulations we show for the hydronium cation that umbrella-like
tunneling inversion has a strong impact on the first and second $p$H$\rm_2$
microsolvation shells. The data-driven nature of our protocol opens the door to
the study of bosonic $p$H$\rm_2$ quantum solvation for a wide range of embedded

laws apply to idealized fluids, and extensions to more realistic scenarios have
been problematic. Here, these laws are extended to hold with additional
fundamental complexities, including salinity in the ocean, or moisture and
clouds in the atmosphere. In the absence of these additional complexities, it
is known that potential vorticity is conserved following each fluid parcel;
here, for a salty ocean or cloudy atmosphere, the general conserved quantity is
potential vorticity integrated over certain pancake-shaped volumes.
Furthermore, the conservation laws are also related to a symmetry in the
Lagrangian, which brings a connection to the symmetry-conservation
relationships seen in other areas of physics.

computational cost of canonical gradient-based methods such as gradient descent
(GD). Our proposed \emph{Low-Rank Gradient Descent} (LRGD) algorithm finds an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of a $p$-dimensional function by first
identifying $r \leq p$ significant directions, and then estimating the true
$p$-dimensional gradient at every iteration by computing directional
derivatives only along those $r$ directions. We establish that the ""directional
oracle complexities"" of LRGD for strongly convex and non-convex objective
functions are $\mathcal{O}(r \log(1/\epsilon) + rp)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(r/\epsilon^2 + rp)$, respectively. When $r \ll p$, these
complexities are smaller than the known complexities of $\mathcal{O}(p
\log(1/\epsilon))$ and $\mathcal{O}(p/\epsilon^2)$ of {\gd} in the strongly
convex and non-convex settings, respectively. Thus, LRGD significantly reduces
the computational cost of gradient-based methods for sufficiently low-rank

also poses important challenges when finding the best model or acceleration
technique for a particular problem. An example of such challenges resides in
the fact that the accuracy or effectiveness of a GNN model or acceleration
technique generally depends on the structure of the underlying graph. In this
paper, in an attempt to address the problem of graph-dependent acceleration, we
propose ProGNNosis, a data-driven model that can predict the GNN training time

inspecting the input graph metrics. Such prediction is made based on a
regression that was previously trained offline using a diverse synthetic graph
dataset. In practice, our method allows making informed decisions on which
design to use for a specific problem. In the paper, the methodology to build

satisfy that gcd(x,y,z)=x and, finally, we classify all the cases in which any
of these two variables coincide with each other.

incompressible fluid occupying half the 2D space and flowing under its own

small but non-localized initial data.
  Our main result is that if the $H^s$ norm of the initial data is $\epsilon$,
where $s \gg 1$ and $\epsilon \ll 1$, then the equation is wellposed at least
for a time proportional to $\epsilon^{-4}$, improving on the $\epsilon^{-3}$
lifespan obtained in \cite{BeFePu,Wu2DL}. We also study period water waves and
show a lifespan bridging the gap between non-periodic waves and waves with a

and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is beneficial to determining whether an
individual is at risk of such abnormalities. Automatic ECG classification
methods, especially the deep learning based ones, have been proposed to detect
cardiac abnormalities using ECG records, showing good potential to improve
clinical diagnosis and help early prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
However, the predictions of the known neural networks still do not
satisfactorily meet the needs of clinicians, and this phenomenon suggests that
some information used in clinical diagnosis may not be well captured and
utilized by these methods. In this paper, we introduce some rules into
convolutional neural networks, which help present clinical knowledge to deep
learning based ECG analysis, in order to improve automated ECG diagnosis
performance. Specifically, we propose a Handcrafted-Rule-enhanced Neural
Network (called HRNN) for ECG classification with standard 12-lead ECG input,
which consists of a rule inference module and a deep learning module.
Experiments on two large-scale public ECG datasets show that our new approach
considerably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, our
proposed approach not only can improve the diagnosis performance, but also can
assist in detecting mislabelled ECG samples. Our codes are available at

different structures and morphologies in sulfur are suggested as scalable
cathodes for high-energy lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The composites
contain 80 wt.% sulfur and 20 wt.% of either MnO2 or TiO2, leading to a sulfur
content in the electrode of 64 wt.% and revealing a reversible, fast, and lowly
polarized conversion process in the cell with limited interphase resistance.
The S-TiO2 composite exhibits an excellent rate capability between C/10 and 2C,
and a cycle life extended over 400 cycles at 2C, owing to the effects of the
nanometric TiO2 additive in boosting the reaction kinetics. Instead, the
micrometric sized particles of MnO2 partially limit the electrochemical
activity of S-MnO2 to the current rate of 1C. Nevertheless, both S-MnO2 and
S-TiO2 withstand a sulfur loading up to values approaching 6 mgcm-2, and
deliver an areal capacit ranging from about 4.5 to 5.5 mAhcm-2 at C/5. The
excellent performances of the metal oxide-sulfur electrodes, even at high
active material loading, and the possible scalability of the synthetic pathway
adopted in the work suggest that the composites are viable cathodes for
next-generation Li-S batteries with high energy density and efficient
electrochemical process.

pressing need for rapid, reliable diagnostics. Currently, popular testing
methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can
have high false negative rates. Consequently, COVID-19 patients are not
accurately identified nor treated quickly enough to prevent transmission of the
virus. However, the recent rise of medical CT data has presented promising
avenues, since CT manifestations contain key characteristics indicative of
COVID-19. This study aimed to take a novel approach in the machine
learning-based detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scans. First, the dataset
utilized in this study was derived from three major sources, comprising a total
of 17,698 chest CT slices across 923 patient cases. Image preprocessing
algorithms were then developed to reduce noise by excluding irrelevant
features. Transfer learning was also implemented with the EfficientNetB7
pre-trained model to provide a backbone architecture and save computational
resources. Lastly, several explainability techniques were leveraged to
qualitatively validate model performance by localizing infected regions and
highlighting fine-grained pixel details. The proposed model attained an overall
accuracy of 0.927 and a sensitivity of 0.958. Explainability measures showed
that the model correctly distinguished between relevant, critical features
pertaining to COVID-19 chest CT images and normal controls. Deep learning
frameworks provide efficient, human-interpretable COVID-19 diagnostics that
could complement radiologist decisions or serve as an alternative screening
tool. Future endeavors may provide insight into infection severity, patient
risk stratification, and prognosis.
