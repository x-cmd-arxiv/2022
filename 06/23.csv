purpose. While such a strategy has the advantage of being in line with the
common binary logic, it in some sense wastes the ready-for-use resources in the
large Hilbert space of these intrinsic multi-dimensional systems. Quantum
computation beyond qubits (e.g., using qutrits or qudits) has thus been
discussed and argued to be more efficient than its qubit counterpart in certain
scenarios. However, one of the essential elements for qutrit-based quantum
computation, two-qutrit quantum gate, remains a major challenge. In this work,
we propose and demonstrate a highly efficient and scalable two-qutrit quantum
gate in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a tunable coupler to control
the cross-Kerr coupling between two qutrits, our scheme realizes a two-qutrit
conditional phase gate with fidelity 89.3% by combining simple pulses applied
to the coupler with single-qutrit operations. We further use such a two-qutrit
gate to prepare an EPR state of two qutrits with a fidelity of 95.5%. Our
scheme takes advantage of a tunable qutrit-qutrit coupling with a large on:off
ratio. It therefore offers both high efficiency and low cross talk between
qutrits, thus being friendly for scaling up. Our work constitutes an important
step towards scalable qutrit-based quantum computation.

shop sequencing problem is intractable in classical computing. In this paper,
we propose to solve a general paint shop sequencing problem using
state-of-the-art quantum computing algorithms. Most existing works are solely
focused on reducing color changeover costs, i.e., costs incurred by different
colors between consecutive vehicles. This work reveals that different
sequencing of vehicles also significantly affects the quality performance of
the painting process. We use a machine learning model pretrained on historical

as a combinational optimization problem with two cost components, i.e., color
changeover cost and repair cost. The problem is further converted to a quantum
optimization problem and solved with Quantum Approximation Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA). As a matter of fact, current quantum computers are still
limited in accuracy and scalability. However, with a simplified case study, we
demonstrate how the classic sequencing problem in paint shop can be formulated

steady-state queueing models are commonly used to derive analytic expressions
for CFs, the finite length of planning periods calls their validity into
question. We apply a different approach to propose a mechanistic model for
one-resource, one-product factory shop based on the analogy between the
operation of machine and enzyme molecule. The model is reduced to a singularly
perturbed system of two differential equations for slow (WIP) and fast (busy
machines) variables, respectively. The analysis of this slow-fast system finds
that CF is nothing but a result of the asymptotic expansion of the slow
invariant manifold. The validity of CF is ultimately determined by how small is
the parameter multiplying the derivative of the fast variable. It is shown that
sufficiently small characteristic ratio 'working machines : WIP' guarantees the
applicability of CF approximation in unsteady-state operation.

SSIM methods are insufficiently sensitive, when images contain low information,

Therefore, we propose two new IQA methods, InTensity Weighted SSIM index and

feature importance (estimated by model explanation techniques) with human
annotations such as highlights of important image regions. However, recent work
has shown that performance gains from feature importance (FI) supervision for
Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks persist even with random supervision,
suggesting that these methods do not meaningfully align model FI with human FI.
In this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA
model accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason
(RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate
predictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2)
max-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3)
invariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and
(4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations
(Plausibility). Our best performing method, Visual Feature Importance
Supervision (VisFIS), outperforms strong baselines on benchmark VQA datasets in
terms of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. While past work
suggests that the mechanism for improved accuracy is through improved
explanation plausibility, we show that this relationship depends crucially on
explanation faithfulness (whether explanations truly represent the model's
internal reasoning). Predictions are more accurate when explanations are
plausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful.
Lastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of
out-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's
in-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics
for evaluating model reasoning. All supporting code is available at

partial point cloud of an object -- the goal is to not only estimate the object
pose, but also to provide a certificate of correctness for the resulting
estimate. Our first contribution is a general theory of certification for
end-to-end perception models. In particular, we introduce the notion of
$\zeta$-correctness, which bounds the distance between an estimate and the
ground truth. We show that $\zeta$-correctness can be assessed by implementing
two certificates: (i) a certificate of observable correctness, that asserts if
the model output is consistent with the input data and prior information, (ii)
a certificate of non-degeneracy, that asserts whether the input data is
sufficient to compute a unique estimate. Our second contribution is to apply
this theory and design a new learning-based certifiable pose estimator. We
propose C-3PO, a semantic-keypoint-based pose estimation model, augmented with
the two certificates, to solve the certifiable pose estimation problem. C-3PO
also includes a keypoint corrector, implemented as a differentiable
optimization layer, that can correct large detection errors (e.g. due to the
sim-to-real gap). Our third contribution is a novel self-supervised training
approach that uses our certificate of observable correctness to provide the
supervisory signal to C-3PO during training. In it, the model trains only on
the observably correct input-output pairs, in each training iteration. As
training progresses, we see that the observably correct input-output pairs
grow, eventually reaching near 100% in many cases. Our experiments show that
(i) standard semantic-keypoint-based methods outperform more recent
alternatives, (ii) C-3PO further improves performance and significantly
outperforms all the baselines, and (iii) C-3PO's certificates are able to
discern correct pose estimates.

indicators that is based on a penalization of the power means. The idea
underlying this approach consists in multiplying the power mean by a factor
that takes into account for the horizontal heterogeneity among indicators with
the aim of penalizing the units with larger heterogeneity. In order to measure
this heterogeneity, we scale the vector of normalized indicators by their power
means, we compute the variance of the scaled normalized indicators transformed
by means of the appropriate Box-Cox function, and we measure the heterogeneity
as the counter image of this variance through the Box-Cox function. The
resulting penalization factor can be interpreted as the relative error, or the
loss of information, that we obtain substituting the vector of the normalized
indicators with their power mean. This penalization approach has the advantage
to be fully data-driven and to be coherent with the same principle underlying
the power mean approach, that is the minimum loss of information principle as
well as to allow for a more refined rankings. The penalized power mean of order
one coincides with the Mazziotta Pareto Index.

space as it can only copy tokens from the dialogue context. However, these
methods may suffer from low coverage when phrases that must be added to a
source utterance cannot be covered by a single context span. This can occur in
languages like English that introduce tokens such as prepositions into the
rewrite for grammaticality. We propose a hierarchical context tagger (HCT) that
mitigates this issue by predicting slotted rules (e.g., ""besides_"") whose slots
are later filled with context spans. HCT (i) tags the source string with
token-level edit actions and slotted rules and (ii) fills in the resulting rule
slots with spans from the dialogue context. This rule tagging allows HCT to add
out-of-context tokens and multiple spans at once; we further cluster the rules
to truncate the long tail of the rule distribution. Experiments on several
benchmarks show that HCT can outperform state-of-the-art rewriting systems by
~2 BLEU points.

by a factor of $e^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$ by Huang, Slomka, Tkocz and Vritsiou. In

systems composed by a large number of variables. The goal is to find a smaller
version of the system whose time evolution is easier to predict while
preserving some of the key dynamical features of the original system. Finding
such a reduced representation for complex systems is, however, a difficult
task. We address this problem for dynamics on weighted directed networks, with
special emphasis on modular and heterogeneous networks. We propose a two-step
dimension-reduction method that takes into account the properties of the
adjacency matrix. First, units are partitioned into groups of similar
connectivity profiles. Each group is associated to an observable that is a
weighted average of the nodes' activities within the group. Second, we derive a
set of conditions that must be fulfilled for these observables to properly
represent the original system's behavior, together with a method for
approximately solving them. The result is a reduced adjacency matrix and an
approximate system of ODEs for the observables' evolution. We show that the
reduced system can be used to predict some characteristic features of the
complete dynamics for different types of connectivity structures, both
synthetic and derived from real data, including neuronal, ecological, and
social networks. Our formalism opens a way to a systematic comparison of the
effect of various structural properties on the overall network dynamics. It can
thus help to identify the main structural driving forces guiding the evolution

formalism, these are related to the curvature perturbation at the end of
inflation. We apply this method to quadratic inflation, where the existence of
semi-analytical results allows us to benchmark our approach. We find excellent
agreement within the estimated statistical error, both in the drift- and
diffusion-dominated regimes. The computation takes at most a few hours on a
single CPU, and can reach probability values corresponding to less than one
Hubble patch per observable universe at the end of inflation. With direct
sampling, this would take more than the age of the universe to simulate even
with the best current supercomputers. As an application, we study how the
presence of large-field boundaries might affect the tail of the probability
distribution. We also find that non-perturbative deviations from Gaussianity

finds an approximate macroscopic homogenized equation with constant
coefficients posed in space and time; however, the resulting homogenized
equation is higher order in space and time. The homogenized equation can be
used to solve initial-boundary-value problems posed on arbitrary non-periodic
macroscale geometries with macroscopic heterogeneity, such as bodies composed
of several different metamaterials or with external boundaries.
  First, considering a single band, the higher-order space derivatives lead to
additional continuity conditions at the boundary between a homogeneous material
and a metamaterial. These provide predictions of wave scattering in 1-d and 2-d
that match well with the exact fine-scale solution; compared to alternative
approaches, they provide a single equation that is valid over a broad range of
frequencies, are easy to apply, and are much faster to compute. Next, the
setting of two bands with a bandgap is considered. The homogenized equation has
also higher-order time derivatives. Notably, the homogenized model provides a
single equation that is valid over both bands and the bandgap. The continuity
conditions are applied to wave scattering at a boundary, and show good
agreement with the exact fine-scale solution.
  Using that the order of the highest time derivative is proportional to the
number of bands considered, a nonlocal-in-time structure is conjectured for the
homogenized equation in the limit of infinite bands. This suggests that
homogenizing over finer length and time scales -- with the temporal
homogenization being carried out through the consideration of higher bands in
the dispersion relation -- is a mechanism for the emergence of macroscopic
spatial and temporal nonlocality, with the extent of temporal nonlocality being
related to the number of bands considered.

and contributed data. Meanwhile, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been
successfully used with centralised datasets, producing state-of-the-art results
in constrained or unconstrained settings. However, such centralised datasets
may not be always available for training. Most recent work at the intersection
of NAS and FL attempts to alleviate this issue in a cross-silo federated
setting, which assumes homogeneous compute environments with datacenter-grade
hardware. In this paper we explore the question of whether we can design
architectures of different footprints in a cross-device federated setting,
where the device landscape, availability and scale are very different. To this
end, we design our system, FedorAS, to discover and train promising
architectures in a resource-aware manner when dealing with devices of varying
capabilities holding non-IID distributed data. We present empirical evidence of
its effectiveness across different settings, spanning across three different
modalities (vision, speech, text), and showcase its better performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated solutions, while maintaining resource efficiency.

modulation of isolated time-limited pulses. Fundamental solitons are one
possible solution for such pulses which offer a fundamental advantage: their
shape is not affected by fiber disperison and nonlinearity. Furthermore, a
simple energy detector can be used at the receiver to detect the transmitted
information. However, systems based on energy modulation of solitons are not
competitive in terms of data rates. This is partly due to the fact that the
effective time duration of a soliton depends on its chosen amplitude. In this
paper, we propose to replace fundamental solitons by new time-limited waveforms
that can be detected using an energy detector, and that are immune to fiber
distortions. Our proposed solution relies on the prolate spheroidal wave
functions and a numerical optimization routine. Time-limited waveforms that
undergo minimum time broadening along an optical fiber are obtained and shown
to outperform fundamental solitons. In the case of binary transmission and a
single span of fiber, we report rate increases of 33.8% and 12% over lossy and
lossless fibers, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the transmission rate
of the proposed system increases as the number of used energy levels increases,
which is not the case for fundamental solitons due to their effective
time-amplitude constraint. For example, rate increases of 164% and 70% over
lossy and lossless fibers respectively are reported when using four energy
levels.

actively forming massive stars, while the Molecular Ridge is forming almost no
massive stars, despite its large reservoir of molecular gas and proximity to
N159 and 30 Dor. We segment the emission from each region into hierarchical
structures using dendrograms and analyze the sizes, masses, and linewidths of
these structures. We find that the Ridge has significantly lower kinetic energy
at a given size scale and also lower surface densities than the other regions,
resulting in higher virial parameters. This suggests that the Ridge is not
forming massive stars as actively as the other regions because it has less
dense gas and not because collapse is suppressed by excess kinetic energy. We
also find that these physical conditions and energy balance vary significantly
within the Ridge and that this variation appears only weakly correlated with
distance from sites of massive star formation such as R136 in 30 Dor, which is
$\sim1$ kpc away. These variations also show only a weak correlation with local

presentation for the topos and develop tools for finding such presentations.
Extensions of geometric theories, which can add axioms, symbols and sorts, are
treated as objects in their own right, to be able to build up complex theories
from parts. The role of equivalence extensions, which leave the theory the same
up to Morita equivalence, is investigated.
  Motivated by the question what the big Zariski topos of a non-affine scheme
classifies, we show how to construct a syntactic presentation for a topos if
syntactic presentations for a covering family of open subtoposes are given. For
this, we introduce conditional theory extensions that require part of the data
a model is made of only under some condition given in the form of a closed
geometric formula. We also give a general definition for systems of
interdependent theory extensions, to be able to talk about compatible syntactic
presentations not only for the open subtoposes in a given cover but also for
their finite intersections.
  An important concept for finding classified theories of toposes in concrete
situations is that of theories of presheaf type. We develop several techniques
for extending a theory while preserving the presheaf type property, and give a
list of examples of simple extensions which can destroy it.
  Finally, we determine a syntactic presentation of the big crystalline topos
of a scheme. In the case of an affine scheme, this is accomplished by showing
that the biggest part of the classified theory is of presheaf type and
transforming the site defining the crystalline topos into the canonical
presheaf site for this theory, while the remaining axioms induce the Zariski
topology. Then we can apply our results on gluing classifying toposes to obtain
a classified theory even in the non-affine case.

Motivated by this observation, we examine the probability that $N$ players who

  workshop at ICML 2022",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Natural data observed in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is often constrained to an
$m$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M}$, where $m < n$. Current generative
models represent this manifold by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable
through a neural network $f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$. Such
procedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward
limitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single
parameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either
computational instability or the inability to learn probability densities
within the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\mathcal{M}$
as a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. To learn
the data distribution within $\mathcal{M}$, we introduce constrained
energy-based models, which use a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to
train and sample within the learned manifold. The resulting model can be
manipulated with an arithmetic of manifolds which allows practitioners to take
unions and intersections of model manifolds. In experiments on synthetic and
natural data, we show that constrained EBMs can learn manifold-supported
distributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models.

thermal/chemical variation and winds can strongly influence spectra. Recently,
the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76 b has shown evidence for condensation and
asymmetric Fe absorption with time. However, it is currently unclear whether
these asymmetries are driven by chemical or thermal differences between the two
limbs, as precise constraints on variation in these have remained elusive due
to the challenges of modelling these dynamics in a Bayesian framework. To
address this we develop a new model, HyDRA-2D, capable of simultaneously
retrieving morning and evening terminators with day-night winds. We explore
variations in Fe, temperature profile, winds and opacity deck with limb and
orbital phase using VLT/ESPRESSO observations of WASP-76 b. We find Fe is more
prominent on the evening for the last quarter of the transit, with
$\log(X_\mathrm{Fe}) = {-4.03}^{+0.28}_{-0.31}$, but the morning shows a lower
abundance with a wider uncertainty, $\log(X_\mathrm{Fe}) =
{-4.59}^{+0.85}_{-1.0}$, driven by degeneracy with the opacity deck and the
stronger evening signal. We constrain 0.1 mbar temperatures ranging from
$2950^{+111}_{-156}$ K to $2615^{+266}_{-275}$ K, with a trend of higher
temperatures for the more irradiated atmospheric regions. We also constrain a
day-night wind speed of $9.8^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ km/s for the last quarter, higher
than $5.9^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ km/s for the first, in line with general circulation
models. We find our new spatially- and phase-resolved treatment is
statistically favoured by 4.9$\sigma$ over traditional 1D-retrievals, and thus
demonstrate the power of such modelling for robust constraints with current and
future facilities.

ultra-light axions, in which particles with mass $m_{\psi} < 10^{-20}\,
\rm{eV}$ comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter. A galactic scale
de Broglie wavelength distinguishes these theories from cold dark matter (CDM),
suppressing the overall abundance of structure on sub-galactic scales, and
producing wave-like interference phenomena in the density profiles of halos.
With the aim of constraining the particle mass, we analyze the flux ratios in a
sample of eleven quadruple-image strong gravitational lenses. We account for
the suppression of the halo mass function and concentration-mass relation
predicted by ULDM theories, and the wave-like fluctuations in the host halo
density profile, calibrating the model for the wave interference against
numerical simulations of galactic-scale halos. We show that the granular
structure of halo density profiles, in particular, the amplitude of the
fluctuations, significantly impacts image flux ratios, and therefore inferences
on the particle mass derived from these data. We infer relative likelihoods of
CDM to ULDM of 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, and 4:1 for particle masses

of CDM to ULDM with a particle mass in the same ranges of 98:1, 48:1, 26:1 and
18:1, highlighting the significant perturbation to image flux ratios associated
with the fluctuations. Nevertheless, our results disfavor the lightest particle

Optical spectra exhibit a slightly evolved F-type single star, displaying
periodic Doppler shifts with a 2.76-day Keplerian circular orbit, with no
indication of light from a secondary component. Optical and UV photometry
reveal ellipsoidal variations with half the orbital period, due to the tidal
deformation of the F star. The mass of the unseen companion is constrained to
the range $1.1$--$2.1\,M_{\odot}$ at $3\sigma$ confidence, with the median of
the mass distribution at $1.4\,M_{\odot}$, the typical mass of known neutron
stars. A main-sequence star cannot masquerade as the dark companion. The
distribution of possible companion masses still allows for the possibility of a
very massive white dwarf. The companion itself could also be a close pair
consisting of a white dwarf and an M star, or two white dwarfs, although the
binary evolution that would lead to such a close triple system is unlikely.
Similar ambiguities regarding the certain identification of a dormant neutron

it will become, in the future, a bright X-ray source and afterwards might even

galactic nuclei (AGN), including hints of AGN-driven outflows in dwarfs.
However, in the common theoretical model of galaxy formation, efficient
supernova (SN) feedback is the tool of choice for regulating star formation in
the low-mass regime. In this paper, we present a suite of high-resolution
cosmological dwarf zoom-in simulations relaxing the assumption of strong SN
feedback, with the goal to determine whether more moderate SN feedback in
combination with an efficient AGN could be a suitable alternative. Importantly,
we find that there are sufficient amounts of gas to power brief
Eddington-limited accretion episodes in dwarfs. This leads to a variety of
outcomes depending on the AGN accretion model: from no additional suppression
to moderate regulation of star formation to catastrophic quenching. Efficient
AGN can drive powerful outflows, depleting the gas reservoir of their hosts via
ejective feedback and then maintaining a quiescent state through heating the
circumgalactic medium. Moderate AGN outflows can be as efficient as the strong
SN feedback commonly employed, leading to star formation regulation and HI gas
masses in agreement with observations of field dwarfs. All efficient AGN
set-ups are associated with overmassive black holes (BHs) compared to the
(heavily extrapolated) observed BH mass - stellar mass scaling relations, with
future direct observational constraints in this mass regime being crucially
needed. Efficient AGN activity is mostly restricted to high redshifts, with
hot, accelerated outflows and high X-ray luminosities being the clearest
tell-tale signs for future observational campaigns.

the evidence for stellar multiplicity among the stars surveyed by NASA's Kepler

estimate the probability of an unresolved stellar companion for a large subset
of the Kepler and TESS Input Catalog stars, where possible benchmarking our

large preference for the presence of WZDR. We also investigate whether
additional dark radiation -- dark matter interactions can help in easing the

Monte Carlo sampling methods. Building upon our convolutional neural network

external shear ($\gamma_{ext,1}$, $\gamma_{ext,2}$) from ground-based imaging

pipeline from Schuldt et al. (2021b) to simulate lens images using real images
of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC) and from the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field as lens galaxies and background sources, respectively. We find
overall very good recoveries for the SIE parameters, while differences remain
in predicting the external shear. From our tests, most likely the low image
resolution is the limiting factor for predicting the external shear. Given the
run time of milli-seconds per system, our network is perfectly suited to
predict the next appearing image and time delays of lensed transients in time.
Therefore, we also present the performance of the network on these quantities
in comparison to our simulations. Our ResNet is able to predict the SIE and
shear parameter values in fractions of a second on a single CPU such that we
are able to process efficiently the huge amount of expected galaxy-scale lenses

$\mu$, $\tau$) are fully determined by hadron mass parameters, and are in good
agreement with lattice QCD (LQCD) predictions. We develop a parametrization of

fits to the available LQCD predictions and experimental data, and we provide
precise updated predictions for the $\bar{B} \to D^{(*)} \tau \bar\nu$ decay

specifically on the decay modes $\bar{B}^0\to D^{*+}\ell^- \bar{\nu}$ with
$\ell = e$ and $\mu$. The world averages of the ratios $R_D$ and $R_D^{*}$
currently differ from the Standard Model (SM) predictions by $3.4\sigma$ while
recently a new anomaly has been observed in the forward-backward asymmetry

found that $\Delta A_{FB} = A_{FB}(B\to D^{*} \mu\nu) - A_{FB} (B\to D^{*} e

Belle data. In this work we explore possible solutions to the $\Delta A_{FB}$
anomaly and point out correlated NP signals in other angular observables. These
correlations between angular observables must be present in the case of beyond
the Standard Model physics. We stress the importance of $\Delta$ type
observables that are obtained by taking the difference of the observable for
the muon and the electron mode. These quantities cancel form factor
uncertainties in the SM and allow for clean tests of NP. These intriguing
results also suggest an urgent need for improved simulation and analysis

describe a new Monte Carlo Event-generator tool based on EVTGEN that we
developed to allow simulation of the NP signatures in $\bar{B}^0\to

Using a Bayesian approach we focus on the constraints that can be derived on

third-generation of gravitational wave interferometers. We consider both single

show that a single observation with a third-generation interferometer, such as
the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer, will constrain the strength of the
repulsive three-body potential with exquisite accuracy, turning
third-generation GW detectors into new laboratories to study the nucleon

cross sections over dwarf galaxy scales. Motivated by DM interactions that
follow a Yukawa potential, the cross section per unit mass, $\sigma/m_{\chi}$,
assumes a velocity dependent form that avoids violations of current constraints
on large scales. We demonstrate that our implementation accurately models not
only core formation in haloes, but also gravothermal core collapse. For central
haloes in cosmological volumes, frequent DM particle collisions isotropise the
particles orbit, making them largely spherical. We show that the
velocity-dependent $\sigma/m_{\chi}$ models produce a large diversity in the
circular velocities of satellites haloes, with the spread in velocities
increasing as the cross sections reach 20, 60 and 100 cm$^2$/g in
$10^9~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ haloes. The large variation in the haloes internal
structure is driven by DM particles interactions, causing in some haloes the
formation of extended cores, whereas in others gravothermal core collapse. We

expert demonstrations. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) trains
a discriminator that distinguishes expert from agent transitions, and in turn
use a reward defined by the discriminator output to optimize a policy generator
for the agent. This generative adversarial training approach is very powerful
but depends on a delicate balance between the discriminator and the generator
training. In high-dimensional problems, the discriminator training may easily
overfit or exploit associations with task-irrelevant features for transition
classification. A key insight of this work is that performing imitation
learning in a suitable latent task space makes the training process stable,
even in challenging high-dimensional problems. We use an action encoder-decoder
model to obtain a low-dimensional latent action space and train a LAtent Policy
using Adversarial imitation Learning (LAPAL). The encoder-decoder model can be
trained offline from state-action pairs to obtain a task-agnostic latent action
representation or online, simultaneously with the discriminator and generator
training, to obtain a task-aware latent action representation. We demonstrate
that LAPAL training is stable, with near-monotonic performance improvement, and
achieves expert performance in most locomotion and manipulation tasks, while a
GAIL baseline converges slower and does not achieve expert performance in
high-dimensional environments.

we propose to use a new random graph model of communities that we call a
\emph{Geometric Block Model}. The geometric block model builds on the
\emph{random geometric graphs} (Gilbert, 1961), one of the basic models of
random graphs for spatial networks, in the same way that the well-studied
stochastic block model builds on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{en}yi random graphs. It is
also a natural extension of random community models inspired by the recent
theoretical and practical advancements in community detection. To analyze the
geometric block model, we first provide new connectivity results for
\emph{random annulus graphs} which are generalizations of random geometric
graphs. The connectivity properties of geometric graphs have been studied since
their introduction, and analyzing them has been difficult due to correlated
edge formation.
  We then use the connectivity results of random annulus graphs to provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for efficient recovery of communities for
the geometric block model. We show that a simple triangle-counting algorithm to
detect communities in the geometric block model is near-optimal. For this we
consider two regimes of graph density.
  In the regime where the average degree of the graph grows logarithmically
with number of vertices, we show that our algorithm performs extremely well,
both theoretically and practically. In contrast, the triangle-counting
algorithm is far from being optimum for the stochastic block model in the
logarithmic degree regime. We also look at the regime where the average degree
of the graph grows linearly with the number of vertices $n$, and hence to store
the graph one needs $\Theta(n^2)$ memory. We show that our algorithm needs to
store only $O(n \log n)$ edges in this regime to recover the latent
communities.

experimentally address their ground state order and excitations, both because
some of the proposed states do not couple directly to experimental probes, and
because they are highly sensitive to spatial inhomogeneities in real samples.
Here, using a scanning single-electron transistor, we observe thermodynamic
gaps at even integer moir\'e filling factors at low magnetic fields. We find
evidence of a field-tuned crossover from charged spin skyrmions to bare
particle-like excitations, and use this to establish that the underlying ground
state is a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. From the spatial dependence
of these states and the chemical potential variation within the flat bands, we
infer a link between the stability of the correlated ground states and local

insight into the potential mechanisms by which they seed superconductivity upon

singlet dark matter model (SSDMM), the DM is a scalar $S$ that couples to the
Higgs via $\lambda_{hS} \, S^2|H|^2$. We update the fit to the data and find
that the SSDMM is now viable only for $M_S \ge

$\lambda_{U_1 S} \, S^2 \, U_{1\mu}^{\dagger} U^{\mu}_1$. In addition to
leading to DM annihilation via $S S \to U_1 {\bar U}_1$, this coupling
generates $SSgg$ and $SS\gamma\gamma$ couplings at one loop. Although naively
divergent, these loop diagrams can be calculated under the assumption that the
$U_1$ is a gauge boson of a group broken at the TeV scale. With this DM-$U_1$
coupling term, there are additional contributions to the various DM observables

discrete quantum system as a result of interactions with an environment. For
many applications, the question is not necessarily how to avoid (inevitable)
system-environment interactions, but rather how to design environments that
optimally preserve a system's phase relations in spite of such interactions.
The formation of system-environment entanglement is a major driving mechanism
for decoherence, and a detailed understanding of this process could inform
strategies for conserving coherence optimally. This requires scalable,
flexible, and systematically improvable quantum dynamical methods that retain
detailed information about the entanglement properties of the environment, yet
very few current methods offer this combination of features. Here, we address
this need by introducing a theoretical framework wherein we combine the
truncated Wigner approximation with standard time-dependent perturbation theory
allowing for computing expectation values of operators in the combined
system-environment Hilbert space. We demonstrate the utility of this framework
by applying it to the spin-boson model, representative of qubits and simple
donor-acceptor systems. For this model, our framework provides an analytical
description of perturbative contributions to expectation values. We monitor how
quantum decoherence at zero temperature is accompanied by entanglement
formation with individual environmental degrees of freedom. Based on this
entanglement behavior, we find that the selective suppression of low-frequency
environmental modes is particularly effective for mitigating quantum
decoherence.

rate of substructure in the survey's compact discs than previously seen,
underresolved (potentially azimuthally asymmetric) substructure in the
innermost disc of extended sources, and a 'shoulder' on the trailing edge of a
ring in discs with strong depletion at small radii. Noting the shoulder

important to answering numerous questions about stellar physics, from binary
interactions on the main sequence to the pre-supernova radii. One important
factor determining a star's radius is the fraction of its mass in elements
heavier than Helium (metallicity, $Z$). However, the metallicity enters stellar
evolution through several distinct microphysical processes, and which dominates
can change throughout stellar evolution and with the overall magnitude of $Z$.
We perform a series of numerical experiments with 15M$_{\odot}$ MESA models
computed doubling separately the metallicity entering the radiative opacity,
the equation of state, and the nuclear reaction network to isolate the impact
of each on stellar radii. We explore separately models centered around two
metallicity values: one near solar $Z=0.02$ and another sub-solar
$Z\sim10^{-3}$, and consider several key epochs from the end of the main
sequence to core carbon depletion. We find that the metallicity entering the
opacity dominates at most epochs for the solar metallicity models, contributing
to on average $\sim$60 - 90% of the total change in stellar radius. Nuclear
reactions have a larger impact ($\sim$50 - 70%) during most epochs in the
subsolar $Z$ models. The methodology introduced here can be employed more

quantum fluctuations onto a classical background for the exactly soluble
dynamical evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate, experimentally realizable in
the ultracold gas laboratory. A force density exerted on the gas particles
which is of quantum origin is uniquely identified as the deviation from the
classical Eulerian force density. The backreaction equations are then explored
for the specific example of a finite size uniform density condensate initially
at rest. By assuming that the condensate starts from a non-interacting regime,
and in its ground state, we fix a well-defined initial vacuum condition, which
is driven out-of-equilibrium by instantaneously turning on the interactions.
The assumption of this initial vacuum accounts for the ambiguity in choosing a
vacuum state for interacting condensates, which is due to phase diffusion and
the ensuing condensate collapse. As a major finding, we reveal that the time
evolution of the condensate cloud leads to condensate density corrections that
cannot in general be disentangled from the quantum depletion in measurements
probing the power spectrum of the total density. Furthermore, while the
condensate is initially at rest, quantum fluctuations give rise to a nontrivial
condensate flux, from which we demonstrate that the quantum force density
attenuates the classical Eulerian force. Finally, the knowledge of the particle
density as a function of time for a condensate at rest determines, to order
$N^0$, where $N$ is the total number of particles, the quantum force density,
thus offering a viable route for obtaining experimentally accessible quantum
backreaction effects.

  Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots is important for real-world
multi-robot systems and has been studied as an optimization problem on graphs,
called Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). This review surveys different
categories of classic and state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms and different
research attempts to tackle the challenges of generalizing MAPF techniques to
real-world scenarios.
  Recent Findings
  Solving MAPF problems optimally is computationally challenging. Recent
advances have resulted in MAPF algorithms that can compute collision-free paths
for hundreds of robots and thousands of navigation tasks in seconds of runtime.
Many variants of MAPF have been formalized to adapt MAPF techniques to
different real-world requirements, such as considerations of robot kinematics,
online optimization for real-time systems, and the integration of task
assignment and path planning.
  Summary
  Algorithmic techniques for MAPF problems have addressed important aspects of
several multi-robot applications, including automated warehouse fulfillment and
sortation, automated train scheduling, and navigation of non-holonomic robots
and quadcopters. This showcases their potential for real-world applications of
large-scale multi-robot systems.

of a concurrent failure between two or more components due to a shared failure
cause and coupling mechanism. This work emphasizes the importance of
identifying software-centric attributes related to the coupling mechanisms
necessary for simultaneous failures of redundant software components. The
groups of components that share coupling mechanisms are called common cause
component groups (CCCGs). Most CCF models rely on operational data as the basis
for establishing CCCG parameters and predicting CCFs. This work is motivated by
two primary concerns: (1) a lack of operational and CCF data for estimating
software CCF model parameters; and (2) the need to model single components as
part of multiple CCCGs simultaneously. A hybrid approach was developed to
account for these concerns by leveraging existing techniques: a modified beta
factor model allows single components to be placed within multiple CCCGs, while
a second technique provides software-specific model parameters for each CCCG.
This hybrid approach provides a means to overcome the limitations of
conventional methods while offering support for design decisions under the
limited data scenario.

(ROMs) have been widely used to capture the dominant behaviors of
high-dimensional systems. A ROM can be obtained, using the well-known Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), by projecting the full-order model to a
subspace spanned by modal basis modes which are learned from experimental,
simulated or observational data, i.e., training data. However, the optimal
basis can change with the parameter settings. When a ROM, constructed using the
POD basis obtained from training data, is applied to new parameter settings,
the model often lacks robustness against the change of parameters in design,
control, and other real-time operation problems. This paper proposes to use
regression trees on Grassmann Manifold to learn the mapping between parameters
and POD bases that span the low-dimensional subspaces onto which full-order
models are projected. Motivated by the fact that a subspace spanned by a POD
basis can be viewed as a point in the Grassmann manifold, we propose to grow a
tree by repeatedly splitting the tree node to maximize the Riemannian distance
between the two subspaces spanned by the predicted POD bases on the left and
right daughter nodes. Five numerical examples are presented to comprehensively
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and compare the proposed
tree-based method to the existing interpolation method for POD basis and the
use of global POD basis. The results show that the proposed tree-based method
is capable of establishing the mapping between parameters and POD bases, and
thus adapt ROMs for new parameters.

have to solve multiple tasks, each one typically modeled via a reward function.
If reward functions are expressed linearly, and the agent has previously
learned a set of policies for different tasks, successor features (SFs) can be
exploited to combine such policies and identify reasonable solutions for new
problems. However, the identified solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal.
We introduce a novel algorithm that addresses this limitation. It allows RL
agents to combine existing policies and directly identify optimal policies for
arbitrary new problems, without requiring any further interactions with the
environment. We first show (under mild assumptions) that the transfer learning
problem tackled by SFs is equivalent to the problem of learning to optimize
multiple objectives in RL. We then introduce an SF-based extension of the
Optimistic Linear Support algorithm to learn a set of policies whose SFs form a
convex coverage set. We prove that policies in this set can be combined via
generalized policy improvement to construct optimal behaviors for any new
linearly-expressible tasks, without requiring any additional training samples.

suggest instead that the energy deposition is concentrated at very low heights,

networks and next-generation networks to meet the requirements of different
services in various verticals. However, the heterogeneous nature of these
services' requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes the RAN
slicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network
operators (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the
frequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements.
Machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are
increasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and
orchestration of RAN slicing operations. Nerveless, the ability to generalize
DRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited, due to their
strong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. Federated
learning enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for DRL without
the high cost of collecting this data from different RANs. In this paper, we
propose a federated deep reinforcement learning approach for RAN slicing. In
this approach, MVNOs collaborate to improve the performance of their DRL-based
RAN slicing models. Each MVNO trains a DRL model and sends it for aggregation.
The aggregated model is then sent back to each MVNO for immediate use and
further training. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed
DRL approach.

correlation can be used to estimate intrinsic energy from the duration, and
thus can provide us with a new distance measure for cosmology. However, the
correlation suffered from small number statistics (68 FRBs) and was not free
from contamination by latent repeating populations, which might not have such a
correlation. How to separate/exclude the repeating bursts from the mixture of
all different types of FRBs is essential to see this property. Using a much
larger sample from the new FRB catalogue (containing 536 FRBs) recently
released by the CHIME/FRB project, combined with a new classification method
developed based on unsupervised machine learning, we carried out further
scrutiny of the relation. We found that there is a weak correlation between the
intrinsic energy and duration for non-repeating FRBs at z < 0.3 with Kendall's
tau correlation coefficient of 0.239 and significance of 0.001 (statistically
significant), whose slope looks similar to that of gamma-ray bursts. This
correlation becomes weaker and insignificant at higher redshifts (z > 0.3),
possibly due to the lack of the faint FRBs at high-z and/or the redshift
evolution of the correlation. The scattering time in the CHIME/FRB catalogue
shows an intriguing trend: it varies along the line obtained from linear fit on
the energy versus duration plane between these two parameters. A possible
cosmological application of the relation must wait for faint FRBs at high-z.

the liquid and its diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients). In addition, I

many facilities as possible subject to the condition that every two facilities
have distance at least $\delta$ from each other. Our main technical
contribution is an efficient procedure to `round-up' distance $\delta$. It
transforms a $\delta$-dispersed set $S$ into a $\delta^\star$-dispersed set
$S^\star$ of same size where distance $\delta^\star$ is a slightly larger
rational $\tfrac{a}{b}$ with a numerator $a$ upper bounded by the longest
(not-induced) path in the input graph. Based on this rounding procedure and
connections to the distance-$d$ independent set problem we derive a number of
algorithmic results. When parameterized by treewidth, the problem is in XP.
When parameterized by treedepth the problem is FPT and has a matching lower
bound on its time complexity under ETH. Moreover, we can also settle the
parameterized complexity with the solution size as parameter using our rounding
technique: $\delta$-\dispersion is FPT for every $\delta \leq 2$ and W[1]-hard
for every $\delta > 2$. Further, we show that $\delta$-dispersion is
NP-complete for every fixed irrational distance $\delta$, which was left open

fluids have been observed in a binary granular system consisting of dense and
small particles layered on top of lighter and larger particles, when the system
is subjected to vertical vibration and fluidizing gas flow. Using observations
from experiments and numerical modelling we explore whether the theory
developed to describe the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in fluids is also
applicable to binary granular systems. Our results confirm the applicability of
the classic RT instability theory for binary granular systems demonstrating
that several key features are observed in both types of systems, viz: (i) The
characteristic wavenumber of the instability is constant with time, (ii) the
amplitude of the characteristic wavenumber initially grows exponentially and
(iii) the dispersion relation between the wavenumbers k of the interface
instability and the growth rates n(k) of their amplitudes holds in both
fluid-fluid and binary granular systems. Our results also demonstrate that
inter-particle friction is essential for the RT instability to occur in
granular media. For zero particle friction the interface instability bears a
greater resembles to the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. We further define a
yield criterion Y for the interface by treating the granular medium as a
viscoplastic material; only for Y > 15 fingering occurs. Interestingly,
previous work has shown that instabilities in the Earth's lower mantle, another
viscoplastic material, also occur for similar values of Y.

complex data sets, employed by the financial industry to model the probability
of default of a potential customer. In order to ensure that a scorecard remains
a representative model of the population one tests the hypothesis of population
stability; specifying that the distribution of clients' attributes remains
constant over time. Simulating realistic data sets for this purpose is
nontrivial as these data sets are multivariate and contain intricate
dependencies. The simulation of these data sets are of practical interest for
both practitioners and for researchers; practitioners may wish to consider the
effect that a specified change in the properties of the data has on the
scorecard and its usefulness from a business perspective, while researchers may
wish to test a newly developed technique in credit scoring.
  We propose a simulation technique based on the specification of bad ratios,
this is explained below. Practitioners can generally not be expected to provide
realistic parameter values for a scorecard; these models are simply too complex
and contain too many parameters to make such a specification viable. However,
practitioners can often confidently specify the bad ratio associated with two
different levels of a specific attribute. That is, practitioners are often
comfortable with making statements such as ""on average a new customer is 1.5
times as likely to default as an existing customer with similar attributes"". We
propose a method which can be used to obtain parameter values for a scorecard
based on specified bad ratios. The proposed technique is demonstrated using a
realistic example and we show that the simulated data sets adhere closely to
the specified bad ratios. The paper provides a link to a github project in

the context of the human contact -- whether it is a deliberate interaction or
an unintended collision that requires safety manoeuvres. Many published methods
classify discrete interactions using more advanced tactile sensors or by
analysing joint torques. Instead, we propose to augment the intention
recognition capabilities of simple binary tactile sensors by adding a
robot-mounted camera for human posture analysis. Different interaction
characteristics, including touch location, human pose, and gaze direction, are
used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify whether a
touch is intentional or not with an F1-score of 86%. We demonstrate that
multimodal intention recognition is significantly more accurate than monomodal
analyses with the collaborative robot Baxter. Furthermore, our method can also
continuously monitor interactions that fluidly change between intentional or
unintentional by gauging the user's attention through gaze. If a user stops
paying attention mid-task, the proposed intention and attention recognition
algorithm can activate safety features to prevent unsafe interactions. We also
employ a feature reduction technique that reduces the number of inputs to five
to achieve a more generalized low-dimensional classifier. This simplification
both reduces the amount of training data required and improves real-world
classification accuracy. It also renders the method potentially agnostic to the
robot and touch sensor architectures while achieving a high degree of task
adaptability.

validated not only on the basis of galaxy global properties, but also the
stellar abundance ratios. We identify the necessary conditions for the
formation of first stars in mini-halos and derive constraints on the metal

is evaluated by considering different IMFs, the influence of pair-instability
supernovae (PISNe) and their energetic feedback, as well as the metallicity
threshold marks the transition from first stars to the formation of low-mass
long-lived stars. The inclusion of Pop III stars does increase the global
metallicity of UFDs, though insufficient to resolve the tension with
observations. PISNe with progenitor masses above 140Msun do allow to further
increase the metal content of UFDs. However, as PISNe are rare and sometimes
absent in the faintest UFDs, they have a limited impact on the global faint end
of the metallicity-luminosity relation. Despite a limited number of
spectroscopically confirmed members in UFDs, that makes the metallicity
distribution of some UFDs uncertain, our analysis reveals this is the
metal-rich tail that is missing in the models. The remaining challenges are

sensors to macroscopic structures, are strongly influenced by fracture
processes. Fracture itself is a highly localized event; originating at the
atomic scale by bond breaking between individual atoms close to the crack tip.
These processes, however, interact with defects such as dislocations or grain
boundaries and influence phenomena on much larger length scales, ultimately
giving rise to macroscopic behavior and engineering-scale fracture properties.
This complex interplay is the fundamental reason why identifying the atomistic
structural and energetic processes occurring at a crack tip remains a
longstanding and still unsolved challenge.
  We develop a new analysis approach for combining quantitative in-situ
observations of nanoscale deformation processes at a crack tip with
three-dimensional reconstruction of the dislocation structure and advanced
computational analysis to address plasticity and fracture initiation in a
ductile metal. Our combinatorial approach reveals details of dislocation
nucleation, their interaction process, and the local internal stress state, all
of which were previously inaccessible to experiments. This enables us to
describe fracture processes based on local crack driving forces on a

readily applies to any NN architecture. GACT reduces the activation memory for
convolutional NNs, transformers, and graph NNs by up to 8.1x, enabling training

defect-to-defect variations of the optical transition frequencies caused by
local strain variation, and spectral diffusion of the optical frequencies on
repeated measurement caused by photoexcitation of nearby charge traps. In this
experimental study we undertake a group theoretic approach to quantifying
spectral diffusion and strain, decomposing each into components corresponding
to Jahn-Teller symmetries of the NV center. We investigate correlations between
the components of strain, spectral diffusion, and depth from surface, finding
that strain and spectral diffusion are each dominated by longitudinal
perturbations. We also find a weak negative correlation between transverse
static strain and total spectral diffusion suggesting that transverse strain
provides some degree of protection from spectral diffusion. Additionally, we
find that spectral diffusion becomes more pronounced with increasing depth in
the diamond bulk. Our symmetry-decomposed technique for quantifying spectral
diffusion can be valuable for understanding how a given nanoscale charge trap

an exomoon, and in some cases the exomoon itself could be a possible place for
life to develop. For moons outside of the habitable zone, significant tidal
heating may raise their surface temperature enough to be considered habitable.
Tidal heating of a moon depends on numerous factors such as eccentricity,
semimajor axis, size of parent planet, and presence of additional moons. In
this work, we explore the degree of tidal heating possible for multi-moon
systems in resonance using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical models.
This demonstrates that even for a moon with zero initial eccentricity, when it
moves into resonance with an outer moon, it can generate significant
eccentricity and associated tidal heating. Depending on the mass ratio of the
two moons, this resonance can either be short-lived ($\leq200$ Myr) or continue
to be driven by the tidal migration of the moons. This tidal heating can also
assist in making the exomoons easier to discover, and we explore two scenarios:
secondary eclipses and outgassing of volcanic species. We then consider
hypothetical moons orbiting known planetary systems to identify which will be
beast suited for finding exomoons with these methods. We conclude with a
discussion of current and future instrumentation and missions to better
understand how practical it will be to make exomoon discoveries in these ways.

compression length and resolution in lossy data compression. However, it
conceals the underlying dynamics of optimal source encodings or test channels.
We argue that these typically follow a piecewise smooth trajectory as the
source information is compressed. These smooth dynamics are interrupted at
bifurcations, where solutions change qualitatively. Sub-optimal test channels
may collide or exchange optimality there, for example. There is typically a
plethora of sub-optimal solutions, which stems from restrictions of the
reproduction alphabet.
  We devise a family of algorithms that exploits the underlying dynamics to
track a given test channel along the rate-distortion curve. To that end, we
express implicit derivatives at the roots of a non-linear operator by higher
derivative tensors. Providing closed-form formulae for the derivative tensors
of Blahut's algorithm thus yields implicit derivatives of arbitrary order at a
given test channel, thereby approximating others in its vicinity. Finally, our
understanding of bifurcations guarantees the optimality of the root being
traced, under mild assumptions, while allowing us to detect when our
assumptions fail.
  Beyond the interest in rate distortion, this is an example of how
understanding a problem's bifurcations can be translated to a numerical
algorithm.

crossings from planet-planet perturbations. The time which the system remains
stable without orbital crossings has an exponential dependence on the initial
orbital separations in units of mutual Hill radii. However when a multi-planet
system has period ratios near mean-motion resonances, its stability time
differs from the time determined by planet separation. This difference can be
up to an order of magnitude when systems are set up with chains of equal period
ratios. We use numerical simulations to describe the stability time
relationship in non-resonant systems with equal separations but non-equal
masses which breaks the chains of equal period ratios. We find a deviation of
30 per cent in the masses of Earth-mass planets creates a large enough
deviation in the period ratios where the average stability time of a given
spacing can be predicted by the stability time relationship. The mass deviation
where structure from equal period ratios is erased increases with planet mass
but does not depend on planet multiplicity. With a large enough mass deviation,
the distribution of stability time at a given spacing is much wider than in
equal-mass systems where the distribution narrows due to period
commensurabilities. We find the stability time distribution is heteroscedastic
with spacing -- the deviation in stability time for a given spacing increases

arc is an embedding of an arc in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that one endpoint is on
$\ell_1$, the other is on $\ell_2$, and its interior is disjoint from
$\ell_1\cup\ell_2$. Rail arcs are considered up to rail isotopies, ambient
isotopies of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with each self-homeomorphism mapping $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_2$ onto themselves. When the manifolds and maps are taken in the
piecewise linear category, these rail arcs are called stick rail arcs.
  The stick number of a rail arc class is the minimum number of sticks, line
segments in a p.l. arc, needed to create a representative. This paper will
calculate the stick numbers of rail arcs classes with a crossing number at most
2 and use a winding number invariant to calculate the stick numbers of
infinitely many rail arc classes.
  Each rail arc class has two canonically associated knot classes, its under
and over companions. This paper also introduces the rail stick number of knot
classes, the minimum number of sticks needed to create a rail arcs whose under
or over companion is the knot class. The rail stick number is calculated for
all knot classes with crossing number at most 9. The stick number of
multi-component rail arcs classes is considered as well as the lattice stick
number of rail arcs.

assess their performance, availability, correctness, efficiency, and other
aspects useful to operators, as well as to troubleshoot them when they behave
abnormally. Many modern observability platforms support dimensional models of
telemetry signals where the measurements are accompanied by additional
dimensions used to identify either the resources described by the telemetry or
the business-specific attributes of the activities (e.g., a customer
identifier). However, most of these platforms lack any semantic understanding
of the data, by not capturing any metadata about telemetry, from simple aspects
such as units of measure or data types (treating all dimensions as strings) to
more complex concepts such as purpose policies. This limits the ability of the
platforms to provide a rich user experience, especially when dealing with
different telemetry assets, for example, linking an anomaly in a time series
with the corresponding subset of logs or traces, which requires semantic
understanding of the dimensions in the respective data sets.
  In this paper, we describe a schema-first approach to application telemetry
that is being implemented at Meta. It allows the observability platforms to
capture metadata about telemetry from the start and enables a wide range of
functionalities, including compile-time input validation, multi-signal
correlations and cross-filtering, and even privacy rules enforcement. We
present a collection of design goals and demonstrate how schema-first approach
provides better trade-offs than many of the existing solutions in the industry.

tomographic adaptive optics system. However, when considering Extremely Large
Telescope (ELT) scales, the LGS spot elongation becomes so large that it
challenges the standard recipes to design LGSWFS. For classical Shack-Hartmann
wave-front sensor (SHWFS), which is the current baseline for all ELT
LGS-assisted instruments, a trade-off between the pupil spatial sampling
[number of sub-apertures (SAs)], the SA field-of-view (FoV) and the pixel
sampling within each SA is required. For ELT scales, this trade-off is also
driven by strong technical constraints, especially concerning the available
detectors and in particular their number of pixels. For SHWFS, a larger field
of view per SA allows mitigating the LGS spot truncation, which represents a
severe loss of performance due to measurement biases. For a given number of
available detectors pixels, the SA FoV is competing with the proper sampling of
the LGS spots, and/or the total number of SAs. We proposed a sensitivity
analysis, and we explore how these parameters impacts the final performance. In
particular, we introduce the concept of super resolution, which allows one to
reduce the pupil sampling per WFS and opens an opportunity to propose potential
LGSWFS designs providing the best performance for ELT scales.

a heterogeneous random covariance matrix. We propose an extension to the joint
latent class model (JLCM) in which probabilities of subjects being in latent
class k can be set to vary with time. This can be a more flexible way to
analyse the effect of treatments to patients. For example, a patient may be in
period I at the first visit time and may move to period II at the second visit
time, implying the treatment the patient had before might be noneffective at
the following visit time. For a dataset with these particular features, the
joint latent class model which allows jumps among different subgroups can
potentially provide more information as well as more accurate estimation and
prediction results compared to the basic JLCM. A Bayesian approach is used to
do the estimation and a DIC criterion is used to decide the optimal number of
classes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model produces accurate
results and the time-varying JLCM outperforms the basic JLCM. We also
illustrate the performance of our proposed JLCM on the aids data (Goldman et

Laplacians in graph-based data analysis and can be computed efficiently by

bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian
with rates, when $n$ data points are i.i.d. sampled from a general
$d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space. Under
certain joint limit of $n \to \infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\epsilon \to 0$,
the point-wise convergence rate of the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm)
is proved to be $ O( n^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors,
achieved at the scaling of $\epsilon \sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold

point-wise consistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data plus an
additional term proportional to the boundedness of the inner-products of the
noise vectors among themselves and with data vectors. Motivated by our
analysis, which suggests that not exact bi-stochastic normalization but an
approximate one will achieve the same consistency rate, we propose an
approximate and constrained matrix scaling problem that can be solved by SK

theory, recently proposed in the description of monopole pair production via

cross sections for the Drell-Yan reactions derived within the mentioned
framework to evaluate the cross section averaged over the thermal distribution
associated to other particles that constitute the hot medium where the
monopoles propagate. In the considered range of monopole mass with spin-zero
and spin-half, our findings suggest that the thermally averaged cross sections
for the pair production are highly suppressed, while at higher temperatures
those for the annihilation of lighter pairs reach larger magnitudes. Besides,
we observe that smaller temperature leads to a rate of annihilation for scalar
monopoles smaller than the one for fermionic monopoles, which might be
interpreted as a theoretical evidence of a more pronounced stability for spin-0
and heavier monopoles.Then we input these thermally averaged cross sections
into the kinetic equation that describes the evolution of the monopole
abundance via an extension of a freeze-out theory. Our results infer that
heavier monopoles achieve the equilibrium at earlier stages of the expansion,
and consequently at higher temperatures. In addition, larger monopole masses
produce higher values of the relic abundance. Besides, the results indicate
that the abundance does not behave differently for spinless and spin-half relic
monopoles.

hierarchy of forward models that operate at varying magnitudes of step skipping

HKSL in a suite of 30 robotic control tasks and find that HKSL either reaches
higher episodic returns or converges to maximum performance more quickly than
several current baselines. Also, we find that levels in HKSL's hierarchy can
learn to specialize in long- or short-term consequences of agent actions,
thereby providing the downstream control policy with more informative
representations. Finally, we determine that communication channels between

large-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) and advanced control
techniques. In this paper, a comprehensive review of microgrid control is
presented with its fusion of model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). A
high-level research map of microgrid control is developed from six distinct
perspectives, followed by bottom-level modularized control blocks illustrating
the configurations of grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters.
Then, mainstream MFRL algorithms are introduced with an explanation of how MFRL
can be integrated into the existing control framework. Next, the application
guideline of MFRL is summarized with a discussion of three fusing approaches,
i.e., model identification and parameter tuning, supplementary signal
generation, and controller substitution, with the existing control framework.
Finally, the fundamental challenges associated with adopting MFRL in microgrid
control and corresponding insights for addressing these concerns are fully
discussed.

this paper, we propose to use structured world models to incorporate relational
inductive biases in the control loop to achieve sample-efficient and
interaction-rich exploration in compositional multi-object environments. By
planning for future novelty inside structured world models, our method
generates free-play behavior that starts to interact with objects early on and
develops more complex behavior over time. Instead of using models only to
compute intrinsic rewards, as commonly done, our method showcases that the
self-reinforcing cycle between good models and good exploration also opens up
another avenue: zero-shot generalization to downstream tasks via model-based
planning. After the entirely intrinsic task-agnostic exploration phase, our
method solves challenging downstream tasks such as stacking, flipping, pick &

(Vf) control framework for islanded microgrids, with full consideration of the
limited capacity of distributed energy resources (DERs) and Vf dependent load.
First, the concept of DER inadequacy is illustrated with the challenges it
poses. Then, a decentralized and coordinated control framework is proposed to
regulate the output of inverter based generations and reallocate limited DER
capacity for Vf control. The control framework is composed of a power regulator
and a Vf regulator, which generates the supplementary signals for the primary
controller. The power regulator regulates the output of grid forming inverters
according to the real time capacity constraints of DERs, while the Vf regulator
improves the Vf deviation by leveraging the load sensitivity to Vf. Next, the
static feasibility and small signal stability of the proposed method are
rigorously proven through mathematical formulation and eigenvalue analysis.
Finally, a MATLAB Simulink simulation demonstrates the functionalities of the
control framework. A few goals are fulfilled within the decentralized and
coordinated framework, such as making the best use of limited DERs capacity,
enhancing the DC side stability of inverter based generations, and reducing
involuntary load shedding.

great attention due to their superior performance. These methods rely on greedy
graph search to traverse the data points as embedding vectors in a database.
Under this greedy search scheme, we make a key observation: many distance
computations do not influence search updates so these computations can be
approximated without hurting performance. As a result, we propose FINGER, a
fast inference method to achieve efficient graph search. FINGER approximates
the distance function by estimating angles between neighboring residual vectors
with low-rank bases and distribution matching. The approximated distance can be
used to bypass unnecessary computations, which leads to faster searches.
Empirically, accelerating a popular graph-based method named HNSW by FINGER is
shown to outperform existing graph-based methods by 20%-60% across different

such as a posterior from a Bayesian analysis, have rapidly expanded in the past
decade. Algorithms based on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs),
non-reversible continuous-time processes, are developing into their own
research branch, thanks their important properties (e.g., correct invariant
distribution, ergodicity, and super-efficiency). Nevertheless, practice has not
caught up with the theory in this field, and the use of PDMPs to solve applied
problems is not widespread. This might be due, firstly, to several
implementational challenges that PDMP-based samplers present with and,
secondly, to the lack of papers that showcase the methods and implementations
in applied settings. Here, we address both these issues using one of the most
promising PDMPs, the Zig-Zag sampler, as an archetypal example. After an
explanation of the key elements of the Zig-Zag sampler, its implementation
challenges are exposed and addressed. Specifically, the formulation of an
algorithm that draws samples from a target distribution of interest is
provided. Notably, the only requirement of the algorithm is a closed-form
function to evaluate the target density of interest, and, unlike previous
implementations, no further information on the target is needed. The
performance of the algorithm is evaluated against another gradient-based
sampler, and it is proven to be competitive, in simulation and real-data
settings. Lastly, we demonstrate that the super-efficiency property, i.e. the
ability to draw one independent sample at a lesser cost than evaluating the
likelihood of all the data, can be obtained in practice.

(mmWave) communication systems through the design of analog beamforming
codebooks. LoneSTAR codebooks deliver high beamforming gain and broad coverage
while simultaneously reducing the self-interference coupled by transmit and
receive beams at a full-duplex mmWave transceiver. Our design framework
accomplishes this by tolerating some variability in transmit and receive
beamforming gain to strategically shape beams that reject self-interference
spatially while accounting for digitally-controlled analog beamforming networks
and self-interference channel estimation error. By leveraging the coherence
time of the self-interference channel, a mmWave system can use the same
LoneSTAR design over many time slots to serve several downlink-uplink user
pairs in a full-duplex fashion without the need for additional
self-interference cancellation. Compared to those using conventional codebooks,
full-duplex mmWave systems employing LoneSTAR codebooks can mitigate higher
levels of self-interference, tolerate more cross-link interference, and demand
lower SNRs in order to outperform half-duplex operation -- all while supporting
beam alignment. This makes LoneSTAR a potential standalone solution for
enabling simultaneous transmission and reception in mmWave systems, from which
it derives its name.

study a time-sensitive variant of the \textit{misinformation mitigation}

to minimize the number of users that adopt misinformation propagating through a

employ a sandwiching technique by defining submodular upper and lower bounding
functions, providing data-dependent guarantees. In order to enable the use of a
reverse sampling framework, we introduce a weighted version of reverse
reachability sets that captures the associated differential propagation rates
and establish a key equivalence between weighted set coverage probabilities and
mitigation with respect to the sandwiching functions. Further, we propose an
offline reverse sampling framework that provides $(1 - 1/e -

importance sampling technique to reduce the sample complexity of our solution.
Finally, we show how our framework can provide an anytime solution to the

Assistive information generated from Counterfactual Predictions of optimal
joint action selection, which enable explicit assistance to value function
factorization through a novel counterfactual loss. A variational
inference-based information encoding method is developed to collect and encode
the counterfactual predictions from an estimated baseline. To enable
decentralized execution, we also derive factorized per-agent policies inspired
by a maximum-entropy MARL framework. We evaluate the proposed PAC on
multi-agent predator-prey and a set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.

group fairness algorithm, FairSmooth, for improving the fairness of
classification models while maintaining the remarkable prediction accuracy. A
Gaussian parameter smoothing method is developed to transform base classifiers
into their smooth versions. An optimal individual smooth classifier is learnt
for each group with only the data regarding the group and an overall smooth
classifier for all groups is generated by averaging the parameters of all the
individual smooth ones. By leveraging the theory of nonlinear functional
analysis, the smooth classifiers are reformulated as output functions of a
Nemytskii operator. Theoretical analysis is conducted to derive that the
Nemytskii operator is smooth and induces a Frechet differentiable smooth

Lipschitz constant that is independent of the domain of the input data, which
derives the input-agnostic certified group fairness.

beneficial in subsequent statistical models than direct observations. These
representations, in a lower-dimensional space, extract and compress information
from individual curves. The existing representation learning approaches in
functional data analysis usually use linear mapping in parallel to those from
multivariate analysis, e.g., functional principal component analysis (FPCA).
However, functions, as infinite-dimensional objects, sometimes have nonlinear
structures that cannot be uncovered by linear mapping. Linear methods will be
more overwhelmed given multivariate functional data. For that matter, this
paper proposes a functional nonlinear learning (FunNoL) method to sufficiently
represent multivariate functional data in a lower-dimensional feature space.
Furthermore, we merge a classification model for enriching the ability of
representations in predicting curve labels. Hence, representations from FunNoL
can be used for both curve reconstruction and classification. Additionally, we
have endowed the proposed model with the ability to address the missing
observation problem as well as to further denoise observations. The resulting
representations are robust to observations that are locally disturbed by
uncontrollable random noises. We apply the proposed FunNoL method to several
real data sets and show that FunNoL can achieve better classifications than
FPCA, especially in the multivariate functional data setting. Simulation
studies have shown that FunNoL provides satisfactory curve classification and
reconstruction regardless of data sparsity.

system planets may provide guides for constructing better approaches of
exoplanet characterization. With this motivation, we explore how the measured
values of the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio of Uranus and Neptune can
constrain their formation mechanisms. Under the assumption of in-situ
formation, we investigate three solid accretion modes; a dominant accretion
mode switches from pebble accretion to drag-enhanced three-body accretion and
to canonical planetesimal accretion, as the solid radius increases. We consider
a wide radius range of solids that are accreted onto (proto)Neptune-mass
planets and compute the resulting accretion rates as a function of both the
solid size and the solid surface density. We find that for small-sized solids,
the rate becomes high enough to halt concurrent gas accretion, if all the
solids have the same size. For large-sized solids, the solid surface density
needs to be enhanced to accrete enough amounts of solids within the gas disk
lifetime. We apply these accretion modes to the formation of Uranus and Neptune
and show that if the minimum-mass solar nebula model is adopted, solids with
radius of $\sim 1$ m to $\sim 10$ km should have contributed mainly to their
deuterium enrichment; a tighter constraint can be derived if the full solid
size distribution is determined. This work therefore demonstrates that the D/H
ratio can be used as a tracer of solid accretion onto Neptune-mass planets.
Similar efforts can be made for other atomic elements that serve as metallicity
indicators.

These phase-grating systems use the moir\'e far-field technique to avoid the
need for high-aspect absorption gratings used in Talbot-Lau interferometers
(TLI) which reduce the neutron flux reaching the detector. We first demonstrate
through theory and simulations a novel phase grating interferometer system for
cold neutrons that requires a single modulated phase grating (MPG) for
phase-contrast imaging, as opposed to the two- or three-phase gratings in
previously employed PGMI systems. The MPG theory was compared to the full
Sommerfeld-Rayleigh Diffraction integral simulator. Then we compared the MPG
system to experiments in the literature that use a two-phase-grating-based PGMI
with best-case visibility of around 39%. An MPG with a modulation period of 300
micron, pitch of 2 micron, and grating heights with a phase modulation of
(pi,0), illuminated by a monochromatic beam, produces a visibility of 94.2%
with comparable source-to-detector distance (SDD) as the
two-phase-grating-based PGMI. Phase sensitivity, another important performance
metric of the grating interferometer, was compared to values available in the
literature, viz. the conventional TLI with phase sensitivity of 4.5 x 10E+3 for
an SDD of 3.5 m and a beam wavelength of 0.44 nm. For a range of modulation
periods, the MPG system provides comparable or greater theoretical maximum
phase sensitivity of 4.1 x 10E+3 to 10.0 x 10E+3 for SDDs of up to 3.5 m. This
proposed MPG system can provide high-performance PGMI that obviates the need to
align two phase gratings.

stringent limits at such a low redshift $z=0.076$ and is associated with
kilonova emission, suggests that its physical origin is from a binary compact
star merger. By reanalyzing its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
on board the Fermi mission, we find that both time-integrated and time-resolved
spectra can be fitted well by using a 2SBPL plus blackbody (2SBPL+BB) model in
the prompt emission. The bulk Lorentz factors ($\Gamma_{\rm ph}$) of the
outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed thermal emission at the
photosphere radius within a pure fireball model, and we find out that the
temporal evolution of $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light
curve. The derived values of $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ are also consistent with the
$\Gamma_{\rm ph}$-$L_{\gamma, \rm iso}$/$E_{\gamma, \rm iso}$ correlations that
had been found in other bursts. Moreover, we also calculate the magnetization
factor $\sigma_{0}$ in the central engine and $\sigma_{\rm ph}$ at the
photosphere radius within the framework of a hybrid jet model, and find that
the values of both $1+\sigma_{\rm 0}$ and $1+\sigma_{\rm ph}$ are larger than 1
for different time slices. It suggests that at least the Poynting-flux
component is indeed existent in the outflow. If this is the case, one possible
physical interpretation of thermal and nonthermal emissions in GRB 211211A is
from the contributions of both $\nu\bar{\nu}$ annihilation and the
Blandford-Znajek mechanisms in the relativistic jet when a stellar mass black
hole resides in the central engine.

temporal networks that stores edges in both an adjacency dictionary, enabling
rapid node-based slices, and an interval tree, enabling rapid time-based

slice both over nodes and time, either by slicing first over nodes or slicing
first over time. We further propose an approach for predictive compound

intelligent applications empowered by artificial intelligence. The classical
artificial intelligence algorithms require centralized data collection and

to growing data privacy concerns and distributed datasets. Federated Learning
(FL) has emerged as a distributed privacy-preserving learning framework that
enables IoT devices to train global model through sharing model parameters.
However, inefficiency due to frequent parameters transmissions significantly
reduce FL performance. Existing acceleration algorithms consist of two main
type including local update considering trade-offs between communication and
computation and parameter compression considering trade-offs between
communication and precision. Jointly considering these two trade-offs and
adaptively balancing their impacts on convergence have remained unresolved. To
solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel efficient adaptive federated

learning error via jointly considering two variables including local update and
parameter compression and enables FL to adaptively adjust the two variables and
balance trade-offs among computation, communication and precision. The
experiment results illustrate that comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms,
the proposed EAFO can achieve higher accuracies faster.

$G$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ is free, if $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3-f(G))$ is a free group.
Lastly a simple connected graph is said to be linearly free if every its linear
embedding is free. In 1980s it was proved that every complete graph is linearly
free, by Nicholson.
  In this paper, we develop Nicholson's arguments into a general notion, and
establish a sufficient condition for a linear embedding to be free. As an
application of the condition we give a partial answer for a question: how much
can the complete graph $K_n$ be enlarged so that the linear freeness is
preserved and the clique number does not increase? And an example supporting
our answer is provided.
  As the second application it is shown that a simple connected graph of
minimal valency at least $3$ is linearly free, if it has less than 8 vertices.
The conditional inequality is strict, because we found a graph with $8$
vertices which is not linearly free. It is also proved that for $n, m \leq 6$

The Yamada polynomial, one of such invariants, is frequently utilized for

the polynomial is an ambient isotopy invariant after a normalization. On the
other hand, to each $\theta$-curve, a 3-component link can be associated as an

efficient quantum heat engines (QHEs). Yet, a consensus on this ongoing debate
is still lacking owing to challenges arising from treating strong couplings.
Here we conclude the debate for optimal linear cyclic QHEs operated under a
small temperature difference by revealing the detrimental role of strong
system-bath coupling in their optimal operations. We analytically demonstrate
that both the efficiency at maximum power and maximum efficiency of
strong-coupling linear cyclic QHEs are upper bounded by their weak-coupling
counterparts and, particularly, experience a quadratic suppression relative to
the Carnot limit under strong time-reversal symmetry breaking.

radiotherapy-induced temporal lobe injury (RTLI) according to the probability
of REP onset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first exploration of
predicting radiotherapy-induced REP by jointly exploiting image and non-image
data in NPC radiotherapy regimen. We cast REP prediction as a survival analysis
task and evaluate the predictive accuracy in terms of the concordance index
(CI). We design a deep multimodal survival network (MSN) with two feature
extractors to learn discriminative features from multimodal data. One feature
extractor imposes feature selection on non-image data, and the other learns
visual features from images. Because the priorly balanced CI (BCI) loss
function directly maximizing the CI is sensitive to uneven sampling per batch.
Hence, we propose a novel weighted CI (WCI) loss function to leverage all REP
samples effectively by assigning their different weights with a dual average
operation. We further introduce a temperature hyper-parameter for our WCI to
sharpen the risk difference of sample pairs to help model convergence. We
extensively evaluate our WCI on a private dataset to demonstrate its
favourability against its counterparts. The experimental results also show
multimodal data of NPC radiotherapy can bring more gains for REP risk
prediction.

recognized as two distinct mechanisms for the breakdown of eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis(ETH) in an isolated system. In this work, we reveal a
smooth route to connect these two ETH-breaking mechanisms in the Ising chain
with transverse and longitudinal fields. Specifically, starting from an initial
Ising anti-ferromagnetic state, we find that the dynamical system undergoes a
smooth non-thermal crossover from QMBS to QI by changing the Ising
coupling($J$) and longitudinal field($h$) simultaneously while keeping their
ratio fixed, which corresponds to the Rydberg Hamiltonian with an arbitrary
nearest-neighbor repulsion. Deviating from this ratio, we further identify a
continuous thermalization trajectory in ($h,J$) plane that is exactly given by
the Ising transition line, signifying an intimate relation between
thermalization and quantum critical point. Finally, we map out a completely
different dynamical phase diagram starting from an initial ferromagnetic state,
where the thermalization is shown to be equally facilitated by the resonant
spin-flip at special ratios of $J$ and $h$. By bridging QMBS and QI in Ising
chains, our results demonstrate the breakdown of ETH in much broader physical
settings, which also suggest an alternative way to characterize quantum phase
transition via thermalization in non-equilibrium dynamics.

calculating the amount of entropy catalytically extractable from a correlated

catalytically extracted when one cannot implement local projective measurement
on randomness source without altering its state. The RTR, as an archetype of
the `concave' resource theory, is complementary to the convex resource theories
in which the amount of randomness required to erase the resource is a resource
measure. As an application, we prove that quantum operation cannot be hidden in
correlation between two parties without using randomness, which is the
dynamical generalization of the no-hiding theorem. Second, we study the
physical properties of information flow. Popularized quotes like ""information
is physical"" or ""it from bit"" suggest the matter-like picture of information
that can travel with the definite direction while leaving detectable traces on
its region of departure. To examine the validity of this picture, we focus on
that catalysis of randomness models directional flow of information with the
distinguished source and recipient. We show that classical information can
always spread from its source without altering its source or its surrounding
context, like an immaterial entity, while quantum information cannot. We
suggest an approach to formal definition of semantic quantum information and
claim that utilizing semantic information is equivalent to using a partially
depleted information source. By doing so, we unify the utilization of semantic

more information from an incompletely depleted classical randomness source, but
it is not possible for quantum randomness sources.

exponential family, the detection of the transient change of one of the

information necessary to understand the effect of trees on urban environments.
In this study, we demonstrate a method for estimating the leaf area density
(LAD) distribution of individual trees using high-resolution airborne LiDAR.
This method improves upon the previously proposed method, which calculates LAD
based on the contact frequency between the laser beams and leaves by tracing
the paths of the laser beams. The proposed method in this study exploits the
last and intermediate pulses in addition to the first and single pulses to
capture the foliage distribution in the inner part of the crown. Each laser
beam is traced from a point derived by the last pulse to the point derived by
the first or intermediate pulse that is recorded immediately before the last
pulse. The laser beam interceptions and intersections can thus be accurately
reproduced while considering the last and intermediate pulses. We verify the
estimation accuracy of the three-dimensional LAD distribution using terrestrial
LiDAR data from a single tree (Z. serrata). The appropriate voxel size for
representing the LAD distribution from the airborne LiDAR is first determined
by comparing the distribution of voxels containing one or more airborne LiDAR
points with that containing one or more terrestrial LiDAR points. The estimated
LAD distribution with a voxel size of 1 m by 1 m by 0.5 m is subsequently
compared to the terrestrial LiDAR-derived LAD distribution. When only the first
and single pulses are used, the LAD is overestimated and underestimated in the
upper and lower part of the crown, respectively. We confirmed that using the
last and intermediate pulses improves the estimation accuracy of the entire

many emerging Machine-Learning-as-a-Service applications, where prediction
services based on well-trained models are offered to users via pay-per-query.
The lack of a defense mechanism can impose a high risk on the privacy of the
server's model since an adversary could efficiently steal the model by querying
only a few `good' data points. The interplay between a server's defense and an
adversary's attack inevitably leads to an arms race dilemma, as commonly seen
in Adversarial Machine Learning. To study the fundamental tradeoffs between
model utility from a benign user's view and privacy from an adversary's view,
we develop new metrics to quantify such tradeoffs, analyze their theoretical
properties, and develop an optimization problem to understand the optimal
adversarial attack and defense strategies. The developed concepts and theory
match the empirical findings on the `equilibrium' between privacy and utility.
In terms of optimization, the key ingredient that enables our results is a
unified representation of the attack-defense problem as a min-max bi-level

precision is crucial for understanding quasars as a population. These are
fundamental physical properties that underpin models of active galactic nuclei.
A primary technique to measure the black hole mass employs the reverberation
mapping of low-redshift quasars, which is then extended via the
radius-luminosity relationship for the broad-line region to estimate masses
based on single-epoch spectra. An updated radius-luminosity relationship
incorporates the flux ratio of optical Fe ii to H$\beta$ ($\equiv
\mathcal{R}_{\rm Fe}$) to correct for a bias in which more highly accreting
systems have smaller line-emitting regions than previously realized. In this
current work, we demonstrate and quantify the effect of using this Fe-corrected
radius-luminosity relationship on mass estimation by employing archival data
sets possessing rest-frame optical spectra over a wide range of redshifts. We
find that failure to use a Fe-corrected radius predictor results in
overestimated single-epoch black hole masses for the most highly accreting
quasars. Their accretion rate measures ($L_{\rm Bol}/ L_{\rm Edd}$ and
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$), are similarly underestimated. The strongest Fe-emitting
quasars belong to two classes: high-z quasars with rest-frame optical spectra,
which given their extremely high luminosities, require high accretion rates,
and their low-z analogs, which given their low black holes masses, must have
high accretion rates to meet survey flux limits. These classes have mass
corrections downward of about a factor of two, on average. These results
strengthen the association of the dominant Eigenvector 1 parameter
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm Fe}$ with the accretion process.

Across multiple visual recognition benchmarks, we found that pre-training can
not only improve FL, but also close its accuracy gap to the counterpart
centralized learning, especially in the challenging cases of non-IID clients'
data. To make our findings applicable to situations where pre-trained models
are not directly available, we explore pre-training with synthetic data or even
with clients' data in a decentralized manner, and found that they can already
improve FL notably. Interestingly, many of the techniques we explore are
complementary to each other to further boost the performance, and we view this
as a critical result toward scaling up deep FL for real-world applications. We
conclude our paper with an attempt to understand the effect of pre-training on
FL. We found that pre-training enables the learned global models under
different clients' data conditions to converge to the same loss basin, and
makes global aggregation in FL more stable. Nevertheless, pre-training seems to
not alleviate local model drifting, a fundamental problem in FL under non-IID

radiative scenario and when the central engine injects continuous energy into
the blastwave to study the evolution of the spectral and temporal indexes of
those bursts reported in 2FLGC. We consider the SSC afterglow model evolving in
stellar-wind and interstellar medium, and the CRs as a function of the
radiative parameter, the energy injection index, and the electron spectral
index for $1<p<2$ and $ 2\leq p$. We select all GRBs that have been modeled
with both a simple or a broken power law in the 2FLGC. We found that the CRs of
the SSC model can satisfy a significant fraction of burst that cannot be
interpreted in the synchrotron scenario, even though those that require an
intermediate density profile (e.g., GRB 130427A) or an atypical fraction of
total energy given to amplify the magnetic field ($\varepsilon_B$). The value
of this parameter in the SSC model ranges ($\varepsilon_B\approx 10^{-5} -
10^{-4}$) when the cooling spectral break corresponds to the Fermi-LAT band for
typical values of GRB afterglow. The analysis shows that ISM is preferred for

devices, which are better to be preserved on devices and queried on demand.
However, data analysts still lack a uniform way to harness such distributed
on-device data. In this paper, we propose a data querying system, Deck, that
enables flexible device-centric federated analytics. The key idea of Deck is to
bypass the app developers but allow the data analysts to directly submit their
analytics code to run on devices, through a centralized query coordinator
service. Deck provides a list of standard APIs to data analysts and handles
most of the device-specific tasks underneath. Deck further incorporates two key
techniques: (i) a hybrid permission checking mechanism and mandatory
cross-device aggregation to ensure data privacy; (ii) a zero-knowledge
statistical model that judiciously trades off query delay and query resource
expenditure on devices. We fully implement Deck and plug it into 20 popular
Android apps. An in-the-wild deployment on 1,642 volunteers shows that Deck
significantly reduces the query delay by up to 30x compared to baselines. Our
microbenchmarks also demonstrate that the standalone overhead of Deck is
negligible.

between the source and target domains. Gradual domain adaptation is one of the
approaches used to address the problem. It involves leveraging the intermediate
domain, which gradually shifts from the source domain to the target domain. The
previous work assumed that the number of intermediate domains is large and the
distance between adjacent domains is small; hence, the gradual domain
adaptation algorithm, involving self-training with unlabeled datasets, was
applicable. In practice, however, gradual self-training will fail because the
number of intermediate domains is limited and the distance between adjacent
domains is large. We propose the use of normalizing flows to deal with this
problem while maintaining the framework of unsupervised domain adaptation. We
generate pseudo intermediate domains from normalizing flows and then use them
for gradual domain adaptation. We evaluate our proposed method by experiments
with real-world datasets and confirm that it mitigates the above-explained
problem and improves the classification performance.

human actions from various co-occurring ingredients, e.g., context and

substantial progress through devising advanced action detectors, they still
suffer from these co-occurring ingredients which often dominate the actual

complementary aspects of a video snippet, i.e., the action features and the
co-occurrence features. Especially, we develop a novel auxiliary task by
decoupling these two types of features within a video snippet and recombining
them to generate a new feature representation with more salient action
information for accurate action localization. We term our method RefactorNet,
which first explicitly factorizes the action content and regularizes its
co-occurrence features, and then synthesizes a new action-dominated video

cathode materials for Li-ion batteries. Recently, Li-rich defect anti-fluorite
Li$_5$FeO$_4$ has emerged as a high-capacity cathode material exhibiting
simultaneous anionic and cationic redox without significant oxygen release. But
suffers from irreversible structural change and capacity fade during cycling.
Herein we investigate the suppressed capacity fade reported in Co substituted
Li$_5$FeO$_4$ and establish the optimal performance through tuning the
concentration and oxidation state of Co. We have substituted Co at the Fe site
and carried out a detailed analysis of structural, magnetic, electronic, and
electrochemical properties using first-principles density functional theory
calculations. The extended stability and suppressed capacity fading are found
only in specific compositions depending on the Co/Li concentration and the
oxidation state of Co. The reasons behind suppressed capacity fading in Co
substituted systems have been unveiled on the basis of bonding analyses and
proposed as a strategy to suppress the voltage fading reported in Li-rich
materials due to transition metal migration. From the evaluation of
thermodynamic stability and electronic structure,
Li$_{5.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$O$_4$, Li$_5$Fe$_{0.25}$Co$_{0.75}$O$_4$, and
Li$_{4.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$O$_4$ are found to exhibit better electrical
conductivity than Li$_5$FeO$_4$. All these systems have voltage in the range of
3 to 5 V and exhibit three dimensional Li diffusion pathway with a diffusion
barrier height of around 0.3 eV. From Li$_5$Fe$_{0.25}$Co$_{0.75}$O$_4$, one
can delithiate three Li-ions without structural change and oxygen release,
therefore expected to acquire a reversible capacity of around 513 mAh/g.
Moreover, as in pristine Li$_5$FeO$_4$, the selected Co substituted systems
also exhibit simultaneous anionic and cationic redox without significant O2
release.

orientation. Its efficiency, however, decreases dramatically due to the
sequential constraint. Although the divide-and-conquer strategy has been
utilized for efficiency improvement, cluster merging becomes difficult or
depends on seriously designed overlap structures. This paper proposes an
algorithm to extract the global model for cluster merging and designs a
parallel SfM solution to achieve efficient and accurate UAV image orientation.
First, based on vocabulary tree retrieval, match pairs are selected to
construct an undirected weighted match graph, whose edge weights are calculated
by considering both the number and distribution of feature matches. Second, an
algorithm, termed weighted connected dominating set (WCDS), is designed to
achieve the simplification of the match graph and build the global model, which
incorporates the edge weight in the graph node selection and enables the
successful reconstruction of the global model. Third, the match graph is
simultaneously divided into compact and non-overlapped clusters. After the
parallel reconstruction, cluster merging is conducted with the aid of common 3D
points between the global and cluster models. Finally, by using three UAV
datasets that are captured by classical oblique and recent optimized views
photogrammetry, the validation of the proposed solution is verified through
comprehensive analysis and comparison. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed parallel SfM can achieve 17.4 times efficiency improvement
and comparative orientation accuracy. In absolute BA, the geo-referencing
accuracy is approximately 2.0 and 3.0 times the GSD (Ground Sampling Distance)
value in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. For parallel
SfM, the proposed solution is a more reliable alternative.

design could potentially lead to optimization of one specific value of interest
but fail to leverage informative features from intermediate layers that might
benefit classification performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.
Recently, auxiliary convolutional neural networks (AuxCNNs) have been employed
on top of traditional classification networks to facilitate the training of
intermediate layers to improve classification performance and robustness. In
this study, we proposed an adversarial learning-based AuxCNN to support the
training of deep neural networks for medical image classification. Two main
innovations were adopted in our AuxCNN classification framework. First, the
proposed AuxCNN architecture includes an image generator and an image
discriminator for extracting more informative image features for medical image
classification, motivated by the concept of generative adversarial network
(GAN) and its impressive ability in approximating target data distribution.
Second, a hybrid loss function is designed to guide the model training by
incorporating different objectives of the classification network and AuxCNN to
reduce overfitting. Comprehensive experimental studies demonstrated the
superior classification performance of the proposed model. The effect of the
network-related factors on classification performance was investigated.

classical random variable. We prove a Poly$(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ upper bound on
the sample complexity, which is independent of the size of the quantum system.
We then show that such a similarity metric is directly related to a functional
definition of similarity of unitary operations using the conventional fidelity
metric of quantum states ($F$): If $\| U_1-U_2 \|_{S_2}$ is sufficiently small
(e.g. $ \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1+\sqrt{2(1/\delta - 1)}}$) then the fidelity of
states obtained by processing the same randomly and uniformly picked pure
state, $|\psi \rangle$, is as high as needed ($F({U}_1 |\psi \rangle, {U}_2
|\psi \rangle)\geq 1-\epsilon$) with probability exceeding $1-\delta$. We
provide example applications of this efficient similarity metric estimation
framework to quantum circuit learning tasks, such as finding the square root of

participants is chosen and, unless it decides to reveal itself, no other
participant can identify it. SSLE has a great potential in protecting
blockchain consensus protocols against denial of service (DoS) attacks.
However, all existing solutions either make strong synchrony assumptions or
have expiring registration, meaning that they require elected processes to
re-register themselves before they can be re-elected again. This, in turn,
prohibits the use of these SSLE protocols to elect leaders in
partially-synchronous consensus protocols as there may be long periods of
network instability when no new blocks are decided and, thus, no new
registrations (or re-registrations) are possible. In this paper, we propose
Homomorphic Sortition -- the first asynchronous SSLE protocol with non-expiring
registration, making it the first solution compatible with
partially-synchronous leader-based consensus protocols.
  Homomorphic Sortition relies on Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption
(ThFHE) and is tailored to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, with several
important optimizations with respect to prior proposals. In particular, unlike
most existing SSLE protocols, it works with arbitrary stake distributions and
does not require a user with multiple coins to be registered multiple times.
Our protocol is highly parallelizable and can be run completely off-chain after
setup.
  Some blockchains require a sequence of rounds to have non-repeating leaders.
We define a generalization of SSLE, called Secret Leader Permutation (SLP) in
which the application can choose how many non-repeating leaders should be
output in a sequence of rounds and we show how Homomorphic Sortition also
solves this problem.

tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been
made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \textit{smooth}
low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and
computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been
slow paced. In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such
problems. Mainly, we prove that under a \textit{strict complementarity}
condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective
can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, approximated variants of two
popular \textit{mirror-prox} methods: the Euclidean \textit{extragradient
method} and mirror-prox with \textit{matrix exponentiated gradient updates},
when initialized with a ""warm-start"", converge to an optimal solution with rate
$O(1/t)$, while requiring only two \textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration.
Moreover, for the extragradient method we also consider relaxed versions of
strict complementarity which yield a trade-off between the rank of the SVDs
required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method.
We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several
nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating both the plausibility
of the strict complementarity assumption, and the efficient convergence of our
proposed low-rank mirror-prox variants.

  in Future Space Exploration Missions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Space exploration has witnessed revolutionary changes upon landing of the
Perseverance Rover on the Martian surface and demonstrating the first flight
beyond Earth by the Mars helicopter, Ingenuity. During their mission on Mars,
Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity collaboratively explore the Martian surface,
where Ingenuity scouts terrain information for rover's safe traversability.
Hence, determining the relative poses between both the platforms is of
paramount importance for the success of this mission. Driven by this necessity,
this work proposes a robust relative localization system based on a fusion of
neuromorphic vision-based measurements (NVBMs) and inertial measurements. The
emergence of neuromorphic vision triggered a paradigm shift in the computer
vision community, due to its unique working principle delineated with
asynchronous events triggered by variations of light intensities occurring in
the scene. This implies that observations cannot be acquired in static scenes
due to illumination invariance. To circumvent this limitation, high frequency
active landmarks are inserted in the scene to guarantee consistent event
firing. These landmarks are adopted as salient features to facilitate relative
localization. A novel event-based landmark identification algorithm using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is developed for matching the landmarks
correspondences formulating our NVBMs. The NVBMs are fused with inertial
measurements in proposed state estimators, landmark tracking Kalman filter
(LTKF) and translation decoupled Kalman filter (TDKF) for landmark tracking and
relative localization, respectively. The proposed system was tested in a
variety of experiments and has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in
accuracy and range.

aroused wide interest in the area of recommendation systems (RS) owing to its
simplicity and effectiveness. Typically, the existing literature of CML depends
largely on the \textit{negative sampling} strategy to alleviate the
time-consuming burden of pairwise computation. However, in this work, by taking
a theoretical analysis, we find that negative sampling would lead to a biased
estimation of the generalization error. Specifically, we show that the
sampling-based CML would introduce a bias term in the generalization bound,
which is quantified by the per-user \textit{Total Variance} (TV) between the
distribution induced by negative sampling and the ground truth distribution.
This suggests that optimizing the sampling-based CML loss function does not
ensure a small generalization error even with sufficiently large training data.
Moreover, we show that the bias term will vanish without the negative sampling
strategy. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient alternative without
negative sampling for CML named \textit{Sampling-Free Collaborative Metric
Learning} (SFCML), to get rid of the sampling bias in a practical sense.
Finally, comprehensive experiments over seven benchmark datasets speak to the
superiority of the proposed algorithm.

advantage that the meaning of each feature is explicitly distinguished. Another
approach is to predict mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. However,
parametric vocoders have limitations of voice quality and the mel-spectrogram
features are difficult to model because the timbre and pitch information are
entangled. In this study, we propose a singing voice synthesis model with
multi-task learning to use both approaches -- acoustic features for a
parametric vocoder and mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. By using the
parametric vocoder features as auxiliary features, the proposed model can
efficiently disentangle and control the timbre and pitch components of the
mel-spectrogram. Moreover, a generative adversarial network framework is
applied to improve the quality of singing voices in a multi-singer model.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model can generate more

applies differential privacy by adding randomness to the neighbors' ratings,

identify small but highly reusable neighborhoods so that (i) only a minimal set

not need to be protected with differential privacy, since they are only rarely
exploited as neighbors. In our experiments on five diverse datasets, we make
two key observations: Firstly, ReuseKNN requires significantly smaller
neighborhoods, and thus, fewer neighbors need to be protected with differential
privacy compared to traditional UserKNN. Secondly, despite the small
neighborhoods, ReuseKNN outperforms UserKNN and a fully differentially private
approach in terms of accuracy. Overall, ReuseKNN leads to significantly less
privacy risk for users than in the case of UserKNN.

Roughly speaking, we use the geometric distance of the current input from the

uncertainty estimations than recently proposed approaches by extensively

is modelled as a contact binary, similar to that of Boldrin et al. (2016). Both
bodies are modelled as ellipsoids, and the secondary is given an initial
rotation angle about its body-fixed $y$-axis. Moreover, we consider six
different cases, three where the density of the secondary varies, and three
where we vary its shape. The simulations consider 45 different initial tilt
angles of the secondary, each with 37 different mass ratios. We start the
dynamical simulations at the moment the contact binary reaches a spin fission
limit, and our model ensures that the closest distance between the surfaces of
the two bodies is always kept at 1 cm. The forces, torques and gravitational
potential between the two bodies are modelled using a newly developed surface
integration scheme, giving exact results for two ellipsoids. We find that more
than 80% of the simulations end with the two bodies impacting, and collisions
between the bodies are more common when the density of the secondary is lower,
or when it becomes more elongated. When comparing with data on asteroid pairs
from Pravec et al. (2019) we find that variations in density and shape of the
secondary can account for some of the spread seen in the rotation period for
observed pairs. Furthermore, the secondary may also reach a spin limit for
surface disruption, creating a ternary/multiple system. We find that secondary
fission typically occurs within the first five hours after the contact binary
separates, and is more common when the secondary is less dense or more
elongated.

dynamics is to use a hard regime assignment, where each atmospheric state is
assigned to the regime it is closest to in distance. However, this may not
always be the most appropriate approach as the regime assignment may be
affected by small deviations in the distance to the regimes due to noise. To
mitigate this we develop a sequential probabilistic regime assignment using
Bayes Theorem, which can be applied to previously defined regimes and
implemented in real time as new data become available. Bayes Theorem tells us
that the probability of being in a regime given the data can be determined by
combining climatological likelihood with prior information. The regime
probabilities at time $t$ can be used to inform the prior probabilities at time
$t+1$, which are then used to sequentially update the regime probabilities. We
apply this approach to both reanalysis data and a seasonal hindcast ensemble
incorporating knowledge of the transition probabilities between regimes.
Furthermore, making use of the signal present within the ensemble to better
inform the prior probabilities allows for identifying more pronounced
interannual variability. The signal within the interannual variability of
wintertime North Atlantic circulation regimes is assessed using both a
categorical and regression approach, with the strongest signals found during
very strong El Ni\~no years.

this manuscript, the focus is on the numerical treatment of variational
inequality. In this context, the popular history-variable approach suffers from
variationally inconsistency and non-quantifiable nature of the error
introduced. A better alternative, the penalisation approach, has the potential
to render the stiffness matrix ill-conditioned. In order to circumvent both

phase-field into a local variable, while introducing a micromorphic variable
that regularises the fracture problem. This reduction the regularity
requirements for the phase-field enables an easier implementation of the
fracture irreversibility constraint through simple 'max' operation, with system

classification is the design of appropriate loss functions that exhibit strong
discriminative power. The classical softmax loss does not explicitly encourage
discriminative learning of features. A popular direction of research is to
incorporate margins in well-established losses in order to enforce extra
intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which, however, were
developed through heuristic means, as opposed to rigorous mathematical
principles. In this work, we attempt to address this limitation by formulating
the principled optimization objective as learning towards the largest margins.
Specifically, we firstly define the class margin as the measure of inter-class
separability, and the sample margin as the measure of intra-class compactness.
Accordingly, to encourage discriminative representation of features, the loss
function should promote the largest possible margins for both classes and
samples. Furthermore, we derive a generalized margin softmax loss to draw
general conclusions for the existing margin-based losses. Not only does this
principled framework offer new perspectives to understand and interpret
existing margin-based losses, but it also provides new insights that can guide
the design of new tools, including sample margin regularization and largest
margin softmax loss for the class-balanced case, and zero-centroid
regularization for the class-imbalanced case. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our strategy on a variety of tasks, including visual

Zn5(OH)8Cl2 H2O (simonkolleite), ZnCO3 (smithsonite), Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6
(marionite/ hydrozincite). Second, the identified corrosion minerals are
correlated with the HSI spectra for these specific locations. This correlation
provides us with the spectra in the SWIR region and allows us to construct a
classification map for the different corrosion minerals. The results show that
we are able to identify the different minerals using HSI camera. This proposed
methodology allows us to speed up the inspection process, compared to FTIR,
while still accurately distinguishing between the different corrosion minerals.

opening mass, $M_{\rm gap}$. We use one- and two-dimensional simulations to
study planet gap opening in discs with angular momentum transport powered by
MHD disc winds. We parameterise the efficiency of the MHD disc wind angular
momentum transport through a dimensionless parameter $\alpha_{\rm dw}$, which
is an analogue to the turbulent viscosity $\alpha_{\rm v}$. We find that
magnetised winds are much less efficient in counteracting planet tidal torques
than turbulence is. For discs with astrophysically realistic values of
$\alpha_{\rm dw}$, $M_{\rm gap}$ is always determined by the residual disc
turbulence, and is a factor of a few to ten smaller than usually obtained for
viscous discs. We introduce a gap opening criterion applicable for any values
of $\alpha_{\rm v}$ and $\alpha_{\rm dw}$ that may be useful for planet
formation population synthesis. We show that in discs powered by magnetised
winds, growing planets detach from the disc at planet masses below $\sim
0.1M_{\rm Jup}$ inside 10 AU. This promotes formation of super-Earth planets
rather than gas giants in this region, in particular precluding formation of
hot jupiters in situ. On larger scales, ALMA gap opening planet candidates may
be less massive than currently believed. Future high-resolution observations
with instruments such as the extended ALMA, ngVLA, and SKA are likely to show
abundant narrow annular features at $R < 10$ AU due to ubiquitous super-Earth

flows past aerodynamic surfaces, but is expensive to model in high fidelity
computations. Low-order methods based on discrete vortex elements are able to
capture the physical behavior of these flows, in particular when enhanced with
a criterion that models the ability of the leading edge to sustain suction.
These models are significantly faster than high order methods, but their
expense still grows as vortex elements are continuously shed and convected into
the wake, in effect an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ problem. This work proposes
accelerating the leading-edge suction parameter discrete vortex method (LDVM)
by limiting the number of vortex elements in the LEV coherent structure to N,
hence giving the name to the method N-LEV LDVM. The N-LEV LDVM method correctly
approximates the flows in comparison with the original LDVM model and
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations until the point of LEV
detachment, which N-LEV LDVM is unable to model. We propose reintroducing this
behavior via two physical detachment criteria studied in LEV literature, a
threshold of maximum circulation in the LEV and trailing edge flow reversal. We
demonstrate the ability of the N-LEV LDVM method to accurately predict the
instant in time this detachment occurs for both mechanisms in comparison with
experimental results, laying the ground for their incorporation into the
method.

complex high-dimensional data, with simple relations to their properties. Such
disentangled representations make easier to interpret the significant latent
factors of variation in the data, as well as to generate new data with
desirable features. Methods for disentangling representations often rely on an
adversarial scheme, in which representations are tuned to avoid discriminators
from being able to reconstruct information about the data properties (labels).
Unfortunately adversarial training is generally difficult to implement in
practice. Here we propose a simple, effective way of disentangling
representations without any need to train adversarial discriminators, and apply
our approach to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), one of the simplest
representation-based generative models. Our approach relies on the introduction
of adequate constraints on the weights during training, which allows us to
concentrate information about labels on a small subset of latent variables. The
effectiveness of the approach is illustrated with four examples: the CelebA
dataset of facial images, the two-dimensional Ising model, the MNIST dataset of
handwritten digits, and the taxonomy of protein families. In addition, we show
how our framework allows for analytically computing the cost, in terms of
log-likelihood of the data, associated to the disentanglement of their

wanted to study the role of EI in-depth during RC handling. Method: We
conducted a socio-technical grounded theory study with eighteen software
practitioners from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Findings:
We found causal condition (software practitioners handling RCs), intervening
condition (mode of work), causes (being aware of own emotions, being aware of
others' emotions), direct consequences (regulating own emotions, managing
relationships), extended consequences (sustaining productivity, setting and
sustaining team goals), and contingencies: strategies (open and regular
communication, tracking commitments and issues, and ten other strategies) of
using EI during RC handling. We also found the covariances where strategies
co-vary with the causes and direct consequences, and ease/ difficulty in
executing strategies co-vary with the intervening condition. Conclusion: Open

knowledge, the framework we present in this paper is the first theoretical
framework on EI in Software Engineering research. We provide recommendations
including a problem-solution chart in the form of causes, direct consequences,

Here, we instead consider settings where the underlying optimization problem is
easily solvable. Our main contribution is to classify the complexity of
approximating a wide class of observables via a generic reduction from
approximate counting to the problem of estimating local observables. The key
idea is to use the observables to interpolate the counting problem.
  Using this new approach, we are able to study observables on bipartite graphs
where the underlying optimization problem is easy but the counting problem is
believed to be hard. The most-well studied class of graphs that was excluded
from previous hardness results were bipartite graphs. We establish hardness for
estimating the average size of the independent set in bipartite graphs of
maximum degree 6; more generally, we show tight hardness results for general
vertex-edge observables for antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems on bipartite

Competition in CVPR 2022. The competition addresses the problem of
Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
requires an agent to follow step-by-step natural language instructions to reach
a target. We present a modular plan-and-control approach for the task. Our
model consists of three modules: the candidate waypoints predictor (CWP), the
history enhanced planner and the tryout controller. In each decision loop, CWP
first predicts a set of candidate waypoints based on depth observations from
multiple views. It can reduce the complexity of the action space and facilitate
planning. Then, a history-enhanced planner is adopted to select one of the
candidate waypoints as the subgoal. The planner additionally encodes historical
memory to track the navigation progress, which is especially effective for
long-horizon navigation. Finally, we propose a non-parametric heuristic
controller named tryout to execute low-level actions to reach the planned
subgoal. It is based on the trial-and-error mechanism which can help the agent
to avoid obstacles and escape from getting stuck. All three modules work
hierarchically until the agent stops. We further take several recent advances
of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to improve the performance such as
pretraining based on large-scale synthetic in-domain dataset, environment-level
data augmentation and snapshot model ensemble. Our model won the RxR-Habitat

monolingual word vector spaces are determined using skip-gram algorithm so that
each space encodes common word associations from laypeople within a language.

bilingual word vector space, where we employ cosine similarity as a metric for

our framework demonstrates that it can effectively retrieve similar medical

  Prototyping on FPGAs",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) recently became widely used, from multi-core CPUs to
edge-AI accelerators. Emulation on FPGAs promises to accelerate their RTL
modeling compared to slow simulations. However, realistic test stimuli are
challenging to generate in hardware for diverse applications. In other words,
both a fast and flexible design framework is required. The most promising
solution is hybrid emulation, in which parts of the design are simulated in
software, and the other parts are emulated in hardware. This paper proposes a
novel hybrid emulation framework called EmuNoC. We introduce a
clock-synchronization method and software-only packet generation that improves
the emulation speed by 36.3x to 79.3x over state-of-the-art frameworks while
retaining the flexibility of a pure-software interface for stimuli simulation.
We also increased the area efficiency to model up to an NoC with 169 routers on
a single FPGA, while previous frameworks only achieved 64 routers.

plays an important role in its physico-chemical transformations. Although the
radiation chemistry of H2O astrophysical ice analogues has been well studied,
direct and systematic comparisons of different solid phases are scarce and are
typically limited to just two phases. In this article, we describe the results
of an in-depth study of the 2 keV electron irradiation of amorphous solid water
(ASW), restrained amorphous ice (RAI) and the cubic (Ic) and hexagonal (Ih)
crystalline phases at 20 K so as to further uncover any potential dependence of
the radiation physics and chemistry on the solid phase of the ice. Mid-infrared
spectroscopic analysis of the four investigated H2O ice phases revealed that
electron irradiation of the RAI, Ic, and Ih phases resulted in their
amorphization (with the latter undergoing the process more slowly) while ASW
underwent compaction. The abundance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced as a
result of the irradiation was also found to vary between phases, with yields
being highest in irradiated ASW. This observation is the cumulative result of
several factors including the increased porosity and quantity of lattice
defects in ASW, as well as its less extensive hydrogen-bonding network. Our
results have astrophysical implications, particularly with regards to H2O-rich
icy interstellar and Solar System bodies exposed to both radiation fields and
temperature gradients.

corresponding to health-states of the monitored system are often unavailable.
This issue limits the applicability of fully-supervised machine learning
paradigms for the development of statistical classifiers to be used in
decision-support in SHM systems. One approach to dealing with this problem is
risk-based active learning. In such an approach, data-label querying is guided
according to the expected value of perfect information for incipient data
points. For risk-based active learning in SHM, the value of information is
evaluated with respect to a maintenance decision process, and the data-label
querying corresponds to the inspection of a structure to determine its health
state.
  In the context of SHM, risk-based active learning has only been considered
for generative classifiers. The current paper demonstrates several advantages
of using an alternative type of classifier -- discriminative models. Using the
Z24 Bridge dataset as a case study, it is shown that discriminative classifiers
have benefits, in the context of SHM decision-support, including improved
robustness to sampling bias, and reduced expenditure on structural inspections.

to be able to estimate their state and external interactions based on
(proprioceptive) sensors. Estimating disturbances allows a soft robot to
perform desirable force control. Even in the case of rigid manipulators, force
estimation at the end-effector is seen as a non-trivial problem. And indeed,
other current approaches to address this challenge have shortcomings that
prevent their general application. They are often based on simplified soft
dynamic models, such as the ones relying on a piece-wise constant curvature
(PCC) approximation or matched rigid-body models that do not represent enough
details of the problem. Thus, the applications needed for complex human-robot
interaction can not be built. Finite element methods (FEM) allow for
predictions of soft robot dynamics in a more generic fashion. Here, using the
soft robot modeling capabilities of the framework SOFA, we build a detailed FEM
model of a multi-segment soft continuum robotic arm composed of compliant
deformable materials and fiber-reinforced pressurized actuation chambers with a
model for sensors that provide orientation output. This model is used to
establish a state observer for the manipulator. Model parameters were
calibrated to match imperfections of the manual fabrication process using
physical experiments. We then solve a quadratic programming inverse dynamics
problem to compute the components of external force that explain the pose
error. Our experiments show an average force estimation error of around 1.2%.
As the methods proposed are generic, these results are encouraging for the task
of building soft robots exhibiting complex, reactive, sensor-based behavior
that can be deployed in human-centered environments.

examine possible learning and transfer effects fostered by playing the

data of each player was digitally recorded during gameplay. Our findings
demonstrated a significant positive learning effect of Newtons Race. This

gameplay mostly matched expected learning during the game, with physically

the homology of chain complexes in $\mathsf{C}$ by taking the homology objects
to be morphisms of $\mathsf{C}$, which one may think of as maps from an object
of cycles to an object of chains modulo boundaries.
  One situation to which Grandis's original framework does not apply is
\textit{$\varepsilon$-curved homological algebra}. This refers to chain
complexes of normed spaces whose differential squares to zero only
approximately, in the sense that $\|d^2\| \leq \varepsilon$ for some
$\varepsilon > 0$. This is relevant for example in the theory of approximate
representations of groups, where Kazhdan has successfully employed
$\varepsilon$-curved homological techniques in an ad-hoc manner. We develop
some basics of $\varepsilon$-curved homological algebra and note that our
result on arrow categories facilitates the application of Grandis's theory.

Radiation Pressure Compression (RPC) photoionization models, with the harder
aox ionizing spectrum. However, these results do not reproduce well the
enhancement pattern of the C IV, Mg II, and C III] EWs, or the observed high C
IV/Mg II ratio. RPC calculations indicate that the C IV/Mg II line ratio is an
effective metallicity indicator, and models with sub-Solar metallicity gas and
a hard ionizing continuum reproduce well the enhancement pattern of all four
ultraviolet lines. We find that the C IV/Mg II line ratio in quasars is
generally correlated with the excess X-ray emission. Extremely high EV1 quasars
are characterized by high metallicity and suppressed X-ray emission. The
underlying mechanism relating gas metallicity and X-ray emission is not clear,
but may be related to radiation-pressure driven disk winds, which are enhanced
at high metallicity, and consequent mass loading reducing coronal X-ray

human vocal tract, and their accurate estimation is among the most fundamental

  The contribution of this paper is to propose a new network architecture that
performs well on a variety of different speaker and speech domains. Our
proposed model is composed of a shared encoder that gets as input a spectrogram
and outputs a domain-invariant representation. Then, multiple decoders further
process this representation, each responsible for predicting a different
formant while considering the lower formant predictions. An advantage of our
model is that it is based on heatmaps that generate a probability distribution
over formant predictions. Results suggest that our proposed model better
represents the signal over various domains and leads to better formant

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in solving complex flow problems and the

developed and the numerical instability issues due to the discontinuity of
interfaces are carefully addressed. A local refilling algorithm for new fluid
nodes is proposed and special treatments are introduced to reduce numerical
noises when two particles are close. The proposed model is validated by
simulations of settling of a single sphere (with metaball representation) as
well as a non-spherical particle in a viscous fluid. Good agreements are found
comparing the simulations with experimental results which are also carried out
in this study. The coupling scheme is also tested by multiple particle
simulations which clearly illustrated the stability of the proposed model.
Finally, numerical examples with complex particle shapes demonstrated that the
proposed model can be a powerful tool for future applications such as
shape-induced segregation in riverbeds, and phase transition of dense

Secondly, the FSLBM, a sharp interface model, generally requires a lower

spurious pressure oscillations and numerical instability are generated. The
strength and speed of propagation of shock waves cannot be represented
correctly using a semi-conservative or primitive method. In this research, an
adaptive primitive-conservative scheme is designed to overcome the aforesaid
two difficulties. The underlying cause for pressure oscillation is analyzed
within the framework of Finite Volume Method (FVM). We found that the
nonlinearity of the thermodynamic properties of transcritical fluids renders
standard conservative numerical methods ineffective. In smooth regions, schemes
based on primitive variable are used to eliminate spurious pressure
oscillations. For the purpose of correctly capturing shock waves, the modified
Roe Riemann solver for real fluid is utilized in regions where shock waves
induce discontinuity. The adaptive numerical approach relies only on the speed
of sound, eliminating the requirement to calculate the derivatives of
thermodynamic quantities. A large number of numerical test cases conducted in
one- and two-dimensional spaces have shown the robustness and accuracy of the
proposed adaptive scheme for the simulations of high speed transcritical flows.

size distribution in bacterial communities, also known as biofilm, remains
stable over time. This suggests the existence of homeostatic mechanisms that
contribute to maintaining a stable size distribution. Those known as sizer and

A search for periodicity in Fermi-LAT data found an orbital period of

are due to the observation of the confined shock formed between the pulsar and
stellar wind pointing towards the observer. The secondary increase or strong
rapid variations of the X-ray flux at phases 0.25-0.75 is due to the

collected and analysed spectroscopic and photometric observations covering a
time interval of about 25000 d (68 yr). We present evidence that the object is
a single-line 192.9 d spectroscopic binary and estimate that the secondary
probably is a hot compact object with a mass of about 1.1-1.2 solar masses. We
found and documented very complicated orbital and long-term spectral, light,
and colour variations, which must arise from a combination of several distinct
variability patterns. Attempts at modelling them are planned for a follow-up

known for some other systematically studied Be stars and discuss the current
ideas about the nature of the Be phenomenon.

particle events at Earth. One issue is understanding why some large solar
eruptive events trigger ground level enhancement (GLE) events and others do
not. In this work we perform 3D test particle simulations of a set of historic
GLEs to understand more about what causes these powerful events. Particular
focus is given to studying how the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) affects
high-energy proton transport through the heliosphere following an event.
Analysis of $\geq$M7.0 flares between 1976$-$2020 shows that active regions
located closer to the HCS ($<$10$^{\circ}$) are more likely to be associated
with a GLE event. We found that modelled GLE events where the source region was
close to the HCS also led to increased heliospheric transport in longitude and
higher count rates (when the Earth was located in the drift direction). In a
model that does not include perpendicular diffusion associated with turbulence,
the HCS is the dominant mechanism affecting heliospheric particle transport for
GLE 42 and 69, and varying other parameters (e.g. a narrow, 10$^{\circ}$, or
wider, 60$^{\circ}$, injection width) causes little change. Overall in our
model, the HCS is relevant in 71$\%$ of our analysed GLEs and including it more
accurately reproduces observed intensities near Earth. Our simulations enable
us to produce model profiles at Earth that can be compared to existing
observations by the GOES satellites and neutron monitors, as well as for use in
developing future forecasting models.

can determine properties of the asymptotic dynamics. For instance, considering
the asynchronous dynamics, the absence of positive cycles guarantees the
existence of a unique attractor, and the absence of negative cycles ensures
that all attractors are fixed points. In presence of multiple attractors, one
might be interested in properties that ensure that attractors are sufficiently
""isolated"", that is, they can be found in separate subspaces or even trap
spaces, subspaces that are closed with respect to the dynamics. Here we
introduce notions of separability for attractors and identify corresponding
necessary conditions on the interaction graph. In particular, we show that if
the interaction graph has at most one positive cycle, or at most one negative
cycle, or if no positive cycle intersects a negative cycle, then the attractors
can be separated by subspaces. If the interaction graph has no path from a
negative to a positive cycle, then the attractors can be separated by trap
spaces. Furthermore, we study networks with interaction graphs admitting two
vertices that intersect all cycles, and show that if their attractors cannot be
separated by subspaces, then their interaction graph must contain a copy of the
complete signed digraph on two vertices, deprived of a negative loop. We thus
establish a connection between a dynamical property and a complex network
motif. The topic is far from exhausted and we conclude by stating some open
questions.

respectively. Droplet breakup is visualized using high-speed imaging in the
experimental setup, where an open ended shock tube generates impulsive
high-speed flow impinging on a droplet held stationary using an acoustic
levitator. Axisymmetric simulations using the Volume of Fluid technique are
conducted to capture the gas dynamics of the flowfield and droplet deformation
at the initial stages. Fluid droplets are subject to a transient flow field
generated by the open ended shock tube, characterized by a propagating incident
shock wave, a recirculating vortex ring, and standing shock cells. Droplet
breakup for all fluids proceeds through an initial flattening of the droplet
followed by generation of a liquid sheet at the periphery in the presence of a
curved, detached shock front at the leading edge. The breakup appears to follow
a sheet stripping process whereby stretched ligaments undergo secondary
atomization through viscous shear. Mist generated in the wake of the droplet
appears to expand laterally due to the unconstrained expansion of the
high-speed gas jet. The breakup morphology of droplets for all fluids appears
consistent with previous observations using conventional shock tubes. Lateral
deformation of the coherent droplet mass is observed to be higher for
nanofluids as compared to water. This is attributed to higher viscosity and
Ohnesorge number of nanofluid droplets, which results in delayed breakup and
increased lateral stretching.

general features for tail ones. Besides, assigning excessive attention to the
tail predicates leads to semantic deviation. Based on this, we propose a novel
SGG framework, learning to generate scene graphs from Head to Tail (SGG-HT),
containing Curriculum Re-weight Mechanism (CRM) and Semantic Context Module

predicates and then gradually focuses on tail/hard ones. SCM is proposed to
relieve semantic deviation by ensuring the semantic consistency between the

study a more general variant called Two-way Partial AUC (TPAUC), where only the

Motivated by this, we present the first trial in this paper to optimize this
new metric. The critical challenge along this course lies in the difficulty of
performing gradient-based optimization with end-to-end stochastic training,
even with a proper choice of surrogate loss. To address this issue, we propose
a generic framework to construct surrogate optimization problems, which
supports efficient end-to-end training with deep learning. Moreover, our
theoretical analyses show that: 1) the objective function of the surrogate
problems will achieve an upper bound of the original problem under mild

generalization performance in terms of TPAUC with a high probability. Finally,
empirical studies over several benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of our

Specifically, the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition can analyze a highly complex

memory can store the state vector. However, simulation of quantum dynamics via
Trotter-Suzuki decomposition requires huge number of steps, each of which
accesses the state vector, and hence the simulation time becomes impractically
long. To settle this issue, we propose a technique to accelerate simulation of
quantum dynamics via simultaneous diagonalization of mutually commuting Pauli
groups, which is also attracting a lot of attention to reduce the measurement
overheads in quantum algorithms. We group the Hamiltonian into mutually
commputing Pauli strings, and each of them are diagonalized in the
computational basis via a Clifford transformation. Since diagonal operators are
applied on the state vector simultaneously with minimum memory access, this
method successfully use performance of highly parallel processors such as
Graphics Processing Units (GPU). Compared to an implementation using one of the
fastest simulators of quantum computers, the numerical experiments have shown

increasing interest in both industry and academia. However, recent empirical
studies revealed what seems to be an overlooked aspect of the architecting of
SoS that is linked to major integration and operational issues: the interplay
between the various disciplines involved in such an architecting process. This
aspect becomes particularly relevant for the management of the interfaces
between the SoS constituents, where such disciplines inevitably meet. In this
paper, we present the results of the first cycle of a Technical Action Research
(TAR) study conducted in cooperation between the authors and a group of
practitioners involved in the long-running architecting process of a
large-scale radio astronomy SoS project. This TAR is aimed at exploring
potential improvements of the document-centered interface management approach
currently followed in this project by adopting elements of the
\textit{documentation-as-code} philosophy, which is widely adopted in the
domain of software systems. As a result, a working proof-of-concept of an ICD
(Interface Control Document) management approach was developed by the
researchers and evaluated by the practitioners. The results of the study and
the corresponding lessons learned are reported in this work.

fluctuations have major socioeconomic effects. Advances in Numerical weather
prediction (NWP) have been measured by the improvement of forecasts for various
physical fields such as temperature and pressure; however, large biases exist
in precipitation prediction. We augment the output of the well-known NWP model
CFSv2 with deep learning to create a hybrid model that improves short-range
global precipitation at 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead times. To hybridise, we address
the sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which
transforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. Dynamical model
precipitation and surface temperature outputs are fed into a modified DLWP-CS
(UNET) to forecast ground truth precipitation. While CFSv2's average bias is +5
to +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model decreases it to
within -1 to +1 mm/day. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004,
China floods in 2010, India floods in 2005, and Myanmar storm Nargis in 2008
are used to confirm the substantial enhancement in the skill for the hybrid
dynamical-deep learning model. CFSv2 typically shows a moderate to large bias
in the spatial pattern and overestimates the precipitation at short-range time
scales. The proposed deep learning augmented NWP model can address these biases
and vastly improve the spatial pattern and magnitude of predicted
precipitation. Deep learning enhanced CFSv2 reduces mean bias by 8x over
important land regions for 1 day lead compared to CFSv2. The spatio-temporal
deep learning system opens pathways to further the precision and accuracy in
global short-range precipitation forecasts.

Indirect observations of the cosmic-ray electron (CRE) distribution
via synchrotron emission is crucial for deepening the understanding of the CRE
transport in the interstellar medium, and in investigating the role of galactic
outflows.
  Aims. In this paper, we quantify the contribution of diffusion- and
advection-dominated transport of CREs in the galaxy M51 considering relevant
energy loss processes.
  Methods. We used recent measurement from M 51 that allow for the derivation
of the diffusion coefficient, the star formation rate, and the magnetic field
strength. With this input, we solved the 3D transport equation numerically
including the spatial dependence as provided by the measurements, using the
open-source transport framework CRPropa (v3.1). We included 3D transport
(diffusion and advection), and the relevant loss processes.
  Results. We find that the data can be described well with the parameters from
recent measurements. For the best fit, it is required that the wind velocity,
following from the observed star formation rate, must be decreased by a factor
of 5. We find a model in which the inner galaxy is dominated by advective
escape and the outer galaxy is composed by both diffusion and advection.
  Conclusions. Three-dimensional modelling of cosmic-ray transport in the
face-on galaxy M51 allows for conclusions about the strength of the outflow of
such galaxies by quantifying the need for a wind in the description of the
cosmic-ray signatures. This opens up the possibility of investigating galactic
winds in face-on galaxies in general.

the Subaru telescope. With other T-types' spectra available in the literature

$L$-band continuum slopes similar to (1) Ceres and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,
and have an OH-absorption feature with band centres $<$2.8 $\mu$m. (96) Aegle
hints at a shallow N--H band near 3.1 $\mu$m and C--H band of organic materials
over 3.4--3.6 $\mu$m, whereas no diagnostic bands of water ice and other
volatiles exceeding the noise of the data were seen for both asteroids. The
large T-type asteroids but (596) Scheila display similar spectral shapes to our
targets. $\sim$50 \% of large T-types contain an absorption band near 0.6--0.65
$\mu$m likely associated with hydrated minerals. For T-type asteroids (except
Jupiter Trojans) of all sizes, we found a weak correlation: the smaller the
diameter and the closer the Sun, the redder the visible slope. The 2.9-$\mu$m
band depths of large T-types suggest that they might have experienced aqueous
alteration comparable to Ch-types but more intense than most of the main-belt
asteroids. The polarimetric phase curve of the T-types is well described by a
particular surface structure and their 0.5--4.0 $\mu$m reflectance spectra
appear most similar to CI chondrites with grain sizes of $\sim$25--35 $\mu$m.
Taken as a whole, we propose that large T-type asteroids might be dislodged
roughly around 10 au in the early solar system.

distinct stages of droplet evolution are identified, namely, the deformation
stage when the initially spherical droplet evolves into an irregular geometric
shape with complex structures, the breakup stage when many daughter droplets
are formed, and the restoration stage when the droplets relax towards spherical
shape. These three stages are analyzed systematically from several
perspectives: (1) a geometric perspective concerning the maximum equivalent
diameter, the total number of droplets, total interface area, and probability
distribution of droplet diameters, (2) a dynamic perspective concerning the
evolution of local velocity and vorticity at the fluid-fluid interface, (3) a
global perspective concerning the evolution of average kinetic energy /
dissipation rate and their Fourier spectra, (4) spherical harmonics based

substantially affected by subphotospheric energy dissipation, which is
typically caused by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs). We study the
observational characteristics of such emission, in particular the spectral
signatures. Invoking an internal collision framework to estimate relevant shock
initial conditions, we use an RMS model to generate synthetic photospheric
spectra. The spectra are then fitted with a standard cutoff power-law (CPL)
function to compare with corresponding GRB catalogues. We find mean values and
standard deviations for the low-energy index and the peak energy as
$\langle\alpha_{\rm cpl}\rangle = -0.76\pm 0.227$ and $\langle\log(E_{\rm
peak}/{\rm keV})\rangle = 2.42\pm 0.408$, respectively. The range of
$\alpha_{\rm cpl}$ values obtained cover a substantial fraction of the
catalogued values, $\langle\alpha_{\rm cpl}^{\rm cat}\rangle = -0.80 \pm
0.311$. This requires that the free fireball acceleration starts at $r_0 \sim
10^{10}~$cm, which is in agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. The CPL
function generally provides a good fit, even though the synthetic spectra
typically exhibit an additional break at lower energies. We also identify a
non-negligible parameter region for what we call ``optically shallow shocks'':
shocks that do not accumulate enough scatterings to reach a steady-state
spectrum before decoupling. These occur for optical depths $\tau \lesssim 55 \,
u_u^{-2}$, where $u_u = \gamma_u\beta_u\sim 2$ is the dimensionless specific
momentum of the upstream as measured in the shock rest frame. We conclude that
photospheric emission, which has passed through an RMS, is spectrally
consistent with the dominant fraction of observed bursts.

network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties as weak and strong ties
based on the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three
nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, there are strong ties between $A$ and $B$, as well as
$A$ and $C$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $B$ and $C$. So
far, most works discuss the STC in static networks. However, modern large-scale
social networks are usually highly dynamic, providing user contacts and
communications as streams of edge updates. Temporal networks capture these
dynamics. To apply the STC to temporal networks, we first generalize the STC
and introduce a weighted version such that empirical a priori knowledge given
in the form of edge weights is respected by the STC. The weighted STC is hard
to compute, and our main contribution is an efficient 2-approximative streaming
algorithm for the weighted STC in temporal networks. As a technical
contribution, we introduce a fully dynamic 2-approximation for the minimum
weight vertex cover problem, which is a crucial component of our streaming
algorithm. Our evaluation shows that the weighted STC leads to solutions that
capture the a priori knowledge given by the edge weights better than the

  Acoustic Unit Discovery",,,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is widely used for unsupervised topic
modelling on sets of documents. No temporal information is used in the model.
However, there is often a relationship between the corresponding topics of
consecutive tokens. In this paper, we present an extension to LDA that uses a
Markov chain to model temporal information. We use this new model for acoustic
unit discovery from speech. As input tokens, the model takes a discretised
encoding of speech from a vector quantised (VQ) neural network with 512 codes.
The goal is then to map these 512 VQ codes to 50 phone-like units (topics) in
order to more closely resemble true phones. In contrast to the base LDA, which
only considers how VQ codes co-occur within utterances (documents), the Markov
chain LDA additionally captures how consecutive codes follow one another. This
extension leads to an increase in cluster quality and phone segmentation
results compared to the base LDA. Compared to a recent vector quantised neural
network approach that also learns 50 units, the extended LDA model performs
better in phone segmentation but worse in mutual information.

system's environment, despite such knowledge being important for determining a
reactive control system's precise interaction with its environment. Therefore,
we propose an approach for reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable
environments. While assuming that the environment behaves like a partially
observable Markov decision process with known discrete actions, we assume no
knowledge about its structure or transition probabilities.
  Our approach combines Q-learning with IoAlergia, a method for learning Markov
decision processes (MDP). By learning MDP models of the environment from
episodes of the RL agent, we enable RL in partially observable domains without
explicit, additional memory to track previous interactions for dealing with
ambiguities stemming from partial observability. We instead provide RL with
additional observations in the form of abstract environment states by
simulating new experiences on learned environment models to track the explored
states. In our evaluation, we report on the validity of our approach and its
promising performance in comparison to six state-of-the-art deep RL techniques

localise Janus particles with a significant optical asymmetry from standard
wide-field microscopy images, bypassing the need for specialised equipment and

that ML algorithms will become increasingly prevalent by necessity in the study
of active matter systems, and encourage experimentalists to take advantage of
this powerful tool to address the various challenges within the field.

of electricity trading markets. Considering the growing concern of data
privacy, federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted to train STLF models
for utility companies (UCs) in recent research. Inspiringly, in wholesale
markets, as it is not realistic for power plants (PPs) to access UCs' data
directly, FL is definitely a feasible solution of obtaining an accurate STLF
model for PPs. However, due to FL's distributed nature and intense competition
among UCs, defects increasingly occur and lead to poor performance of the STLF
model, indicating that simply adopting FL is not enough. In this paper, we
propose a DRL-assisted FL approach, DEfect-AwaRe federated soft actor-critic
(DearFSAC), to robustly train an accurate STLF model for PPs to forecast
precise short-term utility electricity demand. Firstly. we design a STLF model
based on long short-term memory (LSTM) using just historical load data and time
data. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of defects occurrence, a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted to assist FL by alleviating
model degradation caused by defects. In addition, for faster convergence of FL
training, an auto-encoder is designed for both dimension reduction and quality
evaluation of uploaded models. In the simulations, we validate our approach on
real data of Helsinki's UCs in 2019. The results show that DearFSAC outperforms
all the other approaches no matter if defects occur or not.

technique to study the linguistic properties of hidden vector spaces, previous
works have shown that these pre-trained language models encode simple
linguistic properties in their hidden representations. However, none of the
previous work assessed whether these models encode the whole grammatical
structure of a programming language. In this paper, we prove the existence of a
syntactic subspace, lying in the hidden representations of pre-trained language
models, which contain the syntactic information of the programming language. We
show that this subspace can be extracted from the models' representations and
define a novel probing method, the AST-Probe, that enables recovering the whole
abstract syntax tree (AST) of an input code snippet. In our experimentations,
we show that this syntactic subspace exists in five state-of-the-art
pre-trained language models. In addition, we highlight that the middle layers
of the models are the ones that encode most of the AST information. Finally, we
estimate the optimal size of this syntactic subspace and show that its
dimension is substantially lower than those of the models' representation
spaces. This suggests that pre-trained language models use a small part of
their representation spaces to encode syntactic information of the programming

and a test data set. A proposed model is built based on the training data, and
then the performance of the model is assessed using test data. Usually, the
data is split randomly into a training and a test set on an ad hoc basis. This
approach, pivoted on random splitting, works well but more often than not, it
fails to gauge the generalizing capability of the model with respect to
perturbations in the input of training and test data. Experimentally, this
sensitive aspect of randomness in the input data is realized when a new
iteration of a fixed pipeline, from model building to training and testing, is
executed, and an overly optimistic performance estimate is reported. Since the
consistency in a model's performance predominantly depends on the data
splitting, any conclusions on the robustness of the model are unreliable in
such a scenario. We propose a diagnostic approach to quantitatively assess the
quality of a given split in terms of its true randomness, and provide a basis
for inferring model insensitivity towards the input data. We associate model
robustness with random splitting using a self-defined data-driven distance
metric based on the Mahalanobis squared distance between a train set and its
corresponding test set. The probability distribution of the distance metric is
simulated using Monte Carlo simulations, and a threshold is calculated from
one-sided hypothesis testing. We motivate and showcase the performance of the
proposed approach using various real data sets. We also compare the performance
of the existing data splitting methods using the proposed method.

non-linear dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have
been used for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimising
for the reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is
that a trained network will have difficulties to reconstruct anomalous parts
during the test phase. This is usually done by controlling the capacity of the
network by either reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or enforcing
sparsity constraints on its activations. However, neither of these techniques
does explicitly penalise reconstruction of anomalous signals often resulting in
a poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a self-supervised learning
regime which allows to use discriminative information during training while
regularising the model to focus on the data manifold by means of a modified
reconstruction error resulting in an accurate detection. Unlike related
approaches, the inference of the proposed method during training and prediction
is very efficient processing the whole input image in one single step. Our
experiments on the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset demonstrate high recognition
and localisation performance of the proposed method. On the texture-subset, in

paper, we argue that BERT-rankers are not immune to adversarial attacks
targeting retrieved documents given a query. Firstly, we propose algorithms for
adversarial perturbation of both highly relevant and non-relevant documents
using gradient-based optimization methods. The aim of our algorithms is to
add/replace a small number of tokens to a highly relevant or non-relevant
document to cause a large rank demotion or promotion. Our experiments show that
a small number of tokens can already result in a large change in the rank of a
document. Moreover, we find that BERT-rankers heavily rely on the document
start/head for relevance prediction, making the initial part of the document
more susceptible to adversarial attacks. More interestingly, we find a small
set of recurring adversarial words that when added to documents result in
successful rank demotion/promotion of any relevant/non-relevant document
respectively. Finally, our adversarial tokens also show particular topic
preferences within and across datasets, exposing potential biases from BERT
pre-training or downstream datasets.

  of Subsequence Probability",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Longest Common Subsequence Problem (LCS) deals with finding the longest
subsequence among a given set of strings. The LCS problem is an NP-hard problem
which makes it a target for lots of effort to find a better solution with
heuristics methods. The baseline for most famous heuristics functions is a
tabular random, probabilistic approach. This approach approximates the length
of the LCS in each iteration. The combination of beam search and tabular
probabilistic-based heuristics has led to a large number of proposals and
achievements in algorithms for solving the LCS problem. In this work, we
introduce a closed-form equation of the probabilistic table calculation for the
first time. Moreover, we present other corresponding forms of the closed-form
equation and prove all of them. The closed-form equation opens new ways for
analysis and further approximations. Using the theorems and beam search, we
propose an analytic method for estimating the length of the LCS of the
remaining subsequence. Furthermore, we present another heuristic function based
on the Coefficient of Variation. The results show that our proposed methods
outperform the state-of-the-art methods on the LCS problem.

considered to conduct lateral, longitudinal compression, and nail penetration
tests. The mechanical failure is characterized by the voltage drop and
temperature rise at the onset of the first short-circuit is identified by
Aurdino-based voltage sensor module and temperature measurement module. The
battery failure load and peak temperature at the onset of internal
short-circuit during different mechanical abuse conditions are found to rely on
the battery size strongly. The failure due to the onset of internal short

lateral compression, unlike longitudinal compression and nail penetration test.
At the onset of the short circuit, the LFPBs showed variation in temperature
above the ambient value of 28 degree C. Among the LFPBs considered, the lowest

replace an unbounded state space with a ""truncated"" bounded state space. When
such a replacement is made, one often wants to know whether the equilibrium
behavior of the truncated chain or process is close to that of the untruncated
system. For example, such questions arise naturally when considering numerical
methods for computing stationary distributions on unbounded state space. In
this paper, we use the principle of ""regeneration"" to show that the stationary
distributions of ""fixed state"" truncations converge in great generality (in
total variation norm) to the stationary distribution of the untruncated limit,
when the untruncated chain is positive Harris recurrent. Even in countable

which are newly defined corresponding to rank-3 tensor polarized hadron. The
collinear FFs are obtained from the $k_T$-integrated correlation matrix, and
only two TMD FFs with rank-3 tensor polarization have nonvanishing collinear

two structure functions are found nonzero and none of the rank-3 tensor

a shared model jointly without transmitting local raw data, has become a
prevalent recommendation paradigm with privacy-preserving advantages. However,
previous work on FRS performs similarity search via inner product in continuous
embedding space, which causes an efficiency bottleneck when the scale of items
is extremely large. We argue that such a scheme in federated settings ignores
the limited capacities in resource-constrained user devices (i.e., storage
space, computational overhead, and communication bandwidth), and makes it
harder to be deployed in large-scale recommender systems. Besides, it has been
shown that transmitting local gradients in real-valued form between server and
clients may leak users' private information. To this end, we propose a
lightweight federated recommendation framework with privacy-preserving matrix
factorization, LightFR, that is able to generate high-quality binary codes by
exploiting learning to hash technique under federated settings, and thus enjoys
both fast online inference and economic memory consumption. Moreover, we devise
an efficient federated discrete optimization algorithm to collaboratively train
model parameters between the server and clients, which can effectively prevent
real-valued gradient attacks from malicious parties. Through extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that our LightFR model
outperforms several state-of-the-art FRS methods in terms of recommendation
accuracy, inference efficiency and data privacy.

hence results in direct dipolar coupling between the qubits. In this work, we

the properties of efficient storage that mitigates the detrimental effects of
the dipolar coupling on the stored entanglement.

the order in which those variables appear as arguments of predicates.
  While the complexities of their satisfiability problems are now
well-established, their model theory, however, is poorly understood.
  Our paper aims to provide some insight into it.
  We start by providing suitable notions of bisimulation for ordered logics.
  We next employ bisimulations to compare the relative expressive power of
ordered logics, and to characterise our logics as bisimulation-invariant
fragments of FO a la van Benthem.
  Afterwards, we study the Craig Interpolation Property~(CIP).
  We refute yet another claim from the infamous work by Purdy, by showing that
the fluted and forward fragments do not enjoy CIP.
  We complement this result by showing that the ordered fragment and the
guarded ordered logics enjoy CIP.
  These positive results rely on novel and quite intricate model constructions,

because of limited training data and large intra- and inter-species variances.
Motivated by the progress of visual-language research, we propose that
pre-trained language models (e.g., CLIP) can facilitate animal pose estimation
by providing rich prior knowledge for describing animal keypoints in text.
However, we found that building effective connections between pre-trained
language models and visual animal keypoints is non-trivial since the gap
between text-based descriptions and keypoint-based visual features about animal
pose can be significant. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
prompt-based Contrastive learning scheme for connecting Language and AniMal
Pose (CLAMP) effectively. The CLAMP attempts to bridge the gap by adapting the
text prompts to the animal keypoints during network training. The adaptation is
decomposed into spatial-aware and feature-aware processes, and two novel
contrastive losses are devised correspondingly. In practice, the CLAMP enables
a new cross-modal animal pose estimation paradigm. Experimental results show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under the supervised,
few-shot, and zero-shot settings, outperforming image-based methods by a large

and theoretical interests to propose a physics-informed statistical approach
for modeling wildfire AOD propagation by simultaneously utilizing, or fusing,
multi-source heterogeneous satellite remote-sensing data streams. Leveraging a
spectral approach, the proposed approach integrates multi-source satellite data
streams with a fundamental advection-diffusion equation that governs the AOD
propagation process. A bias correction process is included in the statistical
model to account for the bias of the physics model and the truncation error of
the Fourier series. The proposed approach is applied to California wildfires
AOD data streams obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. Comprehensive numerical examples are provided to demonstrate
the predictive capabilities and model interpretability of the proposed
approach. Computer code has been made available on GitHub.

customers' frustration. Despite the recent advances in 3D virtual try-on
solutions, such approaches still remain limited to a very narrow - if not only
a handful - selection of articles, and often for only one size of those fashion
items. Other state-of-the-art approaches that aim to support customers find
what fits them online mostly require a high level of customer engagement and
privacy-sensitive data (such as height, weight, age, gender, belly shape,
etc.), or alternatively need images of customers' bodies in tight clothing.
They also often lack the ability to produce fit and shape aware visual guidance
at scale, coming up short by simply advising which size to order that would
best match a customer's physical body attributes, without providing any
information on how the garment may fit and look. Contributing towards taking a
leap forward and surpassing the limitations of current approaches, we present
FitGAN, a generative adversarial model that explicitly accounts for garments'
entangled size and fit characteristics of online fashion at scale. Conditioned
on the fit and shape of the articles, our model learns disentangled item
representations and generates realistic images reflecting the true fit and
shape properties of fashion articles. Through experiments on real world data at
scale, we demonstrate how our approach is capable of synthesizing visually
realistic and diverse fits of fashion items and explore its ability to control
fit and shape of images for thousands of online garments.

while being consistent with a range of experimental observations. However,
these models are either unable to effectively backpropagate error signals
across multiple layers or require a multi-phase learning process, neither of
which are reminiscent of learning in the brain. Here, we introduce a new model,
Bursting Cortico-Cortical Networks (BurstCCN), which solves these issues by
integrating known properties of cortical networks namely bursting activity,
short-term plasticity (STP) and dendrite-targeting interneurons. BurstCCN
relies on burst multiplexing via connection-type-specific STP to propagate
backprop-like error signals within deep cortical networks. These error signals
are encoded at distal dendrites and induce burst-dependent plasticity as a
result of excitatory-inhibitory top-down inputs. First, we demonstrate that our
model can effectively backpropagate errors through multiple layers using a
single-phase learning process. Next, we show both empirically and analytically
that learning in our model approximates backprop-derived gradients. Finally, we
demonstrate that our model is capable of learning complex image classification
tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Overall, our results suggest that cortical features
across sub-cellular, cellular, microcircuit and systems levels jointly underlie
single-phase efficient deep learning in the brain.

as none of the existing predictions can describe the data. We show in this
letter that the covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory, with constraints

the BESIII data. The predicted branching fraction and asymmetry parameter for

note that a more precise measurement of the asymmetry parameter, which is
related with that of $\Sigma^+\to p\gamma$, is crucial to test Hara's theorem.

each particle interacts weakly with many others, so that the total forces and

there, collisions are rare and make the self-propulsion direction to change

Gaussian and depend on the interactions among particles, but that only their
Gaussian part survives in the hydrodynamic limit. At variance with fluctuating
hydrodynamics for weakly interacting particles, we find that the noise variance
at hydrodynamic level depends on the interaction rules among particles and is
proportional to the square of the density, reflecting the binary nature of the

current trend of openness suggests that the principle of openness should be
followed not only by data but also research, education, software, standard,

levels, in different domains. This should ensure greater transparency,
eliminating inequalities, promoting, and achieving sustainable development
goals. Therefore, many agendas now have openness as a prerequisite. This

to their common objectives, providing some success stories of open data use in
smart cities or transformation of cities towards smart cities, mapping them to
the features of the Society 5.0. We believe that this trend develops a new form

the grand canonical ($\mu V T$) ensemble, which implies the presence of the
chemical equilibrium with the environment. However, in most experimental
scenarios, the total amount of particles in BEC is determined either by the
initial conditions or by the balance between dissipation and pumping. As a
result, BEC may possess the thermal equilibrium but almost never the chemical
equilibrium. In addition, many experimentally achievable BECs are non-ideal due
to interaction between particles. In the recent work
[10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.065301], it has been shown that invariant subspaces in
the system Hilbert space appear in non-equilibrium BEC in the fast
thermalization limit. In each of these subspaces, Gibbs distribution is
established with a certain number of particles that makes it possible to
investigate properties of non-ideal non-equilibrium BEC independently in each
invariant subspace. In this work, we analyze the BEC stability due to change in
dispersion curve caused by non-ideal interactions in BEC. Generally, non-ideal
interactions lead to the redshift or blueshift of the dispertion curve and to
the change in the effective mass of the particles. We show that the redshift of
the dispersion curve can lead to the negative compressibility of BEC, whereas
the change in the effective mass always makes BEC more stable. We find the
explicit condition for the particle density in BEC, at which the negative
compressibility appears.

The objectives of our MIPP task is to maximize the amount of information

Unfortunately, these objectives are at odds especially when exploring large

impose a probabilistic communication constraint that allows robots to meet
intermittently and resiliently share information, and then act to maximize
collected information during all other times. To solve our problem, we select
meeting locations with the highest probability of resilience and use a
sequential greedy algorithm to optimize paths for robots to explore. Finally,
we show the validity of our results by comparing the learning ability of
well-behaving robots applying resilient vs. non-resilient MIPP algorithms.

indeed the most efficient mechanism for energy release we currently know of,
with up to ~30-40% of the gravitational rest mass energy that can be converted
into radiation. The vast majority of this energy is released at high energy
(UV-X-rays) within the central $100$ gravitational radii from the central SMBH.
This energy release occurs through a variety of emission and absorption
mechanisms, spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The UV emission being
commonly explained by the presence of an optically thick accretion flow, while
the X-rays generally require a hotter, optically thinner, plasma, the so-called
X-ray corona. If outflows are present, they can also extract a significant part
of the gravitational power. With an origin in the deep potential well of the
SMBH, the study of the high-energy emission of AGN give a direct insight into

expansion history follows the predictions of the $Planck$ $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$

microwave background anisotropies. Redshift space distortion measurements also
appear to be consistent with $Planck$ $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. In this paper, we
argue that these observations can be reconciled with the $Planck$ $\Lambda{\rm

non-linear scales than assumed in analyses of weak galaxy lensing. We
demonstrate this point by fitting a one-parameter model, characterising a
suppression of the non-linear power spectrum, to the KiDS-1000 weak lensing
measurements. Such a suppression could be attributed to new properties of the
dark matter that affect non-linear scales, or to a response of the matter
fluctuations to baryonic feedback processes that are stronger than expected
from recent cosmological simulations. Our proposed explanation can be tested
using measurements of the amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum on
linear scales, in particular via high precision redshift space distortion
measurements from forthcoming galaxy and quasar redshift surveys.

To tackle this issue, we apply a stochastic variance reduced gradient
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SVRG-HMC) method to approximate the posterior
distribution. To utilize the computing resources of other fog access points
(F-APs) and to reduce the communications overhead, we propose a quantized
federated learning (FL) framework combining with Bayesian learning. The
quantized federated Bayesian learning framework allows each F-AP to send
gradients to the cloud server after quantizing and encoding. It can achieve a
tradeoff between prediction accuracy and communications overhead effectively.
Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed policy outperforms
the existing policies.

method based on domain decomposition to perform fast and accurate magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) simulations that include both remote and local

MRI setups into two domains and optimized electromagnetic (EM) modeling for
each case. Specifically, interactions between the body and EM waves originating
from local radiofrequency (RF) coils were modeled with the precorrected fast
Fourier transform, whereas the interactions with remote conductive surfaces (RF
shield, scanner bore) were modeled with a novel cross tensor train-based
algorithm. We compared the hybrid- VSIE with other VSIE methods for realistic
MRI simulation setups. Results: The hybrid-VSIE was the only practical method
for simulation using 1 mm voxel isotropic resolution (VIR). For 2 mm VIR, our
method could be solved at least 23 times faster and required 760 times lower

a marked improvement in terms of convergence times of the numerical EM

  To fill this gap, we have created an open-source benchmark for practical

antiplane shear. By introducing a rather simple processing step into the

of the LBM is maintained. Our findings underline the validity of the LBM as a

  Plans in Case of Supply Chain Disruptions",,,"10.3233/AIC-200646",,"cs.AI cs.MA math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Manufacturing companies typically use sophisticated production planning
systems optimizing production steps, often delivering near-optimal solutions.
As a downside for delivering a near-optimal schedule, planning systems have
high computational demands resulting in hours of computation. Under normal
circumstances this is not issue if there is enough buffer time before
implementation of the schedule (e.g. at night for the next day). However, in
case of unexpected disruptions such as delayed part deliveries or defectively
manufactured goods, the planned schedule may become invalid and swift
replanning becomes necessary. Such immediate replanning is unsuited for
existing optimal planners due to the computational requirements. This paper
proposes a novel solution that can effectively and efficiently perform
replanning in case of different types of disruptions using an existing plan.
The approach is based on the idea to adhere to the existing schedule as much as
possible, adapting it based on limited local changes. For that purpose an
agent-based scheduling mechanism has been devised, in which agents represent
materials and production sites and use local optimization techniques and
negotiations to generate an adapted (sufficient, but non-optimal) schedule. The
approach has been evaluated using real production data from Huawei, showing
that efficient schedules are produced in short time. The system has been
implemented as proof of concept and is currently reimplemented and transferred
to a production system based on the Jadex agent platform.

(SR-DEM) to simulate systems of particles with closed surfaces of revolution.
Due to the cylindrical symmetry of a surface of revolution, the geometry of any
cross-section about the axis of rotation remains the same. Taking advantage of
this geometric feature, a node-to-cross-section contact algorithm is proposed
for efficient contact detection between particles with a surface of revolution.
In our SR-DEM framework, the contact algorithm is realized in a master-slave
fashion: the master particle is approximated by its surface nodes, while the
slave particle is represented by a signed distance field (SDF) of the
cross-section about the axis of rotation. This hybrid formulation in both 2D
and 3D space allows a very efficient contact calculation yet relatively simple
code implementation. We then apply SR-DEM to simulate particle-particle,
particle-wall impact, granular packing in a cylindrical container, and tablets
in a rotating drum, to demonstrate SR-DEM's ability to predict the post-impact
velocities, packing porosity, and dynamic angle of repose, respectively.
Finally, we suggest a simple approach to find an optimal surface resolution, by
increasing the number of surface nodes until some of the bulk properties that
could characterize the system converge.

human-centric metric. The finding means that keeping increasing model sizes in
the patent domain might be unnecessary if the purpose is to assist human
writing with autocompletion. Several patent language models are pre-trained
from scratch in this research. The pre-trained models are released for future
researchers. Several visualization tools are also provided. The importance of
building a generative language model in the patent domain is the potential to
facilitate creativity and innovations in the future.

scientific discoveries. At the heart of its daily operations are the editorial
boards. Despite their activities and recruitment often being opaque to outside
observers, they play a crucial role in promoting fair evaluations and gender
parity. Literature on gender inequality lacks the connection between women as
editors and as research-active scientists, thereby missing the comparison
between the gender balances in these two academic roles. Literature on
editorial fairness similarly lacks longitudinal studies on the conflicts of
interest arising from editors being research active, which motivates them to
expedite the publication of their papers. We fill these gaps using a dataset of
103,000 editors, 240 million authors, and 220 million publications spanning
five decades and 15 disciplines. This unique dataset allows us to compare the
proportion of female editors to that of female scientists in any given year or
discipline. Although women are already underrepresented in science (26%), they
are even more so among editors (14%) and editors-in-chief (8%); the lack of
women with long-enough publishing careers explains the gender gap among
editors, but not editors-in-chief, suggesting that other factors may be at
play. Our dataset also allows us to study the self-publication patterns of
editors, revealing that 8% of them double the rate at which they publish in
their own journal soon after the editorship starts, and this behavior is
accentuated in journals where the editors-in-chief self-publish excessively.
Finally, men are more likely to engage in this behaviour than women.

overfitting is an issue in training neural networks. To avoid overfitting, one
common approach is to penalize the parameters especially the weights in neural

applications, the theoretical foundation of penalized neural networks has not
been well-established. Our goal of this paper is to propose the general
framework of neural networks with regularization and prove its consistency.
Under certain conditions, the estimated neural network will converge to true
underlying function as the sample size increases. The method of sieves and the
theory on minimal neural networks are used to overcome the issue of
unidentifiability for the parameters. Two types of activation functions:
hyperbolic tangent function(Tanh) and rectified linear unit(ReLU) have been
taken into consideration. Simulations have been conducted to verify the

X-ray energy can be discriminated by detecting the emission spectra of each

by color or multispectral visible-light camera in one single shot of X-ray. To
verify this idea, stacked multilayer scintillators based on several emerging
metal halides were fabricated in the cost-effective and scalable solution
process, and proof-of-concept multi-energy FPXI were experimentally
demonstrated. The dual-energy X-ray image of a bone-muscle model clearly showed
the details that were invisible in conventional energy-integration FPXI. By
stacking four layers of specifically designed multilayer scintillators with
appropriate thicknesses, a prototype FPXI with four energy channels was
realized, proving its extendibility to multispectral or even hyperspectral

with homogeneous shear. A Lagrangian stochastic model for the rods angular
dynamics is introduced and compared to the results of direct numerical
simulations. The model consists in superposing a short-correlated random
component to the steady large-scale mean shear, and can thereby be integrated
analytically. To reproduce the single-time orientation statistics obtained
numerically, it is found that one has to properly account for the combined
effect of the mean shear, for anisotropic velocity gradient fluctuations, and
for the presence of persistent rotating structures in the flow that bias
Lagrangian statistics. The model is then used to address two-time statistics.
The notion of tumbling rate is extended to diffusive dynamics by introducing
the stationary probability flux of the rods unfolded angle. The model is found
to reproduce the long-term effects of an average shear on the mean and the
variance of the fibres angular increment. Still, it does not reproduce an
intricate behaviour observed in numerics for intermediate times: the unfolded
angle is there very similar to a L\'evy walk with distributions of increments
displaying intermediate power-law tails.

the EPSP/IPSP cancellation between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and
propose a Machine Learning that does not belong to any conventional method. The
feature is to consider one neuron and give it a multivariable Xj (j = 1, 2,.)
and its function value F(Xj) as data to the input layer. The multivariable
input layer and processing neuron are linked by two lines to each variable
node. One line is called an EPSP edge, and the other is called an IPSP edge,
and a parameter {\Delta}j common to each edge is introduced. The processing
neuron is divided back and forth into two parts, and at the front side, a pulse
having a width 2{\Delta}j and a height 1 is defined around an input X . The
latter half of the processing neuron defines a pulse having a width 2{\Delta}j
centered on the input Xj and a height F(Xj) based on a value obtained from the
input layer of F(Xj). This information is defined as belonging to group i. In
other words, the group i has a width of 2{\Delta}j centered on the input Xj, is
defined in a region of height F(Xj), and all outputs of xi within the variable
range are F(Xi). This group is learned and stored by a few minutes of the
Teaching signals, and the output of the TEST signals is predicted by which
group the TEST signals belongs to. The parameter {\Delta}j is optimized so that
the accuracy of the prediction is maximized. The proposed method was applied to
the flower species classification problem of Iris, the rank classification
problem of used cars, and the ring classification problem of abalone, and the
calculation was compared with the neural networks.

\dots ,n-1\} \times \{0,1, \dots ,n-1\} \times \cdots \times \{0,1, \dots
,n-1\}$. In this paper we consider the general, NP-complete, Line-Cover
problem, where the edges are not required to be axis-parallel, showing that the
original Theorem 1 by Kranakis et al. does not hold anymore when the
aforementioned constraint is disregarded. Furthermore, for any given $n$ above
two, as $k$ approaches infinity, the link-length of any minimal
(non-rectilinear) polygonal chain does not exceed Kranakis' conjectured value
of $\frac{k}{k-1} \cdot n^{k-1}+O(n^{k-2})$ only if we introduce a
multiplicative constant $c \geq 1.5$ for the lower order terms (e.g., if we
select $n=3$ and assume that $c<1.5$, starting from a sufficiently large $k$,
it is not possible to visit all the nodes of $P(n,k)$ with a trail of
link-length $\frac{k}{k-1} \cdot n^{k-1}+c \cdot n^{k-2})$.

gathered during their use of information systems. This extends to both the data
they actively provide in exchange for services as well as the metadata
passively generated in many aspects of their computing experiences. However,
new technologies are at a great risk of being inadequate to protect a user's
privacy if researchers focus primarily on the use cases of these technologies
without giving sufficient consideration to incorporating privacy at a
fundamental level. Edge computing has been introduced as a promising networking
paradigm for processing the incredible magnitude of data produced by modern IoT
networks. As edge computing is still considered a relatively new technology,
the edge computing community has a responsibility to ensure privacy protection
is interwoven into its implementations at a foundational level. In this paper,
I first introduce the concepts of user privacy and edge computing; I then
provide a state-of-the-art overview of current literature as it relates to
privacy preservation in honest-but-curious edge computing. Finally, I provide
future research recommendations in the hope that the edge computing research
and development community will be inspired to ensure strong privacy protections
in their current and future work.

  urban scale","24 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The assessment of seismic risk in urban areas with high seismicity is
certainly one of the most important problems that territorial managers have to
face. A reliable evaluation of this risk is the basis for the design of both
specific seismic improvement interventions and emergency management plans.
Unappropriate seismic risk assessments may provide misleading results and
induce bad decisions with relevant economic and social impact. The seismic risk
in urban areas is mainly linked to three factors, namely, ""hazard"", ""exposure""
and ""vulnerability"". Hazard measures the potential of an earthquake to produce
harm; exposure evaluates the amount of population exposed to harm;
vulnerability represents the proneness of considered buildings to suffer
damages in case of an earthquake. Estimates of such factors may not always
coincide with the perceived risk of the resident population. The propensity to
implement structural seismic improvement interventions aimed at reducing the
vulnerability of buildings depends significantly on the perceived risk. This
paper investigates on the difference between objective and perceived risk and
highlights some critical issues. The aim of this study is to calibrate
opportune policies, which allow addressing the most appropriate seismic risk
mitigation options with reference to current levels of perceived risk. We
propose the introduction of a Seismic Policy Prevention index (SPPi). This
methodology is applied to a case-study focused on a densely populated district
of the city of Catania (Italy).

entirely satisfactory. Our approach considers first and second order,

of objects; these effects, extremely small, are estimated through examples.

  Semantic Technology Reasoning","5 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.OH cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circuit diagrams have been used in electrical engineering for decades to
describe the wiring of devices and facilities. They depict electrical
components in a symbolic and graph-based manner. While the circuit design is
usually performed electronically, there are still legacy paper-based diagrams
that require digitization in order to be used in CAE systems. Generally,
knowledge on specific circuits may be lost between engineering projects, making
it hard for domain novices to understand a given circuit design. The
graph-based nature of these documents can be exploited by semantic
technology-based reasoning in order to generate human-understandable
descriptions of their functional principles. More precisely, each electrical
component (e.g. a diode) of a circuit may be assigned a high-level function
label which describes its purpose within the device (e.g. flyback diode for
reverse voltage protection). In this paper, forward chaining rules are used for
such a generation. The described approach is applicable for both CAE-based
circuits as well as raw circuits yielded by an image understanding pipeline.
The viability of the approach is demonstrated by application to an existing set
of circuits.
