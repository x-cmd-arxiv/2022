of relativistic mean field model with Thomas-Fermi approximation. Typical pasta
structures (droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble) are obtained, which form
various crystalline configurations. The properties of those nuclear pastas are
examined in a three-dimensional geometry with reflection symmetry, where the
optimum lattice constants are fixed by reproducing the droplet/bubble density
that minimizes the free energy adopting spherical or cylindrical approximations
for Wigner-Seitz cells. It is found that different crystalline structures can
evolve into each other via volume conserving deformations. For fixed densities
and temperatures, the differences of the free energies per baryon of nuclear
pasta in various shapes and lattice structures are typically on the order of
tens of keV, suggesting the possible coexistence of those structures. As
temperature increases, the thermodynamic fluctuations are expected to disrupt
the long-range ordering in nuclear pasta structures. We then estimate the
critical conditions for nuclear pasta to become disordered and behave like
liquid, which are found to be sensitive to the densities, temperatures, proton
fractions, and nuclear shapes. If we further increase temperature, eventually
the nonuniform structures of nuclear pasta become unstable and are converted
into uniform nuclear matter. The phase diagrams of nuclear matter are then
estimated, which should be useful for understanding the evolutions of neutron
stars, supernova dynamics, and binary neutron star mergers.

wavepackets localized in the vicinity of the zero level set $\Gamma$ of a
domain wall. The main applications we consider are a topologically non-trivial
Dirac model and a similar but topologically trivial Klein-Gordon equation. The
static domain wall models an interface separating two insulating media in
possibly different topological phases. We propose a semiclassical oscillatory
representation of the wavepackets and provide an estimate of their accuracy in
appropriate energy norms. We describe the propagation of relativistic modes
along $\Gamma$ and analyze dispersive modes by a stationary phase method. In
the absence of turning points, we show that arbitrary localized and smooth
initial conditions may be represented as a superposition of such wavepackets.
In the presence of turning points, the results apply only for sufficiently

molecules, neutral and ionised metals, and hydrogen in the transmission
spectrum of ultra-hot Jupiters, and have started to probe the dynamics of their
atmospheres. We analyse the transmission spectrum of MASCARA-1b, one of the
densest ultra-hot Jupiters orbiting a bright (V=8.3) star. We focus on the CaII
H&K, NaI, LiI, H$\alpha$, and KI D1 spectral lines and on the cross-correlated
FeI, FeII, CaI, YI, VI, VII, CaH, and TiO lines. For those species that are not
present in the stellar spectrum, no detections are reported, but we measure
upper limits with an excellent precision ($\sim10$ ppm for particular species).
For those species that are present in the stellar spectrum and whose
planet-occulted spectral lines induce spurious features in the planetary
transmission spectrum, an accurate modelling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
(RM) and centre-to-limb variations (CLV) is necessary to recover possible
atmospheric signals. In the case of MASCARA-1b, this is difficult due to the
overlap between the radial velocities of the stellar surface regions occulted
by MASCARA-1b and the orbital track along which the planet atmospheric signal
is expected to be found. To try to disentangle a possible planetary signal, we
compare our results with models of the RM and CLV effects, and estimate the
uncertainties of our models depending on the different system parameters.
Unfortunately, more precise measurements of the spin-orbit angle are necessary
to better constrain the planet-occulted track and correct for the transit
effects in the transmission spectrum with enough precision to be able to detect
or discard possible planetary absorptions. Finally, we discuss the possibility
that non-detections are related to the low absorption expected for a high
surface gravity planet such as MASCARA-1b.

are successful techniques for SNN training. Nevertheless, the spike-base BP
training is slow and requires large memory costs. Though ANN2NN provides a
low-cost way to train SNNs, it requires many inference steps to mimic the
well-trained ANN for good performance. In this paper, we propose a SNN-to-ANN
(SNN2ANN) framework to train the SNN in a fast and memory-efficient way. The
SNN2ANN consists of 2 components: a) a weight sharing architecture between ANN
and SNN and b) spiking mapping units. Firstly, the architecture trains the
weight-sharing parameters on the ANN branch, resulting in fast training and low
memory costs for SNN. Secondly, the spiking mapping units ensure that the
activation values of the ANN are the spiking features. As a result, the
classification error of the SNN can be optimized by training the ANN branch.
Besides, we design an adaptive threshold adjustment (ATA) algorithm to address
the noisy spike problem. Experiment results show that our SNN2ANN-based models
perform well on the benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet).
Moreover, the SNN2ANN can achieve comparable accuracy under 0.625x time steps,
0.377x training time, 0.27x GPU memory costs, and 0.33x spike activities of the

across the wormhole throat leads to the formation of an additional structure of
ring images with distinct polarization properties. The twist of the
polarization vector around the ring is less pronounced, thus modifying the
polarization pattern, and the polarization intensity can increase with an order
of magnitude compared to the radiation from our universe. Thus, while it could
be difficult to distinguish wormhole spacetimes by their direct polarized
images, the strongly lensed images and the polarization of the radiation
through the wormhole throat provide characteristic signatures which can serve
as probes for horizonless objects.

theoretical and practical impacts on the field of adversarial learning. In the

perturbation to different inputs results in noticeably unnatural inputs.
Therefore, we introduce a new universal adversarial setup - a universal
adversarial policy, which has many advantages of other universal attacks but
also results in valid texts - thus making it relevant in practice. We achieve
this by learning a single search policy over a predefined set of semantics
preserving text alterations, on many texts. This formulation is universal in
that the policy is successful in finding adversarial examples on new texts
efficiently. Our approach uses text perturbations which were extensively shown
to produce natural attacks in the non-universal setup (specific synonym
replacements). We suggest a strong baseline approach for this formulation which
uses reinforcement learning. It's ability to generalise (from as few as 500
training texts) shows that universal adversarial patterns exist in the text

bell-shape Perey-Buck spatial nonlocality in the optical model potential for

nonlocality considering fully nonlocal optical potentials in momentum space.
The framework is based on a momentum-space in-medium folding model, where
infinite nuclear matter $g$ matrices in Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation
are folded to the target one-body mixed density. The study is based on chiral
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) as well as Argonne $v_{18}$

The resulting nonlocaliy form factor features a bell-shape with nonlocality
range $\beta$ between 0.86 and 0.89 fm, for both proton and neutron beams at

  Our result: the complexity of deciding for a given configuration which of the

reduction from a Boolean formula game of T.J. Schaefer, known to be

  We embed the non-planar Schaefer game within the planar Tumbleweed board

it is said to be a total dominating identifying code of $G$, and the smallest

  Extending similar characterizations for identifying codes from the

$\gamma_t^{\text{ID}}(G)=n-1$ (such graphs either satisfy

  Recent Findings. Through this review, we identify a dearth of work that
holistically tackles the problem of co-design and co-optimization of robots and
the networks they employ. We also highlight the role that data-driven and
machine learning approaches play in evolving communication pipelines for
multi-robot systems. In particular, we refer to recent work that diverges from

this context.
  Summary. We present a critical view of the way robotic algorithms and their

This way, motion blur registers temporally continuous information on the scene

more complex motion reconstruction in the VFI task, as well as HDR frame
reconstruction that so far has been considered only for the originally captured

$O(1/T^{1/4})$ best-iterate, and $O(1/T^{3/4})$ average-iterate convergence

convergence rate, for finding the NE of perturbed EFGs, which is useful for
finding approximate extensive-form perfect equilibria (EFPE). To the best of
our knowledge, they constitute the first last-iterate convergence results for
CFR-type algorithms, while matching the state-of-the-art average-iterate
convergence rate in finding NE for non-perturbed EFGs. We also provide

bounding box regression. In this paper, we present Unbiased Teacher v2, which
shows the generalization of SS-OD method to anchor-free detectors and also
introduces Listen2Student mechanism for the unsupervised regression loss.
Specifically, we first present a study examining the effectiveness of existing

that box selection with centerness and the localization-based labeling used in
anchor-free detectors cannot work well under the semi-supervised setting. On

multi-step imaging pipeline for analysis of interferometric data. DoG-HiT
applies the compressed sensing approach to imaging by employing a flexible DoG
wavelet dictionary which is designed to adapt smoothly to the uv-coverage. It
uses closure properties as data fidelity terms only initially and perform
non-convex, non-smooth optimization by an amplitude conserving and total flux
conserving hard thresholding splitting. DoG-HiT calculates a multiresolution
support as a side product. The final reconstruction is refined through
self-calibration loops and imaging with amplitude and phase information applied
for the multiresolution support only. We demonstrate the stability of DoG-HiT
and benchmark its performance against image reconstructions made with CLEAN and
Regularized Maximum-Likelihood (RML) methods using synthetic data. The
comparison shows that DoG-HiT matches the superresolution achieved by the RML
reconstructions and surpasses the sensitivity to extended emission reached by
CLEAN. Application of regularized maximum likelihood methods outfitted with

due to the presence of effective long-ranged forces. When the particles are
polar with a well-defined symmetry axis and non-uniform density, recent
theoretical predictions suggest that prolate objects will repel and oblate ones
will weakly attract. We tested these predictions using mass polar proalte
spheroids, which are composed of 2 mm spheres glued together. We probed
different aspect rations ($\kappa$) and center of mass offsets ($\chi$) by
combining spheres of different densities. Experiments were done in both
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) and three=dimensional (3D) chambers. By optically
tracking the motion of single particles, we found that the dynamics were
well-described by a reduced mobility matrix model that could be solved
analytically. Pairs of particles exhibited an effective repulsion, and their
separation roughly scaled as ~$(\kappa-1)/\chi^{0.39}$, i.e. particles that
were more prolate or had smaller mass asymmetry had stronger repulsion effects.
In 3D, particles with $\chi>0$ were distributed more uniformly than $\chi=0$
particles, and the degree of uniformity increased with $\kappa$, indicating
that the effective 2-body repulsion manifests for a large number of particles.

Log-GPIS inference, the proposed incremental odometry technique computes the

Concurrently, an optimisation-based planner computes a safe collision-free path

integrable due to the presence of a fourth constant of motion like the Carter

give a chance to the existence of radial effective potentials with stable
circular orbits in two-dimensional planes, such as the equatorial plane and
other nonequatorial planes. They also give a possibility of the presence of
radial effective potentials with stable spherical orbits in the
three-dimensional space. The dynamical parameters play important roles in
changing the graphs of the effective potentials. In addition, variations of
these parameters affect the presence or absence of stable circular orbits,
innermost stable circular orbits, stable spherical orbits and marginally stable
spherical orbits. They also affect the radii of the stable circular or
spherical orbits. It is numerically shown that the stable circular orbits and
innermost stable circular orbits can exist not only in the equatorial plane but
also in the nonequatorial planes. Several stable spherical orbits and
marginally stable spherical orbits are numerically confirmed, too. In

  Network",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The *shuffle model* is a powerful tool to amplify the privacy guarantees of
the *local model* of differential privacy. In contrast to the fully
decentralized manner of guaranteeing privacy in the local model, the shuffle
model requires a central, trusted shuffler. To avoid this central shuffler,
recent work of Liew et al. (2022) proposes shuffling locally randomized data in
a decentralized manner, via random walks on the communication network
constituted by the clients. The privacy amplification bound it thus provides
depends on the topology of the underlying communication network, even for
infinitely long random walks. It does not match the state-of-the-art privacy
amplification bound for the shuffle model (Feldman et al., 2021).
  In this work, we prove that the output of~$n$ clients' data, each perturbed
by an ${\epsilon}_0$-local randomizer, and shuffled by random walks with a
logarithmic number of steps, is $( {O} ( (1 - e^{-\epsilon_0} ) \sqrt{ (
e^{\epsilon_0} / n ) \ln (1 / \delta ) } ), O(\delta) )$-differentially
private. Importantly, this bound is independent of the topology of the
communication network, and asymptotically closes the gap between the privacy
amplification bounds for the network shuffle model (Liew et al., 2022) and the
shuffle model (Feldman et al., 2021). Our proof is based on a reduction to the
shuffle model, and an analysis of the distribution of random walks of finite
length. Building on this, we further show that if each client is sampled
independently with probability~$p$, the privacy guarantee of the network
shuffle model can be further improved to $( {O} ( (1 - e^{-\epsilon_0} )
\sqrt{p ( e^{\epsilon_0} / n ) \ln (1 / \delta ) } ) , O(\delta) )$.
Importantly, the subsampling is also performed in a fully decentralized manner
that does not require a trusted central entity; compared with related bounds in
prior work, our bound is stronger.

planning an ecological study, yet there are currently no well-established
procedures for when multivariate abundances are to be collected. A power
analysis procedure would need to address three challenges: designing a
parsimonious simulation model that captures key community data properties;
measuring effect size in a realistic yet interpretable fashion; and ensuring
computational feasibility when simulation is used both for power estimation and
significance testing. 2. Here we propose a power analysis procedure that
addresses these three challenges by: using for simulation a Gaussian copula
model with factor analytical structure, fitted to pilot data; assuming a common
effect size across all taxa, but applied in different directions according to
expert opinion (to ""increaser"", ""decreaser"" or ""no effect"" taxa); using a
critical value approach to estimate power, which reduces computation time by a
factor of 500 with little loss of accuracy. 3. The procedure is demonstrated on
pilot data from fish assemblages in a restoration study, where it was found
that the planned study design would only be capable of detecting relatively
large effects (change in abundance by a factor of 1.5 or more). 4. The methods
outlined in this paper are available in accompanying R software (the ecopower
package), which allows researchers with pilot data to answer a wide range of

federated learning (FL) is to reduce the number of communication rounds,
particularly since doing so reduces performance in heterogeneous data settings.
To tackle both issues, we take a Bayesian perspective on the problem of
learning a global model. We show how the global predictive posterior can be
approximated using client predictive posteriors. This is unlike other works
which aggregate the local model space posteriors into the global model space
posterior, and are susceptible to high approximation errors due to the
posterior's high dimensional multimodal nature. In contrast, our method
performs the aggregation on the predictive posteriors, which are typically
easier to approximate owing to the low-dimensionality of the output space. We
present an algorithm based on this idea, which performs MCMC sampling at each
client to obtain an estimate of the local posterior, and then aggregates these
in one round to obtain a global ensemble model. Through empirical evaluation on
several classification and regression tasks, we show that despite using one
round of communication, the method is competitive with other FL techniques, and
outperforms them on heterogeneous settings. The code is publicly available at

proposing adversarial disentanglement of depression characteristics and speaker
identity. The model used for depression classification is trained in a
speaker-identity-invariant manner by minimizing depression prediction loss and
maximizing speaker prediction loss during training. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated on two datasets - DAIC-WOZ (English) and
CONVERGE (Mandarin), with three feature sets (Mel-spectrograms, raw-audio
signals, and the last-hidden-state of Wav2vec2.0), using a modified DepAudioNet
model. With adversarial training, depression classification improves for every
feature when compared to the baseline. Wav2vec2.0 features with adversarial
learning resulted in the best performance (F1-score of 69.2% for DAIC-WOZ and
91.5% for CONVERGE). Analysis of the class-separability measure (J-ratio) of
the hidden states of the DepAudioNet model shows that when adversarial learning
is applied, the backend model loses some speaker-discriminability while it
improves depression-discriminability. These results indicate that there are
some components of speaker identity that may not be useful for depression
detection and minimizing their effects provides a more accurate diagnosis of
the underlying disorder and can safeguard a speaker's identity.

in dispersive, nonlinear optical resonators. They have been extensively studied
in the context of resonators with purely cubic (Kerr-type) nonlinearity that
are externally-driven with a monochromatic continuous wave laser -- in such
systems, the solitons manifest themselves as unique attractors whose carrier
frequency coincides with that of the external driving field. Recent experiments
have, however, shown that a qualitatively different type of temporal CS can
arise via parametric down-conversion in resonators with simultaneous quadratic
and cubic nonlinearity. In contrast to conventional CSs in pure-Kerr
resonators, these \emph{parametrically-driven cavity solitons} come in two
different flavours with opposite phases, and they are spectrally centred at
half of the frequency of the driving field. Here, we theoretically and
numerically show that, under conditions of bichromatic driving, such
parametrically-driven CSs can also arise in dispersive resonators with pure
Kerr nonlinearity. In this case, the solitons arise through parametric
four-wave mixing, come with two distinct phases, and have a carrier frequency
in between the two external driving fields. We show that, when all waves are
resonant, the solitons can experience long-range interactions due to their
back-action on the intracavity fields at the pump frequencies, and we discuss
the parameter requirements for the solitons' existence. Besides underlining the
possibility of exciting a new type of cavity soliton in dispersive Kerr
cavities, our work advances the theoretical modeling of resonators that are
coherently-driven with polychromatic fields.

intervals to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the action along with
intertemporal information. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method

galaxy clusters detected by the Subaru HSC survey in the eROSITA eFEDS field.
Through a joint analysis of SRG/eROSITA and Subaru/HSC surveys, we aim to study
the dynamical status of the optically selected clusters and derive the cluster
scaling relations. The sample consists of 43 optically selected galaxy clusters
with a richness $>40$ in $0.16<z<0.89$. We systematically analyzed the X-ray
images and spectra using the eROSITA data. We identified the BCG using the
optical and far-infrared databases. We evaluated the cluster's dynamical status
by measuring the offset between the X-ray peak and BCG position, the gas
concentration, and the number of galaxy-density peaks. We studied the
luminosity-temperature and mass-luminosity relations based on eROSITA X-ray
spectra and HSC weak-lensing data analyses. Based on the these measurements,
the fraction of relaxed clusters is $2(<39)$%, which is smaller than that of
the X-ray-selected cluster samples. After correcting for a selection bias due
to the richness cut, we obtained a shallow $L-T$ slope of $2.1\pm0.5$, which is
consistent with the predictions of the self-similar model and the baseline
model incorporating a mass-concentration relation. The $L-M$ slope of
$1.5\pm0.3$ agrees with the above theoretical models and that of the
shear-selected clusters in the eFEDs field. Our analysis of high-richness
optical clusters yields a small fraction of relaxed clusters and a shallow
slope for the luminosity-temperature relation. This suggests that the average
X-ray properties of the optical clusters are likely to be different from those
observed in the X-ray samples. Thus, the joint eROSITA and HSC observations are
a powerful tool in extending the analysis to a larger sample and understanding
the selection effect with a view to establish cluster scaling relations.

been proposed. However, they require many training data for each target task.
We propose a simple yet effective meta-learning method to detect OoD with small
in-distribution data in a target task. With the proposed method, the OoD
detection is performed by density estimation in a latent space. A neural
network shared among all tasks is used to flexibly map instances in the
original space to the latent space. The neural network is meta-learned such
that the expected OoD detection performance is improved by using various tasks
that are different from the target tasks. This meta-learning procedure enables
us to obtain appropriate representations in the latent space for OoD detection.
For density estimation, we use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with full
covariance for each class. We can adapt the GMM parameters to in-distribution
data in each task in a closed form by maximizing the likelihood. Since the
closed form solution is differentiable, we can meta-learn the neural network
efficiently with a stochastic gradient descent method by incorporating the
solution into the meta-learning objective function. In experiments using six

energy propagates relatively slowly to the magnetosphere which is at odds with
the observed rise time of the radiative event of $\lesssim 10$ ms. Nor can the
flare energy be deposited entirely outside the star, as most of the energy
reflects off the stellar surface, giving surface oscillations of insufficient
magnitude to produce detectable modulations of magnetospheric currents. Energy
deposition in a volume that straddles the stellar surface gives agreement with
the observed rise time and excites a range of modes with substantial amplitude
at observed QPO frequencies. In general, localized energy deposition excites a
broad range of modes that encompasses the observed QPOs, though many more modes
are excited than the number of observed QPOs. If the flare energy is deposited
axisymmetrically, as is possible for a certain class of MHD instabilities, the

on the line profiles is also investigated. Methods. Our previous nl-model for
calculating level populations of hydrogen atoms and hydrogen recombination
lines is improved. The effects of line and continuum radiation fields on the
level populations are considered in the improved model. By using this method
the properties of simulated hydrogen recombination lines and level populations
are used in analyses. Results. The simulations show that hydrogen radio
recombination lines are often emitted from the energy level with an inverted
population. The widths of Hn$\alpha$ lines can be significantly narrowed by
strong stimulated emissions to be even less than 10 km s$^{-1}$. The
amplification of hydrogen recombination lines is more affected by the line
optical depth than by the total optical depth. The influence of stimulated
emission on the estimates of electron temperature and density of ionized gas is
evaluated. We find that comparing multiple line-to-continuum ratios is a
reliable method for estimating the electron temperature, while the
effectiveness of the estimation of electron density is determined by the

the IB hard to satisfy both requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we

significant progress, reasoning about 3D human-scene contact from a single

types of predefined contact, often reduce body and scene to a small number of
primitives, and even overlook image evidence. To predict human-scene contact
from a single image, we address the limitations above from both data and
algorithmic perspectives. We capture a new dataset called RICH for ""Real
scenes, Interaction, Contact and Humans."" RICH contains multiview
outdoor/indoor video sequences at 4K resolution, ground-truth 3D human bodies
captured using markerless motion capture, 3D body scans, and high resolution 3D
scene scans. A key feature of RICH is that it also contains accurate
vertex-level contact labels on the body. Using RICH, we train a network that
predicts dense body-scene contacts from a single RGB image. Our key insight is
that regions in contact are always occluded so the network needs the ability to
explore the whole image for evidence. We use a transformer to learn such
non-local relationships and propose a new Body-Scene contact TRansfOrmer
(BSTRO). Very few methods explore 3D contact; those that do focus on the feet
only, detect foot contact as a post-processing step, or infer contact from body
pose without looking at the scene. To our knowledge, BSTRO is the first method

introducing the binormal parts is that it allows room for a physical ansatz for
describing the whole evolution of the thermodynamic system. Taking advantage of
this platform, we propose a proper ansatz that deals with the binormal
contributions starting from the physical properties of thermal equilibrium
systems. We also consider the stability of a thermodynamic system in a flat
background. We find that $\textit{new}$ ""Klein"" modes exist in addition to the

performing speech segregation. Despite their wide-scope of real-world
applications, little is known about the mechanisms they employ to group and
consequently segregate individual speakers. Knowing that harmonicity is a
critical cue for these networks to group sources, in this work, we perform a
thorough investigation on ConvTasnet and DPT-Net to analyze how they perform a
harmonic analysis of the input mixture. We perform ablation studies where we
apply low-pass, high-pass, and band-stop filters of varying pass-bands to
empirically analyze the harmonics most critical for segregation. We also
investigate how these networks decide which output channel to assign to an
estimated source by introducing discontinuities in synthetic mixtures. We find
that end-to-end networks are highly unstable, and perform poorly when
confronted with deformations which are imperceptible to humans. Replacing the
encoder in these networks with a spectrogram leads to lower overall
performance, but much higher stability. This work helps us to understand what
information these network rely on for speech segregation, and exposes two
sources of generalization-errors. It also pinpoints the encoder as the part of
the network responsible for these errors, allowing for a redesign with expert

Transformer architecture, have enabled natural language processing (NLP) to
achieve remarkably low perplexity. However, powerful NLP models necessitate
increasing model size, leading to substantial computational and memory
requirements. In this paper, we introduce an efficient inference framework
tailored for large-scale generative language models. To reduce the model size,
we employ a weight-only quantization strategy while preserving full precision
for activations. As a result, we attain sub-4-bit quantization for each weight
through non-uniform or uniform quantization techniques. Our proposed kernel,
called LUT-GEMM, then accelerates quantized matrix multiplications, offering a
flexible balance between compression ratio and accuracy. Unlike earlier matrix
multiplication kernels that accommodated weight-only quantization, LUT-GEMM
efficiently eliminates the resource-demanding dequantization process for both
uniform and non-uniform quantization methods. By reducing the latency of
individual GPUs and the overall inference process for large-scale language
models, LUT-GEMM provides significant performance improvements in inference.
The impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios
through low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations, which
decreases the number of required GPUs. For the OPT-175B model with 3-bit
quantization, we show that LUT-GEMM accelerates the latency for generating each
token by 2.1x compared to OPTQ, which requires costly dequantization.
Consequently, LUT-GEMM enables inference of the OPT-175B model on a single GPU
without noticeable degradation in accuracy or performance, while the
non-quantized OPT-175B model requires a minimum of 8 GPUs.

following two-dimensional incompressible flow problem. Starting from
configurations corresponding to translating inviscid equilibria, namely, the
translating F\""{o}ppl equilibria (counter-rotating point vortex pair, either
fore or aft of a translating circular cylinder) and the translating Hill
equilibria (counter-rotating point vortex pair, either fore or aft of an
elliptic cylinder), viscosity is turned on for $t >0$ and the subsequent
viscous interaction is simulated. The interaction is in a dynamically coupled
setting where the neutrally buoyant cylinder is free to move along the symmetry
axis under the action of the instantaneous fluid stresses on its surface. It is
observed that for starting configurations in which the vortex pair trails the
cylinder, the viscous evolution stays close to the inviscid equilibrium.
However, for starting configurations in which the vortex pair leads the
cylinder, there is significant deviation from the inviscid equilibrium. In such
cases, the vortices either accelerate and leave the cylinder behind or, more
interestingly, leave their leading positions and are attracted towards the
trailing positions. In other words, the cylinder in such cases threads through
the leading vortices, overtakes them and the vortices are observed to trail the
cylinder again. The symmetry of the inviscid dynamics about the perpendicular

models have widely followed short-term methodology, which dynamically
determines the balance between spatial and temporal saliency fusion by solely
considering the current consecutive limited frames. However, the short-term
methodology has one critical limitation, which conflicts with the real
mechanism of our visual system -- a typical long-term methodology. As a result,
failure cases keep showing up in the results of the current SOTA models, and
the short-term methodology becomes the major technical bottleneck. To solve
this problem, this paper proposes a novel VSOD approach, which performs VSOD in
a complete long-term way. Our approach converts the sequential VSOD, a
sequential task, to a data mining problem, i.e., decomposing the input video
sequence to object proposals in advance and then mining salient object
proposals as much as possible in an easy-to-hard way. Since all object
proposals are simultaneously available, the proposed approach is a complete
long-term approach, which can alleviate some difficulties rooted in
conventional short-term approaches. In addition, we devised an online updating
scheme that can grasp the most representative and trustworthy pattern profile
of the salient objects, outputting framewise saliency maps with rich details
and smoothing both spatially and temporally. The proposed approach outperforms
almost all SOTA models on five widely used benchmark datasets.

link representations by aggregating the pairwise node representations. As
pointed out by previous works, this two-step procedure results in low

point out that the capability of existing deep Navier-Stokes informed methods
is limited to handle non-smooth or fractional equations, which are two critical

vortex dynamics motivates a Monte Carlo based loss function for training the
neural network, which avoids the calculation of derivatives through
auto-differentiation. Therefore, DRVM not only can efficiently solve
Navier-Stokes equations involving rough path, non-differentiable initial

differentiable benefits of the deep-learning-based solver. We conduct
experiments on the Cauchy problem, parametric solver learning, and the inverse

predicted radio source dynamics are in good agreement with hydrodynamic
simulations of both low-powered Fanaroff-Riley Type-I and high-powered Type-II

complementing the original RAiSE model with the magnetic field and
shock-acceleration histories of a set of Lagrangian tracer particles taken from

sufficient for an accurate description of the dynamics and observable features

being generated in mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has emerged as
a promising distributed learning technique. By collaboratively training a
shared learning model on edge devices, raw data transmission and storage are
replaced by the exchange of the local computed parameters/gradients in FL,
which thus helps address latency and privacy issues. However, the number of
resource blocks when using traditional orthogonal transmission strategies for
FL linearly scales with the number of participating devices, which conflicts
with the scarcity of communication resources. To tackle this issue,
over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged recently which leverages the
inherent superposition property of wireless channels to perform one-shot model
aggregation. However, the aggregation accuracy in AirComp suffers from the
unfavorable wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we consider the
use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to mitigate this problem and
improve FL performance with AirComp. Specifically, a performance-oriented
design scheme that directly minimizes the optimality gap of the loss function
is proposed to accelerate the convergence of AirComp-based FL. We first analyze
the convergence behavior of the FL procedure with the absence of channel fading
and noise. Based on the obtained optimality gap which characterizes the impact
of channel fading and noise in different communication rounds on the ultimate
performance of FL, we propose both online and offline approaches to tackle the
resulting design problem. Simulation results demonstrate that such a
performance-oriented design strategy can achieve higher test accuracy than the
conventional isolated mean square error (MSE) minimization approach in FL.

most of them, the position of the swinger is controlled directly. This
simplifies the problem but hides the mechanics of torques applied to keep the
swing moving in a regular pattern. This article studies these mechanics. Two
models of a swing with torques as controls that we consider are identical to
popular models of modern robotics: the Acrobot and reaction wheel pendulum.
However, the control task of sustaining the swing's regular oscillations by a
static feedback control is new and challenging, especially when damping in the
joint connecting the swing to the frame is considered. We develop two types of
controls to accomplish this task. One works for small damping and is based on
linearizing the undamped system by a suitable preliminary feedback control. The
other works for large damping. In the steady state, the resulting closed-loop
system describes a harmonically driven damped pendulum (a simple system known
for its complex behavior), including chaotic motion for some parameter values.
To address such complexities, we build free parameters into the controls, then
adjust them based on simulations to avoid chaos and achieve regular
oscillations that are seen on playgrounds.

stabilised in a hot vitiated co-flow are performed. For auto-igniting flames,
an accurate prediction of flame stabilisation, which depends on a delicate
balance between turbulent transport and chemical kinetics at the flame base,
poses an enormous challenge to conventional turbulent combustion models.
Multiple mapping conditioning/large eddy simulation (MMC-LES), a promising tool
for modelling turbulence-chemistry interactions, has been successfully applied
to simulate a variety of combustion applications involving gaseous, liquid, and
solid fuels. MMC-LES is a full \gls{PDF} method where MMC plays the role of the
mixing model, emulating molecular mixing phenomenon. MMC attempts to produce
accurate molecular mixing by localising mixing in an independent,
composition-like reference space. Due to this enforced localised mixing, a
sparse distribution of stochastic Lagrangian particles for may be used for the
Monte-Carlo simulation of the sub-grid joint-composition PDF equation. In the
present study, we employ MMC-LES to investigate the auto-igniting methane/air
flames of UC Berkeley. A sparse resolution of 1 particle per 10 Eulerian
finite-volume cells is used in this study, which offers much cheaper computing
expenses in comparison to the conventional transported PDF approach. A skeletal
chemical mechanism, based on GRI 3.0, containing 30 species and 184 reactions,

modelled using the recently published \textit{dyn-aISO} model to assess its

hydrogels that have been supplemented with microbeads or glycerol to create
controlled material heterogeneity, we show that the morphology of the crack
surface depends solely on one parameter: the probability to perturb the front
above a critical size to produce a step-like instability. This probability
scales linearly with the number density, and as heterogeneity size to the $5/2$
power. The ensuing behavior is universal and is captured by the 1D ballistic

large-scale pretrained language models because they often require expensive
additional labeled data to adapt to new domains. Existing works usually fails
to leverage the implicit relationships among words across domains. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, called Domain Adaptation with Structured
Knowledge (DASK), to enhance domain adaptation by exploiting word-level
semantic relationships. DASK first builds a knowledge graph to capture the
relationship between pivot terms (domain-independent words) and non-pivot terms
in the target domain. Then during training, DASK injects pivot-related
knowledge graph information into source domain texts. For the downstream task,
these knowledge-injected texts are fed into a BERT variant capable of
processing knowledge-injected textual data. Thanks to the knowledge injection,
our model learns domain-invariant features for non-pivots according to their
relationships with pivots. DASK ensures the pivots to have domain-invariant
behaviors by dynamically inferring via the polarity scores of candidate pivots
during training with pseudo-labels. We validate DASK on a wide range of
cross-domain sentiment classification tasks and observe up to 2.9% absolute
performance improvement over baselines for 20 different domain pairs. Code will

diverse set of foreground images. A foreground-background segmentation
algorithm is then used to generate foreground object masks. Next, in order to
generate context images, first a language description of the context is
generated by applying an image captioning method on a small set of images
representing the context. These language descriptions are then used to generate
diverse sets of context images using the DALL-E framework. These are then
composited with object masks generated in the first step to provide an

sufficiently accurate reconstructions for further assessment of the object.
Additionally, we propose to use an unsupervised clustering approach known as
Density Peak Advanced, to perform a segmentation and spot density anomalies in
the internal structure of the reconstructed objects. We evaluate the method in
a proof of concept study for the application of wood log scanning for the
industrial sawing process, where the goal is to spot anomalies within the wood

of data and smoothness terms that commonly occur in machine learning, computer
vision, and pattern recognition. While discrete optimization methods are able
to give theoretical optimality guarantees, they can only handle a finite number
of labels and therefore suffer from label discretization bias. Existing
continuous optimization methods can find sublabel-accurate solutions, but they
are not efficient for large label spaces. In this work, we propose an efficient
sublabel-accurate method that utilizes the best properties of both continuous
and discrete models. We separate the problem into two sequential steps: (i)
global discrete optimization for selecting the label range, and (ii) efficient
continuous sublabel-accurate local refinement of a convex approximation of the
energy function in the chosen range. Doing so allows us to achieve a boost in
time and memory efficiency while practically keeping the accuracy at the same
level as continuous convex relaxation methods, and in addition, providing
theoretical optimality guarantees at the level of discrete methods. Finally, we
show the flexibility of the proposed approach to general pairwise smoothness
terms, so that it is applicable to a wide range of regularizations. Experiments
on the illustrating example of the image denoising problem demonstrate the

growth. Existing analytical approaches to find Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions
for MFGs are, however, by and large restricted to contractive or monotone
settings, or rely on the uniqueness of the NE. This paper proposes a new
mathematical paradigm to analyze discrete-time MFGs without any of these
restrictions.
  The key idea is to reformulate the problem of finding NE solutions in MFGs as
solving an equivalent optimization problem, called MF-OMO, with bounded
variables and trivial convex constraints. It is built on the classical work of
reformulating a Markov decision process as a linear program, and by adding the
consistency constraint for MFGs in terms of occupation measures, and by
exploiting the complementarity structure of the linear program.
  This equivalence framework enables finding multiple (and possibly all) NE
solutions of MFGs by standard algorithms such as projected gradient descent,
and with convergence guarantees under appropriate conditions. In particular,
analyzing MFGs with linear rewards and with mean-field independent dynamics is
reduced to solving a finite number of linear programs, hence solvable in finite
time.
  This optimization reformulation of MFGs can be extended to variants of MFGs
such as personalized MFGs.

the properties of data and affects model performance at large. The impact of
particular forms of normalization, however, has so far been investigated in
limited domain-specific classification tasks and not in a general fashion.
Motivated by the lack of such a comprehensive study, in this paper we
investigate the performance of lp-constrained softmax loss classifiers across
different norm orders, magnitudes, and data dimensions in both proof-of-concept
classification problems and real-world popular image classification tasks.
Experimental results suggest collectively that lp-constrained softmax loss
classifiers not only can achieve more accurate classification results but, at
the same time, appear to be less prone to overfitting. The core findings hold
across the three popular deep learning architectures tested and eight datasets
examined, and suggest that lp normalization is a recommended data
representation practice for image classification in terms of performance and
convergence, and against overfitting.

problem into two sub-problems with Dirichlet and Neumann interface conditions,

full-order model (FOM) is solved by Dirichlet-Neumann iterations between the
two sub-problems until interface convergence is reached. We, then, apply the
reduced basis (RB) method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the
solution of each sub-problem. Furthermore, we use the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM) applied at the interface level to achieve a fully
reduced-order representation of the DD techniques implemented. To deal with
interface data when non-conforming FE interface discretizations are considered,
we employ the INTERNODES method combined with the interface DEIM reduction. The
reduced-order model (ROM) is then solved by sub-iterating between the two
reduced-order sub-problems until convergence of the approximated high-fidelity
interface solutions. The ROM scheme is numerically verified on both steady and
unsteady coupled problems, in the case of non-conforming FE interfaces.

a sequential adversarial hypothesis testing game played between the decision
maker and the adversary. This game is a zero-sum and strategic one. We assume
the adversary is active under \emph{all} hypotheses and knows the underlying
distribution of observed samples. We adopt this framework as it is the
worst-case scenario from the perspective of the decision maker. The goal of the
decision maker is to minimize the expectation of the stopping time to ensure
that the test is as efficient as possible; the adversary's goal is, instead, to
maximize the stopping time. We derive a pair of strategies under which the
asymptotic Nash equilibrium of the game is attained. We also consider the case
in which the adversary is not aware of the underlying hypothesis and hence is
constrained to apply the same strategy regardless of which hypothesis is in
effect. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings.

can be reconciled by taking into account the degeneracy of the brain, which
manifests in multiple routes leading to similar function or dysfunction. We
exemplify degeneracy at three different levels, ranging from the cellular to
the network and systems level. First, at the cellular level, we describe the
relevance of ion channel degeneracy for epilepsy and discuss its interplay with
dendritic morphology. Second, at the network level, we provide examples for the
degeneracy of synaptic and intrinsic neuronal properties that supports the
robustness of neuronal networks but also leads to diverse responses to
ictogenic and epileptogenic perturbations. Third, at the system level, we
provide examples for degeneracy in the intricate interactions between the
immune and nervous system. Finally, we show that computational approaches
including multiscale and so called population neural circuit models help
disentangle the complex web of physiological and pathological adaptations. Such
models may contribute to identifying the best personalized multitarget
strategies for directing the system towards a physiological state.

opto-electronic devices, have so far been synthesized with only one emission
center where the exciton resides. Recent development of coupled Colloidal
Quantum Dots Molecules (CQDM), where two core-shell CQDs are fused to form two
emission centers in close proximity, allows to explore how charge carriers in
one CQD affect the charge carriers in the other CQD. Cryogenic single particle
spectroscopy reveals that while CQD monomers manifest a simple emission
spectrum comprising a main emission peak with well-defined phonon sidebands,
CQDMs exhibit a complex spectrum with multiple peaks that are not all spaced
according to the known phonon frequencies. Based on complementary emission
polarization and time-resolved analysis, this is assigned to fluorescence of
the two coupled emission centers. Moreover, the complex peak structure shows
correlated spectral diffusion indicative of the coupling between the two
emission centers. Utilizing Schrodinger-Poisson self-consistent calculations,
we directly map the spectral behavior, alternating between neutral and charged
states of the CQDM. Spectral shifts related to electrostatic interaction
between a charged emission center and the second emission center are thus fully
mapped. Furthermore, effects of moving surface charges are identified, whereby
the emission center proximal to the charge shows larger shifts. Instances where
the two emission centers are negatively charged simultaneously are also
identified. Such detailed mapping of charging states is enabled by the coupling
within the CQDM and its anisotropic structure. This understanding of the
coupling interactions is a progress towards quantum technology and sensing
applications based on CQDMs.

indicated that stochastic policy, despite its simplicity, is the most
frequently used exploration approach. However, most existing stochastic
exploration approaches either explore new actions heuristically regardless of
Q-values or inevitably introduce bias into the learning process to couple the
sampling with Q-values. In this paper, we propose a novel preference-guided
$\epsilon$-greedy exploration algorithm that can efficiently learn the action
distribution in line with the landscape of Q-values for DQN without introducing
additional bias. Specifically, we design a dual architecture consisting of two
branches, one of which is a copy of DQN, namely the Q-branch. The other branch,
which we call the preference branch, learns the action preference that the DQN
implicit follows. We theoretically prove that the policy improvement theorem
holds for the preference-guided $\epsilon$-greedy policy and experimentally
show that the inferred action preference distribution aligns with the landscape
of corresponding Q-values. Consequently, preference-guided $\epsilon$-greedy
exploration motivates the DQN agent to take diverse actions, i.e., actions with
larger Q-values can be sampled more frequently whereas actions with smaller
Q-values still have a chance to be explored, thus encouraging the exploration.
We assess the proposed method with four well-known DQN variants in nine
different environments. Extensive results confirm the superiority of our
proposed method in terms of performance and convergence speed.

require unfeasibly large sample sizes, composite endpoints are widely chosen as
the primary endpoint. Despite being commonly used, composite endpoints entail
challenges in designing and interpreting results. Given that the components may
be of different relevance and have different effect sizes, the choice of
components must be made carefully. Especially, sample size calculations for
composite binary endpoints depend not only on the anticipated effect sizes and
event probabilities of the composite components, but also on the correlation
between them. However, information on the correlation between endpoints is
usually not reported in the literature which can be an obstacle for planning of
future sound trial design. We consider two-arm randomized controlled trials
with a primary composite binary endpoint and an endpoint that consists only of
the clinically more important component of the composite endpoint. We propose a
trial design that allows an adaptive modification of the primary endpoint based
on blinded information obtained at an interim analysis. We consider a decision
rule to select between a composite endpoint and its most relevant component as
primary endpoint. The decision rule chooses the endpoint with the lower
estimated required sample size. Additionally, the sample size is reassessed
using the estimated event probabilities and correlation, and the expected
effect sizes of the composite components. We investigate the statistical power
and significance level under the proposed design through simulations. We show
that the adaptive design is equally or more powerful than designs without
adaptive modification on the primary endpoint. The targeted power is achieved
even if the correlation is misspecified while maintaining the type 1 error. We
illustrated the proposal by means of two case studies.

(PD). These are continuous and ubiquitous across broad regions of the corona,
including the quiet Sun. The aim of this paper is to present an improved,
efficient method to create velocity vector field maps, based on the direction
and magnitude of the PD as observed in time series of extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
images. The method is presented here for use with the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA)/Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) EUV channels, and takes as
input \app2 hours of images at the highest 12s cadence. Data from a region near
disk center is extracted, and a process called time normalization applied to
the co-aligned data. Following noise reduction using \atrous\ decomposition,
the PD are effectively revealed. A modified Lucas Kanade algorithm is then used
to map the velocity field. The method described here runs comfortably on a
desktop computer in a few minutes, and offers an order of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to a previous implementation. Applied to a region of the
quiet Sun, we find that the velocity field describes a mosaic of cells of
coherent outwardly-diverging PD flows, of typical size 50 to 100\arcsec\ (36 to
72Mm). The flows originate from points and narrow corridors in the cell
centres, and end in the narrow boundaries between cells. Visual comparison with
ultraviolet AIA images shows that the flow sources are correlated with the
bright photospheric supergranular network boundaries. Assuming that the PD
follow the local magnetic field, the velocity flow field is a proxy for the
plane-of-sky distribution of the coronal magnetic field, and therefore the maps
offer a unique insight into the topology of the corona. These are particularly
valuable for quiet Sun regions where the appearance of structures in EUV images
is hard to interpret.

connection between data-driven decision-making and distributionally robust
optimization with a regret objective. We then leverage this connection to
quantify the performance that is achievable by Sample Average Approximation
(SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball: for any integral
probability metric, we derive bounds depending on the approximation parameter,
a notion which quantifies how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the

we design and analyze problem-dependent policies achieving rate-optimality. We
compare achievable guarantees for three widely-studied problems -- newsvendor,

in $d$-space admits an $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners with $O(n)$ edges and weight
proportional to that of the Euclidean MST of $S$. In a recent breakthrough, Le
and Solomon (2019) established the precise dependencies on $\varepsilon>0$, for
constant $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the minimum lightness and sparsity of
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners, and observed that Steiner points can substantially
improve the lightness and sparsity of a $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner. They gave
upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ for the minimum lightness
in dimensions $d\geq 3$, and $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the
minimum sparsity in $d$-space for all $d\geq 1$.
  In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of
Euclidean Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners. We establish lower bounds of
$\Omega(\varepsilon^{-d/2})$ for the lightness and
$\Omega(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean
$d$-space for all constant $d\geq 2$. Our lower bound constructions generalize
previous constructions by Le and Solomon, but the analysis substantially
simplifies previous work, using new geometric insight, focusing on the
directions of edges. Next, we show that for every finite set of points in the
plane and every $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$, there exists a Euclidean Steiner
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner of lightness $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$; this matches the
lower bound for $d=2$. We generalize the notion of shallow light trees, which
may be of independent interest, and use directional spanners and a modified
window partitioning scheme to achieve a tight weight analysis.

analogue of the Riemann-Roch theory for Riemann surfaces. One of the key
concepts of graph divisor theory is the {\it rank} of a divisor on a graph. The
importance of the rank is well illustrated by Baker's {\it Specialization
lemma}, stating that the dimension of a linear system can only go up under
specialization from curves to graphs, leading to a fruitful interaction between
divisors on graphs and curves.
  Due to its decisive role, determining the rank is a central problem in graph
divisor theory. Kiss and T\'othm\'eresz reformulated the problem using
chip-firing games, and showed that computing the rank of a divisor on a graph
is NP-hard via reduction from the Minimum Feedback Arc Set problem.
  In this paper, we strengthen their result by establishing a connection
between chip-firing games and the Minimum Target Set Selection problem. As a
corollary, we show that the rank is difficult to approximate to within a factor
of $O(2^{\log^{1-\varepsilon}n})$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ unless $P=NP$.
Furthermore, assuming the Planted Dense Subgraph Conjecture, the rank is
difficult to approximate to within a factor of $O(n^{1/4-\varepsilon})$ for any
$\varepsilon>0$.

often described as the sum of stochastic processes and geophysical signals
which allow studying global and local geodynamical effects such as plate
tectonics, earthquakes, or ground water variations. In this work we propose to
extend the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) to estimate the
parameters of linear models with correlated residuals. This statistical
inferential framework is applied to GNSS daily position time series data to
jointly estimate functional (geophysical) as well as stochastic noise models.
Our method is called GMWMX, with X standing for eXogeneous variable: it is
semi-parametric, computationally efficient and scalable. Unlike standard
methods such as the widely used Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), our
methodology offers statistical guarantees, such as consistency and asymptotic
normality, without relying on strong parametric assumptions. At the Gaussian
model, our results show that the estimated parameters are similar to the ones
obtained with the MLE. The computational performances of our approach has
important practical implications. Indeed, the estimation of the parameters of
large networks of thousands of GNSS stations quickly becomes computationally
prohibitive. Compared to standard methods, the processing time of the GMWMX is
over $1000$ times faster and allows the estimation of large scale problems
within minutes on a standard computer. We validate the performances of our
method via Monte-Carlo simulations by generating GNSS daily position time
series with missing observations and we consider composite stochastic noise
models including processes presenting long-range dependence such as power-law
or Mat\'ern processes. The advantages of our method are also illustrated using
real time series from GNSS stations located in the Eastern part of the USA.

treatments without randomized clinical trial (RCT) is growing, with benefit
estimated from single-arm trials. This has become common in oncology, impacting
the approval pathway of health technology assessment agencies. We aimed to
provide some guidance for indirect comparison to external controls to improve
the level of evidence following such uncontrolled designs. METHODS We used the
illustrative example of blinatumomab, a bispecific antibody for the treatment
of B-cell ALL in complete remission (CR) with persistent minimal residual
disease (MRD). Its approval relied on a single-arm trial conducted in 86 adults
with B-cell ALL in CR, with undetectable MRD after one cycle as the main
endpoint. To maximize the validity of indirect comparisons, a 3-step process
for incorporating external control data to such single-arm trial data is
proposed and detailed, with emphasis on the example. RESULTS The first step
includes the definition of estimand, i.e. the treatment effect reflecting the
clinical question. The second step relies on the adequate selection of external
controls, from previous RCT or real-world data (RWD) obtained from patient
cohort, registries, or electronic patient files. The third step consists in
chosing the statistical approach targeting the treatment effect of interest,
either in the whole population or restricted to the single-arm trial or the
external controls, and depending on the available individual-level or
aggregrated external data. CONCLUSION Validity of treatment effect derived from
indirect comparisons heavily depends on carefull methodological considerations
that are included in the proposed 3-step procedure. Because the level of
evidence of a well conducted RCT cannot be guaranteed, post-market
authorization evaluation is even more important than in standard settings.

stable over periods of >6 Gyr, implying that any large velocity disturbances of
stars and gas clouds are damped rapidly on the timescale of their rotation.
However, it is also known that despite this damping, there must be a degree of
random local motion to stabilize the orbits against degenerate collapse. A
mechanism for such damping is proposed by a combination of inter-stellar
gravitational interactions, and interactions with the Oort clouds and exo-Oort
objects associated with each star. Analysis of the gravitational interactions
between two stars is a three-body problem, because the stars are also in orbit
round the large virtual mass of the galaxy. These mechanisms may produce rapid
damping of large perturbations within a time period that is short on the scale
of observational look-back time, but long on the scale of the disk rotational
period for stars with small perturbations. This mechanism may also account for
the locally observed mean perturbations in the Milky Way of 8-15~km/s for
younger stars and 20-30~km/s for older stars.

notoriously difficult and requires a lot of training steps. A standard solution
to speed up the process is to leverage additional reward signals, shaping it to
better guide the learning process. In the context of language-conditioned RL,
the abstraction and generalisation properties of the language input provide
opportunities for more efficient ways of shaping the reward. In this paper, we
leverage this idea and propose an automated reward shaping method where the
agent extracts auxiliary objectives from the general language goal. These
auxiliary objectives use a question generation (QG) and question answering (QA)
system: they consist of questions leading the agent to try to reconstruct
partial information about the global goal using its own trajectory. When it
succeeds, it receives an intrinsic reward proportional to its confidence in its
answer. This incentivizes the agent to generate trajectories which
unambiguously explain various aspects of the general language goal. Our
experimental study shows that this approach, which does not require engineer
intervention to design the auxiliary objectives, improves sample efficiency by
effectively directing exploration.

role during the formation planetary bodies by providing a significant
additional source of heat. Notably, this led to early and large-scale melting
and iron core formation in planetesimals and their loss of volatile elements,
such as hydrogen and carbon. In the context exoplanetary systems, therefore,
the prevalence of short-lived radioisotopes is key to interpreting the observed
bulk volatile budget and atmospheric diversity among low-mass exoplanets. White
dwarfs that have accreted planetary material provide a unique means to infer
the frequency of iron core formation in extrasolar planetesimals, and hence the
ubiquity of planetary systems forming with high short-lived radioisotope
abundances. Here, we devise a quantitative method to infer the fraction of
planetary systems enriched with shortlived radionuclides upon planetesimal
formation from white dwarf data. We argue that the current evidence from white
dwarfs point towards a significant fraction of exo-planetesimals having formed
an iron core. Although the data may be explained by the accretion of exo-moon
or Pluto-sized bodies that were able to differentiate due to gravitational
potential energy release, our results suggest that the most likely explanation
for the prevalence of differentiated material among polluted white dwarfs is
that the Solar System is not unusual in being enriched in 26Al. The models
presented here suggest a ubiquitous pathway for the enrichment of exoplanetary
systems by short-lived radioisotopes, disfavouring short-lived radioisotope
enrichment scenarios relying on rare chance encounters with single nearby

  Learning Workshop (Neurips 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As one of the most popular machine learning models today, graph neural
networks (GNNs) have attracted intense interest recently, and so does their
explainability. Users are increasingly interested in a better understanding of
GNN models and their outcomes. Unfortunately, today's evaluation frameworks for
GNN explainability often rely on few inadequate synthetic datasets, leading to
conclusions of limited scope due to a lack of complexity in the problem
instances. As GNN models are deployed to more mission-critical applications, we
are in dire need for a common evaluation protocol of explainability methods of
GNNs. In this paper, we propose, to our best knowledge, the first systematic
evaluation framework for GNN explainability, considering explainability on
three different ""user needs"". We propose a unique metric that combines the
fidelity measures and classifies explanations based on their quality of being
sufficient or necessary. We scope ourselves to node classification tasks and
compare the most representative techniques in the field of input-level
explainability for GNNs. For the inadequate but widely used synthetic
benchmarks, surprisingly shallow techniques such as personalized PageRank have
the best performance for a minimum computation time. But when the graph
structure is more complex and nodes have meaningful features, gradient-based
methods are the best according to our evaluation criteria. However, none
dominates the others on all evaluation dimensions and there is always a
trade-off. We further apply our evaluation protocol in a case study for frauds
explanation on eBay transaction graphs to reflect the production environment.

product, is fundamental to the compositional, process-theoretic approach to
physical theories. Promonoidal categories generalise monoidal categories by
replacing the functors normally used to form joint systems with profunctors.
Intuitively, this allows the formation of joint systems which may not always
give a system again, but instead a generalised system given by a presheaf. This
extra freedom gives a new, richer notion of joint systems that can be applied
to categorical formulations of spacetime. Whereas previous formulations have
relied on partial monoidal structure that is only defined on pairs of
independent (i.e. spacelike separated) systems, here we give a concrete
formulation of spacetime where the notion of a joint system is defined for any
pair of systems as a presheaf. The representable presheaves correspond
precisely to those actual systems that arise from combining spacelike systems,
whereas more general presheaves correspond to virtual systems which inherit
some of the logical/compositional properties of their ``actual'' counterparts.
We show that there are two ways of doing this, corresponding roughly to
relativistic versions of conjunction and disjunction. The former endows the
category of spacetime slices in a Lorentzian manifold with a promonoidal
structure, whereas the latter augments this structure with an (even more)
generalised way to combine systems that fails the interchange law.

  In this paper we present Phoebe, a proactive approach to system auto-tuning

approach makes use of parallel profiling runs, QoS modeling, and runtime
optimization to provide a general solution whereby configuration parameters are
automatically tuned to ensure a stable service as well as alignment with

vulnerable to test cases resulting from either adversarial manipulation or

machine learning algorithms for real-world applications, especially in
safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving (AD). On the other hand,
traditional AD testing on naturalistic scenarios requires hundreds of millions
of driving miles due to the high dimensionality and rareness of the
safety-critical scenarios in the real world. As a result, several approaches
for autonomous driving evaluation have been explored, which are usually,
however, based on different simulation platforms, types of safety-critical
scenarios, scenario generation algorithms, and driving route variations. Thus,
despite a large amount of effort in autonomous driving testing, it is still
challenging to compare and understand the effectiveness and efficiency of
different testing scenario generation algorithms and testing mechanisms under
similar conditions. In this paper, we aim to provide the first unified platform
SafeBench to integrate different types of safety-critical testing scenarios,
scenario generation algorithms, and other variations such as driving routes and
environments. Meanwhile, we implement 4 deep reinforcement learning-based AD
algorithms with 4 types of input (e.g., bird's-eye view, camera) to perform
fair comparisons on SafeBench. We find our generated testing scenarios are
indeed more challenging and observe the trade-off between the performance of AD
agents under benign and safety-critical testing scenarios. We believe our
unified platform SafeBench for large-scale and effective autonomous driving
testing will motivate the development of new testing scenario generation and
safe AD algorithms. SafeBench is available at https://safebench.github.io.

(DRSL) for self-supervised domain adaptation of semantic segmentation. In a
typical setting, the classification loss forces the semantic segmentation model
to greedily learn the representations that capture inter-class variations in
order to determine the decision (class) boundary. Due to the domain shift, this
decision boundary is unaligned in the target domain, resulting in noisy pseudo
labels adversely affecting self-supervised domain adaptation. To overcome this
limitation, along with capturing inter-class variation, we capture pixel-level
intra-class variations through class-aware multi-modal distribution learning
(MMDL). Thus, the information necessary for capturing the intra-class
variations is explicitly disentangled from the information necessary for
inter-class discrimination. Features captured thus are much more informative,
resulting in pseudo-labels with low noise. This disentanglement allows us to
perform separate alignments in discriminative space and multi-modal
distribution space, using cross-entropy based self-learning for the former. For
later, we propose a novel stochastic mode alignment method, by explicitly
decreasing the distance between the target and source pixels that map to the
same mode. The distance metric learning loss, computed over pseudo-labels and
backpropagated from multi-modal modeling head, acts as the regularizer over the
base network shared with the segmentation head. The results from comprehensive
experiments on synthetic to real domain adaptation setups, i.e., GTA-V/SYNTHIA
to Cityscapes, show that DRSL outperforms many existing approaches (a minimum
margin of 2.3% and 2.5% in mIoU for SYNTHIA to Cityscapes).

expansion, which takes into account the time periodicity of the structure ($T_s

and electromagnetic counterparts GRB170817 and AT2017gfo kick-started the field
of gravitational wave multimessenger astronomy. The optically red to near
infra-red emission (`red' component) of AT2017gfo was readily explained as
produced by the decay of newly created nuclei produced by rapid neutron capture
(a kilonova). However, the ultra-violet to optically blue emission (`blue'
component) that was dominant at early times (up to 1.5 days) received no
consensus regarding its driving physics. Among many explanations, two leading
contenders are kilonova radiation from a lanthanide-poor ejecta component or
shock interaction (cocoon emission). In this work, we simulate AT2017gfo-like
light curves and perform a Bayesian analysis to study whether an ultra-violet
satellite capable of rapid gravitational wave follow-up, could distinguish
between physical processes driving the early `blue' component. We find that a
Dorado-like ultra-violet satellite, with a 50 sq. deg. field of view and a
limiting magnitude (AB) of 20.5 for a 10 minute exposure is able to distinguish
radiation components up to at least 160 Mpc if data collection starts within
3.2 or 5.2 hours for two possible AT2017gfo-like light curve scenarios. We also
study the degree to which parameters can be constrained with the obtained
photometry. We find that, while ultra-violet data alone constrains parameters
governing the outer ejecta properties, the combination of both ground-based
optical and space-based ultra-violet data allows for tight constraints for all
but one parameter of the kilonova model up to 160 Mpc. These results imply that
an ultra-violet mission like Dorado would provide unique insights into the
early evolution of the post-merger system and its driving emission physics.

  Application to 3D Object Degradation",,,,,"cs.CG cs.CV cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Triangular meshes are the most popular representations of 3D objects, but
many mesh surfaces contain topological singularities that represent a challenge
for displaying or further processing them properly. One such singularity is the
self-intersections that may be present in mesh surfaces that have been created
by a scanning procedure or by a deformation transformation, such as
off-setting.
  Mesh foldings comprise a special case of mesh surface self-intersections,
where the faces of the 3D model intersect and become reversed, with respect to
the unfolded part of the mesh surface. A novel method for the recognition and
repair of mesh surface foldings is presented, which exploits the structural
characteristics of the foldings in order to efficiently detect the folded
regions. Following detection, the foldings are removed and any gaps so created
are filled based on the geometry of the 3D model. The proposed method is
directly applicable to simple mesh surface representations while it does not
perform any embedding of the 3D mesh (i.e. voxelization, projection). Target of
the proposed method is to facilitate mesh degradation procedures in a fashion
that retains the original structure, given the operator, in the most efficient
manner.

observations from 2008 to 2022 by the COR2 cameras onboard the twin Solar
TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. Although undetected in
individual images, Phaethon was visible in stacks combined from the same
perihelion observations, yet only at small ($\lesssim$30\deg) but not large
($\gtrsim$150\deg) phase angles. The observations are in line with the
contribution from a bare nucleus, thereby seriously contradicting the
interpretation based on HI-1 observations that attributes the perihelion
activity to the ejection of \micron-sized dust. We obtained an upper limit to
the effective cross-section of \micron-sized dust to be $\lesssim \! 10^{5}$
m$^{2}$, at least three orders of magnitude smaller than earlier estimates
based on HI-1 data. On the contrary, the COR2 observations cannot rule out the
existence of mm-sized or larger debris around Phaethon. However, the fact that
no postperihelion debris tail has ever been detected for Phaethon suggests the
unimportance of such dust in the perihelion activity. We thus conclude that the
perihelion activity of Phaethon is highly unlikely relevant to the ejection of
dust. Rather, we deduce that the activity is associated with gas emissions,
possibly Fe I and/or Na D lines. To verify our conjecture and to fully
understand the perihelion activity of Phaethon, more observations at small
heliocentric distances are desired. We compile a list of observing windows
ideal for the search of gas emissions of the asteroid from ground telescopes.
The best opportunities will be during total solar eclipses.

multiplets. For adjoints scalars, the sign of the one loop gauge coupling beta
function depends solely on $M$, vanishing and changing sign precisely at
$M=22$. For the multi-scalar potential at fixed gauge coupling we find several
fixed points with different stability properties at large $N$. The analysis
crucially involves the full set of four $SU(N)$ and $O(M)$ invariant single
trace and double trace couplings. Taking the gauge coupling into account, there
are asymptotically free RG flows for $M<22$ and non-trivial fixed points for
$M=22$ at one loop, while $M>22$ appears to ruin the UV properties of the
theory. Surprisingly, uniquely between $M=22$ and $M=21$ the number of fixed
flows drops from eight to four in the large $N$ limit. There seems to be
something very special about $M=22$. More speculatively, the $M=22$ one-loop

possibility of an isolated non-supersymmetric, purely bosonic AdS$_{4+1}

applied to the knowledge built into deep learning models to directly infer
salience, surprise, and salience in stories. Extensions add memory and external
knowledge from story plots and from Wikipedia to infer salience on novels such
as Great Expectations and plays such as Macbeth. Other work adapts the models
as a planning system for generating original stories.
  The thesis finds that applying the narrative theory to deep learning models
can align with the typical reader. In follow-up work, the insights could help
improve computer models for tasks such as automatic story writing and
assistance for writing, summarising or editing stories. Moreover, the approach
of applying narrative theory to the inherent qualities built in a system that
learns itself (self-supervised) from reading from books, watching videos, and
listening to audio is much cheaper and more adaptable to other domains and
tasks. Progress is swift in improving self-supervised systems. As such, the

single-file experiments. Several studies indicate that there are differences by
gender when group composition is taken into account. Even for the simplest
systems, such as pedestrian flows in corridors, there are still some
deficiencies in the detailed understanding of this fundamental relationship.
The effect of cultural differences can only be seen in a different density and
velocity interval if a comparison is conducted between the two different
cultural groups. Our results indicate that the velocities of male and female
pedestrians are different. For instance, when N = 20, the velocity is 0.65 to
0.69m/s for Chinese, while for Ghanaians, the velocity is 0.51 to 0.62m/s.
Similarly, when the densities change N = 40 in Chinese, they are 0.26 to
0.32m/s, while the Ghanaians are 0.21 to 0.28m/s. In addition, we investigated
whether pedestrian behavior, corridor length, body weight, and height between
Chinese and Ghanaian pedestrians influence cultural differences in a

the design stage of most devices based on high-temperature superconductors

proposing improvements, and computing quantities that are not easy to calculate
with an analytical approach. For instance, the estimation of losses in HTS is
fundamental during the design stage since losses can strongly influence the
cooling system requirements and operating temperature. Typically, 2D finite
element analysis is used to calculate AC losses in HTS, due to the lack of
analytical solutions that can accurately represent complex operating conditions
such as AC transport current and AC external applied magnetic field in coils.
These 2D models are usually a representation of an infinitely long arrangement.
Therefore, they cannot be used to analyze end effects and complex 3D
configurations. In this publication, we use the homogenization of the T-A
formulation in 3D for the analysis of superconducting coils with complex
geometries where a 2D approach can not provide accurate analyses and
verification of assumptions. The modeling methodology allows an easier

the electromagnetic behavior of coils with more complex geometries is analyzed.

transit to the large black hole (LBH) state, and vice versa. We use the

rely on the capability of neural networks to perform direct interpolation,
which we dubbed Neural Interpolation (NI), or explore scene geometry for novel
view synthesis, also known as Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR). Instead, we
incorporate the ideas behind these two kinds of approaches by launching the NI
with a novel DIBR pipeline. Specifically, the proposed Geo-NI first performs NI
using input light field sheared by a set of depth hypotheses. Then the DIBR is
implemented by assigning the sheared light fields with a novel reconstruction
cost volume according to the reconstruction quality under different depth
hypotheses. The reconstruction cost is interpreted as a blending weight to
render the final output light field by blending the reconstructed light fields
along the dimension of depth hypothesis. By combining the superiorities of NI
and DIBR, the proposed Geo-NI is able to render views with large disparity with
the help of scene geometry while also reconstruct non-Lambertian effect when
depth is prone to be ambiguous. Extensive experiments on various datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed geometry-aware light field

exoplanet atmospheres, and to apply it to observed emission phase curve and

3D framework, which is freely available as a stand-alone module from GitHub. We
use the atmospheric modelling and Bayesian retrieval package ARCiS (ARtful

simultaneous transmission (HST/WFC3) and phase-dependent emission (HST/WFC3,
Spitzer/IRAC) observations of WASP-43b as a case study. We assess how input
assumptions affect our retrieval outcomes. In particular we look at
constraining equilibrium chemistry vs a free molecular retrieval, the case of
no clouds vs parametrised clouds, and using Spitzer phase data that have been
reduced from two different literature sources. For the free chemistry
retrievals, we retrieve abundances of H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, AlO, and NH3 as a
function of phase, with many more species considered for the equilibrium
chemistry retrievals. Results. We find consistent super-solar C/O (0.6-0.9) and
super-solar metallicities (1.7-2.9 dex) for all retrieval setups that assume
equilibrium chemistry. Atmospheric heat distribution, hotspot shift (15.6 vs
4.5 for different Spitzer datasets), and temperature structure are influenced
by the Spitzer emission phase data. Comparisons are made with other studies of
WASP-43b, including available GCM simulations. Conclusions. The parametrised 3D
setup we have developed provides a valuable tool to analyse extensive
observational datasets such as spectroscopic phase curves. Near-future

properties of the region, and with the pressure of the galactic environment

link between the pressure terms and the properties of the cluster population
(age, mass, and LyC flux). We find that $P_{\rm ion}$ dominates over $P_{\rm

are strongly enhanced and become almost comparable in the central starburst
region. In the disk ($R \geq 0.15~R_e$), we observe that $P_{\rm dir}$ stays
approximately constant with galactocentric distance. $P_{\rm dir}$ is
positively correlated with an increase in radiation field strength (linked to
the negative metallicity gradient in the galaxy), while it decreases in low
extinction regions. $P_{\rm ion}$ decreases constantly for increasing
galactocentric distances. In general, we observe that HII regions near the
center are underpressured with respect to their surroundings, whereas regions
in the disk are overpressured and hence expanding. We find that regions hosting
younger clusters or having more mass in young star clusters have a higher
internal pressure, indicating that clustered star formation is likely playing a
dominant role in setting the pressure. Finally, we estimate that only 13 % of

cracks and generate a quantitative and qualitative report. ABECIS was tested
using images collected from a UAV and smartphone cameras in real-world

algorithm, the median Intersection over Unions for the test experiments is (1)

control tasks and decision-making problems, like the Go board game. Yet, there
are few success stories when it comes to deploying those algorithms to

model-based RL approach that can learn to control systems with minimal
violations of the safety constraints. The model is learned on the data
collected during the operation of the system in an iterated batch fashion, and
is then used to plan for the best action to perform at each time step. We
propose three different safe planners, one based on a simple random shooting
strategy and two based on MAP-Elites, a more advanced divergent-search
algorithm. Experiments show that these planners help the learning agent avoid
unsafe situations while maximally exploring the state space, a necessary aspect
when learning an accurate model of the system. Furthermore, compared to
model-free approaches, learning a model allows GuSS reducing the number of
interactions with the real-system while still reaching high rewards, a
fundamental requirement when handling engineering systems.

essential applications. A promising approach to address this problem is to
exchange radio signals between mobile agents and static physical anchors (PAs)
that bounce off flat surfaces in the indoor environment. Radio frequency
simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods can be used to jointly
estimates the time-varying location of agents as well as the static locations
of the flat surfaces. Recent work on RF-SLAM methods has shown that each
surface can be efficiently represented by a single master virtual anchor (MVA).
The measurement model related to this MVA-based RF-SLAM method is highly
nonlinear. Thus, Bayesian estimation relies on sampling-based techniques. The
original MVA-based RF-SLAM method employs conventional ""bootstrap"" sampling. In
challenging scenarios it was observed that the original method might converge
to incorrect MVA positions corresponding to local maxima. In this paper, we
introduce MVA-based RF-SLAM with an improved sampling technique that succeeds
in the aforementioned challenging scenarios. Our simulation results demonstrate

signal is absent. In this paper, a joint angle and delay estimation (JADE)
scheme is designed for 5G picocell base stations (gNBs) which addresses two
crucial issues to make it both effective and efficient in realistic indoor
environments. Firstly, the direction-dependence of the array modeling error for
picocell gNB as well as its impact on JADE is revealed. This error is mitigated
by fitting the array response measurements to a vector-valued function and
pre-calibrating the ideal steering-vector with the fitted function. Secondly,
based on the deployment reality that 5G picocell gNBs only have a small-scale
antenna array but have a large signal bandwidth, the proposed scheme decouples
the estimation of time-of-arrival (TOA) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) to
reduce the huge complexity induced by two-dimensional joint processing. It
employs the iterative-adaptive-approach (IAA) to resolve multipath signals in
the TOA domain, followed by a conventional beamformer (CBF) to retrieve the
desired line-of-sight DOA. By further exploiting a dimension-reducing
pre-processing module and accelerating spectrum computing by fast Fourier
transforms, an efficient implementation is achieved for real-time JADE.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in
terms of DOA estimation accuracy. Field tests show that a triangulation
positioning error of 0.44 m is achieved for 90% cases using only DOAs estimated

estimate the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, have been widely employed
in location-aware networks. To achieve a high-accuracy delay estimation, a
number of multiband-based algorithms have been proposed recently, which exploit
the channel state information (CSI) measurements over multiple non-contiguous
frequency bands. However, to the best of our knowledge, there still lacks an
efficient scheme that fully exploits the multiband gains when the phase
distortion factors caused by hardware imperfections are considered, due to that
the associated multi-parameter estimation problem contains many local optimums
and the existing algorithms can easily get stuck in a ""bad"" local optimum. To
address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage global estimation (TSGE)
scheme for multiband delay estimation. In the coarse stage, we exploit the
group sparsity structure of the multiband channel and propose a Turbo Bayesian
inference (Turbo-BI) algorithm to achieve a good initial delay estimation based
on a coarse signal model, which is transformed from the original multiband
signal model by absorbing the carrier frequency terms. The estimation problem
derived from the coarse signal model contains less local optimums and thus a
more stable estimation can be achieved than directly using the original signal
model. Then in the refined stage, with the help of coarse estimation results to
narrow down the search range, we perform a global delay estimation using a
particle swarm optimization-least square (PSO-LS) algorithm based on a refined
multiband signal model to exploit the multiband gains to further improve the
estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed TSGE
significantly outperforms the benchmarks with comparative computational
complexity.

microdosimetry, used to investigate exposure, requires volumetric cell models,
which are numerically challenging. For this reason, a method is presented here
to determine the current and power densities occurring in single cells and
their distinct compartments in a spatially accurate manner as a first step
towards multicellular models within the microstructure of tissue layers. To
achieve this, 3D models of the electromagnetic exposure of generic eukaryotic
cells of different shape (i.e. spherical and ellipsoidal) and internal
complexity (i.e. different organelles) are performed in a virtual, FEM-based
capacitor experiment in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 GHz. In this
context, the spectral response of the current and power distribution within the
cell compartments is investigated and any effects that occur are attributed
either to the dispersive material properties of these compartments or to the
geometric characteristics of the cell model investigated in each case. In these
investigations, the cell is represented as an anisotropic body with an internal
distributed membrane system of low conductivity that mimics the endoplasmic
reticulum in a simplified manner. This will be used to determine which details
of the cell interior need to be modeled, how the electric field and the current
density will be distributed in this region, and where the electromagnetic
energy is absorbed in the microstructure regarding electromagnetic
microdosimetry. Results show that for 5G frequencies, membranes make a
significant contribution to the absorption losses.

renormalization of the coupling constant $\mathfrak{z}$. Recently, we have
developed a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering (DFSS) which offers
a singularity-free treatment of this potential. We elucidate the basic
mechanism responsible for the implicit regularization property of DFSS that
makes it avoid the logarithmic singularity one encounters in the standard

associated with the hypergraph. We also show that, conversely, some specific
footprints in the spectrum and in the corresponding eigenvectors retrace the
presence of some of these building blocks in the hypergraph. The hypergraph
remains invariant under the permutations among the vertices in some building
blocks. These vertices behave similarly, in random walks on the hypergraph and
play an important role in hypergraph automorphisms. Identifying similar
vertices in certain building blocks results in a smaller hypergraph that
contains some spectral information of the original hypergraph. The number of
specific building blocks provides an upper bound of the chromatic number of the
hypergraph. A pseudo metric is introduced to measure distances between vertices
in the hypergraph by using one of the building blocks. Here, we use the concept

for prediction of diagnosis and prognosis in fibrosing interstitial lung
diseases (ILD). Approach: 40 ILD patients (20 usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP), 20 non-UIP pattern ILD) were classified by expert consensus of 2
radiologists and followed for 7 years. Clinical variables were recorded.
Following segmentation of the lung field, a total of 26 texture features were
extracted using a lattice-based approach (TM model). The TM model was compared
with previously histogram-based model (HM) for their abilities to classify UIP
vs non-UIP. For prognostic assessment, survival analysis was performed
comparing the expert diagnostic labels versus TM metrics. Results: In the
classification analysis, the TM model outperformed the HM method with AUC of
0.70. While survival curves of UIP vs non-UIP expert labels in Cox regression
analysis were not statistically different, TM QCT features allowed
statistically significant partition of the cohort. Conclusions: TM model
outperformed HM model in distinguishing UIP from non-UIP patterns. Most
importantly, TM allows for partitioning of the cohort into distinct survival
groups, whereas expert UIP vs non-UIP labeling does not. QCT TM models may
improve diagnosis of ILD and offer more accurate prognostication, better
guiding patient management.

universal and are observed across different markets, financial instruments and
time periods, hence they can serve to validate models of financial markets. If
a given model does not consistently replicate these stylised facts, then we can
reject it as being empirically inadequate. We discuss each stylised fact, the
empirical evidence for it, and introduce appropriate metrics for testing the
presence of these in model generated data. Moreover we investigate the ability
of our model to correctly reproduce these stylised facts. We validate our model
against a comprehensive list of empirical phenomena that qualify as a stylised
fact, of both low and high frequency financial data that can be addressed by
means of a relatively simple ABM of financial markets. This procedure is able
to show whether the model, as an abstraction of reality, has a meaningful

delay-constrained traffic becomes critical for such systems. In
delay-constrained traffic, each packet has a hard deadline; when it is not
delivered before its deadline is up, it becomes useless and will be removed
from the system. In this work, we focus on designing random access schemes for
delay-constrained wireless communications. We first investigate three
ALOHA-based schemes and prove that the system timely throughput of all three
schemes under corresponding optimal transmission probabilities asymptotically
converges to $1/e$, same as the well-known throughput limit for
delay-unconstrained ALOHA systems. The fundamental reason why ALOHA-based
schemes cannot achieve asymptotical system timely throughput beyond $1/e$ is
that all active ALOHA stations access the channel with the same probability in
any slot. To go beyond $1/e$, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based scheme
for delay-constrained wireless communications, called RLRA-DC, under which
different stations collaboratively attain different transmission probabilities
by only interacting with the access point. Our numerical result shows that the
system timely throughput of RLRA-DC can be as high as 0.8 for tens of stations
and can still reach 0.6 even for thousands of stations, much larger than $1/e$.

by cosmic rays and allow for a determination of the cosmic-ray ionization rate
in dense gas. One-dimensional models show that measuring both the H$_2$ gas
column density and H$_2$ line intensity enables a constraint on the cosmic-ray

in the interstellar medium (ISM). Aims: We aim to investigate the impact of
certain assumptions regarding the H$_2$ chemical models and ISM density
distributions on the emission of cosmic-ray induced H$_2$ emission lines. This
is of particular importance for utilizing observations of these lines with the
James Webb Space Telescope to constrain the cosmic-ray ionization rate.
Methods: We compare the predicted emission from cosmic-ray induced,
ro-vibrationally excited H$_2$ emission lines for different one- and
three-dimensional models with varying assumptions on the gas chemistry and

severely hampered due to the mismatch between training and testing
distributions. Since the target domain usually lacks labeled data, and domain
shifts exist at acoustic and linguistic levels, it is challenging to perform
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for ASR. Previous work has shown that
self-supervised learning (SSL) or pseudo-labeling (PL) is effective in UDA by
exploiting the self-supervisions of unlabeled data. However, these
self-supervisions also face performance degradation in mismatched domain
distributions, which previous work fails to address. This work presents a
systematic UDA framework to fully utilize the unlabeled data with
self-supervision in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. On the one hand,
we apply continued pre-training and data replay techniques to mitigate the
domain mismatch of the SSL pre-trained model. On the other hand, we propose a
domain-adaptive fine-tuning approach based on the PL technique with three
unique modifications: Firstly, we design a dual-branch PL method to decrease
the sensitivity to the erroneous pseudo-labels; Secondly, we devise an
uncertainty-aware confidence filtering strategy to improve pseudo-label
correctness; Thirdly, we introduce a two-step PL approach to incorporate target
domain linguistic knowledge, thus generating more accurate target domain
pseudo-labels. Experimental results on various cross-domain scenarios
demonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively boost the cross-domain

regarding extensions of monotones for resource theories. A monotone for a
resource theory assigns a real number to each resource in the theory signifying
the utility or the value of the resource. Gour and Tomamichel studied the
problem of extending monotones using set-theoretical framework when a resource
theory embeds fully and faithfully into the larger theory. One can generalize
the problem of computing monotone extensions to scenarios when there exists a
functorial transformation of one resource theory to another instead of just a
full and faithful inclusion. In this article, we show that (point-wise) Kan
extensions provide a precise categorical framework to describe and compute such
extensions of monotones. To set up monontone extensions using Kan extensions,
we introduce partitioned categories (pCat) as a framework for resource theories
and pCat functors to formalize relationship between resource theories. We
describe monotones as pCat functors into $([0,\infty], \leq)$, and describe
extending monotones along any pCat functor using Kan extensions. We show how
our framework works by applying it to extend entanglement monotones for
bipartite pure states to bipartite mixed states, to extend classical
divergences to the quantum setting, and to extend a non-uniformity monotone
from classical probabilistic theory to quantum theory.

proton and neutron numbers and it may be a candidate for a deuteron
``cluster.'' There is, however, no experimental evidence for it. The purpose of
this paper is to construct a new reaction model for the ($p,pd$) reaction
including the deuteron breakup in the elementary process and the deuteron
reformation by the final-state interactions (FSIs). How these processes
contribute to the observables of the reaction is investigated. The distorted
wave impulse approximation is extended in twofold. The elementary processes of
the ($p,pd$), i.e., the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering and $d(p,p)pn$ reaction, are
described with an impulse picture employing a nucleon-nucleon effective
interaction. The three-body scattering waves in the final state of the ($p,pd$)
reaction are calculated with the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method.
The triple differential cross section (TDX) of the ($p,pd$) reaction is
calculated with the new model. The elementary processes are described
reasonably well with the present model. As for the ($p,pd$) reaction, the
deuteron reformation can either increase or decrease the TDX height depending
on the interference between the elastic and breakup channel of deuteron, while
the \textit{back-coupling} effect always decreases it. It is shown that the
deuteron reformation significantly changes the TDX of the ($p,pd$) reaction
through the interference. It is important to include this process to
quantitatively discuss the ($p,pd$) cross sections in view of the deuteron
formation in nuclei. For more quantitative discussion regarding the
experimental data, further improvement will be necessary.

collaborative training strategy. Transferring the category information is
achieved by knowledge distillation on predicted probability distribution, and a
soft regression loss is adopted for handling displacement in location
information transfer. The experimental result on a large-scale aerial object

uncertainty that the current model has about a point's class label is the main
criterion for this type of ranking. This paper proposes a new approach to
uncertainty sampling in training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main
idea is to use feature representation extracted extracted by the CNN as data
for training a Sum-Product Network (SPN). Since SPNs are typically used for
estimating the distribution of a dataset, they are well suited to the task of
estimating class probabilities that can be used directly by standard
acquisition functions such as max entropy and variational ratio. Moreover, we
enhance these acquisition functions by weights calculated with the help of the
SPN model; these weights make the acquisition function more sensitive to the
diversity of conceivable class labels for data points. The effectiveness of our
method is demonstrated in an experimental study on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets, where we compare it to the state-of-the-art methods MC

Beyond the exact isolated solutions, the regular spectrum can be achieved by
finding the roots of the G-function. The corresponding eigenstates are of
infinite dimension. It is noteworthy that the expansion coefficients of the

global consistent quantization, we employ contrastive learning for both
embedding and quantized representations and fuses these representations for
consistent contrastive regularization between instances. This can make up for
the loss of useful representation information during quantization and
regularize consistency between instances. With a unified learning objective of

minimized. These data can be used for subsequent analyses in terms of flight
safety or efficiency, which is commonly referred to as Flight Data Monitoring

  Statistical assumptions of the smoother theory are not always verified during
application but (consciously or not) assumed to be fulfilled. These assumptions
can hardly be verified prior to the smoother application, however, they can be
verified using the results of an initial smoother iteration and modifications
of specific smoother characteristics can be suggested. This project
specifically verifies assumptions on the measurement noise characteristics.
  Variance and covariance of the measurement noise can be checked after the
initial smoother application. It is discovered that these characteristics
change over time and should be accounted for with a time varying covariance
matrix. This sequence of matrices is estimated by kernel smoothing and replaces
an initially assumed fixed and diagonal covariance matrix used for the first
smoother run. The results of this second smoother iteration are mostly improved
compared to the initial iteration, i.e. the errors are significantly reduced.
Subsequently, the remaining dependence structures of the residuals of the

State-of-the-art linear interpolation approaches, such as LoRAS and ProWRAS can

the Standard Model (SM) $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge gauge boson and a $U(1)_D$ dark

CDFII has measured a value for the $W$-boson mass which lies significantly
above SM expectations. In this paper we speculate that this shift in the $W$'s

focus our attention on the composition of a 2-fold rotation with time reversal,
and we show that insulators with this symmetry possess a Z2 invariant arising
from Atiyah's real K-theory. We call this invariant the K-theory Kane-Mele

systems with time-reversal symmetry. Whenever all Chern numbers vanish, we
demonstrate that this invariant is equivalent to the Chern-Simons axion
coupling, and in the presence of the inversion symmetry, we show how this

its fixed points in momentum space. For the general case of non-trivial Chern

index can be observed in axion insulators of the pnictides family. In
particular, we demonstrate that NpBi can be classified as an axion insulator

been researched and debated for decades. The nature of the early martian
climate is still somewhat mysterious, but evidence for one or more early oceans
implies long-lasting periods of habitability. The primary evidence supporting
early oceans is a set of proposed remnant shorelines circling large fractions
of the planet. The features are thought to be older than 3.6 Ga and possibly as
old as 4 Ga, which would make them some of the oldest large-scale features
still identifiable on the surface of Mars. One question that has not been
thoroughly addressed, however, is whether shorelines this old could survive
modification and destruction processes like impact craters, tectonics,
volcanism, and hydrology in recognizable form. Here we address one of these
processes -- impact cratering -- in detail. We use standard crater counting age
models to generate synthetic, global populations of craters and intersect them
with hypothetical shorelines, tracking portions of the shoreline that are
directly impacted. The oldest shorelines (>= 4 Ga) are at least 70 % destroyed
by direct impacts. Shorelines of any age >3.6 Ga are dissected into relatively
short, discontinuous segments no larger than about 40 km when including the
effects of craters larger than 100 m in radius. When craters smaller than 500 m
in radius are excluded, surviving segment lengths can be as large as ~1000 km.
The oldest shorelines exhibit fractal structure after impacts, presenting as a
discontinuous collection of lines over a range of scales. If the features are
truly shorelines, high-resolution studies should find similar levels of
destruction and discontinuity. However, our results indicate that observing
shorelines as old as 4 Ga, should they exist, is a significant challenge and
raises questions about prior mapping efforts.

properties that are atypical of this group. Moreover, Raman spectra of its
polyaromatic carbonaceous matter does not reflect a structural order consistent
with the metamorphic history of a type 3 chondrite. As a result, it has been
suggested to be an ungrouped C2 chondrite with CO affinities, although it has
not been fully excluded as a CO chondrite. The ambiguity of the meteorite
classification is the motivation behind the present study. We conclude that MIL
07687 is a unique carbonaceous chondrite with possible affinities to CO, CM
and/or some ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites. The difficulty in classifying
this meteorite stems from (i) its heavily weathered nature, which interferes
with the interpretation of our oxygen (O-)isotopic measurements (ii) the
overlap in the petrographic and O-isotopic descriptions of various COs, CMs and
ungrouped meteorites in the Meteoritical society database. Optical and infrared
spectra are consistent with the meteorite unequilibrated nature and indicate
that it is probably mildly aqueously altered. Despite traces of aqueous
alteration having previously been described in MIL 07687, this is the first
time that the presence of hydrated amorphous silicates is reported. In fact,
our results show that its present hydration is beyond that of most CO3s, less
than most CM2s, and comparable to primitive CR2s. Consequently, we support the
meteorite s C2 ung label, although a CO2 or CM2 classification cannot be fully

the design of new drug. As wet experiments are costly and time consuming, the
supervised data for DTA prediction is extremely limited. This seriously hinders
the application of deep learning based methods, which require a large scale of
supervised data. To address this challenge and improve the DTA prediction
accuracy, we propose a framework with several simple yet effective strategies
in this work: (1) a multi-task training strategy, which takes the DTA
prediction and the masked language modeling (MLM) task on the paired
drug-target dataset; (2) a semi-supervised training method to empower the drug
and target representation learning by leveraging large-scale unpaired molecules
and proteins in training, which differs from previous pre-training and
fine-tuning methods that only utilize molecules or proteins in pre-training;
and (3) a cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between drug and
target representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world
benchmark datasets: BindingDB, DAVIS and KIBA. The results show that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performances, e.g., $0.712$ RMSE on BindingDB IC$_{50}$

the Gaia DR2 catalogue with magnitude G<20 to generate Earth microlensing
probability and detection rate maps to other observers. Whilst our Solar system
is a multi-planet system, we show that Earth's photometric microlensing
signature is almost always well approximated by a binary lens assumption. We
then show that the Earth is in fact well-hidden to observers with technology
comparable to our own. Specifically, even if observers are located around every
Gaia DR2 star with G<20, we expect photometric microlensing signatures from the
Earth to be observable on average only tens per year by any of them. In

forecasting the results of joint constraints on the cosmological parameters. By
referring to real observational results, we generate mock data and estimate the

the joint constraints by including all these CSST cosmological probes can
significantly improve the results from current observations by one order of

ensuring the project's completion date by finding the most effective and
efficient mitigation strategy. To fulfill the purpose of this paper, the
Mitigation Controller (MitC) has been developed using an integrative approach
of non-linear optimization techniques, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation,
and preference function modeling. Compared to the conventional way of
mitigating project delays. The developed MitC allows mitigating potential
delays with the least negative consequences on several project criteria, such

demonstrative case study shows the ability of the model to significantly
increase the probability of completing the project in the given target

densities. Investigation of individual flares reveals in nearly all cases the
peak corresponds to the transition from optically thick to thin to synchrotron
emission, but an extended phase of particle acceleration is required in
contrast to simple impulsive injection models. The largest radio flare is
preceded by a phase of optical oscillations and followed one day later by a
smaller but optically thin flare, likely due to ejecta interacting with the
interstellar medium. Comparing the radio emission to contemporaneous X-ray and
optical data, we find that the X-ray and radio measurements are correlated on
all timescales from seconds to one day. Correlation with the optical flux
densities is weak at short timescales, but becomes significant on timescales
greater than a few hours. We evaluate the physical conditions (size, magnetic
field and internal energy) associated with 86 individual radio flares, which in
turn allows us to place a lower limit on the kinetic feedback over the 15 days
of intense activity. If this energy was deposited locally to the source, as

scattering, thus reducing the intra-nanotube carrier mobility. In combination
with electrical measurements of SWCNT network field-effect transistors, these

$\sim$50 per cent in relation to the total helium abundance. We find that
Seyfert 2 nuclei present helium abundance ranging from 0.60 to 2.50 times the

due to excess of helium injected into the Interstellar Medium by the winds of
Wolf Rayet stars. From a regression to zero metallicity, by using Seyfert 2

reflexes of cats. However, designing inertial maneuvering capability into
biomimetic robots, such as biomimetic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is
challenging. Accurately simulating this maneuvering requires numerical
integrators that can ensure both singularity-free integration, and momentum and
energy conservation, in a strongly coupled system - properties unavailable in
existing conventional integrators. In this work, we develop a pair of novel
quaternion variational integrators (QVIs) showing these properties, and
demonstrate their capability for simulating inertial maneuvering in a
biomimetic UAV showing complex multibody-dynamics coupling. Being
quaternion-valued, these QVIs are innately singularity-free; and being
variational, they can show excellent energy and momentum conservation
properties. We explore the effect of variational integration order
(left-rectangle vs. midpoint) on the conservation properties of integrator, and
conclude that, in complex coupled systems in which canonical momenta may be
time-varying, the midpoint integrator is required. The resulting midpoint QVI
is well-suited to the analysis of inertial maneuvering in a biomimetic UAV - a
feature that we demonstrate in simulation - and of other complex dynamical
systems.

off-the-shelf plastic tubes for MR-guided ICH evacuation, improving tool

was able to evacuate an initially 38.36 mL clot in 5 minutes, leaving a

is to provide the quantum theoretical basis of TURs using microphysics models
of linear open quantum systems where it is possible to obtain exact solutions.
In paper [Dong \textit{et al.}, Entropy {\bf 24}, 870 (2022)], we show how TURs
are rooted in the quantum uncertainty principles and the
fluctuation-dissipation inequalities (FDI) under fully nonequilibrium
conditions. In this paper, we shift our attention from the quantum basis to the
thermal manifests. Using a microscopic model for the bath's spectral density in
quantum Brownian motion studies, we formulate a ``thermal'' FDI in the quantum
nonequilibrium dynamics which is valid at high temperatures. This brings the
quantum TURs we derive here to the classical domain and can thus be compared
with some popular forms of TURs. In the thermal-energy-dominated regimes, our
FDIs provide better estimates on the uncertainty of thermodynamic quantities.
Our treatment includes full back-action from the environment onto the system.
As a concrete example of the generalized current, we examine the energy flux or
power entering the Brownian particle and find an exact expression of the
corresponding current-current correlations. In so doing, we show that the
statistical properties of the bath and the causality of the system+bath
interaction both enter into the TURs obeyed by the thermodynamic quantities.

""chemical precompression"" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still
requires relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How
to achieve high-temperature superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50
GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications of superconducting
materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting
ammonium ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the
periodic table reveal 12 elements which can form kinetically stable and
superconducting hydrides at low pressures, where the highest superconducting
transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up to 118.40,
105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer
reveal the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the
H atom continuously gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to
atomic H, facilitating metallization of hydrogen under mild pressure. Our
results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships, one is the H-atom
charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first
ionization energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature.
Besides, ZnN2H8, CdN2H8, and HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient
pressure, and the presence of interstitial electrons suggests that they are
also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78, and 3.05 eV)

well.

modeling ability of transformers, we propose a novel and effective
transformer-based VQA method to tackle these two issues. To better
differentiate temporal variations and thus capture the temporal distortions, we
design a transformer-based Spatial-Temporal Distortion Extraction (STDE)
module. To tackle with temporal quality attention, we propose the
encoder-decoder-like temporal content transformer (TCT). We also introduce the
temporal sampling on features to reduce the input length for the TCT, so as to
improve the learning effectiveness and efficiency of this module. Consisting of
the STDE and the TCT, the proposed Temporal Distortion-Content Transformers for
Video Quality Assessment (DisCoVQA) reaches state-of-the-art performance on
several VQA benchmarks without any extra pre-training datasets and up to 10%
better generalization ability than existing methods. We also conduct extensive
ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of each part in our proposed
model, and provide visualizations to prove that the proposed modules achieve
our intention on modeling these temporal issues. We will publish our codes and
pretrained weights later.

between gas and stars on the scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs;
$\sim$100pc), play a major role in governing galaxy evolution. Measuring the
time-scales of GMC evolution is important to identify and characterise the
specific physical mechanisms that drive this transition. By applying a robust
statistical method to high-resolution CO and narrow-band H$\alpha$ imaging from
the PHANGS survey, we systematically measure the evolutionary timeline from
molecular clouds to exposed young stellar regions on GMC scales, across the
discs of an unprecedented sample of 54 star-forming main-sequence galaxies
(excluding their unresolved centres). We find that clouds live for about
$1{-}3$ GMC turbulence crossing times ($5{-}30$Myr) and are efficiently
dispersed by stellar feedback within $1{-}5$Myr once the star-forming region
becomes partially exposed, resulting in integrated star formation efficiencies
of $1{-}8$%. These ranges reflect physical galaxy-to-galaxy variation. In order
to evaluate whether galactic environment influences GMC evolution, we correlate
our measurements with average properties of the GMCs and their local galactic
environment. We find several strong correlations that can be physically
understood, revealing a quantitative link between galactic-scale environmental
properties and the small-scale GMC evolution. Notably, the measured CO-visible
cloud lifetimes become shorter with decreasing galaxy mass, mostly due to the
increasing presence of CO-dark molecular gas in such environment. Our results
represent a first step towards a comprehensive picture of cloud assembly and
dispersal, which requires further extension and refinement with tracers of the
atomic gas, dust, and deeply-embedded stars.

investigate the behavior of the different models on Winogender. We find that
while larger models outperform smaller ones, the probability that their

world evolves over time and thus the robot's goals may change. One technique to
tackle this problem is goal reasoning, where the agent not only reasons about
its actions, but also about which goals to pursue. While goal reasoning for
single agents has been researched extensively, distributed, multi-agent goal
reasoning comes with additional challenges, especially in a distributed
setting. In such a context, some form of coordination is necessary to allow for
cooperative behavior. Previous goal reasoning approaches share the agent's
world model with the other agents, which already enables basic cooperation.
However, the agent's goals, and thus its intentions, are typically not shared.
  In this paper, we present a method to tackle this limitation. Extending an
existing goal reasoning framework, we propose enabling cooperative behavior
between multiple agents through promises, where an agent may promise that
certain facts will be true at some point in the future. Sharing these promises
allows other agents to not only consider the current state of the world, but
also the intentions of other agents when deciding on which goal to pursue next.
We describe how promises can be incorporated into the goal life cycle, a
commonly used goal refinement mechanism. We then show how promises can be used
when planning for a particular goal by connecting them to timed initial
literals (TILs) from PDDL planning. Finally, we evaluate our prototypical
implementation in a simplified logistics scenario.

and algorithm audits have increased. Many entities have developed framework
guidance to establish a baseline rubric for fairness and accountability.
However, in spite of increased discussions and multiple frameworks, algorithm
and data auditing still remain difficult to execute in practice. Many
open-source auditing tools are available, but users aren't always aware of the
tools, what they are useful for, or how to access them. Model auditing and
evaluation are not frequently emphasized skills in machine learning. There are
also legal reasons for the proactive adoption of these tools that extend beyond
the desire for greater fairness in machine learning. There are positive social
issues of public perception and goodwill that matter in our highly connected
global society. Greater awareness of these tools and the reasons for actively
utilizing them may be helpful to the entire continuum of programmers, data
scientists, engineers, researchers, users and consumers of AI and machine
learning products. It is important for everyone to better understand the input
and output differentials, how they are occurring, and what can be done to
promote FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) in machine-
and deep learning. The ability to freely access open-source auditing tools
removes barriers to fairness assessment at the most basic levels of machine
learning. This paper aims to reinforce the urgent need to actually use these
tools and provides motivations for doing so. The exemplary tools highlighted

  Reinforcement Learning?",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been widely used
in many practical applications, where each agent makes a decision based on its
own observation. Most mainstream methods treat each local observation as an
entirety when modeling the decentralized local utility functions. However, they
ignore the fact that local observation information can be further divided into
several entities, and only part of the entities is helpful to model inference.
Moreover, the importance of different entities may change over time. To improve
the performance of decentralized policies, the attention mechanism is used to
capture features of local information. Nevertheless, existing attention models
rely on dense fully connected graphs and cannot better perceive important
states. To this end, we propose a sparse state based MARL (S2RL) framework,
which utilizes a sparse attention mechanism to discard irrelevant information
in local observations. The local utility functions are estimated through the
self-attention and sparse attention mechanisms separately, then are combined
into a standard joint value function and auxiliary joint value function in the
central critic. We design the S2RL framework as a plug-and-play module, making
it general enough to be applied to various methods. Extensive experiments on
StarCraft II show that S2RL can significantly improve the performance of many
state-of-the-art methods.

can be predicted in advance to guide agencies and residents to respond to
changes in traffic patterns appropriately. However, existing works on traffic
forecasting mainly relied on historical traffic patterns confining to
short-term prediction, under 1 hour, for instance. To better manage future
roadway capacity and accommodate social and human impacts, it is crucial to
propose a flexible and comprehensive framework to predict physical-aware
long-term traffic conditions for public users and transportation agencies. In
this paper, the gap of robust long-term traffic forecasting was bridged by
taking social media features into consideration. A correlation study and a
linear regression model were first implemented to evaluate the significance of
the correlation between two time-series data, traffic intensity and Twitter
data intensity. Two time-series data were then fed into our proposed
social-aware framework, Traffic-Twitter Transformer, which integrated Nature
Language representations into time-series records for long-term traffic
prediction. Experimental results in the Great Seattle Area showed that our
proposed model outperformed baseline models in all evaluation matrices. This
NLP-joined social-aware framework can become a valuable implement of
network-wide traffic prediction and management for traffic agencies.

established for Class I Bragg resonances when linear long waves are reflected
by a finite periodic array of artificial bars, including rectangular,
parabolic, rectified cosinoidal, isosceles trapezoidal, and isosceles
triangular bars. The modified Bragg's law is described by a function of several
parameters such as the bar shape, dimensionless bar height with respect to the
global water depth, and dimensionless bar width with respect to the incident
wavelength. It is found that Bragg's law is just a limiting case of the
modified Bragg's law as the bar height or width approaches zero. This fact
tells us that the Bragg's law that accurately describes Bragg resonances in
X-ray crystallography cannot be simply applied to Bragg resonances of linear
long water waves excited by any finite periodic array of artificial bars,
because the height and width of any artificial bar cannot be zero. Based on the
modified Bragg's law, the phenomenon of phase downshifting can be well
explained and accurately predicted. It is revealed that the phase downshifting
becomes more significant with increasing the cross-sectional area of artificial
bars.

representative research topics for mimicking human perceptual mechanisms, is
currently in its infancy, and none of the existing survey papers have touched
on it, especially from the perspective of saliency detection. Thus, the
ultimate goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review to bridge the gap
between audio-visual fusion and saliency detection. In addition, as another
highlight of this review, we have provided a deep insight into key factors

claim that the audio-visual consistency degree (AVC) -- a long-overlooked

visual counterpart when performing saliency detection. Moreover, in order to
make the AVC issue more practical and valuable for future followers, we have
newly equipped almost all existing publicly available AVSD datasets with

capability of extracting complementary information from rs-fMRI and DTI. By
capturing the deep complementary information between structural features and

show that the proposed model can not only improve classification performance

proposed generative models usually require manually adjusted annotations (e.g.,
segmentation masks) or need pre-labeling. However, studies have found that
these pre-labeling based methods can induce hallucinating artifacts, which
might mislead the downstream clinical tasks, while manual adjustment could be
onerous and subjective. To avoid manual adjustment and pre-labeling, we propose
a novel controllable and simultaneous synthesizer (dubbed CS$^2$) in this study
to generate both realistic images and corresponding annotations at the same

generation (5G) and beyond 5G wireless communications. A novel delay-bounded
wireless media access control (MAC) protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP) was established to strictly ensure the
upper boundary of communication delay. CSMA/AP enables collision-free and
delay-bounded communications with a simple arbitration mechanism exploiting the
precise time synchronization achieved by Wireless Two-Way Interferometry
(Wi-Wi). Experimental demonstration and proving the feasibility in wireless
environments are among the most critical steps before any further discussion of
CSMA/AP and extension to various applications can take in place. In this work
described in this paper, we experimentally demonstrated the fundamental
principles of CSMA/AP by constructing a star-topology wireless network using
software-defined radio terminals combined with precise time synchronization
devices. We show that CSMA/AP was successfully operated, even with dynamic
changes of the spatial position of the terminal or the capability to
accommodate mobility, thanks to the real-time adaption to the dynamically
changing environment by Wi-Wi. We also experimentally confirmed that the
proposed CSMA/AP principle cannot be executed without Wi-Wi, which validates
the importance of precise time synchronization. This study paves the way toward
realizing delay-bounded wireless communications for future low-latency and
highly reliable critical applications.

a game-theoretic learning perspective. By exploring and analyzing intelligent
anti-jamming communication, we present the characteristics of jammers and the
requirements of an intelligent anti-jamming approach. Such approach is required
of self-sensing, self-decision making, self-coordination, self-evaluation, and
learning ability. Then, a game-theoretic learning anti-jamming (GTLAJ) paradigm
is proposed, and its framework and challenges of GTLAJ are introduced.
Moreover, through three cases, i.e., Stackelberg anti-jamming game, Markov
anti-jamming game and hypergraph-based anti-jamming game, different
anti-jamming game models and applications are discussed, and some future
directions are presented.

  Privacy- and Authenticity-Enhancing Technologies","16 pages, 5 tables",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Harmful repercussions from sharing sensitive or personal data can hamper
institutions' willingness to engage in data exchange. Thus, institutions
consider Authenticity Enhancing Technologies (AETs) and Privacy-Enhancing
Technologies (PETs) to engage in Sovereign Data Exchange (SDE), i.e., sharing
data with third parties without compromising their own or their users' data
sovereignty. However, these technologies are often technically complex, which
impedes their adoption. To support practitioners select PETs and AETs for SDE
use cases and highlight SDE challenges researchers and practitioners should
address, this study empirically constructs a challenge-oriented technology
mapping. First, we compile challenges of SDE by conducting a systematic
literature review and expert interviews. Second, we map PETs and AETs to the
SDE challenges and identify which technologies can mitigate which challenges.
We validate the mapping through investigator triangulation. Although the most
critical challenge concerns data usage and access control, we find that the
majority of PETs and AETs focus on data processing issues.

inorganic semiconductors are brittle materials that tend to fracture when
plastically deformed. Manufacturing thin sheets and foils of inorganic
semiconductors is therefore a bottleneck problem, severely restricting their
use in flexible electronics applications. It was recently reported that a few
single-crystalline two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors, such as
InSe, are deformable under compressive stress. Here we demonstrate that
intralayer fracture toughness can be tailored via compositional design to make
inorganic semiconductors processable by cold rolling. We report systematic ab
initio calculations covering a range of van der Waals semiconductors homologous
to InSe, leading to material-property maps that forecast trends in both the
susceptibility to interlayer slip and the intralayer fracture toughness against
cracking. GaSe has been predicted, and experimentally confirmed, to be
practically amenable to being rolled to large (three quarters) thickness
reduction and length extension by a factor of three. Our findings open a new
realm of possibility for alloy selection and design towards processing-friendly
group-III chalcogenides for flexible electronic and thermoelectric
applications.

displacement profiles measured by DIC were used to derive $\Delta_{\rm

crack face friction, by an inverse method. Friction corrected crack growth
kinetics were obtained for mode II crack growth in both steels.

electrospinning method and the influence of electrospinning parameters such as
PVDF concentration, DMF:Acetone ratio on the formation of different phases
({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}) and desired morphology were investigated. A
detail analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrometer data by deconvoluting the peaks were carried out for
assigning and accurately identifying the peaks associated to a particular PVDF
phase. SEM micrographs further helped in understanding the mechanism of desired
\b{eta}-phase as well as in obtaining a condition for bead-free nanofibers.
Interestingly, the mechanism of formation of phases are found mostly governed
by the balance between surface tension and viscosity which is controlled by
PVDF concentration and acetone content in the solution. A PVDF concentration of
20% (w/v) and DMF:Acetone ratio 1:1 was found suitable for maximum
\b{eta}-phase in a completely bead-free nanofibers. The methodology and
understanding of underlying mechanism of desired phase and morphology suggest a
guideline for optimization of \b{eta}-phase and bead-free fibers in PVDF-based
nanocomposite as well.

extended to ''textual factors'': the network nodes are defined as ''concepts'';
the links are ''community connexions''. Thereafter, the text network properties
are investigated along modern statistical physics approaches of networks,
thereby relating network topology and algebraic properties, to literary texts
contents. As a practical illustration, the first chapter of the Genesis in the
Bible is mapped into a 10 node network, as in the Kabbalah approach, mentioning
God ($\equiv Elohim$). The characteristics of the network are studied starting
from its adjacency matrix, and the corresponding Laplacian matrix. Triplets of
nodes are particularly examined in order to emphasize the ''textual (community)
connexions'' of each agent ""emanation"", through the so called clustering
coefficients and the overlap index, whence measuring the ''semantic flow''
between the different nodes. It is concluded that this graph is a small-world
network, weakly dis-assortative, because its average local clustering
coefficient is significantly higher than a random graph constructed on the same
vertex set.

topological property of 1D systems. It is claimed that there is fractional
charge at the boundary of the nontrivial phase while none at that of trivial
phase. However, this conclusion is in direct contradiction to the modern theory
of polarization(MTP). We solve this paradox by showing that the polarization of
SSH model depends only on the distribution of the positive charges and is
irrelevant to the Zak phase defined in previous works. Thus the distribution of
positive charges alone determines whether the SSH chain is topological or not.
Similarly, we show the polarization defined by Berry connection can not be used
to characterize topological property of a 2D generalization of SSH model.
