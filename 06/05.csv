intelligence. Geometric pattern recognition is used in many intelligence tests,
including Dehaene's odd-one-out test of Core Geometry (CG)) based on intuitive
geometrical concepts (Dehaene et al., 2006). Earlier work has developed a
symmetry-based cognitive model of Dehaene's test and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of humans. In this work, we further investigate the role of
symmetry in geometrical intuition and build a cognitive model for the
2-Alternative Forced Choice (2-AFC) variation of the CG test (Marupudi & Varma
2021). In contrast to Dehaene's test, 2-AFC leaves almost no space for
cognitive models based on generalization over multiple examples. Our
symmetry-based model achieves an accuracy comparable to the human average on
the 2-AFC test and appears to capture an essential part of intuitive geometry.

Single-crystalline epitaxial thin films of NiCo2O4 present a model system for

intrinsic Berry phase and impurity scattering. The fundamental understanding of

computations by first performing simulations using an approximate Hamiltonian
which is computationally more efficient than the accurate one and then using
various methods to correct for the resulting error. Those rely on recalculating
the accurate energies of a random subset of configurations obtained using the

mechanisms, especially the influences of input conditions on its performances,
remain unclear. Here, we report a new self-organized regime for the multimode
beam propagation in a graded-index multimode fiber: when the input laser has a
dominant mode in which most of the laser energy is concentrated, the beam
profile can be maintaining in a well-defined structure similar to the input
dominant mode in nonlinear regime, while it will evolve to an irregular pattern
in linear regime. The existence and universality of this nonlinear beam
self-maintaining effect have been verified by the experimental and numerical

real-world reinforcement learning demands consideration of a simple,
computationally-bounded agent interacting with an overwhelmingly complex

\pi^-$, $B^\pm \to K^\pm \pi^+ \pi^-$, $B^\pm \to K^\pm K^+ K^-$ and $B^\pm \to

not require full amplitude analyses, and are performed using proton-proton
collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by LHCb between

the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ $\textit{P}$-wave, in the region dominated by the $B^\pm \to
\rho(770)^0 K^\pm$ decay, a $CP$ asymmetry of $\mbox{$A_{CP}$ = +0.150 $\pm$
0.019 $\pm$ 0.011}$ is measured, where the first uncertainty is statistical and
the second is systematic. This is the first observation of $CP$ violation in
this process. For the other four decay channels, in regions dominated by the
$B^\pm \to \rho(770)^0 \pi^\pm$, $B^\pm \to \overset{(-)}{K^*}(892)^0 \pi^\pm$,
$B^\pm \to \overset{(-)}{K^*}(892)^0 K^\pm$ and $B^\pm \to \phi(1020) K^\pm$
decays, $CP$ asymmetries in the $\textit{P}$-wave compatible with zero are
measured.

value over a distribution of test scenarios. Unfortunately, this evaluation
approach provides limited evidence for post-deployment generalization beyond
the test distribution. In this paper, we address this limitation by extending
the recent CheckList testing methodology from natural language processing to
planning-based RL. Specifically, we consider testing RL agents that make
decisions via online tree search using a learned transition model and value
function. The key idea is to improve the assessment of future performance via a
CheckList approach for exploring and assessing the agent's inferences during
tree search. The approach provides the user with an interface and general
query-rule mechanism for identifying potential inference flaws and validating
expected inference invariances. We present a user study involving knowledgeable
AI researchers using the approach to evaluate an agent trained to play a
complex real-time strategy game. The results show the approach is effective in
allowing users to identify previously-unknown flaws in the agent's reasoning.
In addition, our analysis provides insight into how AI experts use this type of
testing approach, which may help improve future instantiations.

Riemannian and optimal Euclidean space convex-concave algorithms is necessary.
We answer this question in the negative-we prove that the Riemannian corrected
extragradient (RCEG) method achieves last-iterate convergence at a linear rate
in the geodesically strongly-convex-concave case, matching the Euclidean
result. Our results also extend to the stochastic or non-smooth case where RCEG
and Riemanian gradient ascent descent (RGDA) achieve near-optimal convergence
rates up to factors depending on curvature of the manifold.

only one hidden-layer, the 3-layer NTK involves interactions between two

test error descends faster with respect to the number of neurons in the second

first hidden-layer (the one closer to the input). We also show that the

guides the decoder to generate speech in sync with input lip movements. The
predictive posterior thus gives us the generated speech in speaker speaking
style. We have trained our model on the Grid and Lip2Wav Chemistry lecture

movement in an unconstrained natural setting. Extensive evaluation using
various qualitative and quantitative metrics with human evaluation also shows
that our method outperforms the Lip2Wav Chemistry dataset(large vocabulary in

Further, under the scrambling assumption, we recover the usual firewall result

the need for any complexity or computational assumptions. For a black hole that

ultra-high energies via accretion shocks or embedded CR acceleration sites. CRs
with energies below the Hillas condition will be confined within the cluster
and will eventually interact with the intracluster medium (ICM) gas to produce
secondary neutrinos and $\gamma$ rays. Using 9.5 years of muon-neutrino track
events from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we report the results of a
stacking analysis of 1094 galaxy clusters, with masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$
\(\textup{M}_\odot\) and redshifts between 0.01 and $\sim$1, detected by the
{\it Planck} mission via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. We find no evidence
for significant neutrino emission and report upper limits on the cumulative
unresolved neutrino flux from massive galaxy clusters after accounting for the
completeness of the catalog up to a redshift of 2, assuming three different
weighting scenarios for the stacking and three different power-law spectra.
Weighting the sources according to mass and distance, we set upper limits at
$90\%$ confidence level that constrain the flux of neutrinos from massive
galaxy clusters ($\gtrsim 10^{14}$ \(\textup{M}_\odot\)) to be no more than
$4.6\%$ of the diffuse IceCube observations at 100~TeV, assuming an unbroken

for a sustainable future. However, since there are disproportionately fewer
charging stations than EVs, range anxiety plays a major role in the rise in the
number of queries made along the journeys to find an available charging
station. On the other hand, the use of personal data in various types of
analytics is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Hence, the risks of privacy
violation are also surging. Geo-indistinguishability is one of the standards
for formalising location privacy as a generalisation of the local differential
privacy. However, the noise has to be carefully calibrated considering the
implications of potential utility-loss. In this paper, we introduce approximate
geo-indistinguishability (AGeoI) which allows the EVs to obfuscate the
individual query-locations while ensuring that they remain within their
preferred area of interest. It is vital because journeys are often sensitive to
a sharp drop in QoS, which has a high cost for the extra distance to be
covered. We apply AGeoI and dummy data generation to protect the privacy of EVs
during their journeys and preserve the QoS. Analytical insights and experiments
are used to demonstrate that a very high percentage of EVs get privacy for free
and that the utility-loss caused by the privacy-gain is minuscule. Using the
iterative Bayesian update, our method allows for a private and highly accurate
prediction of charging station occupancy without disclosing query locations and
vehicle trajectories, which is vital in unprecedented traffic congestion
scenarios and efficient route-planning.

SPAD operates in the Geiger mode and can act as a photon counting receiver
obviating the need for a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). Although a SPAD
receiver can provide higher sensitivity compared to the traditional linear
photodetectors, it suffers from the dead-time-induced nonlinearity. To improve
the data rates of SPAD-based OWC systems, optical orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) can be employed. This paper provides a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of the SPAD-based OWC systems using OFDM signalling
considering the effects of signal clipping, SPAD nonlinearity, and
signal-dependent shot noise. An equivalent additive Gaussian noise channel
model is proposed to describe the performance of the SPAD-based OFDM system.
The statistics of the proposed channel model and the analytical expressions of
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) are derived in closed

since the causal query of interest may not require a fully-specified causal

minimum amount of heat that must be dissipated to erase one logical bit of
information through a quasi-statically slow protocol. For finite time
information erasure, the thermodynamic costs depend on the specific physical
realization of the logical memory and how the information is erased. Here we
treat the problem within the paradigm of a Brownian particle in a symmetric
double-well potential. The two minima represent the two values of a logical
bit, 0 and 1, and the particle's position is the current state of the memory.
The erasure protocol is realized by applying an external time-dependent tilting
force. We derive analytical tools to evaluate the work required to erase a
classical bit of information in finite time via an arbitrary continuous erasure
protocol, which is a relevant setting for practical applications. Importantly,
our method is not restricted to the average work, but instead gives access to
the full work distribution arising from many independent realizations of the
erasure process. Using the common example of an erasure protocol that changes
linearly with time acting on a double-parabolic potential, we explicitly
calculate all relevant quantities and verify them numerically.

synthetic data and comparing their underlying generative processes has become
an imperative task for various reasons, including fighting visual
misinformation and source attribution. Existing methods often approximate the
distance between the models via their sample distributions. In this paper, we
approach the problem of fingerprinting generative models by learning
representations that encode the residual artifacts left by the generative
models as unique signals that identify the source models. We consider these
unique traces (a.k.a. ""artificial fingerprints"") as representations of
generative models, and demonstrate their usefulness in both the discriminative
task of source attribution and the unsupervised task of defining a similarity
between the underlying models. We first extend the existing studies on
fingerprints of GANs to four representative classes of generative models (VAEs,
Flows, GANs and score-based models), and demonstrate their existence and
attributability. We then improve the stability and attributability of the
fingerprints by proposing a new learning method based on set-encoding and
contrastive training. Our set-encoder, unlike existing methods that operate on
individual images, learns fingerprints from a \textit{set} of images. We
demonstrate improvements in the stability and attributability through
comparisons to state-of-the-art fingerprint methods and ablation studies.
Further, our method employs contrastive training to learn an implicit

they call the Bayes blind spot of p) is large with respect to three common
measures of size, namely, having cardinality c, (normalized) Lebesgue measure
1, and Baire second category with respect to a natural topology. In the present
paper, we establish analogous results for probability measures defined on any
infinite sigma algebra of subsets of a denumerably infinite set. However, we
have needed to employ distinctly different approaches to determine the
cardinality, and especially, the topological and measure-theoretic sizes of the
Bayes blind spot in the infinite case. Interestingly, all of the results that

Bayesian learning itself might be just as culpable as the limitations imposed

by removing degradations, such as noise, blur, and resolution degradation. Deep
learning (DL) has recently been applied to image restoration and enhancement.
Due to its ill-posed property, plenty of works have explored priors to
facilitate training deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the importance of
priors has not been systematically studied and analyzed by far in the research
community. Therefore, this paper serves as the first study that provides a
comprehensive overview of recent advancements of priors for deep image
restoration and enhancement. Our work covers five primary contents: (1) A
theoretical analysis of priors for deep image restoration and enhancement; (2)
A hierarchical and structural taxonomy of priors commonly used in the DL-based
methods; (3) An insightful discussion on each prior regarding its principle,
potential, and applications; (4) A summary of crucial problems by highlighting
the potential future directions to spark more research in the community; (5) An

PLATO's high-priority P1 sample (mostly F5-K7 dwarfs and sub-dwarfs). Our study
includes light curves generated from synchronous observations of 6, 12, 18, and
24 of PLATO's 12 cm aperture cameras over both 2 yr and 3 yr of continuous

post-detrending transit detection is performed with the Transit Least Squares

number of stars in the P1 sample and with modern estimates of the exoplanet
occurrence rates and predict the detection of planets with 0.5 R_E <= R_p <=
1.5 R_E in the HZs around F5-K7 dwarf stars. For the (2 yr + 2 yr)
long-duration observation phase strategy we predict 11-34 detections, for the
(3 yr + 1 yr) strategy we predict 8-25 discoveries. Our study of the effects of
stellar variability on shallow transits of Earth-like planets illustrates that
our estimates of PLATO's planet yield, which we derive using a photometrically

detection of about a dozen Earth-sized planets in the HZs around solar-type
stars will mean a major contribution to this yet poorly sampled part of the
exoplanet parameter space with Earth-like planets.

refines its estimates or prior beliefs about the true underlying model of the
environment. Recent empirical successes in model-based reinforcement learning
with function approximation, however, eschew the true model in favor of a
surrogate that, while ignoring various facets of the environment, still
facilitates effective planning over behaviors. Recently formalized as the value
equivalence principle, this algorithmic technique is perhaps unavoidable as
real-world reinforcement learning demands consideration of a simple,
computationally-bounded agent interacting with an overwhelmingly complex
environment, whose underlying dynamics likely exceed the agent's capacity for
representation. In this work, we consider the scenario where agent limitations
may entirely preclude identifying an exactly value-equivalent model,
immediately giving rise to a trade-off between identifying a model that is
simple enough to learn while only incurring bounded sub-optimality. To address
this problem, we introduce an algorithm that, using rate-distortion theory,
iteratively computes an approximately-value-equivalent, lossy compression of
the environment which an agent may feasibly target in lieu of the true model.
We prove an information-theoretic, Bayesian regret bound for our algorithm that
holds for any finite-horizon, episodic sequential decision-making problem.
Crucially, our regret bound can be expressed in one of two possible forms,
providing a performance guarantee for finding either the simplest model that
achieves a desired sub-optimality gap or, alternatively, the best model given a
limit on agent capacity.

federated learning faces several challenges related to its decentralized
nature. In this work, we develop a novel algorithmic procedure with theoretical
speedup guarantees that simultaneously handles two of these hurdles, namely (i)
data heterogeneity, i.e., data distributions can vary substantially across

personalized solution for each client. Furthermore, our method mitigates the
effects of stragglers by adaptively selecting clients based on their
computational characteristics and statistical significance, thus achieving, for

phase in two-dimensional (2D) systems, namely piezoelectric quantum spin Hall
insulator (PQSHI), is intriguing for exploring novel topological states toward
the development of high-speed and dissipationless electronic devices. In this
work, we predict a PQSHI Janus monolayer VCClBr constructed from
$\mathrm{VCCl_2}$, which is dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. In
the absence of spin orbital coupling (SOC), VCClBr is a narrow gap
semiconductor with gap value of 57 meV, which is different from Dirac semimetal
$\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. The gap of VCClBr is due to built-in electric field caused
by asymmetrical upper and lower atomic layers, which is further confirmed by
external-electric-field induced gap in $\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. When including SOC,
the gap of VCClBr is improved to 76 meV, which is larger than the thermal
energy of room temperature (25 meV). The VCClBr is a 2D topological insulator
(TI), which is confirmed by $Z_2$ topological invariant and nontrivial
one-dimensional edge states. It is proved that the nontrivial topological
properties of VCClBr are robust against strain (biaxial and uniaxial cases) and
external electric field. Due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, only
out-of-plane piezoelectric response can be observed, when biaxial or uniaxial
in-plane strain is applied. The predicted piezoelectric strain coefficients
$d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are -0.425 pm/V and -0.219 pm/V, which are higher than or
compared with ones of many 2D materials. Finally, another two Janus monolayer

PQSHIs. Moreover, their $d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are higher than ones of VCClBr,

contrastive multimodal models are shown to be highly effective at aligning
entities in images/videos and text, e.g., CLIP; text contrastive models are
extensively studied recently for their strong ability of producing
discriminative sentence embeddings, e.g., SimCSE. However, there is not a clear
way to quickly adapt these two lines to multi-channel video-language retrieval
with limited data and resources. In this paper, we identify a principled model
design space with two axes: how to represent videos and how to fuse video and
text information. Based on categorization of recent methods, we investigate the
options of representing videos using continuous feature vectors or discrete
text tokens; for the fusion method, we explore the use of a multimodal
transformer or a pretrained contrastive text model. We extensively evaluate the
four combinations on five video-language datasets. We surprisingly find that
discrete text tokens coupled with a pretrained contrastive text model yields
the best performance, which can even outperform state-of-the-art on the iVQA
and How2QA datasets without additional training on millions of video-text data.
Further analysis shows that this is because representing videos as text tokens
captures the key visual information and text tokens are naturally aligned with
text models that are strong retrievers after the contrastive pretraining
process. All the empirical analysis establishes a solid foundation for future
research on affordable and upgradable multimodal intelligence.

wind driving force. A high-fidelity two-phase model is developed to simulate
highly turbulent wind-wave fields. Instead of using uniform wind, inherent wind
turbulences are prescribed at the inlet boundary using the turbulent spot

flow characteristics with experimental data. With the validated model, a
numerical case study is conducted on a 10^2 m scale under extreme wind and wave

considered, the resultant turbulence is strengthened and is the summation of
the inherent turbulence and the wave-induced turbulence. In addition, the wave
coherent velocities and shelter effect are enhanced because of the presence of
wind inherent turbulence. The regions of intense turbulence depend on the
relative speed between wind velocity and wave phase speed. Higher wind
velocities induce greater turbulence intensities, which can be increased by up

gradually from a set of initialized points by regressing offsets via cascaded

feature importance that is computationally efficient and statistically
powerful. Our approach is fast as we avoid model refitting by leveraging a form
of random observation and feature subsampling called minipatch ensembles; this
approach also improves statistical power by avoiding data splitting. Our
framework can be applied on tabular data and with any machine learning
algorithm, together with minipatch ensembles, for regression and classification
tasks. Despite the dependencies induced by using minipatch ensembles, we show
that our approach provides asymptotic coverage for the feature importance score
of any model under mild assumptions. Finally, our same procedure can also be
leveraged to provide valid confidence intervals for predictions, hence
providing fast, simultaneous quantification of the uncertainty of both
predictions and feature importance. We validate our intervals on a series of
synthetic and real data examples, including non-linear settings, showing that
our approach detects the correct important features and exhibits many
computational and statistical advantages over existing methods.

"2206.02089","Tian Yu","Tian Yu, J. A. Hanna","Avoiding localization instabilities in rotary pleating",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rotary pleating is a widely used process for making filters out of nonwoven
fabric sheets. This involves indirect elastic-plastic bending of pre-weakened
creases by continuously injecting material into an accordion-shaped pack. This
step can fail through a localization instability that creates a kink in a pleat
facet instead of in the desired crease location. In the present work, we
consider the effects of geometric and material parameters on the rotary
pleating process. We formulate the process as a multi-point variable-arc-length
boundary value problem for planar inextensible rods, with hinge connections.
Both the facets (rods) and creases (hinges) obey nonlinear moment-curvature or
moment-angle constitutive laws. Some unexpected aspects of the sleeve boundary
condition at the point of material injection, common to many continuous sheet
processes, are noted. The process, modeled as quasistatic, features multiple
equilibria which we explore by numerical continuation. The presence of,
presumably stable, kinked equilibria is taken as a conservative sign of
potential pleating failure. Failure may also occur due to localization at the
injection point. We may thus obtain ""pleatability surfaces"" that separate the
parameter space into regions where mechanical pleating will succeed or fail.
Successful pleating depends primarily on the distance between the injection
point and the pleated pack. Other factors, such as the crease stiffness and
strength relative to that of the facets, also have an influence. Our approach
can be adapted to study other pleating and forming processes, the deployment
and collapse of folded structures, or multi-stability in compliant structures.

of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) has been widely discussed. However, as CMEs
may have expansion speeds comparable to their propagation speeds in the corona,
it is not clear whether and how reconnection contributes to the true
acceleration and expansion separately. To address this question, we analyze the
dynamics of a moderately fast CME on 2013 February 27, associated with a
continuous acceleration of its front into the high corona, even though its
speed had reached $\sim$700~km~s$^{-1}$ and larger than the solar wind speed.
The apparent CME acceleration is found to be due to the CME expansion in the
radial direction. The CME true acceleration, i.e., the acceleration of its
center, is then estimated by taking into account the expected deceleration
caused by the solar wind drag force acting on a fast CME. It is found that the
true acceleration and the radial expansion have similar magnitudes. We find
that magnetic reconnection occurs after the CME eruption and continues during
the CME propagation in the high corona, which contributes to the CME dynamic
evolution. Comparison between the apparent acceleration related to the
expansion and the true acceleration that compensates the drag shows that, for
this case, magnetic reconnection contributes almost equally to the CME
expansion and to the CME acceleration. The consequences of these measurements
for the evolution of CMEs as they transit from the corona to the heliosphere
are discussed.

WANBB enters the line minimization process with a trial stepsize capturing the
local curvature of the energy surface. The exit is controlled by an
unrestrictive criterion that tends to accept early trials. These two
ingredients streamline the line minimization process in WANBB. The numerical
simulations on nearly 80 systems with good universality demonstrate the
considerable compression of WANBB on the cost for the unaccepted trials
compared with conjugate gradient methods. We also observe across the board
significant and universal speedups as well as the superior robustness of WANBB
over several widely used methods. The latter point is theoretically
established. The implementation of WANBB is pretty simple, in that no a priori

the reward in AIL is $differentiable$ but current model-free RL algorithms do
not make use of this property to train a policy. The reward is AIL is also

property of the shaped AIL reward function and formulate a class of Actor
Residual Critic (ARC) RL algorithms. ARC algorithms draw a parallel to the
standard Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in RL literature and uses a residual
critic, $C$ function (instead of the standard $Q$ function) to approximate only
the discounted future return (excluding the immediate reward). ARC algorithms
have similar convergence properties as the standard AC algorithms with the
additional advantage that the gradient through the immediate reward is exact.
For the discrete (tabular) case with finite states, actions, and known
dynamics, we prove that policy iteration with $C$ function converges to an
optimal policy. In the continuous case with function approximation and unknown

the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. Recently, it has been reported
that the curved spacetime effect or specifically gravitational time dilation
effect on the EoS of dense matter leads to a significant increase of the
maximum mass limit of neutron stars [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{104}, 123005 (2021)

that to study the hydrostatic equilibrium of dense matter within the framework
of general relativity and relativistic fluid dynamics, the grand canonical EoS
of dense matter, $p(T,\mu)$, should be the same as that computed in flat
spacetime, otherwise it is not consistent with local thermodynamic relations
and energy-momentum conservation of the fluid. The gravitation influences the
pressure $p$ only through enhancing the temperature $T$ and the chemical
potential $\mu$, known as Tolman's law and Klein's law. We rewrite the TOV
equation as an alternative version so that the grand canonical EoS computed by

learning applications, particularly for tabular and time-series data as their
use cases often involve high-stakes decision making. Towards this goal, we
introduce a novel interpretable modeling framework, Interpretable Mixture of
Experts (IME), that yields high accuracy, comparable to `black-box' Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) in many cases, along with useful interpretability capabilities.
IME consists of an assignment module and a mixture of experts, with each sample
being assigned to a single expert for prediction. We introduce multiple options
for IME based on the assignment and experts being interpretable. When the
experts are chosen to be interpretable such as linear models, IME yields an
inherently-interpretable architecture where the explanations produced by IME
are the exact descriptions of how the prediction is computed. In addition to
constituting a standalone inherently-interpretable architecture, IME has the
premise of being integrated with existing DNNs to offer interpretability to a
subset of samples while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs. Through extensive
experiments on 15 tabular and time-series datasets, IME is demonstrated to be
more accurate than single interpretable models and perform comparably with
existing state-of-the-art DNNs in accuracy. On most datasets, IME even
outperforms DNNs, while providing faithful explanations. Lastly, IME's
explanations are compared to commonly-used post-hoc explanations methods
through a user study -- participants are able to better predict the model
behavior when given IME explanations, while finding IME's explanations more
faithful and trustworthy.

the advancement of inter-symbol interference (ISI) mitigation techniques, from
equalization in 2G, spread spectrum and RAKE receiver in 3G, to OFDM in 4G and
5G. Looking forward towards 6G, by exploiting the extremely large spatial
dimension brought by large antenna arrays and multi-path sparsity of millimeter
wave (mmWave)/Terahertz channels, we propose a novel ISI mitigation technique,
termed delay alignment modulation (DAM). The key ideas of DAM are path delay
pre-compensation and path-based beamforming, i.e., by deliberately introducing
symbol delays to compensate respective multi-path delays of the channel, so
that with appropriate per-path-based beamforming, the multi-path signal
components will arrive at the receiver simultaneously and constructively. To
gain some insights, we first show that perfect delay alignment can be achieved
to transform the time-dispersive channel to time non-dispersive channel,
without sophisticated channel equalization or multi-carrier processing. This
thus enables efficient equalization-free single-carrier transmission or CP-free
OFDM transmission. When perfect DAM is infeasible or undesirable, we propose
the generic DAM technique to significantly reduce the channel delay spread.
This thus provides a new DoF to combat channel time dispersion for more
efficient single- or multi-carrier signal transmissions. As an illustration, we
propose the novel DAM-OFDM technique, which may save the CP overhead or
mitigate the PAPR and CFO issues suffered by conventional OFDM. We show that
DAM-OFDM involves joint frequency-domain and time-domain beamforming
optimization, for which a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results
show that the proposed DAM-OFDM achieves significant performance gains over the
conventional OFDM, in terms of spectral efficiency, BER and PAPR.

specific features that can significantly increase the probability of this

making their proper characterization a crucial task. Deep Learning approaches
have become extensively used for tasks such as jet fire characterization;

saving the memory footprint, BiGeaR further develops solid online inference
acceleration with bitwise operations, providing alternative flexibility for the
realistic deployment. The empirical results over five large real-world

  fold-caustic diffraction model","20 pages, 7 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  From numerical simulations of the Einstein equations, and also from
gravitational wave observations, the gravitational wave signal from a binary
black hole merger is seen to be simple and to possess certain universal
features. The simplicity is somewhat surprising given that non-linearities of
general relativity are thought to play an important role at the merger. The
universal features include an increasing amplitude as we approach the merger,
where transition from an oscillatory to a damped regime occurs in a pattern
apparently oblivious to the initial conditions. We propose an Airy-function
pattern to model the binary black hole (BBH) merger waveform, focusing on
accounting for its simplicity and universality. We postulate that the relevant
universal features are controlled by a physical mechanism involving: i) a
caustic phenomenon in a basic `geometric optics' approximation and, ii) a
diffraction over the caustic regularizing its divergence. Universality of
caustics and their diffraction patterns account for the observed universal
features, as in optical phenomena such as rainbows. This postulate, if true,
allows us to borrow mathematical techniques from Singularity (Catastrophe)
Theory, in particular Arnol'd-Thom's theorem, and to understand binary mergers
in terms of fold caustics. The diffraction pattern corresponding to the
fold-caustic is given in terms of the Airy function, which leads (under a
`uniform approximation') to the waveform model written in terms of a
parameterized Airy function. The post-merger phase does not share the same
features of simplicity and universality, and must be added separately.
Nevertheless, our proposal allows a smooth matching of the inspiral and
post-merger signals by using the known asymptotics of the Airy function.

regularization, and termed as ShapePU. To leverage unlabeled pixels via PU
learning, we first present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to
estimate the proportion of each class in the unlabeled pixels. Given the
estimated ratios, we then introduce the marginal probability maximization to
identify the classes of unlabeled pixels. To exploit shape knowledge, we apply
cutout operations to training images, and penalize the inconsistent
segmentation results. Evaluated on two open datasets, i.e, ACDC and MSCMRseg,
our scribble-supervised ShapePU surpassed the fully supervised approach

$R^2$ correction and DE, so is the universal feature for the class of

Adversarial training (AT) is found to be the most promising approach against

to aggregate the local models updates. The experiments show that FedWAvg

two of the main problems are the long charging time and the range anxiety of EV
drivers. In this research, we investigate the deployment of dynamic charging
systems, i.e., electrified roads that wirelessly charge EVs on the go, with a
view to accelerating EVs adoption rate. We propose a traffic-based deployment
strategy, statistically quantify its impact, and apply the strategy to two case

our analytical estimates not only closely match the real data, but they also
suggest that dynamic charging considerably extends the driving range of popular
EV models in urban mobility. For example, when only 5% of the existing roads in
New York City are equipped with this technology, an EV model such as the Nissan
Leaf will approximately maintain its battery level without stopping to
recharge. If the percentage of charging roads is increased to 10%, then the
Leaf will gain nearly 10% of its battery after every 40 kilometers of driving.
Our framework provides a solution to public and private organizations that

into two extreme cases, i.e., they either restore all frames in parallel or
restore the video frame by frame in a recurrent way, which would result in
different merits and drawbacks. Typically, the former has the advantage of
temporal information fusion. However, it suffers from large model size and
intensive memory consumption; the latter has a relatively small model size as
it shares parameters across frames; however, it lacks long-range dependency
modeling ability and parallelizability. In this paper, we attempt to integrate
the advantages of the two cases by proposing a recurrent video restoration
transformer, namely RVRT. RVRT processes local neighboring frames in parallel
within a globally recurrent framework which can achieve a good trade-off
between model size, effectiveness, and efficiency. Specifically, RVRT divides
the video into multiple clips and uses the previously inferred clip feature to
estimate the subsequent clip feature. Within each clip, different frame
features are jointly updated with implicit feature aggregation. Across
different clips, the guided deformable attention is designed for clip-to-clip
alignment, which predicts multiple relevant locations from the whole inferred
clip and aggregates their features by the attention mechanism. Extensive
experiments on video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising show that the

people in many parts of the globe. The scientific literature devoted both to
field observations and to modeling the propagation of ticks continues to grow.
So far the majority of the mathematical studies were devoted to models based on
ordinary differential equations, where spatial variability was taken into
account by a discrete parameter. Only few papers use spatially nontrivial
diffusion models, and they are devoted mostly to spatially homogeneous
equilibria. Here we develop diffusion models for the propagation of ticks
stressing spatial heterogeneity. This allows us to assess the sizes of control
zones that can be created (using various available techniques) to produce a
patchy territory, on which ticks will be eventually eradicated. Using averaged
parameters taken from various field observations we apply our theoretical
results to the concrete cases of the lone star ticks of North America and of
the taiga ticks of Russia.

scalable machine learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNNs)
filtering and processing these data. While the very recent theoretical work on
CNNs focuses on standard nonparametric denoising problems, the variability in
image classification datasets does, however, not originate from additive noise
but from variation of the shape and other characteristics of the same object
across different images. To address this problem, we consider a simple
supervised classification problem for object detection on grayscale images.
While from the function estimation point of view, every pixel is a variable and
large images lead to high-dimensional function recovery tasks suffering from
the curse of dimensionality, increasing the number of pixels in our image
deformation model enhances the image resolution and makes the object
classification problem easier. We propose and theoretically analyze two
different procedures. The first method estimates the image deformation by
support alignment. Under a minimal separation condition, it is shown that
perfect classification is possible. The second method fits a CNN to the data.
We derive a rate for the misclassification error depending on the sample size
and the number of pixels. Both classifiers are empirically compared on images
generated from the MNIST handwritten digit database. The obtained results
corroborate the theoretical findings.

  Deep neural networks must be equipped with an uncertainty estimation

relationship between deep architectures and their training regimes with their
corresponding selective prediction and uncertainty estimation performance. We
consider both in-distribution uncertainties and class-out-of-distribution ones.
Moreover, we consider some of the most popular estimation performance metrics
previously proposed including AUROC, ECE, AURC, and coverage for selective

uncertainty estimation and examine the relationships between the different
metrics. We find that distillation-based training regimes consistently yield
better uncertainty estimations than other training schemes such as vanilla
training, pretraining on a larger dataset and adversarial training. We also
provide strong empirical evidence showing that ViT is by far the most superior

the eigenfunctions and the reflection coefficients are shown Lipschitz
continuous with respect to initial data, which provides a priori estimate of

predictive performance on various datasets and benchmarks. We believe these
incentives risk a narrow focus on models and on the performance metrics used to
evaluate and compare them -- resulting in a growing body of literature to
evaluate and compare metrics. This paper strives for a more balanced
perspective on classifier performance metrics by highlighting their
distributions under different models of uncertainty and showing how this
uncertainty can easily eclipse differences in the empirical performance of
classifiers. We begin by emphasising the fundamentally discrete nature of
empirical confusion matrices and show how binary matrices can be meaningfully
represented in a three dimensional compositional lattice, whose cross-sections
form the basis of the space of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
We develop equations, animations and interactive visualisations of the contours
of performance metrics within (and beyond) this ROC space, showing how some are
affected by class imbalance. We provide interactive visualisations that show
the discrete posterior predictive probability mass functions of true and false
positive rates in ROC space, and how these relate to uncertainty in performance
metrics such as Balanced Accuracy (BA) and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient
(MCC). Our hope is that these insights and visualisations will raise greater
awareness of the substantial uncertainty in performance metric estimates that
can arise when classifiers are evaluated on empirical datasets and benchmarks,
and that classification model performance claims should be tempered by this
understanding.

  Trade-Off in Adversarial Training","12 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial training has been widely explored for mitigating attacks against
deep models. However, most existing works are still trapped in the dilemma
between higher accuracy and stronger robustness since they tend to fit a model
towards robust features (not easily tampered with by adversaries) while
ignoring those non-robust but highly predictive features. To achieve a better
robustness-accuracy trade-off, we propose the Vanilla Feature Distillation
Adversarial Training (VFD-Adv), which conducts knowledge distillation from a
pre-trained model (optimized towards high accuracy) to guide adversarial
training towards higher accuracy, i.e., preserving those non-robust but
predictive features. More specifically, both adversarial examples and their
clean counterparts are forced to be aligned in the feature space by distilling
predictive representations from the pre-trained/clean model, while previous
works barely utilize predictive features from clean models. Therefore, the
adversarial training model is updated towards maximally preserving the accuracy
as gaining robustness. A key advantage of our method is that it can be
universally adapted to and boost existing works. Exhaustive experiments on
various datasets, classification models, and adversarial training algorithms
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

studying hardness ratio for each observation and the correlation between the

recent years, the rapid increase of ride-hailing trips and commercial
deliveries has induced massive pick-ups/drop-offs (PUDOs), which occupy the
limited curb space that was designed and built decades ago. These PUDOs could
jam curb utilization and disturb the mainline traffic flow, evidently leading
to significant societal externalities. However, there is a lack of an
analytical framework that rigorously quantifies and mitigates the congestion
effect of PUDOs in the system view, particularly with little data support and
involvement of confounding effects. In view of this, this paper develops a
rigorous causal inference approach to estimate the congestion effect of PUDOs
on general networks. A causal graph is set to represent the spatio-temporal
relationship between PUDOs and traffic speed, and a double and separated
machine learning (DSML) method is proposed to quantify how PUDOs affect traffic
congestion. Additionally, a re-routing formulation is developed and solved to
encourage passenger walking and traffic flow re-routing to achieve system
optimal. Numerical experiments are conducted using real-world data in the
Manhattan area. On average, 100 additional units of PUDOs in a region could
reduce the traffic speed by 3.70 and 4.54 mph on weekdays and weekends,
respectively. Re-routing trips with PUDOs on curbs could respectively reduce
the system-wide total travel time by 2.44\% and 2.12\% in Midtown and Central
Park on weekdays. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

demonstrate the fabrication of DBR structures consisting only of undoped boron
nitride (BN) layers with high refractive index contrast by using Metal-Organic
Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). This has been achieved in a single process,
without the need for any post-process etching. The difference in the refractive
index of the component BN layers stems from different degrees of porosity of
the individual BN layers, which is a direct result of a different growth
temperature. The fabricated DBR structures consist of 15.5 pairs of BN layers
and exhibit a reflectance of 87+/-1% at the maximum. The wavelength of maximum
reflectance can be tuned from 500 nm up to the Infrared Region (IR), by simply
adjusting the growth periods of subsequent BN layers. We also demonstrate that
the fabricated structures can be used to create an optical microcavity. The
fabricated DBRs are very promising candidates for future applications, for
example in combination with single-photon emitters in h-BN, which could allow
the building of a cavity-based all-BN single-photon source.

accelerating. From the evidence based on the orbital period variations,
combined with estimates of the mass loss from the system based on radio
observations, it follows that (1) the mass transfer rate from the secondary
component is larger than dM2/dt=-5\times 10^{-6}M{\odot }/yr, possibly as large

introduce a new mixture attention mechanism, which encodes the pertinent word

multi-layer perceptron attention simultaneously. To strengthen the transfer
ability of the model from seen classes to unseen classes, we reformulate
zero-shot intent classification with a meta-learning strategy, which trains the
model by simulating multiple zero-shot classification tasks on seen categories,
and promotes the model generalization ability with a meta-adapting procedure on
mimic unseen categories. Extensive experiments on two real-world dialogue
datasets in different languages show that our model outperforms other strong
baselines on both standard and generalized zero-shot intent classification
tasks.

labeled data as well as neglect negative pairs on unlabeled data, forming
supervised inter-class contrastive learning and unsupervised similarity
learning. For segmentation, we extend supervised inter-class contrastive

improve the classification and segmentation models by a large margin and

to generalize from limited data and to properly estimate the uncertainty in
their predictions. However, these benefits come at a steep computational cost
as Bayesian inference, in most cases, is computationally intractable. One
popular approach to alleviate this problem is using a Monte-Carlo estimation
with an ensemble of models sampled from the posterior. However, this approach
still comes at a significant computational cost, as one needs to store and run
multiple models at test time. In this work, we investigate how to best distill
an ensemble's predictions using an efficient model. First, we argue that
current approaches that simply return distribution over predictions cannot
compute important properties, such as the covariance between predictions, which
can be valuable for further processing. Second, in many limited data settings,
all ensemble members achieve nearly zero training loss, namely, they produce
near-identical predictions on the training set which results in sub-optimal
distilled models. To address both problems, we propose a novel and general
distillation approach, named Functional Ensemble Distillation (FED), and we
investigate how to best distill an ensemble in this setting. We find that
learning the distilled model via a simple augmentation scheme in the form of
mixup augmentation significantly boosts the performance. We evaluated our

  Furthermore, we study rectangles with a bounded ""aspect ratio"", where the
aspect ratio of a rectangle is the larger side of a rectangle divided by its
smaller side. We improve on the well-known best $\tau/\nu$ bound, which is
quadratic in terms of the aspect ratio. We reduce it from quadratic to linear

performance (TE) enhancing. However, the phonon-assisted intervalley scattering
effect is neglected and the mode-selection rules remain unclear. In this work,
TE properties for $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-PbP are intestigated under
the consideration of full mode-, energy- and momentum-resolved electron-phonon
interactions (EPI). The group theory is used to analyze the selection rules for
EPI matrix elements. Our calculations reveal that, the intervalley scattering
contributes non-trivially to the total carrier relaxation time, and the
intervalley scattering can be modulated through crystal symmetry. In addition,
the investigation on the thermal properties reveals that four-phonon scattering
effect dominates the phonon relaxation processes, since the three-phonon
scattering is suppressed due to the significantly large acoustic-optical phonon
bandgap in $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-PbP. By considering full EPI effect
and high-order phonon scattering processes, the calculated ZT values reach
0.90, 0.24 and 1.25 for $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-PbP, repectively,
indicating their promising applications in thermoelectric devices.

difficulties achieving high-quality results and real-time speed at the same

powerful, efficient and flexible 3D representation, for monocular real-time and
accurate human reconstruction. The FOF represents a 3D object with a 2D field
orthogonal to the view direction where at each 2D position the occupancy field
of the object along the view direction is compactly represented with the first
few terms of Fourier series, which retains the topology and neighborhood
relation in the 2D domain. A FOF can be stored as a multi-channel image, which
is compatible with 2D convolutional neural networks and can bridge the gap
between 3D geometries and 2D images. The FOF is very flexible and extensible,
e.g., parametric models can be easily integrated into a FOF as a prior to
generate more robust results. Based on FOF, we design the first 30+FPS
high-fidelity real-time monocular human reconstruction framework. We
demonstrate the potential of FOF on both public dataset and real captured data.
The code will be released for research purposes.

which is of great promise for high-repetition-rate seeded free-electron lasers
(FELs), such as high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG). In this paper, the
self-modulation scheme is systematically analyzed and optimized, and further
experiments in which the self-modulator is resonant at the second harmonic of
the seed laser are conducted. The three-dimensional numerical simulations show
that the required seed laser intensity in the self-modulation scheme is around
three orders of magnitude lower than that of the standard HGHG through the
optimization of the beam size or the peak current. More importantly, by
reasonably setting the initial energy modulation and the resonance of the
self-modulator, a more prominent bunching factor and lase at the 30th harmonic
of the seed laser can be achieved in a single-stage HGHG. Moreover, the
experiment results confirm that varying the resonance conditions of the
self-modulator can still amplify the laser-induced energy modulation, where
coherent radiation generated even at the 12th harmonic can be observed. These
results indicate that the self-modulation scheme can remarkably reduce the
requirements of the seed laser system while improving the harmonic
up-conversion efficiency, which paves the way for realizing
high-repetition-rate and fully coherent soft x-ray FELs.

the most popular mode-seeking algorithms used for clustering and image
segmentation. It iteratively moves each data point to the weighted mean of its
neighborhood data points. The computational cost required to find the neighbors
of each data point is quadratic to the number of data points. Consequently, the
vanilla MS appears to be very slow for large-scale datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a mode-seeking algorithm called GridShift, with significant
speedup and principally based on MS. To accelerate, GridShift employs a
grid-based approach for neighbor search, which is linear in the number of data
points. In addition, GridShift moves the active grid cells (grid cells
associated with at least one data point) in place of data points towards the
higher density, a step that provides more speedup. The runtime of GridShift is
linear in the number of active grid cells and exponential in the number of
features. Therefore, it is ideal for large-scale low-dimensional applications
such as object tracking and image segmentation. Through extensive experiments,
we showcase the superior performance of GridShift compared to other MS-based as
well as state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime on
benchmark datasets for image segmentation. Finally, we provide a new

usually takes an average way to ensemble the local results produced by
distributed machines, which enjoys low communication cost but is statistical
inefficient. To address this problem, we proposed a new Weighted AVerage
Estimate (WAVE) for high-dimensional regressions. The WAVE is a solution to a
weighted least-square loss with an adaptive $L_1$ penalty, in which the $L_1$
penalty controls the sparsity and the weight promotes the statistical
efficiency. It can not only achieve a balance between the statistical and
communication efficiency, but also reach a faster rate than the average
estimate with a very low communication cost, requiring the local machines
delivering two vectors to the master merely. The consistency of parameter
estimation and model selection is also provided, which guarantees the safety of
using WAVE in the distributed system. The consistency also provides a way to
make hypothisis testing on the parameter. Moreover, WAVE is robust to the
heterogeneous distributed samples with varied mean and covariance across
machines, which has been verified by the asymptotic normality under such
conditions. Other competitors, however, do not own this property. The
effectiveness of WAVE is further illustrated by extensive numerical studies and

capacity too. However, the effects of orientational disorder become weaker when
the inter-crystalline space is widened. This weakening of the effect of
orientational disorder is a result of an interplay between the width of the
inter-crystalline space and the strength of guest-guest interactions.

enable an end-to-end training of SKS-coupled-DL, we propose to use zeroth-order

non-intrusive, i.e., does not require making any changes to the SKS. We
evaluate the performance of our ZOO training scheme on two real-world material

integrate scientific knowledge with DL training and is able to outperform
purely data-driven model for data-limited scientific applications. We also

  Over-parameterized ReLU Nets in Very High Dimensions",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This theoretical paper is devoted to developing a rigorous theory for
demystifying the global convergence phenomenon in a challenging scenario:
learning over-parameterized Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nets for very high
dimensional dataset under very mild assumptions. A major ingredient of our
analysis is a fine-grained analysis of random activation matrices. The
essential virtue of dissecting activation matrices is that it bridges the
dynamics of optimization and angular distribution in high-dimensional data
space. This angle-based detailed analysis leads to asymptotic characterizations
of gradient norm and directional curvature of objective function at each
gradient descent iteration, revealing that the empirical loss function enjoys
nice geometrical properties in the overparameterized setting. Along the way, we
significantly improve existing theoretical bounds on both over-parameterization
condition and learning rate with very mild assumptions for learning very high
dimensional data. Moreover, we uncover the role of the geometrical and spectral
properties of the input data in determining desired over-parameterization size
and global convergence rate. All these clues allow us to discover a novel
geometric picture of nonconvex optimization in deep learning: angular
distribution in high-dimensional data space $\mapsto$ spectrums of
overparameterized activation matrices $\mapsto$ favorable geometrical
properties of empirical loss landscape $\mapsto$ global convergence phenomenon.
Furthremore, our theoretical results imply that gradient-based nonconvex
optimization algorithms have much stronger statistical guarantees with much
milder over-parameterization condition than exisiting theory states for
learning very high dimensional data, which is rarely explored so far.

to 2003. Composite maps of different components such as pressure levels, vector
wind, U and V winds, vertical velocity, Specific humidity, OLR, streamlines,
vorticity, and the temperature was drawn and analyzed. The results showed that
the summer circulation of the atmosphere over South West Asia after a sudden
change from late May to early June was established in its normal position.
Different new pressure systems such as Zagros Trough were identified over the
surface and the Turkmenistan Anticyclone, the quasi-stationary trough of east
Turkey at 700 hPa level. During the establishment of Subtropical High Pressure
in the middle and upper troposphere over Iran, the summer circulation of
southwest Asia reached its highest intensity and expansion and continued to
mid-August. On the other hand, the establishment of the Turkmenistan
Anticyclone and Pakistan Low caused the 120 days winds of Sistan, and the
development of High pressure over the Arabian Peninsula and Zagros Trough
resulted in the Shomal wind. The main region of summer precipitation was
identified as a triangular area to the east of 58.30 E and south of 28.30 N.
Synoptic patterns responsible for the summer precipitation of the area are
grouped into four categories as Iran low pressure, Monsoon Depression, Pakistan
low pressure, and local convective cells. Iran low pressure was responsible for
more than 65 percent of summer rainfall, while the Monsoon and Pakistan lows
