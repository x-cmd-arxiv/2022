  Videos",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pretraining on noisy, internet-scale datasets has been heavily studied as a
technique for training models with broad, general capabilities for text,
images, and other modalities. However, for many sequential decision domains
such as robotics, video games, and computer use, publicly available data does
not contain the labels required to train behavioral priors in the same way. We
extend the internet-scale pretraining paradigm to sequential decision domains
through semi-supervised imitation learning wherein agents learn to act by
watching online unlabeled videos. Specifically, we show that with a small
amount of labeled data we can train an inverse dynamics model accurate enough
to label a huge unlabeled source of online data -- here, online videos of
people playing Minecraft -- from which we can then train a general behavioral
prior. Despite using the native human interface (mouse and keyboard at 20Hz),
we show that this behavioral prior has nontrivial zero-shot capabilities and
that it can be fine-tuned, with both imitation learning and reinforcement
learning, to hard-exploration tasks that are impossible to learn from scratch
via reinforcement learning. For many tasks our models exhibit human-level
performance, and we are the first to report computer agents that can craft
diamond tools, which can take proficient humans upwards of 20 minutes (24,000
environment actions) of gameplay to accomplish.

$n$, let $g$ be a Riemannian metric of regularity $W^{1,p}$, $p > n$, on $M$
whose distributional scalar curvature in the sense of Lee-LeFloch is bounded
below by $n(n-1)$, and let $f \colon (M,g) \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be a $1$-Lipschitz
continuous (not necessarily smooth) map of non-zero degree to the unit
$n$-sphere. Then $f$ is a metric isometry. This generalizes a result of Llarull
(1998) and answers in the affirmative a question of Gromov (2019) in his ""four

  Our proof is based on spectral properties of Dirac operators for low
regularity Riemannian metrics and twisted with Lipschitz bundles. We argue that
the existence of a non-zero harmonic spinor field forces $f$ to be quasiregular
in the sense of Reshetnyak, and in this way connect the powerful theory for
quasiregular maps to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

processes, where the emergence of nonlinear and time-dependent dynamics
regulate flow resistance, energy consumption, and particulate dispersal.
Polymeric stress induced by the advection and stretching of suspended polymers
feeds back on the underlying fluid flow, which ultimately dictates the
dynamics, instability, and transport properties of viscoelastic fluids.
However, direct experimental quantification of the stress field is challenging,
and a fundamental understanding of how Lagrangian flow structure regulates the
distribution of polymeric stress is lacking. In this work, we show that the
topology of the polymeric stress field precisely mirrors the Lagrangian
stretching field, where the latter depends solely on flow kinematics. We
develop a general analytical expression that directly relates the polymeric
stress and stretching in weakly viscoelastic fluids for both nonlinear and
unsteady flows, which is also extended to special cases characterized by strong
kinematics. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal a clear correlation
between the stress and stretching field topologies for unstable viscoelastic
flows across a broad range of geometries. Ultimately, our results establish a
connection between the Eulerian stress field and the Lagrangian structure of
viscoelastic flows. This work provides a simple framework to determine the
topology of polymeric stress directly from readily measurable flow field data
and lays the foundation for directly linking the polymeric stress to flow
transport properties.

inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by electron-positron pairs, is
observed toward a number of middle-aged pulsars. The physical origin and actual
commonness of the phenomenon in the Galaxy remain unclear. The conditions of
pair confinement seem extreme compared to what can be achieved in recent
theoretical models. We searched for scenarios minimizing as much as possible
the extent and magnitude of diffusion suppression in the halos in J0633+1746
and B0656+14, and explored the implications on the local positron flux if they
are applied to all nearby middle-aged pulsars. We used a phenomenological
static two-zone diffusion framework and compared its predictions with Fermi-LAT
and HAWC observations of the two halos, and with the local positron flux
measured with AMS-02. While strong diffusion suppression by 2-3 orders of
magnitude at ~100TeV is required by the data, it is possible to find solutions
with diffusion suppression extents as small as 30pc for both objects. If all
nearby middle-aged pulsars develop such halos, their combined positron flux
including the contribution from Geminga would saturate the >100GeV AMS-02
measurement for injection efficiencies that are much smaller than those
inferred for the canonical halos in J0633+1746 and B0656+14, and more generally
with the values typical of younger pulsar wind nebulae. Conversely, if
positrons from other nearby pulsars are released in the interstellar medium
without any confinement around the source, their total positron flux fits into
the observed spectrum for the same injection efficiencies of a few tens of
percent for all pulsars, from kyr-old objects powering pulsar wind nebulae to
100kyr-old objects like J0633+1746 and B0656+14. It seems a simpler scenario to
assume that most middle-aged pulsars do not develop halos (abridged).

data collection and annotation are especially huge. Specifically in robotic
surgery, data scarcity and imbalance have heavily affected the model accuracy

applications such as surgical instrument segmentation. Considering this, we
rethink the surgical instrument segmentation task and propose a one-to-many
data generation solution that gets rid of the complicated and expensive process
of data collection and annotation from robotic surgery. In our method, we only
utilize a single surgical background tissue image and a few open-source
instrument images as the seed images and apply multiple augmentations and
blending techniques to synthesize amounts of image variations. In addition, we
also introduce the chained augmentation mixing during training to further
enhance the data diversities. The proposed approach is evaluated on the real
datasets of the EndoVis-2018 and EndoVis-2017 surgical scene segmentation. Our
empirical analysis suggests that without the high cost of data collection and
annotation, we can achieve decent surgical instrument segmentation performance.
Moreover, we also observe that our method can deal with novel instrument
prediction in the deployment domain. We hope our inspiring results will
encourage researchers to emphasize data-centric methods to overcome demanding
deep learning limitations besides data shortage, such as class imbalance,
domain adaptation, and incremental learning. Our code is available at

quantum theory, but that it characterizes the minimal tensor product of general
pairs of convex cones $\mathsf{C}_A$ and $\mathsf{C}_B$: The elements of the
minimal tensor product $\mathsf{C}_A\otimes_{\min} \mathsf{C}_B$ are precisely
the tensors that can be symmetrically extended to elements in the maximal

demonstrated that by including mass in a thermal field the set of maximally
coherent states of the detector decoheres less compared to a zero mass. In both
of the examples mentioned, by making a suitable choice of detector radius,
field energy and coupling strength it is possible to infer the mass of the
field by either measuring the coherence present in the detector in the case of
an interaction with a coherent field or the corresponding decoherence of a
maximally coherent state in the case of a thermal field. In view of recent
advances in the study of Proca metamaterials, these results suggest the
possibility of utilising the theory of massive electromagnetism for the
construction of novel applications for use in quantum technologies.

processes without specifying the context in the description of a measurement

latter establishes that there is only one non-contextual classical model
compatible with quantum theory, the one that trivially identifies the quantum
state with the classical state. However, this model requires a breaking of the
unitary evolution to account for macroscopic realism. Thus, a causal classical
model compatible with the unitary evolution of the quantum state is necessarily
contextual at some extent. Inspired by well-known results in quantum
communication complexity, we consider a particular class of hidden variable
theories by assuming that the amount of information about the measurement
context is finite. Aiming at establishing some general features of these
theories, we first present a generalized version of the Gleason theorem and
provide a simple proof of it. Assuming that Gleason's hypotheses hold only
locally for `small' changes of the measurement procedure, we obtain almost the
same conclusion of the original theorem about the functional form of the
probability measure. An additional constant and a relaxed property of the
`density operator' are the only two differences from the original result. By
this generalization of the Gleason theorem and the assumption of finite

outcomes of a projective measurement must be linear functions of the projectors

randomness -- namely, stochasticity and non-determinism. While some recent work
has begun to reason about the relationship between stochasticity and
arbitrariness in legal contexts, the role of non-determinism more broadly
remains unexamined. In this paper, we clarify the overlap and differences
between these two concepts, and show that the effects of non-determinism, and
consequently its implications for the law, become clearer from the perspective
of reasoning about ML outputs as distributions over possible outcomes. This
distributional viewpoint accounts for randomness by emphasizing the possible
outcomes of ML. Importantly, this type of reasoning is not exclusive with
current legal reasoning; it complements (and in fact can strengthen) analyses
concerning individual, concrete outcomes for specific automated decisions. By
illuminating the important role of non-determinism, we demonstrate that ML code
falls outside of the cyberlaw frame of treating ``code as law,'' as this frame
assumes that code is deterministic. We conclude with a brief discussion of what
work ML can do to constrain the potentially harm-inducing effects of
non-determinism, and we indicate where the law must do work to bridge the gap

\pi_1(X)\to\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ is rigid provided that $X$ does not
admit logarithmic symmetric differential forms. Furthermore, such
representation $\sigma$ is conjugate to
$\sigma':\pi_1(X)\to\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathcal{O}_L)$ where $\mathcal{O}_L$
is the ring of integer of some number field $L$, so that $\sigma'$ is a complex
direct factor of a $\mathbb{Z}$-variation of Hodge structures. As an
application we prove that a complex quasi-projective manifold $X$ has nonzero
global logarithmic symmetric differential forms if there is linear
representation $\pi_1(X)\to\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ with infinite
images.

split the search space based on the quantiles of the feature distribution --

overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability
issue is mostly caused by the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the
total order of the chain of blocks (and of the operations within each block).
However, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced
applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order of all the
operations. Hence, if a more relaxed partial order (instead of a total order)
is allowed under certain safety conditions, a much higher scalability can be
achieved. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called
Setchain, that allows implementing this partial order and increases
significantly blockchain scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set
object whose elements are not totally ordered, unlike conventional blockchain
operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization
barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest
elements added. With the Setchain, operations in the same epoch are not
ordered, while operations in different epochs are. We present different
Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and
report on an empirical evaluation of a direct implementation. Our results show
that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers to
implement grow-only sets with epoch synchronization. Since the Setchain
barriers can be synchronized with block consolidation, Setchain objects can be
used as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster
operations than on basic blockchains.

small memory to retain old data and rehearse them over time. Unfortunately, due
to the limited memory size, the quality of the memory will deteriorate over
time. In this paper we propose OLCGM, a novel replay-based continual learning
strategy that uses knowledge condensation techniques to continuously compress
the memory and achieve a better use of its limited size. The sample
condensation step compresses old samples, instead of removing them like other
replay strategies. As a result, the experiments show that, whenever the memory
budget is limited compared to the complexity of the data, OLCGM improves the
final accuracy compared to state-of-the-art replay strategies.

are behind a lot of quantum technologies: entanglement and nonlocality. We
focus on multipartite systems, and ask what configurations of those systems are
more useful than others. 'Usefulness' takes on different meanings depending on
the context, but, roughly speaking, we aim for more entanglement or more
nonlocality. Chapter 2 develops a resource theory of entanglement with a unique
multipartite maximally entangled state. Chapter 3 shows that any connected
network of bipartite pure entangled states is genuine multipartite nonlocal
(GMNL). Chapter 4 shows that, unlike in the case of pure states, topology is
crucial to determine whether networks of bipartite mixed entangled states are
genuine multipartite entangled. We also obtain, to our knowledge, the first
example of superactivation of GMNL. In a departure from the main ideas explored
in previous chapters, Chapter 5 is devoted to developing a physical principle
inspired by a seminal result in epistemics. We contend that the principle must
hold for any theory of Nature and intend for it to rule out post-quantum
theories which are consistent with experimentally observed results.

optimistic evaluations of the best policies. In recent years, given the
increased availability of large datasets, such an issue can be further
complicated when researchers include many covariates to estimate the policy or

manuscript, to simultaneously address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a
resampling-based procedure that not only lifts the winner's curse in evaluating
the best policies observed in a random sample, but also is robust to the
presence of many covariates. The proposed inference procedure yields accurate

drastically different from the asymptote, that spectral analysis of $H_g$ fails
to directly reveal. A consistent description of the effect is provided by the
general tool of ``pseudospectrum"", and a quantitative estimation of the maximum
power amplification is provided by the {\it Kreiss constant}. A recipe to
determine an optimal initial condition that will attain maximum amplification
power is given by singular value decomposition of the propagator $e^{-i H_g
t}$. It is further predicted that the interplay between nonnormality and
nonlinearity in a skin-effect laser array can facilitate narrow-emission
spectra with scalable stable-output power.

  Level-Specific Fixed and Random Effects Selection in a Two-Level Nested Model","34 pages",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Popular statistical software provides Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
for multilevel models or linear mixed models. However, it has been observed
that the combination of statistical literature and software documentation has
led to discrepancies in the formulas of the BIC and uncertainties of the proper
use of the BIC in selecting a multilevel model with respect to level-specific
fixed and random effects. These discrepancies and uncertainties result from
different specifications of sample size in the BIC's penalty term for
multilevel models. In this study, we derive the BIC's penalty term for
level-specific fixed and random effect selection in a two-level nested design.
In this new version of BIC, called BIC_E, this penalty term is decomposed into
two parts if the random effect variance-covariance matrix has full rank: (a) a
term with the log of average sample size per cluster whose multiplier involves
the overlapping number of dimensions between the column spaces of the random
and fixed effect design matrices and (b) the total number of parameters times
the log of the total number of clusters. Furthermore, we study the behavior of
BIC_E in the presence of redundant random effects. The use of BIC_E is
illustrated with a textbook example data set and a numerical demonstration
shows that the derived formulae adheres to empirical values.

develop the first model-free, simulator-free algorithm that achieves a
sublinear regret and a sublinear constraint violation even in large-scale
systems. To this end, we consider the episodic constrained Markov decision
processes with linear function approximation, where the transition dynamics and
the reward function can be represented as a linear function of some known
feature mapping. We show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ constraint violation bounds can be
achieved, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the length
of the episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. Our bounds are attained
without explicitly estimating the unknown transition model or requiring a
simulator, and they depend on the state space only through the dimension of the
feature mapping. Hence our bounds hold even when the number of states goes to
infinity. Our main results are achieved via novel adaptations of the standard
LSVI-UCB algorithms. In particular, we first introduce primal-dual optimization
into the LSVI-UCB algorithm to balance between regret and constraint violation.
More importantly, we replace the standard greedy selection with respect to the
state-action function in LSVI-UCB with a soft-max policy. This turns out to be
key in establishing uniform concentration for the constrained case via its
approximation-smoothness trade-off. We also show that one can achieve an even

deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs,
CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4
model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range
dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While
this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long
dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be
difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS
showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still
preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific
initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal
state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all
SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is
critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing
that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same
kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically
describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs,
and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.
Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation
requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all

visual Transformers, which operate on tokens derived from image patches.
However, these Transformers do not perform explicit operations to learn

irregular in nature, we have chosen it to be our primary tool for analysis of
the quasar-galaxy pair redshift data. Kernel density estimation has been
performed for estimating the bin width as proper computation of this quantity

fraction of stars on radial/highly eccentric orbits in the outer regions of
anisotropic clusters lead to an enhancement in the dynamical interactions
between inner and outer stars that affects both the process of mass segregation
and the evolution of primordial binaries. The results of our simulations show
that the time scale of mass segregation of the initially anisotropic cluster is
longer in the core and shorter in the outer regions, when compared to the

significantly affected by the initial velocity distribution and we find that
the rate of disruptions, ejections and exchange events affecting the primordial
binaries in the anisotropic clusters is higher than in the isotropic ones.

them. Crucially, these observations probe a ``transition'' region between
$-10\gtrsim M_V \gtrsim -14$ where we see a mixture of gas-rich and gas-poor
satellites and where quenching processes shift from longer timescales (i.e. via

limitations. Hence we adapt the variational approach -- using ion native
Hamiltonians -- to create ansatze families that can prepare the ground states
of more general problem Hamiltonians. We analytically determine symmetry
protected classes that make certain problem instances inaccessible unless this
symmetry is broken. We exhaustively search over six qubits and consider upto
twenty circuit layers, demonstrating that symmetry can be broken to solve all

neutron star should be highly magnetized, with a surface dipole field of $\sim

Alternatively, the nebula may be powered by the release of magnetic energy from
a magnetar. Magnetar nebulae have been proposed to explain the persistent radio

resolution numerical experiments in which we increase or decrease the angular
momentum of the Lagrangian patches in the early universe. We simulate three
galaxies over their histories from $z=200$ to $z=2$, each with five different

show that altering early-universe angular momentum changes the timing and
orbital parameters of mergers, which in turn changes the total stellar angular
momentum within a galaxy's virial radius in a predictable manner. Of our three

The response is driven by a quadrupole interaction with the electric field
enabled by Td-symmetry. This interaction, until recently believed to be
negligible, reflects inversion symmetry breaking and in two dimensions results
in an electric-field dependent correction to the in-plane g-factor. The effect
can be observed in state-of-the-art heterostructures, either via magnetic
doping or by using a vector magnet, where even for small perpendicular magnetic
fields it is comparable in magnitude to topological materials.

evolved massive pulsator. As candidate post-red supergiant objects, and one of
the few classes of pulsating evolved massive stars, these objects have
incredible potential to change our understanding of the structure and evolution
of massive stars. Here we examine the lightcurves of a sample of 126 cool
supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds observed by the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (\tess~) in order to identify pulsating stars. After making
quality cuts and filtering out contaminant objects, we examine the distribution
of pulsating stars in the Hertzprung-Russel (HR) diagram, and find that FYPS
occupy a region above $\log L/L_\odot \gtrsim 5.0$. This luminosity boundary
corresponds to stars with initial masses of $\sim$18-20 $M_\odot$, consistent
with the most massive red supergiant progenitors of supernovae (SNe) II-P, as
well as the observed properties of SNe IIb progenitors. This threshold is in
agreement with the picture that FYPS are post-RSG stars. Finally, we
characterize the behavior of FYPS pulsations as a function of their location in
the HR diagram. We find low frequency pulsations at higher effective
temperatures, higher frequency pulsations at lower temperatures, with a
transition between the two behaviors at intermediate temperatures. The observed
properties of FYPS make them fascinating objects for future theoretical study.

dresses the classical skeleton of cold dark matter with universal features akin
to the physical imprints of wavelike (or fuzzy) dark matter. We untangle this
wave interference to obtain single-stream wavefunctions corresponding to the
classical fluid streams, by writing the wavefunction in an integral form. Our
wave decomposition captures the full phase-space information and isolates the
multi-stream phenomena related to vorticity and velocity dispersion. We link
the wave interference features of our system to the standard forms of
diffraction catastrophe integrals, which produce bright caustics in optical

can unlock new ways of modelling and probing wavelike dark matter on the scales

associated with simulating the turbulent dynamo by introducing a saturated
magnetic field at equipartition with the velocity field when the central
densities reaches 10-13 g cm-3. We test a range of sink particle creation
densities from 10-10-10-8 g cm-3. Within the range tested, the fields did not
suppress fragmentation of the gas and hence could not prevent the degree of
fragmentation from increasing with increased resolution. The number of sink
particles formed and total mass in sink particles was unaffected by the
magnetic field across all seed fields and resolutions. The magnetic pressure
remained sub-dominant to the gas pressure except in the highest density regions

  In the present paper, we study the special case when one of the matroids is a

equivalent to the problem of packing rainbow spanning trees, an extension of
the problem of packing arborescences in directed graphs which was answered by
Edmonds' seminal result on disjoint arborescences. We complement his result by
showing that it is NP-complete to decide whether an edge-colored graph contains
two disjoint rainbow spanning trees. Our complexity result holds even for the
very special case when the graph is the union of two spanning trees and each

relativistic dynamics and astrophysical binary formation scenarios. In this
study, we revisit the evidence for spin-precession in GW200129 and localize its
origin to data in LIGO Livingston in the 20--50\,Hz frequency range where the
signal amplitude is lower than expected from a non-precessing binary given all
the other data. These data are subject to known data quality issues as a glitch
was subtracted from the detector's strain data. The lack of evidence for
spin-precession in LIGO Hanford leads to a noticeable inconsistency between the
inferred binary mass ratio and precessing spin in the two LIGO detectors,
something not expected from solely different Gaussian noise realizations. We
revisit the LIGO Livingston glitch mitigation and show that the difference
between a spin-precessing and a non-precessing interpretation for GW200129 is
smaller than the statistical and systematic uncertainty of the glitch
subtraction, finding that the support for spin-precession depends sensitively
on the glitch modeling. We also investigate the signal-to-noise ratio $\sim7$
trigger in the less sensitive Virgo detector. Though not influencing the
spin-precession studies, the Virgo trigger is grossly inconsistent with the
ones in LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston as it points to a much heavier system.
We interpret the Virgo data in the context of further data quality issues.
While our results do not disprove the presence of spin-precession in GW200129,
we argue that any such inference is contingent upon the statistical and
systematic uncertainty of the glitch mitigation. Our study highlights the role
of data quality investigations when inferring subtle effects such as
spin-precession for short signals such as the ones produced by high-mass
systems.

synthesize evidence in a reliable and unbiased manner. The process of
conducting SLR is rigorous and well-known; however, most SLR have not followed
this process systematically, leading to various problems, including poor
documentation, lack of quality, and difficulty to be reproduced. These problems
are added to the inherent difficulties in conducting SLR, especially regarding
effort and time consumption. Several practices (including methods, techniques,
and tools) have already been experimented with to mitigate such problems.
Still, it is unclear which practices should be prioritized to reduce such
problems and difficulties. Aims: The main goal of this paper is to contribute
to improving the SLR process being adopted by the community. For that, we
introduce the idea of the Maturity Model for SLR process (MM4SLR). Method: We
systematically examined the literature searching for practices destined to
support or improve the SLR process. After collecting 84 practices, we analyzed,
grouped, and synthesized them into 46 key practices further distributed into 15
specific goals. Inspired by the maturity model for software development
process, we also propose five process areas and an initial version of MM4SLR
containing four maturity levels. Results: MM4SLR provides a new view on those
practices that could be progressively adopted to improve the SLR process.
MM4SLR could define a pragmatic pathway that guides the adoption of those
practices, which better fit the reality of who conducts SLR. Conclusion: The
SLR process is very complex and should be more investigated. We argue that ways
to better select and adopt the various existing practices are necessary. We
conclude that a long research agenda to be fulfilled addressing the SLR process
still exists.

Since copulas enable one to conveniently treat the marginal distribution of
each variable and the interdependencies among variables separately, in the past
60 years they have become an essential analysis tool on classical computers in
various fields ranging from quantitative finance and civil engineering to
signal processing and medicine. The recent finding that copulas can be
expressed as maximally entangled quantum states has revealed a promising
approach to practical quantum advantages: performing tasks faster, requiring
less memory, or, as we show, yielding better predictions. Studying the
scalability of this quantum approach as both the precision and the number of
modeled variables increase is crucial for its adoption in real-world
applications. In this paper, we successfully apply a Quantum Circuit Born
Machine (QCBM) based approach to modeling 3- and 4-variable copulas on trapped
ion quantum computers. We study the training of QCBMs with different levels of
precision and circuit design on a simulator and a state-of-the-art trapped ion
quantum computer. We observe decreased training efficacy due to the increased
complexity in parameter optimization as the models scale up. To address this
challenge, we introduce an annealing-inspired strategy that dramatically
improves the training results. In our end-to-end tests, various configurations
of the quantum models make a comparable or better prediction in risk
aggregation tasks than the standard classical models. Our detailed study of the
copula paradigm using quantum computing opens opportunities for its deployment
in various industries.

continuance of an FSRQ in blazar (or non-blazar) state over an exceptionally

unbiased set of 80 FSRQs whose blazar state stood confirmed during 1980s from
optical polarimetry. Four decades later, blazar state of each FSRQ is
ascertained here from variability of their optical light-curves of typical

3 days), obtained under the Zwicky Transient Facility project ongoing since

additionally from the opto-polarimetric survey RoboPol (2013-2017). From both
these databases it is found that only $\sim$ 10% of the FSRQs have undergone a
blazar $\leftrightarrow$ non-blazar state transition over the past 3 - 4

value function that represents how to solve not just a given task, but any

equipping an agent with an internal goal space defined as all the world states
where it experiences a terminal transition. The agent can then modify the
standard task rewards to define its own reward function, which provably drives
it to learn how to achieve all reachable internal goals, and the value of doing
so in the current task. We demonstrate two key benefits of WVFs in the context
of learning and planning. In particular, given a learned WVF, an agent can
compute the optimal policy in a new task by simply estimating the task's reward
function. Furthermore, we show that WVFs also implicitly encode the transition
dynamics of the environment, and so can be used to perform planning.
Experimental results show that WVFs can be learned faster than regular value
functions, while their ability to infer the environment's dynamics can be used
to integrate learning and planning methods to further improve sample
efficiency.

Fe, \textit{i.e.}, so-called ``magic'' doping, has been observed on a range of
Ti oxide substrates, which concludes that there likely is some important
interaction limiting the FeSe doping. Our study discovers that the polarization
change at the interface Se because of the close proximity to the substrate from
that in the free-standing FeSe film significantly amplifies the total potential
difference at the interface above and beyond the work function difference for
charge transfer. Additionally, the titanate substrate with a large number of
free electrons basically serves as an ``infinite'' charge reservoir, which
leads to the saturated FeSe doping with the complete removal of interface
potential gradient. Our work has developed the theory for modulation doping in
the Van der Waals materials/oxides heterostructure, providing a solution to the
puzzle of ``magic'' doping in FeSe monolayers on titanates. The information

by using complementary data structures yet these methods are ill-suited for
dynamic scenes and often increase memory consumption. Little has been done to
reduce the resources required at training time. We propose a method to exploit
the redundancy of NeRF's sample-based computations by partially sharing
evaluations across neighboring sample points. Our UNeRF architecture is
inspired by the UNet, where spatial resolution is reduced in the middle of the
network and information is shared between adjacent samples. Although this
change violates the strict and conscious separation of view-dependent
appearance and view-independent density estimation in the NeRF method, we show
that it improves novel view synthesis. We also introduce an alternative
subsampling strategy which shares computation while minimizing any violation of
view invariance. UNeRF is a plug-in module for the original NeRF network. Our
major contributions include reduction of the memory footprint, improved
accuracy, and reduced amortized processing time both during training and

generalizations of the tree property that characterize strong compactness and
supercompactness up to inaccessibility. That is, an inaccessible cardinal
$\kappa$ is strongly compact if and only if the strong tree property holds at
$\kappa$, and supercompact if and only if ITP holds at $\kappa$. We present
several results motivated by the problem of obtaining the strong tree property
and ITP at many successive cardinals simultaneously; these results focus on the
successors of singular cardinals. We describe a general class of forcings that
will obtain the strong tree property and ITP at the successor of a singular
cardinal of any cofinality. Generalizing a result of Neeman about the tree
property, we show that it is consistent for ITP to hold at $\aleph_n$ for all
$2 \leq n < \omega$ simultaneously with the strong tree property at
$\aleph_{\omega+1}$; we also show that it is consistent for ITP to hold at

Finally, turning our attention to singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality,
we show that it is consistent for the strong and super tree properties to hold

plays an important role in understanding different phases of matter. It is
especially important for fracton phases where a combination of topology and
fractionalization leads to exotic features not seen in other known quantum
phases. In this paper, we consider the above problem by studying phase
transition in the X-cube model in the presence of a non-linear perturbation.
Using an analysis of the ground state fidelity and identifying a discontinuity
in the global entanglement, we show there is a first order quantum phase
transition from a type I fracton phase with a highly entangled nature to a
magnetized phase. Accordingly, we conclude that the global entanglement, as a
measure of the total quantum correlations in the ground state, can well capture
certain features of fracton phase transitions. Then, we introduce a non-local
order parameter in the form of a foliated operator which can characterize the
above phase transition. We particularly show that such an order parameter has a
geometric nature which captures specific differences of fracton phases with
topological phases. Our study is specifically based on a well-known dual
mapping to the classical plaquette Ising model where it shows the importance of
such dualities in studying different quantum phases of matter.

using a combination of two linear models to predict and minimize the tracking

continuously updated during the execution of the controller. To ensure its
practicality and safe learning, the proposed hybrid FBF controller is equipped
with the ability to handle delays in data acquisition and to detect impending

demonstrated via application to vibration compensation of a 3D printer with
unmodeled linear and nonlinear dynamics. Thanks to the proposed hybrid FBF

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant improvements in node

between meta-training and meta-test due to the task variance caused by
different node/class distributions in meta-tasks (i.e., node-level and
class-level variance). Therefore, to effectively alleviate the impact of task
variance, we propose a task-adaptive node classification framework under the
few-shot learning setting. Specifically, we first accumulate meta-knowledge
across classes with abundant labeled nodes. Then we transfer such knowledge to
the classes with limited labeled nodes via our proposed task-adaptive modules.

potential victims into using and relying on a side chain, i.e., a false,
alternate history of transactions, and into proposing transactions that end up
harming themselves or others. Previous research work on LRAs on blockchain
systems have used, at a high level, one of two approaches. They either try to
(1) prevent the creation of a bogus side chain or (2) make it possible to
distinguish such a side chain from the main consensus chain.
  In this paper, we take a different approach. We start with the
indistinguishability of side chains from the consensus chain -- for the
eclipsed victim -- as a given and assume the potential victim will be fooled.
Instead, we protect the victim via harm reduction applying ""short leashes"" to
transactions. The leashes prevent transactions from being used in the wrong
context.
  The primary contribution of this paper is the design and analysis of leashes.
A secondary contribution is the careful explication of the LRA threat model in
the context of BAR fault tolerance, and using it to analyze related work to
identify their limitations.

used in our daily lives such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare systems, and
unmanned aircraft systems. Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables
systems to learn from data and make decisions on new data based on models to
achieve a given goal. The stochastic nature of AI models makes verification and
validation tasks challenging. Moreover, there are intrinsic biaises in AI
models such as reproductibility bias, selection bias (e.g., races, genders,
color), and reporting bias (i.e., results that do not reflect the reality).
Increasingly, there is also a particular attention to the ethical, legal, and
societal impacts of AI. AI systems are difficult to audit and certify because
of their black-box nature. They also appear to be vulnerable to threats; AI
systems can misbehave when untrusted data are given, making them insecure and
unsafe. Governments, national and international organizations have proposed
several principles to overcome these challenges but their applications in
practice are limited and there are different interpretations in the principles
that can bias implementations. In this paper, we examine trust in the context
of AI-based systems to understand what it means for an AI system to be
trustworthy and identify actions that need to be undertaken to ensure that AI
systems are trustworthy. To achieve this goal, we first review existing
approaches proposed for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, in order to
identify potential conceptual gaps in understanding what trustworthy AI is.
Then, we suggest a trust (resp. zero-trust) model for AI and suggest a set of

Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) uses forward sampling of stochastic

that outlier robust OT fully transports these outliers leading to poor
performances in practice. To tackle these outliers, we propose to detect them
by relying on a classifier trained with adversarial training to classify source

from the classifier is different from its assigned label. To decrease the
influence of these outliers in the transport problem, we propose to either
remove them from the problem or to increase the cost of moving them by using

science application engagements to demonstrate automated pipelines that analyze
data from remote facilities at large scale, without routine human intervention.
In several cases, we have gone beyond demonstrations and now provide

tools, API-driven automation, HPC-scale notebooks via Jupyter, authentication
using Federated Identity and container-based edge services supported.
  The lessons we learned during this project provide a valuable model for

large pool of items as efficiently as possible using passively collected
discrete choice data, i.e., the user picks one item from a set of multiple
items. Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose the choice-based
Borda count algorithm as a fast and accurate ranking algorithm for top
$K$-recovery i.e., correctly identifying all of the top $K$ items. We show that
the choice-based Borda count algorithm has optimal sample complexity for
top-$K$ recovery under a broad class of random utility models. We prove that in
the limit, the choice-based Borda count algorithm produces the same top-$K$
estimate as the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimate method but the
former's speed and simplicity brings considerable advantages in practice.
Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the counting
algorithm is competitive with commonly used ranking algorithms in terms of
accuracy while being several orders of magnitude faster.

Lov\'{a}sz and Szegedy, this is also equivalent to weak randomness: the
property that the group have only finitely many irreducible representations in

However, these solutions do not scale well to large graphs as extraction and
operation on enclosing subgraphs are computationally expensive, especially for
large graphs. This paper presents a scalable link prediction solution, that we
call ScaLed, which utilizes sparse enclosing subgraphs to make predictions. To
extract sparse enclosing subgraphs, ScaLed takes multiple random walks from a
target pair of nodes, then operates on the sampled enclosing subgraph induced
by all visited nodes. By leveraging the smaller sampled enclosing subgraph,
ScaLed can scale to larger graphs with much less overhead while maintaining
high accuracy. ScaLed further provides the flexibility to control the trade-off

performance in several prediction tasks for applications in mammography,
clinical deployment of deep learning systems in still relatively rare;

  using a distributed fuel injection technique and inlet air preheating","28 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has prompted the search for
carbon-free fuel alternatives. One such carbon-free fuel source that can be
used for power generation in a gas turbine-based system is ammonia. Ammonia
combustion poses challenges due to reduced flame speed and reactivity, which
can be alleviated by addition of methane or natural gas. However, NOx emission
is an important issue, which needs resolution before practical consideration of
ammonia. One of the potential solutions that has been proposed is a two-stage,
rich-lean combustion process to minimize NOx while ensuring complete reactant
consumption. This work evaluates the use of two strategies to widen stability
limits for swirl combustors operating on premixed methane-ammonia-air mixtures,
which would facilitate the two-stage combustion approach. The first strategy
involves the use of a distributed fuel injection approach utilizing a novel
micro fuel injection swirler while preventing flashback concerns. The second
strategy involves use of inlet air preheating to increase flame stability and
delay blow-off. Experiments and reactor network simulations are carried out to
evaluate the effectiveness of the two strategies in expanding combustor
operability limits. The influence of the proposed strategies on NOx emissions
are studied and underlying reaction pathways leading to NOx production are
analyzed. Results of the study indicate that a distributed fuel injection
strategy significantly expands stability limits of a swirl combustor operating
on methane-ammonia-air mixtures. Inlet air preheating provides additional
expansion of stability limits; however, this increases NOx production, which is
undesirable from an emissions standpoint. NOx is found to be significantly
lower for rich fuel-air mixtures primarily through the effect of NHi reaction
pathways responsible for NO consumption.

emission at 1 keV and a power-law tail above 10 keV. Empirical models fit the
high-energy power-law tail to radiation from a nonthermal electron
distribution, but the physical location of the nonthermal electrons and the
reason for their power-law index and high-energy cut-off are still largely
unknown. Here, we propose that the nonthermal electrons originate from within
the black hole's innermost stable circular orbit (the ''plunging region'').
Using an analytic model for the plunging region dynamics and electron
distribution function properties from particle-in-cell simulations, we outline
a steady-state model that can reproduce the observed spectral features. In
particular, our model reproduces photon indices of $\Gamma\gtrsim2$ and
power-law luminosities on the order of a few percent of the disk luminosity for
strong magnetic fields, consistent with observations of the soft state. Because
the emission originates so close to the black hole, we predict that the
power-law luminosity should strongly depend on the system inclination angle and
black hole spin. This model could be extended to the power-law tails observed
above 400 keV in the hard state of X-ray binaries.

normal mode assignments. Energies, entropies, critical temperatures, and an
excitation frequency are studied and compared to existing results in the
literature. These normal modes have been derived analytically for N identical,
confined particles from a first-order L=0 group theoretic solution of a
three-dimensional Hamiltonian with a general two-body interaction. In previous
studies, normal modes were able to describe the unitary regime obtaining ground
state energies comparable to benchmark results and thermodynamics quantities in
excellent agreement with experiment. In a recent study, the behavior of the
normal mode frequencies was investigated for Hamiltonians with a range of
interparticle interaction strengths from BCS to unitarity in the first test of
this approach beyond the unitary regime, and a microscopic basis of the large
excitation gaps and universal behavior at unitarity was proposed. Based on the
success of these earlier studies, the current paper continues to explore the
ability of normal modes to describe superfluidity along the BCS to unitarity

In the real world, there are extremely small datasets. Most existing methods
adopt pre-trained neural network models to handle this kind of dataset.
However, these methods are either difficult to deploy on mobile devices because
of their large output size or cannot fully extract the deep semantic
information between phrases and clauses. This paper proposes a multimodel-based
deep learning framework for short-text multiclass classification with an
imbalanced and extremely small data set. Our framework mainly includes five
layers: The encoder layer uses DISTILBERT to obtain context-sensitive dynamic
word vectors that are difficult to represent in traditional feature engineering
methods. Since the transformer part of this layer is distilled, our framework
is compressed. Then, we use the next two layers to extract deep semantic
information. The output of the encoder layer is sent to a bidirectional LSTM
network, and the feature matrix is extracted hierarchically through the LSTM at
the word and sentence level to obtain the fine-grained semantic representation.
After that, the max-pooling layer converts the feature matrix into a
lower-dimensional matrix, preserving only the obvious features. Finally, the
feature matrix is taken as the input of a fully connected softmax layer, which
contains a function that can convert the predicted linear vector into the
output value as the probability of the text in each classification. Extensive
experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach on an extremely small data set. It retains the
state-of-the-art baseline performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy,
and F1 score, and through the model size, training time, and convergence epoch,
we can conclude that our method can be deployed faster and lighter on mobile
devices.

efficiency of Shattered Pellet Injection (SPI) as a Disruption Mitigation
System (DMS). Current mainstream 3D MHD codes modelling SPIs mostly assume
instantaneous thermalization between the previously hot ambient electrons and
the newly released cold electrons, which results in underestimation of the
ablation rate if the hot electron thermalization time is comparable or even
longer than the fragment flying time. To resolve this doubt, we hereby
investigate the thermalization dynamics and the overall hot-electron impact.
The finite-time collisional thermalization of hot-tail electrons in a rapidly
cooling plasma, as well as the so-called ``self-limiting'' effect are
considered. The former effect tends to deplete the colder population within a
hot-tail species, while the latter is found to preferentially deplete the
higher energy population. The combined result is found to cause an almost
self-similar decay of the hot electron distribution function, while its shape
does not deviate much from that of Maxwellian distribution and the mean energy
does not change much during the thermalization process. Based on this
observation, axisymmetric JOREK D2 SPI simulations were carried out with
additional hot-tail contribution to evaluate their overall impact onto the
injection assimilation and penetration. It is found that the hot-tail effect
indeed causes enhanced assimilation and shallower penetration, although the
overall effect depends on the exact injection configuration, with the slow
injection showing negligible hot-tail effect while the fast single
non-shattered pellet case shows drastic hot-tail ablation enhancement. For
ITER-like SPI parameters, there is no significant deviation in the total
assimilation, but some deviation in the injection penetration is observed for
the fast injection velocity cases.

educational data mining communities still suffer from the lack of large-scale,

teaching instructions are well annotated into 8 categories. Furthermore, we
utilize the prevalent pre-trained language models (PLMs) and propose a simple

engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising
in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A
core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular
matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability
to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was
actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical
system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known
mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which
S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a
more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a
simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto
exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture
long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of
SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such
as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to
initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's
performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most

dialogue. First, we record and transcribe actual spontaneous dialogues. Then,
the proposed dialogue TTS is trained in two stages: first stage, variational
autoencoder (VAE)-VITS or Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE)-VITS
is trained, which introduces an utterance-level latent variable into
variational inference with adversarial learning for end-to-end text-to-speech

a latent speaking style representation from speech is trained jointly with TTS.
In the second stage, a style predictor is trained to predict the speaking style
to be synthesized from dialogue history. During inference, by passing the
speaking style representation predicted by the style predictor to
VAE/GMVAE-VITS, speech can be synthesized in a style appropriate to the context
of the dialogue. Subjective evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the original VITS in terms of dialogue-level naturalness.

developing a (stylized) theoretical model of this process and analyzing its
statistical consequences, showing how access to non-aggregated label

-- even feasible, whereas it is impossible with only gold-standard labels. The
entire story, however, is subtle, and the contrasts between aggregated and
fuller label information depend on the particulars of the problem, where
estimators that use aggregated information exhibit robust but slower rates of
convergence, while estimators that can effectively leverage all labels converge
more quickly if they have fidelity to (or can learn) the true labeling process.
The theory we develop in the stylized model makes several predictions for

its ocean depth can reach tens of to hundreds of kilo-meters with no exposed
continents. Due to the lack of exposed continents, neither western boundary
current nor coastal upwelling exists, and ocean overturning circulation becomes
the most important way to return the nutrients deposited in deep ocean back to
the thermocline and to the surface ocean.Here we investigate the depth of the
thermocline in both wind-dominated and mixing-dominated systems on water-rich
exoplanets using the global ocean model MITgcm. We find that the wind-driven
circulation is dominated by overturning cells through Ekman pumping and
subduction and by zonal (west--east) circum-longitudinal currents, similar to
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current on Earth. The wind-influenced thermocline
depth shows little dependence on the ocean depth, and under a large range of
parameters, the thermocline is restricted within the upper layers of the ocean.
The mixing-influenced thermocline is limited within the upper 10 km of the
ocean and can not reach the bottom of the ocean even under extremely strong
vertical mixing. The scaling theories for the thermocline depth on Earth are
applicable for the thermocline depth on water-rich exoplanets. However, due to
the lack of exposed continents, the zonal and meridional flow speeds are not in
the same magnitude as that in the oceans of Earth, which results in the scaling
relationships for water-rich exoplanets are a little different from that used
on Earth.

learning framework to implement adaptive control for an electric platoon
composed of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) at a signalized intersection.
Firstly, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is proposed to describe the
decision process of the mixed platoon. Novel state representation and reward
function are designed for the model to consider the behavior of the whole
platoon. Secondly, in order to deal with the delayed reward, an Augmented
Random Search (ARS) algorithm is proposed. The control policy learned by the
agent can guide the longitudinal motion of the CAV, which serves as the leader
of the platoon. Finally, a series of simulations are carried out in simulation
suite SUMO. Compared with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement
learning approaches, the proposed method can obtain a higher reward. Meanwhile,
the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the delay reward, which
is designed to outperform distributed reward mechanism} Compared with normal
car-following behavior, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the energy can be
saved to different extends (39.27%-82.51%) by adjusting the relative importance
of the optimization goal. On the premise that travel delay is not sacrificed,
the proposed control method can save up to 53.64% electric energy.

role of inverse catalysis to the phase transitions, and large quark AMM will
change the magnetic catalysis phenomena of phase transitions to inverse
magnetic catalysis in the whole $\mu_B-T$ plane. For a fixed magnetic field,
the critical temperature $T_c$ and critical baryon chemical potential $\mu_B^c$
decreases with quark AMM. The stronger the magnetic field is, the inverse
catalysis effect of AMM becomes more important. For a small AMM
$\kappa=\kappa_1$, it shows the magnetic catalysis effect for critical
temperature $T_c$ at vanishing $\mu_B$ with increasing magnetic field, and
(inverse) magnetic catalysis effect for critical baryon chemical potential
$\mu_B^c$ at vanishing $T$ under (weak) strong magnetic field. At finite $T$

different magnetic field. For a large AMM $\kappa=\kappa_2$, we obtain the

  Analysis for Matrix CFAR Detection","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, an innovative matrix CFAR detection scheme based on information
geometry, also referred to as the geometric detector, has been developed
speedily and exhibits distinct advantages in several practical applications.
These advantages benefit from the geometry of the Toeplitz Hermitian positive
definite (HPD) manifold $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, but the
sophisticated geometry also results in some challenges for geometric detectors,
such as the implementation of the enhanced detector to improve the SCR
(signal-to-clutter ratio) and the analysis of the detection performance. To
meet these challenges, this paper develops the dual power spectrum manifold
$\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ as the dual space of
$\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$. For each affine invariant geometric measure
on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, we show that there exists an equivalent
function named induced potential function on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$. By the
induced potential function, the measurements of the dissimilarity between two
matrices can be implemented on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$, and the geometric
detectors can be reformulated as the form related to the power spectrum. The
induced potential function leads to two contributions: 1) The enhancement of
the geometric detector, which is formulated as an optimization problem
concerning $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, is transformed to an equivalent
and simpler optimization on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$. In the presented example
of the enhancement, the closed-form solution, instead of the gradient descent
method, is provided through the equivalent optimization. 2) The detection
performance is analyzed based on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$, and the advantageous
characteristics, which benefit the detection performance, can be deduced by
analyzing the corresponding power spectrum to the maximal point of the induced
potential function.

  Method and Beyond",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG, a.k.a. Chambolle and Pock method)
is a well-studied algorithm for minimax optimization problems with a bilinear
interaction term. Recently, PDHG is used as the base algorithm for a new LP
solver PDLP that aims to solve large LP instances by taking advantage of modern
computing resources, such as GPU and distributed system. Most of the previous
convergence results of PDHG are either on duality gap or on distance to the
optimal solution set, which are usually hard to compute during the solving
process. In this paper, we propose a new progress metric for analyzing PDHG,
which we dub infimal sub-differential size (IDS), by utilizing the geometry of
PDHG iterates. IDS is a natural extension of the gradient norm of smooth
problems to non-smooth problems, and it is tied with KKT error in the case of
LP. Compared to traditional progress metrics for PDHG, IDS always has a finite
value and can be computed only using information of the current solution. We
show that IDS monotonically decays, and it has an $\mathcal O(\frac{1}{k})$
sublinear rate for solving convex-concave primal-dual problems, and it has a
linear convergence rate if the problem further satisfies a regularity condition
that is satisfied by applications such as linear programming, quadratic
programming, TV-denoising model, etc. The simplicity of our analysis and the
monotonic decay of IDS suggest that IDS is a natural progress metric to analyze
PDHG. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that the primal-dual gap has
$\mathcal O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$ convergence rate for the last iteration of
PDHG for convex-concave problems. The analysis and results on PDHG can be
directly generalized to other primal-dual algorithms, for example, proximal
point method (PPM), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and
linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (l-ADMM).

resolve the horizon-scale emission from sources in the immediate vicinity of

highly lensed features of black hole images -- photon rings -- that will
provide particularly sharp probes of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the
particular case of the supermassive black hole M87*, our goal is to explore a
wide variety of accretion flows onto a Kerr black hole and to understand their
corresponding images and visibilities. We are particularly interested in the
visibility on baselines to space, which encodes the photon ring shape and whose
measurement could provide a stringent test of the Kerr hypothesis. We develop a
fully analytical model of stationary, axisymmetric accretion flows with a
variable disk thickness and a matter four-velocity that can smoothly
interpolate between purely azimuthal rotation and purely radial infall. We then
determine the observational appearance of such flows, taking care to include
the effects of thermal synchrotron emission and absorption. Our images
generically display a ""wedding cake"" structure composed of discrete, narrow
photon rings (n=1,2,...) stacked on top of broader primary emission that
surrounds a central brightness depression of model-dependent size. We find that
the ""black hole shadow"" is a model-dependent phenomenon -- even for diffuse,
optically thin sources -- and should not be regarded as a generic prediction of
general relativity. At 230 GHz, the n=1 ring is always visible, but the n=2
ring is sometimes suppressed due to absorption. At 345 GHz, the medium is
optically thinner and the n=2 ring displays clear signatures in both the image
and visibility domains, identifying this frequency as more promising for future
space-VLBI measurements of the photon ring shape.

powerful tool for studying MPs in clusters. In this work, we evaluate the
efficiency of the designed filters for the MCI/CSST in revealing MPs in

Sequences possessing large values of MF are of great interest to a rich list of
disciplines - from physics and chemistry to digital communications, signal
processing, and cryptography. Throughout the last half-century, manifold
approaches and strategies were proposed for finding such sequences. Referenced
as one of the most difficult optimization problems, Golay wrote that it is a
""challenging and charming problem"". His publications on this problem spanned
more than 20 years. Golay himself introduced one beneficial class of sequences,
called skew-symmetric sequences, or finite binary sequences with odd lengths
with alternate autocorrelation values equal to 0. Their sieving construction
greatly reduces the computational efforts of finding binary sequences with odd
lengths and high MF. Having this in mind, the majority of papers to be found in
the literature are focused solely on this class, preferring them over binary
sequences with even lengths. In this work, a new class of finite binary
sequences with even lengths with alternate autocorrelation absolute values
equal to 1 is presented. We show that the MF values of the new class are
closely related to the MF values of adjacent classes of skew-symmetric
sequences. We further introduce new sub-classes of sequences using the
partition number problem and the notion of potentials, measured by helper
ternary sequences. Throughout our experiments, MF records for binary sequences
with many lengths less than 225, and all lengths greater than 225, are
discovered. Binary sequences of all lengths, odd or even, less than $2^8$ and

physically interesting fact that scalar field configurations with a non-minimal
{\it positive} coupling to the spatially-dependent Maxwell electromagnetic
invariant ${\cal F}\equiv F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ can also be supported in
black-hole spacetimes. Intriguingly, it is explicitly proved that the
positive-coupling black-hole spontaneous scalarization phenomenon is induced by
a non-zero combination $a\cdot Q\neq0$ of {\it both} the spin $a\equiv J/M$ and
the electric charge $Q$ of the central supporting black hole. Using analytical
techniques we prove that the regime of existence of the positive-coupling
spontaneous scalarization phenomenon of Kerr-Newman black holes with horizon
radius $r_+(M,a,Q)$ and a non-zero electric charge $Q$ (which, in principle,
may be arbitrarily small) is determined by the {\it critical onset line}
$(a/r_+)_{\text{critical}}=\sqrt{2}-1$. In particular, spinning and charged
Kerr-Newman black holes in the composed Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field theory
are spontaneously scalarized by the positively coupled fields in the
dimensionless charge regime $0<{{Q}\over{M}}\leq\sqrt{2\sqrt{2}-2}$ if their
dimensionless spin parameters lie above the critical onset line
${{a(Q)}\over{M}}\geq
\big[{{a(Q)}\over{M}}\big]_{\text{critical}}={{1+\sqrt{1-2(2-\sqrt{2}){(Q/M)}^2}}\over{2\sqrt{2}}}$.

to unexpected faults. Therefore, bearing fault diagnosis and condition
monitoring is essential for reducing operational costs and downtime in numerous
industries. In various production conditions, bearings can be operated under a
range of loads and speeds, which causes different vibration patterns associated
with each fault type. Normal data is ample as systems usually work in desired
conditions. On the other hand, fault data is rare, and in many conditions,
there is no data recorded for the fault classes. Accessing fault data is
crucial for developing data-driven fault diagnosis tools that can improve both
the performance and safety of operations. To this end, a novel algorithm based
on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) is introduced. Trained
on the normal and fault data on any actual fault conditions, this algorithm
generates fault data from normal data of target conditions. The proposed method
is validated on a real-world bearing dataset, and fault data are generated for
different conditions. Several state-of-the-art classifiers and visualization
models are implemented to evaluate the quality of the synthesized data. The
results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

distance from water point, median speed, and median estimated horizontal
position error. We combine the information available from the accelerometry and
GNSS data via two approaches. The first approach is based on concatenating the
features extracted from both sensor data and feeding the concatenated feature
vector into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. The second approach is
based on fusing the posterior probabilities predicted by two MLP classifiers.
The input to each classifier is the features extracted from the data of one
sensing mode. We evaluate the performance of the developed multimodal animal
behavior classification algorithms using two real-world datasets collected via
smart cattle collar tags and ear tags. The leave-one-animal-out
cross-validation results show that both approaches improve the classification
performance appreciably compared with using data of only one sensing mode. This
is more notable for the infrequent but important behaviors of walking and
drinking. The algorithms developed based on both approaches require little
computational and memory resources hence are suitable for implementation on
embedded systems of our collar tags and ear tags. However, the multimodal
animal behavior classification algorithm based on posterior probability fusion
is preferable to the one based on feature concatenation as it delivers better
classification accuracy, has less computational and memory complexity, is more
robust to sensor data failure, and enjoys better modularity.

challenge for space-borne detectors operating in the $\approx 0.1$ mHz to
$\approx 10$ mHz range. Given the likely prospect that there will be multiple
such detectors, namely LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, with overlapping operational
periods in the next decade, it is important to examine the extent to which the
joint analysis of their data can benefit GB resolution and parameter
estimation. To investigate this, we use realistic simulated LISA and Taiji data
containing the set of $30\times 10^6$ GBs used in the first LISA data challenge
(Radler), and an iterative source extraction method called GBSIEVER introduced
in an earlier work. We find that a coherent network analysis of LISA-Taiji data
boosts the number of confirmed sources by $\approx 75\%$ over that from a
single detector. The residual after subtracting out the reported sources from
the data of any one of the detectors is much closer to the confusion noise
expected from an ideal, but infeasible, multisource resolution method that
perfectly removes all sources above a given signal-to-noise ratio threshold.
While parameter estimation for sources common to both the single detector and
network improves broadly in line with the enhanced signal to noise ratio of GW
sources in the latter, deviation from the scaling of error variance predicted
by Fisher information analysis is observed for a subset of the parameters.

fainter SNe Ia residing in galaxies with larger line strengths. We also find a
trend (3$\sigma$) between Hubble residual and the Balmer decrement (a measure

combined with the scarcity of the wireless spectrum, have motivated a
significant effort towards increasing the throughput of wireless networks. One
of the major factors which limits the throughput in wireless communications
networks is the accuracy of the time synchronization between the nodes in the
network, as a higher throughput requires higher synchronization accuracy.
Existing time synchronization schemes, and particularly, methods based on
pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs), which are the focus of the current work, have
the advantage of simple implementation and achieve high accuracy when the nodes
are closely located, yet tend to achieve poor synchronization performance for
distant nodes. In this study, we propose a robust PCO-based time
synchronization algorithm which retains the simple structure of existing
approaches while operating reliably and converging quickly for both distant and
closely located nodes. This is achieved by augmenting PCO-based synchronization
with deep learning tools that are trainable in a distributed manner, thus
allowing the nodes to train their neural network component of the
synchronization algorithm without requiring additional exchange of information
or central coordination. The numerical results show that our proposed deep
learning-aided scheme is notably robust to propagation delays resulting from
deployments over large areas, and to relative clock frequency offsets. It is
also shown that the proposed approach rapidly attains full (i.e., clock
frequency and phase) synchronization for all nodes in the wireless network,
while the classic model-based implementation does not.

electronic excitation prefers to stabilize the FM state over the AFM one, and
once the critical photocarrier concentration ({\alpha}_c) is reached, an MPT
from AFM phase to FM phase takes place. This theory has been confirmed by
performing first-principles calculations on a series of two-dimensional (2D)
van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets and a linear relationship between
{\alpha}_c and the intrinsic material parameters is obtained. Importantly, our

employs a wavelet neural network (WNN) on optimally enhanced retinal images
features. To avoid tedious and error prone manual analysis of retinal images by
ophthalmologists, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) substantially aids in robust
diagnosis. Our objective is to introduce a CAD system with a fresh approach.
Retinal image quality improvement is attempted in two phases. The retinal image
preprocessing phase improves the brightness and contrast of the image through
quantile based histogram modification. It is followed by the image enhancement
phase, which involves multi scale morphological operations using image specific
dynamic structuring elements for the retinal structure enrichment. Graph based
retinal image features in terms of Local Graph Structures (LGS) and Graph
Shortest Path (GSP) statistics are extracted from various directions along with
the statistical features from the enhanced retinal dataset. WNN is employed to
classify glaucoma retinal images with a suitable wavelet activation function.
The performance of the WNN classifier is compared with multilayer perceptron
neural networks with various datasets. The results show our approach is
superior to the existing approaches.

on robust rank-based statistics, e.g., median, to find malicious updates.
However, implementing privacy-preserving rank-based statistics is nontrivial

graph analytical problems. Hence, they have become the \emph{de facto} solution
in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased
results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have
empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a
significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have
systematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to
biased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the
structure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely
limits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In
this paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias
in GNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel post-hoc explanation framework to
identify two edge sets that can maximally account for the exhibited bias and
maximally contribute to the fairness level of the GNN prediction for any given
node, respectively. Such explanations not only provide a comprehensive
understanding of bias/fairness of GNN predictions but also have practical
significance in building an effective yet fair GNN model. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
towards delivering effective structural explanations for the bias of GNNs.

Inspired by robust regression, we introduce doubly residual link structure to
make prediction more robust.Built upon Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
theorem, we explicitly introduce feature selection, model ensemble, and a tree

robustness and representation power of TreeDRNet. Unlike previous deep models
for sequential forecasting work, TreeDRNet is built entirely on multilayer

  finite element exterior calculus",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns the discretizations in pair of adjoint operators between
Hilbert spaces so that the adjoint properties can be preserved. Due to the
finite-dimensional essence of discretized operators, a new framework, theory of
partially adjoint operators, is motivated and presented in this paper, so that
adjoint properties can be figured out for finite-dimensional operators which
can not be non-trivially densely defined in other background spaces. A formal
methodology is presented under the framework to construct partially adjoint
discretizations by a conforming discretization (CD) and an
accompanied-by-conforming discretization (ABCD) for each of the operators.
Moreover, the methodology leads to an asymptotic uniformity of an infinite
family of finite-dimensional operators. The validities of the theoretical
framework and the formal construction of discretizations are illustrated by a
systematic family of in-pair discretizations of the adjoint exterior
differential operators.
  The adjoint properties concerned in the paper are the closed range theorem
and the strong dualities, whose preservations have not been well studied yet.
Quantified versions of the closed range theorem are established for both
adjoint operators and partially adjoint discretizations. The notion
Poincare-Alexander-Lefschetz (P-A-L for short) type duality is borrowed for
operator theory, and horizontal and vertical P-A-L dualities are figured out
for adjoint operators and their analogues are established for partially adjoint
discretizations. Particularly by partially adjoint discretizations of exterior
differential operators, the Poincare-Lefschetz duality is preserved as an
identity, which was not yet obtained before.

shows efficacy in various types of natural language processing (NLP) and

approximate the 1-Wasserstein distance by the tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD),
where TWD is a 1-Wasserstein distance with tree-based embedding and can be
computed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes on a tree. More
specifically, we propose a simple yet efficient L1-regularized approach to
learning the weights of the edges in a tree. To this end, we first show that
the 1-Wasserstein approximation problem can be formulated as a distance
approximation problem using the shortest path distance on a tree. We then show
that the shortest path distance can be represented by a linear model and can be
formulated as a Lasso-based regression problem. Owing to the convex
formulation, we can obtain a globally optimal solution efficiently. Moreover,
we propose a tree-sliced variant of these methods. Through experiments, we
demonstrated that the weighted TWD can accurately approximate the original

accretion burst, which is closely associated with flares of several class II
methanol maser transitions, and, later, a 22 GHz water maser flare. Water maser
flares provide an invaluable insight into ejection events associated with
accretion bursts. Although the short timescale of the 22 GHz water maser flare
made it impossible to carry out a very long baseline interferometry
observation, we could track it with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).
The evolution of the spatial structure of the 22 GHz water masers and their
association with the continuum sources in the region is studied with the VLA
during two epochs, pre- and post-H2O maser flare. A drastic change in the
distribution of the water masers is revealed: in contrast to the four maser
groups detected during epoch I, only two newly formed clusters are detected
during epoch II. The 22 GHz water masers associated with the bursting source
MM1 changed in morphology and emission velocity extent. Clear evidence of the
influence of the accretion burst on the ejection from G358.93-0.03-MM1 is
presented. The accretion event has also potentially affected a region with a
radius of ~2'' (~13 500 AU at 6.75 kpc), suppressing water masers associated

modeling is applied to 6,000 star particles for each system, to recover the
underlying matter distribution. The stellar or dark matter component
individually is poorly recovered, but the total profile is constrained more
reasonably. The mass within the half-mass radius of tracers is recovered the
tightest, and the mass between 200 and 300 pc, $M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$, is
constrained ensemble unbiasedly, with a scatter of 0.167 dex. If using 2,000
particles and only line-of-sight velocities with typical errors, the scatter in
$M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$ is increased by $\sim$50%. Quiescent Sagittarius
dSph-like systems and star-forming systems with strong outflows show distinct
features, with $M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$ mostly under-estimated for the former,
and likely over-estimated for the latter. The biases correlate with the
dynamical status, which is a result of contraction motions due to tidal effects
in quiescent systems or galactic winds in star-forming systems, driving them
out of equilibrium. After including Gaia DR3 proper motion errors, we find
proper motions can be as useful as line-of-sight velocities for nearby systems
at $<\sim$60 kpc. By extrapolating the actual density profiles and the
dynamical constraints down to scales below the resolution, we find the mass
within 150 pc can be constrained ensemble unbiasedly, with a scatter of
$\sim$0.255 dex. In the end, we show that the contraction of member stars in
nearby systems is detectable based on Gaia DR3 proper motion errors.

found that substitution of Cu for Fe enhances the low-energy spin excitations
($\le$ 100 meV), especially around the (0.5, 0.5) point, and leaves the
high-energy magnetic excitations intact. In contrast to the expectation that Cu
with spin 1/2 will dilute the magnetic moments contributed by Fe with a larger
spin, we find that the 10% Cu doping enlarges the effective fluctuating moment
from 2.85 to 3.13 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Fe, although there is no long- or short-range
magnetic order around (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 0). The presence of enhanced
magnetic excitations in the 10% Cu doped sample which is in the insulating
state indicates that the magnetic excitations must have some contributions from
the local moments, reflecting the dual nature of the magnetism in iron-based
superconductors. We attribute the substitution effects to the localization of
the itinerant electrons induced by Cu dopants. These results also indicate that
the Cu doping does not act as electron donor as in a rigid-band shift model,
but more as scattering centers that localize the system.

forward propagation, backward propagation and weight gradient update
procedures. Compared to the existing ones, our new implementations can incur
much less communication overhead between registers and cache. Experimental
results on two ARMv8 CPUs show that our implementations can averagely deliver

adding speaker regularization loss, replacing speaker embedding with zero

physics. We focus mainly on the annual and to a lesser extent semi-annual
components. Maps of the first three components of SLP (that together comprise
more than 85% of the data variance) reveal interesting symmetries. The trend is
very stable and forms a triskel structure that can be modeled as Taylor-Couette
flow of mode 3. The annual component is characterized by a large negative
anomaly extending over Eurasia in the NH Summer (and the opposite in the NH
Winter) and three large positive anomalies over Australia and the southern tips
of South America and South Africa in the SH Spring (and the opposite in the SH
Autumn) forming a triskel. The semi-annual component is characterized by three
positive anomalies (an irregular triskel) in the NH Spring and Autumn (and the
opposite in the NH Summer and Winter), and in the SH Spring and Autumn by a
strong stable pattern consisting of three large negative anomalies forming a
clear triskel within the 40$^{\circ}$-60$^{\circ}$ annulus formed by the
southern oceans. A large positive anomaly centered over Antarctica, with its
maximum displaced toward Australia, and a smaller one centered over Southern

signal processing technologies of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output

such as Gaussian signaling and independent identically distributed (IID)
channel matrices. As a result, this paper considers a generalized MU-MIMO
(GMU-MIMO) system with more general assumptions, i.e., arbitrarily fixed input
distributions, and general unitarily-invariant channel matrices. However, there
is still no accurate capacity analysis and capacity optimal transceiver with
practical complexity for GMU-MIMO under the constraint of coding. To address
these issues, inspired by the replica method, the constrained sum capacity of
coded GMU-MIMO with fixed input distribution is calculated by using the
celebrated mutual information and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) lemma and
the MMSE optimality of orthogonal/vector approximate message passing
(OAMP/VAMP). Then, a capacity optimal multiuser OAMP/VAMP receiver is proposed,
whose achievable rate is proved to be equal to the constrained sum capacity.
Moreover, a design principle of multi-user codes is presented for the multiuser
OAMP/VAMP, based on which a kind of practical multi-user low-density
parity-check (MU-LDPC) code is designed. Numerical results show that
finite-length performances of the proposed MU-LDPC codes with multi-user
OAMP/VAMP are about 2 dB away from the constrained sum capacity and outperform
those of the existing state-of-art methods.

structures $\mathcal{C}$ of one or several binary relations definable in
Monadic Second Order Logic MSOL. It states that the number of such structures
on the set $[n]$ is modularly C-finite (MC-finite). In previous work we
extended this to structures definable in CMSOL, MSOL extended with modular
counting quantifiers. The first author also showed that the Specker-Blatter
Theorem does not hold for one quaternary relation (2003).
  If the vocabulary allows a constant symbol $c$, there are $n$ possible
interpretations on $[n]$ for $c$. We say that a constant $c$ is {\em
hard-wired} if $c$ is always interpreted by the same element $j \in [n]$. In
this paper we show:
  1. The Specker-Blatter Theorem also holds for CMSOL when hard-wired constants
are allowed. The proof method of Specker and Blatter does not work in this
case.
  2. The Specker-Blatter Theorem does not hold already for $\mathcal{C}$ with
one ternary relation definable in First Order Logic FOL. This was left open
since 1983.
  Using hard-wired constants allows us to show MC-finiteness of counting
functions of various restricted partition functions which were not known to be
MC-finite till now. Among them we have the restricted Bell numbers $B_{r,A}$,
restricted Stirling numbers of the second kind $S_{r,A}$ or restricted
Lah-numbers $L_{r,A}$. Here $r$ is an non-negative integer and $A$ is an
ultimately periodic set of non-negative integers.

the configurational entropy and the stability point for each realistic equation
of state? In view of the above question, we focus on neutron stars, quark
stars, as well as on the third family of compact stars (hybrid stars), where a
possible phase transition may lead to the existence of twin stars (stars with
equal mass but different radius). In each case, we use a large set of equations
of state investigating the possibility to find correlations between the
stability region obtained from the traditional perturbation methods to the one
obtained by the minimum of configurational entropy. We found that the suggested
prediction of the stability by the minimization of the configurational entropy,
concerning neutron stars and quark stars, does not have, at least
quantitatively, universal validity. However, in several cases it qualitatively
predicts the existence of the stability point. In conclusion, the
configurational entropy, can be considered as an additional tool which enters
into the quiver for studying the stability of compact objects such as for

granularities depending on attributes (e.g., poverty rate and crime rate),
modeling such data is not straightforward. This article offers a multi-output
Gaussian process (MoGP) model that infers functions for attributes using
multiple aggregate datasets of respective granularities. In the proposed model,
the function for each attribute is assumed to be a dependent GP modeled as a
linear mixing of independent latent GPs. We design an observation model with an
aggregation process for each attribute; the process is an integral of the GP
over the corresponding support. We also introduce a prior distribution of the
mixing weights, which allows a knowledge transfer across domains (e.g., cities)
by sharing the prior. This is advantageous in such a situation where the
spatially aggregated dataset in a city is too coarse to interpolate; the
proposed model can still make accurate predictions of attributes by utilizing
aggregate datasets in other cities. The inference of the proposed model is
based on variational Bayes, which enables one to learn the model parameters
using the aggregate datasets from multiple domains. The experiments demonstrate
that the proposed model outperforms in the task of refining coarse-grained

minimize a weighted sum of service delay and resource consumption cost, which
is NP-complete. Then, the joint VNF P&R problem is decoupled into two iterative
subtasks: placement subtask and routing subtask. Each subtask consists of
multiple concurrent parallel sequential decision processes. By invoking the
deep deterministic policy gradient method and multi-agent technique, an
MADRL-P&R framework is designed to perform the two subtasks. The new joint

decoder diversity in the waterfall region, by specializing BP-RNN decoders to
specific classes of errors, with absorbing set support. We further combine our
approach with an ordered statistics decoding (OSD) post-processing step, which
effectively leverages the bit-error rate optimization deriving from the use of
the binary cross-entropy loss function. We show that a single specialized
BP-RNN decoder combines better than BP with the OSD post-processing step.
Moreover, combining OSD post-processing with the diversity brought by the use
of multiple BP-RNN decoders, provides an efficient way to bridge the gap to
maximum likelihood decoding.

the time series length T tends to infinity, and in the small-T-case, where T is
a fixed natural number. The theoretical analysis of the paper is complemented

valuable since they provide insights into the dynamics. Dual-unitary models are
examples in one spatial dimension where this is possible. These brick-wall
quantum circuits consist of local gates, which remain unitary not only in time,
but also when interpreted as evolutions along the spatial directions. However,
this setting of unitary dynamics does not directly apply to real-world systems
due to their imperfect isolation, and it is thus imperative to consider the
impact of noise to dual-unitary dynamics and its exact solvability.
  In this work we generalise the ideas of dual-unitarity to obtain exact
solutions in noisy quantum circuits, where each unitary gate is substituted by
a local quantum channel. Exact solutions are obtained by demanding that the
noisy gates yield a valid quantum channel not only in time, but also when
interpreted as evolutions along one or both of the spatial directions and
possibly backwards in time. This gives rise to new families of models that
satisfy different combinations of unitality constraints along the space and
time directions. We provide exact solutions for the spatio-temporal correlation
functions, spatial correlations after a quantum quench, and the structure of
steady states for these families of models. We show that noise unbiased around
the dual-unitary family leads to exactly solvable models, even if
dual-unitarity is strongly violated. We prove that any channel unital in both
space and time directions can be written as an affine combination of a
particular class of dual-unitary gates. Finally, we extend the definition of
solvable initial states to matrix-product density operators. We completely
classify them when their tensor admits a local purification.

characterisation of how it couples to instrumental response. In this work, we
present characterisation of antenna gain patterns for the Large-aperture

modelled with a log-polynomial, and the 21cm signal identified with high
accuracy. However, uncertainties on the soil properties lead to
\textperthousand\ changes in the chromaticity that can bias the signal
recovery. The bias can be up to a factor of two in amplitude and up to few \%
in the frequency location. These effects do not appear to be mitigated by
larger ground planes, conversely gain patterns with larger ground planes
exhibit more complex frequency structure, significantly compromising the

resolved by direct imaging (Ab, Ad, B, C, D) as well as a compact sub-system
(Aa1, Aa2, Ac1, Ac2). Its geometry was already determined on the basis of
extensive photometric, spectroscopic and interferometric observations. However,
the fundamental absolute parameters are still not known precisely enough. We
use an advanced N-body model to account for all mutual gravitational
perturbations among the four close components, and all observational data
types, including: astrometry, radial velocities, eclipse timing variations,
squared visibilities, closure phases, triple products, normalized spectra, and
spectral-energy distribution (SED). The respective model has 38 free
parameters, namely three sets of orbital elements, component masses, and their
basic radiative properties ($T$, $\log g$, $v_{\rm rot}$). We revised the
fundamental parameters of QZ Car as follows. For a model with the nominal
extinction coefficient $R_V \equiv A_V/E(B-V) = 3.1$, the best-fit masses are
$m_1 = 26.1\,M_{\rm S}$, $m_2 = 32.3\,M_{\rm S}$, $m_3 = 70.3\,M_{\rm S}$, $m_4
= 8.8\,M_{\rm S}$, with uncertainties of the order of $2\,M_{\rm S}$, and the
system distance $d = (2800\pm 100)\,{\rm pc}$. In an alternative model, where
we increased the weights of RV and TTV observations and relaxed the SED
constraints, because extinction can be anomalous with $R_V \sim 3.4$, the
distance is smaller, $d = (2450\pm 100)\,{\rm pc}$. This would correspond to
that of Collinder 228 cluster. Independently, this is confirmed by dereddening
of the SED, which is only then consistent with the early-type classification
(O9.7Ib for Aa1, O8III for Ac1). Future modelling should also account for an
accretion disk around Ac2 component.

Process Regression to fit the gradient profiles and identify the local extrema
to determine the scales associate with these features. Around the valley, we
identify three types of distinct local minima, corresponding to caustics of
particles orbiting around halos. The appearance and depth of the three caustics
depend significantly on the direction defined by the local tidal field,
formation time and environment of halos. The first caustic is located at a
radius r>0.8R_{200}, corresponding to the splashback feature, and is dominated
by particles at their first apocenter after infall. The second and third
caustics, around 0.6R_{200} and 0.4R_{200} respectively, can be determined
reliably only for old halos. The first caustic is always the most prominent
feature along T_3, but may not be the case along T_1 or in azimuthally-averaged
profiles, suggesting that caution must be taken when using averaged profiles to
investigate the splashback radius. We find that the splashback feature is
approximately isotropic when proper separations are made between the first and
the other caustics. We also identify a peak feature located at $\sim$
2.5R_{200} in the density gradient profile. This feature is the most prominent
along T_1 and is produced by mass accumulations from the structure outside
halos. We also discuss the origins of these features and their observational

cosmic ray spectrum at an energy of 3 PeV, which is called the knee. The
solution of the problem is associated with the determination of the nuclear
composition of cosmic rays in the knee area. The conclusions of this work are
based on the analysis of the characteristics of the EAS cores obtained using
X-ray emulsion chambers. According to these data, a number of anomalous effects
are observed in the knee region, such as scaling violation in the spectra of
secondary hadrons, an excess of muons in EAS with gamma families and others. At
the same energies equivalent to 1-100 PeV the laboratory system colliders show
scaling behavior. So analysis of the data on the EAS cores suggests that the
knee in their spectrum is formed by a component of cosmic rays of a non-nuclear
nature, possibly consisting of stable (quasi-stable) particles of hypothetical
strange quark matter, which named strangelets. This is the only model of the
knee compatible with the magnetic rigidity of the nuclear spectra break R=100
TV. In fact, stranglets are stable heavy quasi-nuclei with a positive electric
charge of Z=30-1000, so the mechanism of their acceleration coincides with the
nuclear one. The break of the cosmic ray spectrum can be associated with a
significantly larger mass of strangelets compared to nuclei.

plane are three-dimensional complex entangled structures whose topological
properties can be encoded in any generating cell of its infinite planar
representation. Such a periodic cell, called motif, is a specific type of link
diagram embedded on a torus consisting of essential simple closed curves for
weaves, or null-homotopic for polycatenanes. In this paper, we introduce a
methodology to construct such motifs using the concept of polygonal link
transformations. This approach generalizes to the Euclidean plane existing
methods to construct polyhedral links in the three-dimensional space. Then, we
will state our main result which allows one to predict the type of motif that
can be built from a given planar periodic tiling and a chosen polygonal link

  Problems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is well-known that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial
examples. Existing studies of adversarial training have made great progress
against this challenge. As a typical trait, they often assume that the class
distribution is overall balanced. However, long-tail datasets are ubiquitous in
a wide spectrum of applications, where the amount of head class instances is
larger than the tail classes. Under such a scenario, AUC is a much more
reasonable metric than accuracy since it is insensitive toward class
distribution. Motivated by this, we present an early trial to explore
adversarial training methods to optimize AUC. The main challenge lies in that
the positive and negative examples are tightly coupled in the objective
function. As a direct result, one cannot generate adversarial examples without
a full scan of the dataset. To address this issue, based on a concavity
regularization scheme, we reformulate the AUC optimization problem as a saddle
point problem, where the objective becomes an instance-wise function. This
leads to an end-to-end training protocol. Furthermore, we provide a convergence
guarantee of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis differs from the existing
studies since the algorithm is asked to generate adversarial examples by
calculating the gradient of a min-max problem. Finally, the extensive
experimental results show the performance and robustness of our algorithm in
three long-tail datasets.

causes signal loss in free-space optical communication as the light beam
spreads and wanders at the receiving end. Frequency and/or time division
multiplexing adaptive optics (AO) techniques have been used to conjugate this
kind of wavefront distortion. However, if the signal beam moves relative to the
atmosphere, the AO system performance degrades due to high temporal
anisoplanatism. Here we solve this problem by adding a pioneer beacon that is
spatially separated from the signal beam with time delay between spatially
separated pulses. More importantly, our protocol works irrespective of the
signal beam intensity and hence is also applicable to secret quantum
communication. In particular, using semi-empirical atmospheric turbulence
calculation, we show that for low earth orbit satellite-to-ground decoy state
quantum key distribution with the satellite at zenith angle $< 30^\circ$, our
method increases the key rate by at least $215\%$ and $40\%$ for satellite

observing Solar System objects (SSOs) since the beginning of its operations in
August 2014. The Gaia data release three (DR3) includes, for the first time,
the mean reflectance spectra of a selected sample of 60 518 SSOs, primarily
asteroids, observed between August 5, 2014, and May 28, 2017. Each reflectance
spectrum was derived from measurements obtained by means of the Blue and Red
photometers (BP/RP), which were binned in 16 discrete wavelength bands. We
describe the processing of the Gaia spectral data of SSOs, explaining both the
criteria used to select the subset of asteroid spectra published in Gaia DR3,
and the different steps of our internal validation procedures. In order to
further assess the quality of Gaia SSO reflectance spectra, we carried out
external validation against SSO reflectance spectra obtained from ground-based
and space-borne telescopes and available in the literature. For each selected
SSO, an epoch reflectance was computed by dividing the calibrated spectrum
observed by the BP/RP at each transit on the focal plane by the mean spectrum
of a solar analogue. The latter was obtained by averaging the Gaia spectral
measurements of a selected sample of stars known to have very similar spectra
to that of the Sun. Finally, a mean of the epoch reflectance spectra was
calculated in 16 spectral bands for each SSO. The agreement between Gaia mean
reflectance spectra and those available in the literature is good for bright
SSOs, regardless of their taxonomic spectral class. We identify an increase in
the spectral slope of S-type SSOs with increasing phase angle. Moreover, we
show that the spectral slope increases and the depth of the 1 um absorption
band decreases for increasing ages of S-type asteroid families.

metasurfaces. Their resonant properties are intrinsic to the band structure of

the high sensitivity of excitons to the medium's electron density, the first

modelling work is the only way we can answer how much we know about any
phenomenon. With quantitative science now highly influential in the public

conclusions with sufficient rigour to produce useful, reproducible results.
Incomplete consideration of model-based uncertainties can lead to false
conclusions with real world impacts. Despite these potentially damaging
consequences, uncertainty consideration is incomplete both within and across
scientific fields. We take a unique interdisciplinary approach and conduct a
systematic audit of model-related uncertainty quantification from seven
scientific fields, spanning the biological, physical, and social sciences. Our
results show no single field is achieving complete consideration of model
uncertainties, but together we can fill the gaps. We propose opportunities to
improve the quantification of uncertainty through use of a source framework for
uncertainty consideration, model type specific guidelines, improved
presentation, and shared best practice. We also identify shared outstanding
challenges (uncertainty in input data, balancing trade-offs, error propagation,
and defining how much uncertainty is required). Finally, we make nine concrete
recommendations for current practice (following good practice guidelines and an
uncertainty checklist, presenting uncertainty numerically, and propagating
model-related uncertainty into conclusions), future research priorities
(uncertainty in input data, quantifying uncertainty in complex models, and the
importance of missing uncertainty in different contexts), and general research
standards across the sciences (transparency about study limitations and
dedicated uncertainty sections of manuscripts).

pricing is one of the useful schemes to eliminate traffic congestion in

networks are usually large and complicated, and behavior of road users is
uncertain. To account for this challenge, this work proposes a dynamic
congestion pricing method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). It is
designed to eliminate traffic congestion based on observable data in general
large-scale road networks, by leveraging the data-driven nature of deep
reinforcement learning. One of the novel elements of the proposed method is the
distributed and cooperative learning scheme. Specifically, the DRL is
implemented by a spatial-temporally distributed manner, and cooperation among
DRL agents is established by novel techniques we call spatially shared reward

efficient learning in large-scale networks. The numerical experiments using
Sioux Falls Network showed that the proposed method works well thanks to the

computationally expensive, and the sequences may evolve over time. K-medoids or
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is commonly used to cluster sequences since
it supports alignment-based distances, and the k-centers being actual data
items helps with cluster interpretability. However, offline k-medoids has no
support for concept drift, while also being prohibitively expensive for
clustering data streams. We therefore propose SECLEDS, a streaming variant of
the k-medoids algorithm with constant memory footprint. SECLEDS has two unique
properties: i) it uses multiple medoids per cluster, producing stable
high-quality clusters, and ii) it handles concept drift using an intuitive
Medoid Voting scheme for approximating cluster distances. Unlike existing
adaptive algorithms that create new clusters for new concepts, SECLEDS follows
a fundamentally different approach, where the clusters themselves evolve with
an evolving stream. Using real and synthetic datasets, we empirically
demonstrate that SECLEDS produces high-quality clusters regardless of drift,
stream size, data dimensionality, and number of clusters. We compare against
three popular stream and batch clustering algorithms. The state-of-the-art
BanditPAM is used as an offline benchmark. SECLEDS achieves comparable F1 score
to BanditPAM while reducing the number of required distance computations by
83.7%. Importantly, SECLEDS outperforms all baselines by 138.7% when the stream
contains drift. We also cluster real network traffic, and provide evidence that
SECLEDS can support network bandwidths of up to 1.08 Gbps while using the

linearly, containing one model for every combination of parameter values. Here
we investigate alternative methods of sampling parameters, including random
sampling and Latin hypercube (LH) sampling, and how these compare to linearly
sampled grids. We use a random forest to analyse the performance of these grids
for two different models, as well as investigate the information content of the
particular model grid from Goyal et al. 2019. We also use nested-sampling to
implement mock atmospheric retrievals on simulated JWST transmission spectra by
interpolating on linearly sampled model grids. Our results show that random or
LH sampling out-performs linear sampling in parameter predictability for our
higher dimensional models, requiring fewer models in the grid, and thus
allowing for more computationally intensive forward models to be used. We also
find that using a traditional retrieval with interpolation on a linear grid can
produce biased posterior distributions, especially for parameters with
non-linear effects on the spectrum. In particular, we advise caution when
performing linear interpolation on the C/O ratio, cloud properties, and
metallicity. Finally, we find that the information content analysis of the grid

viscosity, and the thermal conductivity of a relativistic hot boson gas in a
magnetic field using the relativistic kinetic theory within the Chapman-Enskog
method. The order-by-order off-equilibrium distribution function is obtained in
terms of the associate Laguerre polynomial with magnetic field-dependent
coefficients using the relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport
equation. The order-by-order anisotropic transport coefficients are evaluated
in powers of the dimensionless ratio of kinetic energy to the fluid temperature
for finite magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the shear viscosity (in all
order) splits into five different coefficients. Four of them show a magnetic
field dependence as seen in a previous study \cite{Ashutosh1} using the
relaxation time approximation for the collision kernel. On the other hand, bulk
viscosity, which splits into three components (in all order), is independent of
the magnetic field. The thermal conductivity shows a similar splitting but is
field-dependent. The difference in the first and second-order results are
prominent for the thermal conductivities than the shear viscosity; moreover,
the difference in the two results is most evident at low temperatures. The
first and second-order results seem to converge rapidly for high temperatures.

spatio-temporal subspace. Our goal is to investigate the application of ST-RB
methods to the unsteady incompressible Stokes equations, with a particular
focus on stability. High-fidelity simulations are performed using the Finite
Element (FE) method and BDF2 as time marching scheme. We consider two different
ST-RB methods. In the first one - called ST--GRB - space-time model order
reduction is achieved by means of a Galerkin projection; a spatio-temporal
supremizers enrichment procedure is introduced to guarantee stability. The
second method - called ST-PGRB - is characterized by a Petrov-Galerkin
projection, stemming from a suitable minimization of the FOM residual, that
allows to automatically attain stability. The classical RB method - denoted as
SRB-TFO - serves as a baseline for theoretical development. Numerical tests
have been conducted on an idealized symmetric bifurcation geometry and on the
patient-specific one of a femoropopliteal bypass. The results show that both
ST-RB methods provide accurate approximations of the high-fidelity solutions,
while considerably reducing the computational cost. In particular, the ST-PGRB
method exhibits the best performance, as it features a better computational
efficiency while retaining accuracies in accordance with theoretical
expectations.

has been to assume a model of click behavior and to subsequently introduce a
method for unbiasedly estimating preferences under that assumed model. The
success of this approach is evident in that unbiased methods have been found
for an increasing number of behavior models and types of bias. This work aims
to uncover the implicit limitations of the high-level prevalent approach in the
counterfactual LTR field. Thus, in contrast with limitations that follow from
explicit assumptions, our aim is to recognize limitations that the field is
currently unaware of. We do this by inverting the existing approach: we start
by capturing existing methods in generic terms, and subsequently, from these
generic descriptions we derive the click behavior for which these methods can
be unbiased. Our inverted approach reveals that there are indeed implicit
limitations to the counterfactual LTR approach: we find counterfactual
estimation can only produce unbiased methods for click behavior based on affine
transformations. In addition, we also recognize previously undiscussed
limitations of click-modelling and pairwise approaches to click-based LTR. Our
findings reveal that it is impossible for existing approaches to provide
unbiasedness guarantees for all plausible click behavior models.

dialogue system, expects a shorter inference facing the impatience of human
users. Existing work increases inference speed by designing non-autoregressive
models for single-turn SLU tasks but fails to apply to multi-turn SLU in
confronting the dialogue history. The intuitive idea is to concatenate all
historical utterances and utilize the non-autoregressive models directly.
However, this approach seriously misses the salient historical information and
suffers from the uncoordinated-slot problems. To overcome those shortcomings,
we propose a novel model for multi-turn SLU named Salient History Attention
with Layer-Refined Transformer (SHA-LRT), which composes of an SHA module, a
Layer-Refined Mechanism (LRM), and a Slot Label Generation (SLG) task. SHA
captures salient historical information for the current dialogue from both
historical utterances and results via a well-designed history-attention
mechanism. LRM predicts preliminary SLU results from Transformer's middle
states and utilizes them to guide the final prediction, and SLG obtains the
sequential dependency information for the non-autoregressive encoder.
Experiments on public datasets indicate that our model significantly improves
multi-turn SLU performance (17.5% on Overall) with accelerating (nearly 15
times) the inference process over the state-of-the-art baseline as well as
effective on the single-turn SLU tasks.

$\delta$ is independent of $n$ and deteriorates as to become uninformative when
$\delta = \Omega \left(n^{-1/3} \right)$.
  We prove several improvements and extensions of the aforementioned result.
First, keeping the bound on $\alpha(G)$ as above and allowing for $\delta =
\Omega(n^{-1/3})$, we determine the correct order of magnitude of the number of
random edges whose addition to $G$ a.a.s. results in a pancyclic graph. Our

  Assuming the correctness of Chv\'atal's toughness conjecture, allows for the
mitigation of the condition $\alpha(G) = O \left(\delta^2 n \right)$ imposed

determines, for a wide range of values of $\delta(G)$, the correct order of

pancyclicity of $G$.
  For the emergence of nearly spanning cycles, our fourth result determines,

it survives the introduction of mobile charge carriers, all of which are
presently unknown14. To explore these questions, we conduct surface potential
measurements of parallel WSe2 and MoS2 multi-layers with aligned and
anti-aligned configurations of the polar interfaces. We find evenly spaced,
nearly decoupled potential steps, indicating highly confined interfacial
electric fields, which provide means to design multi-state ""ladder
ferroelectrics"". Furthermore, we find that the internal polarization remains
significant upon electrostatic doping of a mobile charge carrier density as
high as 1013 cm-2, with substantial in-plane conductivity. Using
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), we
trace the extra charge redistribution in real and momentum space and identify
an eventual doping-induced depolarization mechanism.

critical role in the construction of smart cities. However, due to the complex
environment in urban scenes, secure and accurate data acquisition brings great
challenges to 3D modeling and scene updating. Optimal trajectory planning of
UAVs and accurate data collection of onboard cameras are non-trivial issues in
urban modeling. This study presents the principle of optimized views
photogrammetry and verifies its precision and potential in large-scale 3D
modeling. Different from oblique photogrammetry, optimized views photogrammetry
uses rough models to generate and optimize UAV trajectories, which is achieved
through the consideration of model point reconstructability and view point
redundancy. Based on the principle of optimized views photogrammetry, this
study first conducts a precision analysis of 3D models by using UAV images of
optimized views photogrammetry and then executes a large-scale case study in
the urban region of Qingdao city, China, to verify its engineering potential.
By using GCPs for image orientation precision analysis and TLS (terrestrial
laser scanning) point clouds for model quality analysis, experimental results
show that optimized views photogrammetry could construct stable image
connection networks and could achieve comparable image orientation accuracy.
Benefiting from the accurate image acquisition strategy, the quality of mesh
models significantly improves, especially for urban areas with serious
occlusions, in which 3 to 5 times of higher accuracy has been achieved.
Besides, the case study in Qingdao city verifies that optimized views
photogrammetry can be a reliable and powerful solution for the large-scale 3D

key concept to understand and predict physical properties of crystalline
materials. A wealth of interesting Hall-type responses in charge, spin and heat
transport are caused by the BC associated to electronic bands inside a solid:
anomalous Hall effects in magnetic materials, and various nonlinear Hall and
Nernst effects in non-magnetic systems that lack inversion symmetry. However,
for the largest class of known materials -- non-magnetic ones with inversion
symmetry -- electronic BC is strictly zero. Here we show that precisely for
these bulk BC-free materials, a finite BC can emerge at their surfaces and
interfaces. This immediately activates certain surfaces in producing Hall-type
transport responses. We demonstrate this by first principles calculations of
the BC at bismuth, mercury-telluride (HgTe) and rhodium surfaces of various
symmetries, revealing the presence of a surface Berry curvature dipole and
associated quantum nonlinear Hall effects at a number of these. This opens up a
plethora of materials to explore and harness the physical effects emerging from

from a surplus process governed by Brownian motion with drift under a drawdown
constraint, i.e. the dividend rate can never decrease below a given fraction
$a$ of its historical maximum. We solve the resulting two-dimensional optimal
control problem and identify the value function as the unique viscosity
solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We then derive
sufficient conditions under which a two-curve strategy is optimal, and show how
to determine its concrete form using calculus of variations. We establish a
smooth-pasting principle and show how it can be used to prove the optimality of
two-curve strategies for sufficiently large initial and maximum dividend rate.
We also give a number of numerical illustrations in which the optimality of the
two-curve strategy can be established for instances with smaller values of the
maximum dividend rate, and the concrete form of the curves can be determined.
One observes that the resulting drawdown strategies nicely interpolate between
the solution for the classical unconstrained dividend problem and the one for a
ratcheting constraint as recently studied in Albrecher et al. (2022). When the
maximum allowed dividend rate tends to infinity, we show a surprisingly simple
and somewhat intriguing limit result in terms of the parameter $a$ for the
surplus level on from which, for sufficiently large current dividend rate, a
take-the-money-and-run strategy is optimal in the presence of the drawdown

numerically obtained exponents satisfy Weyl symmetry relations as well as
generalized parabolicity (proportionality to eigenvalues of the quadratic
Casimir operator). At the same time, the generalized parabolicity is strongly
violated at critical points of metal-insulator transitions, signalling
violation of local conformal invariance. Moreover, in classes D and DIII, even

  Binary Similarity Comparison","Accepted by EAI SecureComm 2022, 20 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cross-architecture binary similarity comparison is essential in many security
applications. Recently, researchers have proposed learning-based approaches to
improve comparison performance. They adopted a paradigm of instruction
pre-training, individual binary encoding, and distance-based similarity
comparison. However, instruction embeddings pre-trained on external code corpus
are not universal in diverse real-world applications. And separately encoding
cross-architecture binaries will accumulate the semantic gap of instruction
sets, limiting the comparison accuracy. This paper proposes a novel
cross-architecture binary similarity comparison approach with multi-relational
instruction association graph. We associate mono-architecture instruction
tokens with context relevance and cross-architecture tokens with potential
semantic correlations from different perspectives. Then we exploit the
relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) to perform type-specific graph
information propagation. Our approach can bridge the gap in the
cross-architecture instruction representation spaces while avoiding the
external pre-training workload. We conduct extensive experiments on basic
block-level and function-level datasets to prove the superiority of our
approach. Furthermore, evaluations on a large-scale real-world IoT malware
reuse function collection show that our approach is valuable for identifying
malware propagated on IoT devices of various architectures.

(DIBs) are important for exploring their origins. However, the Gaia-RVS
spectral window between 846 and 870 nm contains few DIBs, the strong DIB at 862
nm being the only convincingly confirmed one. Here we attempt to confirm the
existence of a broad DIB around 864.8 nm and estimate its characteristics using
the stacked Gaia-RVS spectra of a large number of stars. We study the
correlations between the two DIBs at 862 nm and 864.8 nm, as well as the
interstellar extinction. We obtained spectra of the interstellar medium
absorption by subtracting the stellar components using templates constructed
from real spectra at high Galactic latitudes with low extinctions. We then
stacked the ISM spectra in Galactic coordinates, pixelized by the HEALPix
scheme, to measure the DIBs. The stacked spectrum is modeled by the profiles of
the two DIBs, Gaussian for $\lambda$862 and Lorentzian for $\lambda$864.8, and
a linear continuum. We obtain 8458 stacked spectra in total, of which 1103
(13%) have reliable fitting results after applying numerous conservative
filters. This work is the first of its kind to fit and measure $\lambda$862 and
$\lambda$864.8 simultaneously in cool-star spectra. We find that the EWs and
CDs of the two DIBs are well correlated with each other. The full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of $\lambda$864.8 is estimated as $1.62 \pm 0.33$ nm which
compares to $0.55 \pm 0.06$ nm for $\lambda$862. We also measure the vacuum
rest-frame wavelength of $\lambda$864.8 to be $\lambda_0 = 864.53 \pm 0.14$ nm,
smaller than previous estimates. We find a solid confirmation of the existence
of the DIB around 864.8 nm based on an exploration of its correlation with
$\lambda$862 and estimation of its FWHM. $\lambda$862 correlates better with
E(BP-RP) than $\lambda$864.8.

we investigate so-called near-optimal solutions to energy system optimisation
models; solutions whose objective values deviate only marginally from the
optimum. Using a refined method for obtaining explicit geometric descriptions
of these near-optimal feasible spaces, we find designs that are as robust as
possible to perturbations. This contributes to the ongoing debate on how to
define and work with robustness in energy systems modelling. We apply our
methods in an investigation using multiple decades of weather data. For the
first time, we run a capacity expansion model of the European power system (one
node per country) with a 3-hourly temporal resolution with 41 years of weather
data. While an optimisation with 41 weather years is at the limits of
computational feasibility, we use the near-optimal feasible spaces of single
years to gain an understanding of the design space over the full time period.
Specifically, we intersect all near-optimal feasible spaces for the individual
years in order to get designs that are likely to be feasible over the entire
time period. We find significant potential for investment flexibility, and
verify the feasibility of these designs by simulating the resulting dispatch
problem with four decades of weather data. They are characterised by a shift
towards more onshore wind and solar power, while emitting up to 50% less $CO_2$
than a cost-optimal solution over that period. Our work builds on recent
developments in the field, including techniques such as Modelling to Generate
Alternatives and Modelling All Alternatives, and provides new insights into the
geometry of near-optimal feasible spaces and the importance of multi-decade
weather variability for energy systems design. We also provide an effective way

Our simulations show that domain wall dynamics and stability depend crucially

result in the formation of critical nuclei for the permanent shift of the
domain wall. If two domain walls are close - put in other words, when domains
are small - thermal fluctuations can be sufficient to bring domain walls into

edge-connectivity requirements. This encompasses uniform demands such as the
Minimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem ($k$-ECSS), as well as
nonuniform demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem. A weakness of
these formulations, though, is that we are not able to ask for fault-tolerance
larger than the connectivity. We introduce and study new variants of these
problems under a notion of relative fault-tolerance. Informally, we require not
that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults (as in the
classical setting), but that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded
number of faults and the two nodes are connected in the underlying graph
post-faults. That is, the subgraph we build must ""behave"" identically to the
underlying graph with respect to connectivity after bounded faults.
  We define and introduce these problems, and provide the first approximation
algorithms: a $(1+4/k)$-approximation for the unweighted relative version of
$k$-ECSS, a $2$-approximation for the weighted relative version of $k$-ECSS,
and a $27/4$-approximation for the special case of Relative Survivable Network

independent interest. First, we give a generalization of Jain's iterative
rounding analysis that works even when the cut-requirement function is not
weakly supermodular, but instead satisfies a weaker definition we introduce and
term local weak supermodularity. Second, we prove a structure theorem and
design an approximation algorithm utilizing a new decomposition based on

different tools are available to disentangle the composition of cosmic matter,
in material of extraterrestrial origins such as cosmic rays, meteorites,
stardust grains, lunar and terrestrial sediments, and through astronomical
observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding cosmic
abundances and their evolution requires combining such measurements with
approaches of astrophysical, nuclear theories and laboratory experiments, and
exploiting additional cosmic messengers, such as neutrinos and gravitational
waves. Recent years have seen significant progress in almost all these fields;
they are presented in this review. Models are required to explore nuclear
fusion of heavier elements. These have been confirmed by observations of
nucleosynthesis products in the ejecta of stars and supernovae, as captured by
stardust grains and by characteristic lines in spectra seen from these objects,
and also by ejecta material captured by Earth over millions of years in
sediments. All these help to piece together how cosmic materials are
transported in interstellar space and re-cycled into and between generations of
stars. Our description of cosmic compositional evolution needs observational
support, as it rests on several assumptions that appear challenged. This
overview presents the flow of cosmic matter and the various sites of
nucleosynthesis, as understood from combining many techniques and observations,

science. A recent development in this direction is a declarative probabilistic

Datalog, a probabilistic extension of Datalog that allows sampling from

Datalog program P on an input database D is a probability space over the
minimal models of D and P, the so-called possible outcomes. This is a natural
generalization of the (deterministic) semantics of Datalog, where the output of

negation, which in turn leads to a strictly more expressive declarative

how the probabilistic semantics of generative Datalog with negation can be
robustly defined. Our goal is to provide an answer to this question by

ratio, while the gas in the inner ring is ionized mostly by young stars.
However, any obvious feature of outflows is not found in its gas kinematics. In
the ring, star formation seems to have recently occurred and the gas
metallicity is slightly enhanced compared to the center. From our results, we
conclude that star formation has occurred in the circumnuclear region within a

Moreover, we find that the increasing external or internal risks both
negatively affect production and exports, but external risk does not
significantly impact on imports and it positively impacts on consumption, while
internal risk negatively impacts on imports and consumption. The results
suggest that most of governments have difficulty to raise subsequent food

magnetostriction, which is then set into rotation. At stirring frequencies
approaching the radial trap frequency, we observe the generation of dynamically

substellar companions to five accelerating stars (HIP 1481, HIP 88399, HIP
96334, HIP 30314 and HIP 116063) using multiple data sets acquired with
different techniques. Methods. Our targets were originally observed as part of
the SPHERE/SHINE survey, and radial velocity (RV) archive data were also
available for four of the five objects. No companions were originally detected
in any of these data sets, but the presence of significant proper motion
anomalies (PMa) for all the stars strongly suggested the presence of a
companion. Combining the information from the PMa with the limits derived from
the RV and SPHERE data, we were able to put constraints on the characteristics
of the unseen companions. Results. Our analysis led to relatively strong
constraints for both HIP 1481 and HIP 88399, narrowing down the companion
masses to 2-5 M_Jup and 3-5 M_Jup and separations within 2-15 au and 3-9 au,
respectively. Because of the large age uncertainties for HIP 96334, the poor
observing conditions for the SPHERE epochs of HIP 30314 and the lack of RV data
for HIP 116063, the results for these targets were not as well defined, but we
were still able to constrain the properties of the putative companions within a
reasonable confidence level. Conclusions. For all five targets, our analysis
has revealed that the companions responsible for the PMa signal would be well
within reach for future instruments planned for the ELT (e.g., MICADO), which
would easily achieve the required contrast and angular resolution. Our results
therefore represent yet another confirmation of the power of multi-technique
approaches for both the discovery and characterisation of planetary systems.

association studies (GWAS) to address the multiple testing burden that limits
discovery of potentially important predictors. Linear mixed models (LMMs) have
become an attractive alternative to principal components (PC) adjustment to
account for population structure and relatedness in high-dimensional penalized
models. However, their use in binary trait GWAS rely on the invalid assumption
that the residual variance does not depend on the estimated regression
coefficients. Moreover, LMMs use a single spectral decomposition of the
covariance matrix of the responses, which is no longer possible in generalized
linear mixed models (GLMMs). We introduce a new method called pglmm, a
penalized GLMM that allows to simultaneously select genetic markers and
estimate their effects, accounting for between-individual correlations and
binary nature of the trait. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm
based on PQL estimation that allows to scale regularized mixed models on
high-dimensional binary trait GWAS (~300,000 SNPs). We show through simulations
that penalized LMM and logistic regression with PC adjustment fail to correctly
select important predictors and/or that prediction accuracy decreases for a
binary response when the dimensionality of the relatedness matrix is high
compared to pglmm. Further, we demonstrate through the analysis of two
polygenic binary traits in the UK Biobank data that our method can achieve
higher predictive performance, while also selecting fewer predictors than a
sparse regularized logistic lasso with PC adjustment. Our method is available
as a Julia package PenalizedGLMM.jl.

frequently also an obstacle to the explicit evaluation of the associated path
integrals. In order to address this issue in the case of Ray-Singer Torsion,
which appears in various topological gauge theories, we introduce a massive
variant of the Ray-Singer Torsion which involves determinants of the twisted
Laplacian with mass but without zero modes. This has the advantage of allowing
one to explicitly keep track of the zero mode dependence of the theory. We
establish a number of general properties of this massive Ray-Singer Torsion.
For product manifolds $M=N \times S^1$ and mapping tori one is able to
interpret the mass term as a flat $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ connection and one can
represent the massive Ray-Singer Torsion as the path integral of a Schwarz type
topological gauge theory. Using path integral techniques, with a judicious
choice of an algebraic gauge fixing condition and a change of variables which
leaves one with a free action, we can evaluate the torsion in closed form. We
discuss a number of applications, including an explicit calculation of the
Ray-Singer Torsion on $S^1$ for $G=PSL(2,R)$ and a path integral derivation of
a generalisation of a formula of Fried for the torsion of finite order mapping
tori.

  calculations",,,,"math.DS cs.LG physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  This paper explores how to identify a reduced order model (ROM) from a
physical system. A ROM captures an invariant subset of the observed dynamics.
We find that there are four ways a physical system can be related to a
mathematical model: invariant foliations, invariant manifolds, autoencoders and
equation-free models. Identification of invariant manifolds and equation-free
models require closed-loop manipulation of the system. Invariant foliations and
autoencoders can also use off-line data. Only invariant foliations and
invariant manifolds can identify ROMs, the rest identify complete models.
Therefore, the common case of identifying a ROM from existing data can only be
achieved using invariant foliations.
  Finding an invariant foliation requires approximating high-dimensional
functions. For function approximation, we use polynomials with compressed
tensor coefficients, whose complexity increases linearly with increasing
dimensions. An invariant manifold can also be found as the fixed leaf of a
foliation. This only requires us to resolve the foliation in a small
neighbourhood of the invariant manifold, which greatly simplifies the process.
Combining an invariant foliation with the corresponding invariant manifold
provides an accurate ROM. We analyse the ROM in case of a focus type
equilibrium, typical in mechanical systems. The nonlinear coordinate system
defined by the invariant foliation or the invariant manifold distorts
instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios, which we correct. Through
examples we illustrate the calculation of invariant foliations and manifolds,
and at the same time show that Koopman eigenfunctions and autoencoders fail to
capture accurate ROMs under the same conditions.

sound sources from the observed multi-channel audio. For the practical problem
of unknown number of sources, existing localization algorithms attempt to
predict a likelihood-based coding (i.e., spatial spectrum) and employ a
pre-determined threshold to detect the source number and corresponding DOA
value. However, these threshold-based algorithms are not stable since they are
limited by the careful choice of threshold. To address this problem, we propose
an iterative sound source localization approach called ISSL, which can
iteratively extract each source's DOA without threshold until the termination
criterion is met. Unlike threshold-based algorithms, ISSL designs an active
source detector network based on binary classifier to accept residual spatial
spectrum and decide whether to stop the iteration. By doing so, our ISSL can
deal with an arbitrary number of sources, even more than the number of sources
seen during the training stage. The experimental results show that our ISSL
achieves significant performance improvements in both DOA estimation and source
number detection compared with the existing threshold-based algorithms.

including environmental science, biology, signal processing, econometrics,
among others. Many Bayesian models have been developed to handle nonstationary
time series. The time-varying vector autoregressive (TV-VAR) model is a
well-established model for multivariate nonstationary time series.
Nevertheless, in most cases, the large number of parameters presented by the
model results in a high computational burden, ultimately limiting its usage.
This paper proposes a computationally efficient multivariate Bayesian Circular
Lattice Filter to extend the usage of the TV-VAR model to a broader class of
high-dimensional problems. Our fully Bayesian framework allows both the
autoregressive (AR) coefficients and innovation covariance to vary over time.
Our estimation method is based on the Bayesian lattice filter (BLF), which is
extremely computationally efficient and stable in univariate cases. To
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive
comparison with other competing methods through simulation studies and find
that, in most cases, our approach performs superior in terms of average squared
error between the estimated and true time-varying spectral density. Finally, we
demonstrate our methodology through applications to quarterly Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) data and Northern California wind data.

prevents another action from being performed in the future) is represented by a
relationship between entities (either propositions or actions) and is learned
by the agent, just by observation, using domain-independent axiom schemata and

(RST). The main contribution of the paper is the relation family Although,
inspired on the RST relation Concession. The accurate definition of the

  development and implementation of clinical prediction models: a simulation
  study","42 pages. Submitted to Statistical Methods in Medical Research in
  October 2021",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Existing guidelines for handling missing data are generally not
consistent with the goals of prediction modelling, where missing data can occur
at any stage of the model pipeline. Multiple imputation (MI), often heralded as
the gold standard approach, can be challenging to apply in the clinic. Clearly,
the outcome cannot be used to impute data at prediction time. Regression
imputation (RI) may offer a pragmatic alternative in the prediction context,
that is simpler to apply in the clinic. Moreover, the use of missing indicators
can handle informative missingness, but it is currently unknown how well they
perform within CPMs. Methods: We performed a simulation study where data were
generated under various missing data mechanisms to compare the predictive
performance of CPMs developed using both imputation methods. We consider
deployment scenarios where missing data is permitted/prohibited, and develop
models that use/omit the outcome during imputation and include/omit missing
indicators. Results: When complete data must be available at deployment, our
findings were in line with widely used recommendations; that the outcome should
be used to impute development data under MI, yet omitted under RI. When
imputation is applied at deployment, omitting the outcome from the imputation
at development was preferred. Missing indicators improved model performance in
some specific cases, but can be harmful when missingness is dependent on the
outcome. Conclusion: We provide evidence that commonly taught principles of
handling missing data via MI may not apply to CPMs, particularly when data can
be missing at deployment. In such settings, RI and missing indicator methods
can (marginally) outperform MI. As shown, the performance of the missing data
handling method must be evaluated on a study-by-study basis, and should be
based on whether missing data are allowed at deployment.

applications, is a stream of recommended items consisting of successive pages
that can be browsed by scrolling. In waterfall RS, when a user finishes
browsing a page, the edge (e.g., mobile phones) would send a request to the
cloud server to get a new page of recommendations, known as the paging request
mechanism. RSs typically put a large number of items into one page to reduce
excessive resource consumption from numerous paging requests, which, however,
would diminish the RSs' ability to timely renew the recommendations according
to users' real-time interest and lead to a poor user experience. Intuitively,
inserting additional requests inside pages to update the recommendations with a
higher frequency can alleviate the problem. However, previous attempts,
including only non-adaptive strategies (e.g., insert requests uniformly), would
eventually lead to resource overconsumption. To this end, we envision a new
learning task of edge intelligence named Intelligent Request Strategy Design
(IRSD). It aims to improve the effectiveness of waterfall RSs by determining
the appropriate occasions of request insertion based on users' real-time
intention. Moreover, we propose a new paradigm of adaptive request insertion
strategy named Uplift-based On-edge Smart Request Framework (AdaRequest).
AdaRequest 1) captures the dynamic change of users' intentions by matching
their real-time behaviors with their historical interests based on
attention-based neural networks. 2) estimates the counterfactual uplift of user
purchase brought by an inserted request based on causal inference. 3)
determines the final request insertion strategy by maximizing the utility
function under online resource constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on

AdaRequest.

algorithm to retrieve the properties of binary systems using unresolved
spectra, unresolved photometry, and resolved contrasts. We have analyzed 8
Kepler Objects of Interest in M star binary systems using literature data, and
have found that the temperatures of the primary stars (and presumed planet
hosts) are revised upward by an average of 200 K. The planetary radii should be
revised upward by an average of 20% if the primary star is the host, and 80% if
the secondary star is the planet host. The average contrast between stellar
components in the Kepler band is 0.75 mag, which is small enough that neither
star in any of the binaries can be conclusively ruled out as a potential planet
host. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for multiplicity when
measuring stellar parameters, especially in the context of exoplanet
characterization.

application of the multilaser technique, we show that the richer spectra

to learn a meaningful representation of the features of the data. Yet,
understanding when and how this feature learning improves performance remains a
challenge: for example, it is beneficial for modern architectures trained to
classify images, whereas it is detrimental for fully-connected networks trained
for the same task on the same data. Here we propose an explanation for this
puzzle, by showing that feature learning can perform worse than lazy training
(via random feature kernel or the NTK) as the former can lead to a sparser
neural representation. Although sparsity is known to be essential for learning
anisotropic data, it is detrimental when the target function is constant or
smooth along certain directions of input space. We illustrate this phenomenon
in two settings: (i) regression of Gaussian random functions on the
d-dimensional unit sphere and (ii) classification of benchmark datasets of
images. For (i), we compute the scaling of the generalization error with number
of training points, and show that methods that do not learn features generalize
better, even when the dimension of the input space is large. For (ii), we show
empirically that learning features can indeed lead to sparse and thereby less
smooth representations of the image predictors. This fact is plausibly
responsible for deteriorating the performance, which is known to be correlated
with smoothness along diffeomorphisms.

theory} for evaluation of hydration free energies of ions, namely,
\textit{quasi-chemical theory} (QCT). We focus on halide anions, but also the
hydroxide anion, since they have been outstanding challenges for all theories.
QCT is built by identification of inner-shell clusters, separate treatment of
those clusters, then integration of those results into the broader-scale
solution environment. We exploit a close comparison with mass-spectrometric
measurements of ion-hydration equilibria. That theory-experiment comparison is
excellent with moderate computational effort here. This agreement reinforces
both theory and experiment, and provides a numerically accurate inner-shell
contribution to QCT. The inner-shell complexes involving heavier halides
display strikingly asymmetric hydration clusters. QCT provides a favorable
setting for exploitation of the polarizable continuum model (PCM) when the
inner-shell material shields the ion from the outer solution environment. For
the asymmetrically hydrated, and less effectively shielded, heavier halide
ions, we investigate an inverse procedure in which the inner-shell structures
are sampled from readily available AIMD calculations on the bulk solutions.
This inverse procedure is a remarkable improvement and our final results are in
close agreement with a standard tabulation of hydration free energies.
Comparison of anion hydration cluster structures with bulk solutions from AIMD
simulations emphasize slight differences: the asymmetries of bulk solution
inner-shell structures are moderated, but still present; and inner shells fill
to slightly higher average coordination numbers in bulk solution than in
clusters.

resource-constrained embedded systems is the binary neural network (BNN). BNNs
save on memory and simplify computation by binarizing both features and
weights. Unfortunately, binarization is inevitably accompanied by a severe
decrease in accuracy. To reduce the accuracy gap between binary and
full-precision networks, many repair methods have been proposed in the recent
past, which we have classified and put into a single overview in this chapter.
The repair methods are divided into two main branches, training techniques and
network topology changes, which can further be split into smaller categories.
The latter category introduces additional cost (energy consumption or
additional area) for an embedded system, while the former does not. From our
overview, we observe that progress has been made in reducing the accuracy gap,
but BNN papers are not aligned on what repair methods should be used to get
highly accurate BNNs. Therefore, this chapter contains an empirical review that
evaluates the benefits of many repair methods in isolation over the
ResNet-20\&CIFAR10 and ResNet-18\&CIFAR100 benchmarks. We found three repair
categories most beneficial: feature binarizer, feature normalization, and
double residual. Based on this review we discuss future directions and research
opportunities. We sketch the benefit and costs associated with BNNs on embedded
systems because it remains to be seen whether BNNs will be able to close the
accuracy gap while staying highly energy-efficient on resource-constrained

reproducibility of the input tail behaviour of the interspike intervals
distributions in the output. Our answer refers to a system of interconnected
neurons with stochastic perfect integrate and fire units. In particular, we
show that the class of regularly-varying vectors is a possible choice to obtain
such consistency. Some further necessary technical hypotheses are added.

acquired by substituting the spinor pseudovectorial parameterization for the

all with the displacement consisting of the spinor parameterization of an
antisymmetric 2-rank tensor and a position vector, one having 4 terms and the
others each having twice distinct 2 of the 4 terms. With possible field

give the angular momentum quasilocalization. The importance and prospects for
successfully including the angular momentum in Witten's formalism are

or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial
to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion
observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice,
source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely
challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph
diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization
methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the
uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming
challenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization
is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion
sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the
generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed.
To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source
Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion
sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a
probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along
with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution
for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the
source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion
sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that
integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the
model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments
are conducted on 7 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE
in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling other methods on average
20% in AUC score.

current cannot, which is from some energy-scale arguments and has never been
proven. A recent work [Phys. Rev. B 103, 195203 (2021)] using quantum transport
formalism achieves a conclusion that shift current indeed has a Hall current,
seemingly contradicting the previous assumption and making the situation more
confusing. Moreover, the behavior of BPVE under strong magnetic field is still
unexplored. In this Letter, using a minimal 2D tight-binding model, we carry
out a systematic numerical study of the BPVE under weak and strong magnetic
field by treating the field in a non-perturbative way. Our model clearly shows
the appearance of the magnetically-induced ballistic current along the
transverse direction, which agrees with the previous predictions, and
interestingly a sizable longitudinal response of the shift current is also
observed, a phenomenon that is not captured by any existing theories where the
magnetic field is treated perturbatively. More surprisingly, drastically
different shift current is found in the strong-field regime, and the evolution
from weak to strong field resembles a phase transition. We hope that our work
could resolve the debate over the behavior of BPVE under magnetic field, and
the strong-field behavior of shift current is expected to inspire more studies

applications and has been considered a challenging self-organization game for

capabilities in search and pursuit. We model a self-organizing system as a
partially observable Markov game (POMG) featured by large-scale,
decentralization, partial observation, and noncommunication. The proposed
distributed algorithm: fuzzy self-organizing cooperative coevolution (FSC2) is
then leveraged to resolve the three challenges in multi-target SOP: distributed
self-organizing search (SOS), distributed task allocation, and distributed
single-target pursuit. FSC2 includes a coordinated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL) method that enables homogeneous agents to learn
natural SOS patterns. Additionally, we propose a fuzzy-based distributed task
allocation method, which locally decomposes multi-target SOP into several
single-target pursuit problems. The cooperative coevolution principle is
employed to coordinate distributed pursuers for each single-target pursuit
problem. Therefore, the uncertainties of inherent partial observation and
distributed decision-making in the POMG can be alleviated. The experimental
results demonstrate that by decomposing the SOP task, FSC2 achieves superior
performance compared with other implicit coordination policies fully trained by
general MARL algorithms. The scalability of FSC2 is proved that up to 2048 FSC2
agents perform efficient multi-target SOP with almost 100 percent capture
rates. Empirical analyses and ablation studies verify the interpretability,
rationality, and effectiveness of component algorithms in FSC2.

priorities in recent research efforts in machine learning, AI, and

to {locally interacting} communities in a way to maximize a pertinent notion of
equitability. In particular, we look at the dynamic setting where the
allocation is repeated across multiple periods (e.g., yearly), the local
communities evolve in the meantime (driven by the provided allocation), and the
allocations are modulated by feedback coming from the communities themselves.
We employ recent mathematical tools stemming from data-driven feedback online
optimization, by which communities can learn their (possibly unknown)
evolution, satisfaction, as well as they can share information with the
deciding bodies. We design dynamic policies that converge to an allocation that
maximize equitability in the long term. We further demonstrate our model and
methodology with realistic examples of healthcare and education subsidies
design in Sub-Saharian countries. One of the key empirical takeaways from our
setting is that long-term equitability is fragile, in the sense that it can be
easily lost when deciding bodies weigh in other factors (e.g., equality in
allocation) in the allocation strategy. Moreover, a naive compromise, while not
providing significant advantage to the communities, can promote inequality in
social outcomes.

photodissociation induced by high energy photons dominates the atmosphere

on atmospheric temperature, as increased temperature leads to increased
population of vibrational excited states and the consequent lowering of the
photodissociation threshold. This paper inaugurates a new series of papers
presenting computed temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections with

performed by solving the time-independent Schr\""{o}dinger equation for each

for hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride are computed for a grid of 34
temperatures between 0 and 10~000 K. Use of different radiation fields shows
that for the Sun and cooler stars the photodissociation rate can increase
exponentially for molecular temperatures above 1000 K; conversely the
photodissociation rates in UV rich fields instead are almost insensitive to the
temperature of the molecule. Furthermore, these rates show extreme sensitivity

modeling the ever-increasing event timestamps, inter-event time gaps, event
types, and the influences between different events within and across different
sequences. In recent years neural enhancements to marked temporal point
processes (MTPP) have emerged as a powerful framework to model the underlying
generative mechanism of asynchronous events localized in continuous time.
However, most existing models and inference methods in the MTPP framework
consider only the complete observation scenario i.e. the event sequence being
modeled is completely observed with no missing events -- an ideal setting that
is rarely applicable in real-world applications. A recent line of work which
considers missing events while training MTPP utilizes supervised learning
techniques that require additional knowledge of missing or observed label for
each event in a sequence, which further restricts its practicability as in
several scenarios the details of missing events is not known apriori. In this
work, we provide a novel unsupervised model and inference method for learning
MTPP in presence of event sequences with missing events. Specifically, we first
model the generative processes of observed events and missing events using two
MTPP, where the missing events are represented as latent random variables.
Then, we devise an unsupervised training method that jointly learns both the
MTPP by means of variational inference. Such a formulation can effectively
impute the missing data among the observed events and can identify the optimal
position of missing events in a sequence.

to allocate different computations for different samples while better

architecture, place intermediate classifiers at different depths of the
architecture, and the model outputs the results when the prediction confidence
reaches a preset threshold. We propose a training paradigm of self-distillation

to maximize their performance and training speed. At the same time, to mitigate
the vulnerability of performance to the location and number settings of
intermediate classifiers in the Early-exit paradigm, we propose a

things with predictive power and gives the opportunity to control life. Its
scaling means not just the improvement of the instrument part, but also,
mainly, mathematical and software tools, and our understanding of the QC
problem. The first principle of quantum modeling is the reduction of reality to
finite-dimensional models similar to QED in optical cavities. The second
principle is a strict limitation of the so-called Feynman principle, the number
of qubits in the standard formulation of the QC. This means treating
decoherence exclusively as a limitation of the memory of a classical modeling
computer, and introducing corresponding progressive restrictions on the working
area of the Hilbert space of quantum states as the model expands. The third
principle is similarity in processes of different nature. The quantum nature of
reality is manifested in this principle; its nature is quantum nonlocality,
which is the main property that ensures the prospects of quantum physical
devices and their radical advantage over classical ones.

  We first provide an overview of approaches to device modelling and a brief

three key criteria for a suitable predictive model for circuit design: it must
be a compact model; it must be SPICE-compatible; it must have a minimal number
of fitting parameters. We selected Jimenez's drain-current model as it best
matched these criteria, and we introduce some modifications to improve the
predictive properties, namely accounting for saturation velocity and the
asymmetry in n- and p-type carrier mobilities.

experimentally-obtained GFET characteristics with the same materials and
geometries and find good agreement between GFET Lab and experiment. We
demonstrate the ability to export SPICE models for use in higher level circuit
simulations and compare SPICE simulations of GFETs against GFETs simulated in

salient features of an expensive high-fidelity behavior is a prevalent approach
in design optimization. In recent times, Deep Learning (DL) models are being

However, the main challenge in creating a DL-based surrogate is to
simulate/label a large number of design points, which is time-consuming for
computationally costly and/or high-dimensional engineering problems. In the
present work, we propose a novel sampling technique by combining the active
learning (AL) method with DL. We call this method $\epsilon$-weighted hybrid
query strategy ($\epsilon$-HQS) , which focuses on the evaluation of the
surrogate at each learning iteration and provides an estimate of the failure
probability of the surrogate in the Design Space. By reusing already collected
training and test data, the learned failure probability guides the next
iteration's sampling process to the region of the high probability of failure.
During the empirical evaluation, better accuracy of the surrogate was observed
in comparison to other methods of sample selection. We empirically evaluated
this method in two different engineering design domains, finite element based
static stress analysis of submarine pressure vessel(computationally costly
process) and second submarine propeller design( high dimensional problem).

other periodic structures, reflected and transmitted waves propagate away from
the structure in different radiation channels. A diffraction anomaly occurs
when the outgoing waves in one or more radiation channels vanish. Zero
reflection, zero transmission and perfect absorption are important examples of
diffraction anomalies, and they are useful for manipulating electromagnetic
waves and light. Since diffraction anomalies appear only at specific
frequencies and/or wavevectors, and may require the tuning of structural or
material parameters, they are relatively difficult to find by standard
numerical methods. Iterative methods may be used, but good initial guesses are
required. To determine all diffraction anomalies in a given frequency interval,
it is necessary to repeatedly solve the diffraction problem for many
frequencies. In this paper, an efficient numerical method is developed for
computing diffraction anomalies. The method relies on nonlinear eigenvalue
formulations for scattering anomalies and solves the nonlinear eigenvalue
problems by a contour-integral method. Numerical examples involving periodic

uncertainties, which has motivated the development and use of stochastic
compartmental models. Here, we first show that a common stochastic model, which
treats the uncertainties as white noise, is fundamentally flawed since it
erroneously implies that greater parameter uncertainties will lead to the
eradication of the disease. Then, we present a principled modeling of the
uncertainties based on reasonable assumptions on the contacts of each
individual. Using the central limit theorem and Doob's theorem on Gaussian
Markov processes, we prove that the correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is
the appropriate tool for modeling uncertainties in the infectivity rate. We
demonstrate our results using a compartmental model of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the available US data from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database.
In particular, we show that the white noise stochastic model systematically
underestimates the severity of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, whereas the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model correctly forecasts the course of this variant.
Moreover, using an SIS model of sexually transmitted disease, we derive an
exact closed-form solution for the asymptotic distribution of infected
individuals. This analytic result shows that the white noise model
underestimates the severity of the pandemic because of unrealistic
noise-induced transitions. Our results strongly support the need for temporal

framework institutes a novel method, called an Incremental Computation of
Mean-Subspace (ICMS) technique, which computes an approximation of mean-target
subspace on a Grassmann manifold and is proven to be a close approximate to the
Karcher mean. Furthermore, the transformation matrix computed from the
mean-target subspace is applied to the next target data in the
recursive-feedback stage, aligning the target data closer to the source domain.
The computation of transformation matrix and the prediction of next-target
subspace leverage the performance of the recursive-feedback stage by
considering the cumulative temporal dependency among the flow of the target
subspace on the Grassmann manifold. The labels of the transformed target data
are predicted by the pre-trained source classifier, then the classifier is
updated by the transformed data and predicted labels. Extensive experiments on
six datasets were conducted to investigate in depth the effect and contribution

approaches in terms of classification accuracy and computational speed. In
addition, the experiments on traditional manifold-based learning models and

in nonassociative and noncommutative gravity by focusing on features that
generalize to higher dimensions. The theories we study are modelled on (co)
tangent Lorentz bundles (i.e. eight dimensional phase spaces) with a star
product structure determined by R-flux deformations in string theory. The
nonassociative vacuum Einstein equations involve real and complex effective
sources with coefficients which are proportional to the Planck and string
constants or their products. We develop the anholonomic frame and connection
deformation method and prove that such systems of nonlinear partial
differential equations can be decoupled and integrated in general form for a
generic off-diagonal ansatz for symmetric and non-symmetric metrics. The
coefficients of such metrics may depend on all phase space coordinates
(space-time coordinates plus energy-momentum). Conditions are given when the
generating and integration functions and effective sources define two classes
of physically important exact and parametric solutions with R-flux sources
related via nonlinear symmetries to effective cosmological constants: (1) 6D
Tangherlini BHs, which are star product and R-flux distorted to
quasi-stationary configurations and 8D black ellipsoids (BEs) and BHs; (2)
nonassocitative space-time and co-fiber space double BH and/or BE
configurations generalizing Schwarzschild - de Sitter metrics. We argue that
the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is applicable only for very special
classes of nonassociative BHs encoding conventional horizons and (anti) de
Sitter configurations. Finally, we show how analogs of the relativistic G.
Perelman geometric thermodynamic variables can be defined and computed for
general classes of off-diagonal solutions encoding nonassociative R-flux
deformations.

utilize two supervised learning classifiers, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression
to show the accuracy and competency of the Epoc+ device and its associated
applications in neurotechnological research. We present experimental studies
and the demonstration indicates 69% and 62% improved accuracy for the
aforementioned classifiers respectively in reading the performance matrices of

  Janus Particles",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Herein we demonstrate the ability to optically tune the mobility of
electrically powered Janus particles (JP) that are half coated with various
Zinc Oxide (ZnO) semiconducting layers, i.e. polycrystalline, amorphous and
amorphous with a SiO2 passivation layer. The ZnO semiconductor photo-response
enables increase in its electrical conductivity with light having wavelengths
of sufficient photon energy with respect to the semiconductor bandgap. This
effect, termed optically modulated electrokinetic propulsion (OMEP), can be
harnessed to increase the contrast in polarizability between the dielectric and
semiconducting hemispheres, which in turn, results in an increased
electrokinetic mobility. The addition of optical activation to the electrical
field enables an additional degree of control of JP mobility. We also
demonstrate optical control of collective behavior and particle-particle
interactions for dense semi-conducting Janus particle populations.

studies are subject to limitation of shadow zones. It is not possible to
capture the terrain pattern and requires interpolation and extrapolation for
conformal mapping of spatial coordinates for generation of terrain model. The
discrete data is mapped through a function set whose domain returns the
analytic test in Riemann map. The algorithm adopted in analysis for such
mapping does not have a certainty score or probability of degree of correctness
conforming to the physical landscape of shadow zones. The aim of the paper is
to establish a generator of certainty degree of the mapping along with a
continuous terrain model generator. The confirmed mapping of terrain presents a
continuous spatial coordinate set which form the boundary of the shadow zone
with discrete spatial coordinates. The discrete set is normalized in Gaussian
distribution through a Poisson distribution transition. The continuous data set
is represented by Laurentian series in which the function will be analytic and
can be mapped to Riemann surface with singularities within the annulus and
outside the annulus of approximate space sub set (Euclidean space).The
singularities will be discarded through Picard's theorem and analytic test at
poles with Cauchy's residual theorem is done. The resulting set of spatial
coordinates will restructure within Riemann number sphere which will be mapped
on the plane as stereographic projection. The Gaussian distribution which forms
the basis of analysis will provide with the tool for generating the probability
of certainty of every terrain model idealised to conform to the physical
landscape.

centres and it is directly dependent on the application workload. Various
services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) are offered by cloud computing to
provide compute, network, and storage capabilities to the cloud users utilizing
the pay-per-usage approach. Resource allocation is a prior solution to address
various demanding situations like the under/overload handling, resource
wastage, load balancing, Quality-of-Services (QoS) violations, VM migration and
many more. The primary aim of Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is mapping of
Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines (PMs), such that the PMs may be
utilized to their maximum efficiency, where the already active VMs are not to
be interrupted. It provides a list of live VM migrations that must be
accomplished to get the optimum solution and reduces energy consumption to a
larger extent. The inefficient VMP leads to wastage of resources, excessive
energy consumption and also increase overall operational cost of the data
center. On this context, this article provides an extensive survey of resource
management schemes in cloud environment. A conceptual scheme for resource
management, grouping of current machine learning based resource allocation
strategies, and fundamental problems of ineffective distribution of physical
resources are analyzed. Thereafter, a complete survey of existing techniques in
machine learning based mechanisms in the field of cloud resource management are
explained. Ultimately, the paper explores and concludes distinct approaching
challenges and future research guidelines associated to resource management in
cloud environment.
