employed on sequences or total orders. More recently, a more general form of
sorting on partially ordered sets (or posets), where some pairs of elements are
incomparable, has been studied. General poset sorting algorithms have a
lower-bound query complexity of $\Omega(wn + n \log n)$, where $w$ is the width
of the poset.
  We consider the problem of sorting in trees, a particular case of partial
orders, and parametrize the complexity with respect to $d$, the maximum degree
of an element in the tree, as $d$ is usually much smaller than $w$ in trees.
For example, in complete binary trees, $d = \Theta(1), w = \Theta(n)$. We
present a randomized algorithm for sorting a tree poset in worst-case expected
$O(dn\log n)$ query and time complexity. This improves the previous upper bound
of $O(dn \log^2 n)$. Our algorithm is the first to be optimal for
bounded-degree trees. We also provide a new lower bound of $\Omega(dn + n \log
n)$ for the worst-case query complexity of sorting a tree poset. Finally, we
present the first deterministic algorithm for sorting tree posets that has
lower total complexity than existing algorithms for sorting general partial
orders.

to convert the path planning into an optimization problem. The optimization
algorithm named Multi-subject TLBO is then proposed to minimize the formulated
objective function. The algorithm is developed based on TLBO but enhanced with
new operations including mutation, elite selection and multi-subject training
to improve the solution quality and speed up the convergence rate. Comparison
with state-of-the-art algorithms and experiments with real UAVs have been
conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results

the Partial Wave Analysis of the concurrently measured two-pion channel, these

$e^+e^-$ yield. Instead, approaches based on a VMD amplitude vanishing at small
$e^+e^-$ invariant masses supplemented coherently by a direct photon amplitude
provide a better agreement. A good description of the data is also obtained
using a calculation of electromagnetic timelike baryon transition form factors
in a covariant spectator-quark model, demonstrating the dominance of meson
cloud effects. The angular distributions of $e^+e^-$ pairs demonstrate the
contributions of virtual photons with longitudinal polarization, in contrast to
real photons. The virtual photon angular dependence supports the dominance of
J=3/2, I=1/2 contributions observed in both the $\gamma^{\star} n$ and the $\pi

of magnetic braiding, our observations of parallel loops imply that the
stresses put into the magnetic field have to relax while the braiding is
applied: the magnetic field never reaches a highly braided state on these
length-scales comparable to the separation of the loops. This supports recent
numerical 3D models of loop braiding in which the effective dissipation is

  Work-Shop. 10 pages",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Down-sampling training data has long been shown to improve the generalization
performance of a wide range of machine learning systems. Recently,
down-sampling has proved effective in genetic programming (GP) runs that
utilize the lexicase parent selection technique. Although this down-sampling
procedure has been shown to significantly improve performance across a variety
of problems, it does not seem to do so due to encouraging adaptability through
environmental change. We hypothesize that the random sampling that is performed
every generation causes discontinuities that result in the population being
unable to adapt to the shifting environment. We investigate modifications to
down-sampled lexicase selection in hopes of promoting incremental environmental
change to scaffold evolution by reducing the amount of jarring discontinuities
between the environments of successive generations. In our empirical studies,
we find that forcing incremental environmental change is not significantly
better for evolving solutions to program synthesis problems than simple random
down-sampling. In response to this, we attempt to exacerbate the hypothesized
prevalence of discontinuities by using only disjoint down-samples to see if it
hinders performance. We find that this also does not significantly differ from
the performance of regular random down-sampling. These negative results raise
new questions about the ways in which the composition of sub-samples, which may
include synonymous cases, may be expected to influence the performance of
machine learning systems that use down-sampling.

regime due to the crowded frequency spectrum. However, a downside of the
wideband regime is that obtaining channel state information is costly, and the
capacity of previously used modulation schemes such as code division multiple
access and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing begins to diverge from
the capacity bound without channel state information. Impulsive frequency shift
keying and wideband time frequency coding have been shown to perform well in
the wideband regime without channel state information, thus avoiding the costs

the maximum likelihood receiver is a bank of frequency-selective filters, which
is very costly to implement due to the large number of filters. In this work,
we aim to simplify the receiver by using an analog compressed sensing receiver
with chipping sequences as correlating signals to detect the sparse signals.
Our results show that using a compressed sensing receiver allows for the
simplification of the analog receiver with the trade off of a slight
degradation in recovery performance. For a fixed frequency separation, symbol
time, and peak SNR, the performance loss remains the same for a fixed ratio of
number of correlating signals to the number of frequencies.

interaction for the $sd$ shell, which allows us to exactly reproduce selected
NCSM spectra of $^{18}$O, $^{18}$F and $^{18}$Ne within the two valence nucleon

quadrupole ($E2$) and magnetic dipole ($M1$) operators by matching them to the
electromagnetic transitions and moments for $^{17}$O and $^{17}$F from the NCSM
at $N_{\rm max}=4$. Thus, effective $E2$ and $M1$ operators are obtained as
sets of single-particle matrix elements for the valence space ($sd$ shell)

comparison of a large set of $sd$ shell results on quadrupole and magnetic

the correlation between the numerical analysis and the user studies, and
demonstrate that some image quality metrics may provide useful guidance in
attack designs, while there is still a significant gap between assessed image

space-time: One, that the warp bubble (not its payload) has the mass; two, that
the mass is a background feature in front of which the warp drive moves. For
simplicity, we consider generic Nat\'ario warp drives with zero-vorticity flow
field. The resulting spacetimes are sufficiently simple to allow an exact and
fully explicit computation of all of the stress-energy components, and verify
that (as expected) the null energy condition (NEC) is violated. Likewise the
weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions (WEC, SEC, DEC) are violated.
Indeed, this confirms the community's folk wisdom, and recent (fully general,
but implicit) results of the present authors which closed previous gaps in the
argument. However, folk wisdom should be carefully and critically examined
before being believed, and the present examples for general results will
greatly aid physical intuition.

can creep in as the author's bias. Movie production houses would prefer to

deep learning models can give human-level accuracy in multiple tasks, having an
AI solution to identify the biases present in the script at the writing stage
can help them avoid the inconvenience of stalled release, lawsuits, etc. Since
AI solutions are data intensive and there exists no domain specific data to
address the problem of biases in scripts, we introduce a new dataset of movie
scripts that are annotated for identity bias. The dataset contains dialogue
turns annotated for (i) bias labels for seven categories, viz., gender,
race/ethnicity, religion, age, occupation, LGBTQ, and other, which contains
biases like body shaming, personality bias, etc. (ii) labels for sensitivity,

costs in financial systems and fuel costs being common examples. In these

leading to vastly suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, repeatedly acting produces
wear and tear and ultimately, damage. Determining \textit{when to act} is
crucial for achieving successful outcomes and yet, the challenge of efficiently
\textit{learning} to behave optimally when actions incur minimally bounded
costs remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework named \textbf{L}earnable \textbf{I}mpulse \textbf{C}ontrol
\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{A}lgorithm (LICRA), for learning to optimally
select both when to act and which actions to take when actions incur costs. At
the core of LICRA is a nested structure that combines RL and a form of policy
known as \textit{impulse control} which learns to maximise objectives when
actions incur costs. We prove that LICRA, which seamlessly adopts any RL
method, converges to policies that optimally select when to perform actions and
their optimal magnitudes. We then augment LICRA to handle problems in which the
agent can perform at most $k<\infty$ actions and more generally, faces a budget
constraint. We show LICRA learns the optimal value function and ensures budget
constraints are satisfied almost surely. We demonstrate empirically LICRA's
superior performance against benchmark RL methods in OpenAI gym's \textit{Lunar

one of the most important aspects of turbulence from an engineering

transported in space and in scale by nonlinear multi-scale interactions in wall
turbulence as well as turbulent energy. In the present study, the spectral
transport budgets of turbulent heat fluxes are investigated based on direct
numerical simulation data of a turbulent plane Couette flow with a passive
scalar heat transfer. The transport budgets of spanwise spectra of temperature
fluctuation and velocity-temperature correlations are investigated in detail in
comparison to those of the corresponding Reynolds stress spectra. The
similarity and difference between those scale-by-scale transports are
discussed, with a particular focus on the roles of interscale transport and
spatial turbulent diffusion. As a result, it is found that the spectral
transport of the temperature-related statistics is quite similar to those of
the Reynolds stresses, and in particular inverse interscale transfer is
commonly observed throughout the channel in both transport of the Reynolds

narratives, forming echo chambers. The echo chamber effect and opinion
polarization may be driven by several factors including human biases in
information consumption and personalized recommendations produced by feed
algorithms. Until now, studies have mainly used opinion dynamic models to
explore the mechanisms behind the emergence of polarization and echo chambers.
The objective was to determine the key factors contributing to these phenomena
and identify their interplay. However, the validation of model predictions with
empirical data still displays two main drawbacks: lack of systematicity and
qualitative analysis. In our work, we bridge this gap by providing a method to
numerically compare the opinion distributions obtained from simulations with
those measured on social media. To validate this procedure, we develop an
opinion dynamic model that takes into account the interplay between human and
algorithmic factors. We subject our model to empirical testing with data from
diverse social media platforms and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art
models. To further enhance our understanding of social media platforms, we
provide a synthetic description of their characteristics in terms of the
model's parameter space. This representation has the potential to facilitate
the refinement of feed algorithms, thus mitigating the detrimental effects of
extreme polarization on online discourse.

We present what we believe to be accurate theoretical gaps including the
effects of finite width and Landau level (LL) mixing. While theory captures the
width dependence, there still remains a deviation between the calculated and

experimental gaps of the $n/(2n\pm 1)$ states as $\Delta_{n/(2n\pm 1)} =
Ce^2/[(2n\pm 1)\varepsilon l]-\Gamma$, where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric
constant of the background semiconductor and $l$ is the magnetic length; the
first term is interpreted as the cyclotron energy of composite fermions and
$\Gamma$ as a disorder-induced broadening of composite-fermion LLs. Fitting the
gaps for various fractional quantum Hall states, we find that $\Gamma$ can be
nonzero even in the absence of disorder.

learning to a prediction task and solve it via supervised learning (RvS) have
become popular due to their simplicity, robustness to hyperparameters, and
strong overall performance on offline RL tasks. However, simply conditioning a
probabilistic model on a desired return and taking the predicted action can
fail dramatically in stochastic environments since trajectories that result in
a return may have only achieved that return due to luck. In this work, we
describe the limitations of RvS approaches in stochastic environments and
propose a solution. Rather than simply conditioning on the return of a single
trajectory as is standard practice, our proposed method, ESPER, learns to
cluster trajectories and conditions on average cluster returns, which are
independent from environment stochasticity. Doing so allows ESPER to achieve
strong alignment between target return and expected performance in real
environments. We demonstrate this in several challenging stochastic offline-RL
tasks including the challenging puzzle game 2048, and Connect Four playing
against a stochastic opponent. In all tested domains, ESPER achieves
significantly better alignment between the target return and achieved return
than simply conditioning on returns. ESPER also achieves higher maximum
performance than even the value-based baselines.

local characteristics such as discontinuities, spikes and oscillations for
example, due the features of wavelet basis expansion of functions. Simulation

neuroimaging, to increase both statistical power and the representation of

scanner and acquisition differences - the harmonisation problem - and second,
data privacy concerns due to the inherently personal nature of medical imaging

framework operating in the federated learning paradigm. We show that to remove
the scanner-specific effects, we only need to share the mean and standard

correlated with the large-scale temperature and polarization signals of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). A measurement of $\mu T$ and $\mu E$
correlations can therefore be used to constrain it on wavelengths of
perturbations not directly probed by the standard CMB anisotropies. In this
work, we carry out a first rigorous search for $\mu$-type spectral distortion
anisotropies with \Planck data, applying the well-tested constrained ILC
component-separation method combined with the needlet framework. We reconstruct
a $\mu$ map from \Planck data, which we then correlate with the CMB
anisotropies to derive constraints on the amplitude $\fNL$ of the local form
bispectrum, specifically on the highly squeezed configurations with effective
wavenumbers $k_s \simeq \SI{740}{Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_L \simeq
\SI{0.05}{Mpc^{-1}}$. We improve previously estimated constraints by more than
an order of magnitude. This enhancement is owing to the fact that for the first
time we are able to use the full multipole information by carefully controlling
biases and systematic effects in the final analysis. We also for the first time
incorporate constraints from measurements of $\mu E$ correlations, which
further tighten the limits. A combination of the derived \Planck $\mu T$ and
$\mu E$ power spectra yields $|\fNL| \lesssim 6800$ (95\% c.l.) on this highly
squeezed bispectrum. This is only $\simeq 3$ times weaker than the anticipated
constraint from \LiteBIRD alone. We show that a combination of \LiteBIRD with
\Planck will improve the expected future constraint by $\simeq 20\%$ over
\LiteBIRD alone. These limits can be used to constrain multi-field inflation
models and primordial black hole formation scenarios, thus providing a
promising novel avenue forward in CMB cosmology.

(EP) is expressed as an independent sum over each driving frequency of
non-negative contributions. These contributions are bilinear in the
nonconservative and conservative forces and involve a novel generalized Onsager

drivings, we advance a novel decomposition of the EP rate into two non-negative

due to deviation from the instantaneous steady-state - directly implying a
minimum entropy production principle close to equilibrium. This setting reveals
the geometric structure of near-equilibrium thermodynamics and generalizes
previous approaches to cases with nonconservative forces.

control of the race cars. The team from TUM placed first in Indianapolis and
secured second place in Las Vegas. During the final of the passing competition,
the TUM team reached speeds and accelerations close to the limit of the
vehicle, peaking at around 270 km/h and 28 ms2. This paper will present details

problems, empowering scientific innovations, and handling emergency situations.
Therefore, the correctness and trustworthiness of research software are of
absolute importance. Software testing is an important activity for identifying
problematic code and helping to produce high-quality software. However, testing
of research software is difficult due to the complexity of the underlying
science, relatively unknown results from scientific algorithms, and the culture
of the research software community. Aims: The goal of this paper is to better
understand current testing practices, identify challenges, and provide
recommendations on how to improve the testing process for research software
development. Method: We surveyed members of the research software developer
community to collect information regarding their knowledge about and use of
software testing in their projects. Results: We analysed 120 responses and
identified that even though research software developers report they have an
average level of knowledge about software testing, they still find it difficult
due to the numerous challenges involved. However, there are a number of ways,
such as proper training, that can improve the testing process for research
software. Conclusions: Testing can be challenging for any type of software.
This difficulty is especially present in the development of research software,
where software engineering activities are typically given less attention. To
produce trustworthy results from research software, there is a need for a
culture change so that testing is valued and teams devote appropriate effort to
writing and executing tests.

challenges in applying it to advertising systems: a) the limited scale of

  In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised split distillation framework
VFed-SSD to alleviate the two limitations. We identify that: i) there are
massive unlabeled overlapped data available in advertising systems, and ii) we
can keep a balance between model performance and inference cost by decomposing

machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), are a promising new tool to tackle this problem with a modest
computational cost and retaining the best features of merger trees from
simulations. We train our GAN model with a limited sample of merger trees from
the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)
simulation suite, constructed using two halo finders-tree builder algorithms:
SUBFIND-D-TREES and ROCKSTAR-ConsistentTrees. Our GAN model successfully learns
to generate well-constructed merger tree structures with high temporal
resolution, and to reproduce the statistical features of the sample of merger
trees used for training, when considering up to three variables in the training
process. These inputs, whose representations are also learned by our GAN model,
are mass of the halo progenitors and the final descendant, progenitor type
(main halo or satellite) and distance of a progenitor to that in the main
branch. The inclusion of the latter two inputs greatly improves the final
learned representation of the halo mass growth history, especially for
SUBFIND-like ML trees. When comparing equally sized samples of ML merger trees
with those of the EAGLE simulation, we find better agreement for SUBFIND-like
ML trees. Finally, our GAN-based framework can be utilised to construct merger
histories of low- and intermediate-mass haloes, the most abundant in
cosmological simulations.

the unusual effects that can be present in multiband superconductors. A Leggett
mode describes the collective periodic oscillation of the relative phase
between the phases of the superconducting condensates formed by electrons in
different bands. It can be thought of as the mode arising from an inter-band
Josephson effect. The experimental observation of Leggett modes is challenging
for several reasons: (i) Multiband superconductors are rare; (ii) they describe
charge fluctuations between bands and therefore are hard to probe directly;
(iii) their mass gap is often larger than the superconducting gaps and
therefore are strongly overdamped via relaxation processes into the
quasiparticle continuum. In this work we show that Leggett modes, and their
frequency, can be detected unambigously in a.c. driven superconducting quantum
interference devices (SQUIDs). We then use the results to analyze the
measurements of a SQUID based on Cd3As2, an exemplar Dirac semimetal, in which

controllable framework, Text2Human, for a high-quality and diverse human
generation. We synthesize full-body human images starting from a given human
pose with two dedicated steps. 1) With some texts describing the shapes of
clothes, the given human pose is first translated to a human parsing map. 2)
The final human image is then generated by providing the system with more
attributes about the textures of clothes. Specifically, to model the diversity
of clothing textures, we build a hierarchical texture-aware codebook that
stores multi-scale neural representations for each type of texture. The
codebook at the coarse level includes the structural representations of
textures, while the codebook at the fine level focuses on the details of
textures. To make use of the learned hierarchical codebook to synthesize
desired images, a diffusion-based transformer sampler with mixture of experts
is firstly employed to sample indices from the coarsest level of the codebook,
which then is used to predict the indices of the codebook at finer levels. The
predicted indices at different levels are translated to human images by the
decoder learned accompanied with hierarchical codebooks. The use of
mixture-of-experts allows for the generated image conditioned on the
fine-grained text input. The prediction for finer level indices refines the
quality of clothing textures. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework can generate more diverse

found to depend on the pre-shock density dispersion and shock speed in a manner

highly with human judgements of text quality. Yet, there is a dearth of such
metrics, which inhibits the rapid and efficient progress of language
generators. One exception is the recently proposed Mauve. In theory, Mauve
measures an information-theoretic divergence between two probability
distributions over strings: one representing the language generator under
evaluation; the other representing the true natural language distribution.
Mauve's authors argue that its success comes from the qualitative properties of
their proposed divergence. Yet in practice, as this divergence is uncomputable,
Mauve approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial
distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by
grouping strings based on a pre-trained language model's embeddings. As we
show, however, this is not a tight approximation -- in either theory or
practice. This begs the question: why does Mauve work so well? In this work, we
show that Mauve was right for the wrong reasons, and that its newly proposed
divergence is not necessary for its high performance. In fact, classical
divergences paired with its proposed cluster-based approximation may actually
serve as better evaluation metrics. We finish the paper with a probing
analysis; this analysis leads us to conclude that -- by encoding syntactic- and
coherence-level features of text, while ignoring surface-level features -- such
cluster-based substitutes to string distributions may simply be better for

formation or radio lobes associated with AGN activity. We explore the star
formation explanation by calculating the expected radio emission for these nine
VLBA non-detections, finding that about 5 have VLA luminosities that are
inconsistent with this scenario. Of the remaining four, two are associated with
spectroscopically confirmed AGNs that are consistent with being located at
their galaxy photo-centers. There are therefore between 5 and 7 wandering MBH
candidates out of the 13 galaxies we observed, although we cannot rule out
background AGNs for five of them with the data in hand.

polymers with limited stiffness. However, existing commercial digital
manufacturing software only provides a few simple fiber layout algorithms,
which solely use the geometry of the shape. In this work, we build an automated
fiber path planning algorithm that maximizes the stiffness of a 3D print given
specified external loads. We formalize this as an optimization problem: an
objective function is designed to measure the stiffness of the object while
regularizing certain properties of fiber paths (e.g., smoothness). To
initialize each fiber path, we use finite element analysis to calculate the
stress field on the object and greedily ""walk"" in the direction of the stress
field. We then apply a gradient-based optimization algorithm that uses the
adjoint method to calculate the gradient of stiffness with respect to fiber
layout. We compare our approach, in both simulation and real-world experiments,
to three baselines: (1) concentric fiber rings generated by Eiger, a leading
digital manufacturing software package developed by Markforged, (2) greedy
extraction on the simulated stress field (i.e., our method without
optimization), and (3) the greedy algorithm on a fiber orientation field
calculated by smoothing the simulated stress fields. The results show that
objects with fiber paths generated by our algorithm achieve greater stiffness
while using less fiber than the baselines--our algorithm improves the Pareto
frontier of object stiffness as a function of fiber usage. Ablation studies
show that the smoothing regularizer is needed for feasible fiber paths and
stability of optimization, and multi-resolution optimization help reduce the
running time compared to single-resolution optimization.

a weighted rank aggregation, wherein a (convex) weight is applied to each input

Traditionally, the aim of rank aggregation is to summarize the information from
the input rankings and provide one final ranking that hopefully represents a
more accurate or truthful result than any one input ranking. While such an
aggregated ranking is, and clearly has been, useful to many applications, it
also obscures information. In this paper, we show the wealth of information
that is available for the weighted rank aggregation problem due to its
structure. We apply weight set decomposition to the set of convex multipliers,
study the properties useful for understanding this decomposition, and visualize
the indifference regions. This methodology reveals information--that is

an essential role in quantum mechanics (QM), are not in fact unique to QM. Here
we add a new example, the ""Arrow"" system, to the growing list of classical
systems that possess incompatible variables. We show how classical probability
theory can be extended to include any system with incompatible variables in a
general incompatible variables (GIV) theory. We then show how the QM theory of
elementary systems emerges naturally from the GIV framework when the
fundamental variables are taken to be the symmetries of the states of the
system. This result follows primarily because in QM the symmetries of the
Poincare group play a double role, not only as the operators which transform
the states under symmetry transformations but also as the fundamental variables
of the system. The incompatibility of the QM variables is then seen to be just
the incompatibility of the corresponding space-time symmetries. We also arrive
at a clearer understanding of the Born Rule: although not primarily derived
from symmetry - rather it is simply a free Pythagorean construction for
accommodating basic features of classical probability theory in Hilbert spaces
- it is Poincare symmetry that allows the Born Rule to take on its familiar
form in QM, in agreement with Gleason's theorem. Finally, we show that any
probabilistic system (classical or quantal) that possesses incompatible
variables will show not only uncertainty, but also interference in its
probability patterns. Thus the GIV framework provides the basis for a broader
perspective from which to view QM: quantal systems are a subset of the set of
all systems possessing incompatible variables (and hence showing uncertainty
and interference), namely the subset in which the incompatible variables are
incompatible symmetries.

for several biased-noise qubit platforms, most notably Kerr cats. However,
experimentally measuring the noise bias is challenging as it requires
accurately estimating certain low-probability Pauli errors in the presence of
much larger state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In this paper, we
introduce bias randomized benchmarking (BRB) as a technique for measuring bias
in quantum gates. BRB, like all RB protocols, is highly accurate and immune to
SPAM errors. Our first protocol, CX-dihedral BRB, is a straightforward method
to measure the bias of the entire CX-dihedral group. Our second protocol,
interleaved bias randomized benchmarking (IBRB), is a generalization of
interleaved RB tailored to the experimental constraints biased-noise qubits;
this is a more involved procedure that directly targets the bias of the CX gate
alone. Our BRB procedures occupy a middle ground between classic RB protocols

code, modified to include state-of-the-art empirical measurements of pebble

due to the low pebble thermal conductivity, the peak temperatures attained
during evolution are much higher than in any previous study given the same

extremely small, sub-kilometre comets have the potential to retain the
primordial, uniform and thermally unprocessed composition from which they
formed. Comets with radii in excess of about 20 km are typically swept by rapid
and energetically powerful aqueous hydration reactions. Across the full range
of comet sizes and formation times, evolutions result in the processing and
differentiation of various volatile species, and a radially heterogeneous
nucleus stucture. Our computations however also indicate that the assumed
fraction of radionuclides is a pivotal free parameter, because isotopic
analyses of the only available cometary samples suggest that no 26Al was ever
present in comet 81P/Wild 2. We show that if comets formed early in the

the fixing-the-equations approach, which was developed to control the behaviour
of the high-frequency modes of the solutions and the potentially significant

gravitational collapse, where even black hole formation might be insufficient
to shield regions of the spacetime where these pathologies might arise. Here,
we focus (as a representative example) on scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a theory
which can lead to ill-posed dynamical evolutions, but with intriguing
stationary black hole physics. We study the spherical collapse of a scalar
pulse to a black hole in the fixing-the-equations approach, comparing the early
stages of the evolution with the unfixed theory, and the later stages with its
stationary limit. With this approach, we are able to evolve past problematic
regions in the original theory, resolve black hole collapse and connect with
the static black hole solutions. Our method can thus be regarded as providing a
weak completion of the original theory, and the observed behaviour lends
support for considering previously found black hole solutions as a natural

VLT data relative to the HST-Spitzer spectrum. This offset can be explained by
the assumed radius for the common-mode correction of the VLT spectra, which is
a well-known feature of ground-based transmission spectroscopy. We find
evidence for a lack of chromospheric and photometric activity of the host star

challenging. The gold-standard is quantum state tomography (QST), capable of
fully reconstructing a quantum state without prior knowledge. Measurement and
classical computing costs, however, increase exponentially in the system size -
a bottleneck given the scale of existing and near-term quantum devices. Here,
we demonstrate a scalable and practical QST approach that uses a single
measurement setting, namely symmetric informationally complete (SIC) positive
operator-valued measures (POVM). We implement these nonorthogonal measurements
on an ion trap device by utilizing more energy levels in each ion - without
ancilla qubits. More precisely, we locally map the SIC POVM to orthogonal
states embedded in a higher-dimensional system, which we read out using
repeated in-sequence detections, providing full tomographic information in
every shot. Combining this SIC tomography with the recently developed
randomized measurement toolbox (""classical shadows"") proves to be a powerful
combination. SIC tomography alleviates the need for choosing measurement
settings at random (""derandomization""), while classical shadows enable the
estimation of arbitrary polynomial functions of the density matrix orders of
magnitudes faster than standard methods. The latter enables in-depth
entanglement studies, which we experimentally showcase on a 5-qubit absolutely
maximally entangled (AME) state. Moreover, the fact that the full tomography
information is available in every shot enables online QST in real time. We
demonstrate this on an 8-qubit entangled state, as well as for fast state

dark matter. Self-gravitating structures of such fields might be common objects
in the universe, and could comprise even galactic halos. These structures would
interact gravitationally with black holes, a process of the utmost importance
since it dictates their lifetime, the black hole motion, and possible
gravitational radiation emission.
  Here, we study the dynamics of a black hole piercing through a much larger
fully relativistic boson star, made of a complex minimally coupled massive
scalar without self-interactions. As the black hole pierces through the bosonic
structure, it is slowed down by accretion and dynamical friction, giving rise
to gravitational-wave emission. Since we are interested in studying the
interaction with large and heavy scalar structures, we consider mass ratios up
to $q\sim 10$ and length ratios ${\cal L} \sim 62$.
  Somewhat surprisingly, for all our simulations, the black hole accretes more
than 95% of the boson star material, even if an initially small black hole
collides with large velocity. This is a consequence of an extreme ""tidal
capture"" process, which binds the black hole and the boson star together, for
these mass ratios. We find evidence of a ""gravitational atom"" left behind as a
product of the process.

elliptical shape, such as a twist of the principal axis or variations in the
axis ratio with galactocentric distance. Although satisfactory lens modeling is
generally achieved without accounting for these azimuthal structures, the
question about their impact on inferred lens parameters remains, in particular,
on time delays as they are used in time-delay cosmography. This paper aims at
characterizing these effects and quantifying their impact considering realistic
amplitudes of the variations. We achieved this goal by creating mock lensing
galaxies with morphologies based on two data sets: observational data of local
elliptical galaxies, and hydrodynamical simulations of elliptical galaxies at a
typical lens redshift. We then simulated images of the lensing systems with
space-based data quality and modeled them in a standard way to assess the
impact of a lack of azimuthal freedom in the lens model. We find that twists in
lensing galaxies are easily absorbed in homoeidal lens models by a change in
orientation of the lens up to 10{\deg} with respect to the reference
orientation at the Einstein radius, and of the shear by up to 20{\deg} with
respect to the input shear orientation. The ellipticity gradients, on the other
hand, can introduce a substantial amount of shear that may impact the radial
mass model and consequently bias $H_0$, up to 10 km/s/Mpc. However, we find
that light is a good tracer of azimuthal structures, meaning that direct
imaging should be capable of diagnosing their presence. This in turn implies
that such a large bias is unlikely to be unaccounted for in standard modeling
practices. Furthermore, the overall impact of twists and ellipticity gradients
averages out at a population level. For the galaxy populations we considered,
the cosmological inference remains unbiased.

diagonalization and analytical solutions demonstrates that the results of
CheMPS are reliable over a wide range of frequencies. We then calculate the
dynamical conductivity spectra of the interacting system for various values of
the interaction and disorder strengths. In the high frequency regime, the
conductivity decays as a power law, with an interaction dependent exponent.
This behavior is qualitatively consistent with the bosonized field theory
predictions, although the numerical evaluation of the exponent shows deviations
from the analytically expected values. We also compute the characteristic
pinning frequency at which a peak in the conductivity appears. We confirm that
it is directly related to the inverse of the localization length, even in the
interacting case. We demonstrate that the localization length follows a power
law of the disorder strength with an exponent dependent on the interaction, and
find good quantitative agreement with the field theory predictions. In the low
frequency regime, we find a behavior consistent with the one of the
noninteracting system $\omega^{2}(\ln\omega)^{2}$ independently of the

wide ( > 100 au) WD+WD binaries and 24 new triples containing at least two WDs

1589 wide double-WD binaries and triples, we derive total ages of each WD using
photometric data from all-sky surveys, in conjunction with Gaia parallaxes and
current hydrogen-atmosphere WD models. Ignoring initial-to-final-mass relations
and considering only WD cooling ages, we find that roughly 21-36% of the more
massive WDs in a system have a shorter cooling age. Since more massive WDs
should be born as more massive main-sequence stars, we attribute this
unphysical disagreement as evidence of prior mergers or the presence of an
unresolved companion, suggesting that roughly 21-36% of wide WD+WD binaries
were once triples. Among the 423 wide WD+WD pairs that pass high-fidelity cuts,
we find that 25% total age uncertainties are generally appropriate for WDs with
masses > 0.63 Msun and temperatures < 12,000 K, and provide suggested inflation
factors for age uncertainties for higher-mass WDs. Overall, WDs return reliable
stellar ages, but we detail cases where total ages are least reliable,

energy, angular momentum, or centre of mass in a bounded region. The difficulty
is that there is dissipation. A self-gravitating system, confined by its own
gravity to a bounded region, radiates some of the charges away into the
environment. At a formal level, dissipation implies that some diffeomorphisms
are not Hamiltonian. In fact, there is no Hamiltonian on phase space that would
move the region relative to the fields. Recently, an extension of the covariant
phase space has been introduced to resolve the issue. On the extended phase
space, the Komar charges are Hamiltonian. They are generators of dressed
diffeomorphisms. While the construction is sound, the physical significance is
unclear. We provide a critical review before developing a geometric approach
that takes into account dissipation in a novel way. Our approach is based on
metriplectic geometry, a framework used in the description of dissipative
systems. Instead of the Poisson bracket, we introduce a Leibniz bracket - a sum
of a skew-symmetric and a symmetric bracket. The symmetric term accounts for
the loss of charge due to radiation. On the metriplectic space, the charges are
Hamiltonian, yet they are not conserved under their own flow.

remote work, and (b) the resurgence of the labor movement and an increase in
collective action in workplaces -- especially in the tech industry, where this
phenomenon has been dubbed the tech worker movement. Through a series of
qualitative interviews with 29 tech workers involved in collective action, we
investigate how labor organizers assess and mitigate risks to privacy while
engaging in these actions. Among the most common risks that organizers
experienced are retaliation from their employer, lateral worker conflict,
emotional burnout, and the possibility of information about the collective
effort leaking to management. Depending on the nature and source of the risk,
organizers use a blend of digital security practices and community-based
mechanisms. We find that digital security practices are more relevant when the
threat comes from management, while community management and moderation are
central to protecting organizers from lateral worker conflict. Since labor
organizing is a collective rather than individual project, individual privacy
and collective privacy are intertwined, sometimes in conflict and often
mutually constitutive. Notions of privacy that solely center individuals are
often incompatible with the needs of organizers, who noted that safety in
numbers could only be achieved when workers presented a united front to
management. We conclude with design recommendations that can help create safer,
more secure and more private tools to better address the risks that organizers
face.

galaxies in the TNG100 simulation. In agreement with a previous, similar
analysis of the Illustris-1 simulation, the satellites are typically poor
tracers of the mean host mass density. Unlike the Illustris-1 satellites, here
the spatial distribution of the complete satellite sample is well-fitted by an
NFW profile; however, the concentration is a factor of ~2 lower than that of
the mean host mass density. The spatial distribution of the brightest 50% and
faintest 50% of the satellites are also well-fitted by NFW profiles, but the
concentrations differ by a factor of ~2. When the sample is subdivided by host
color and luminosity, the number density profiles for blue satellites generally
fall below the mean host mass density profiles while the number density
profiles for red satellites generally rise above the mean host mass density
profiles. These opposite, systematic offsets combine to yield a moderately good
agreement between the mean mass density profile of the brightest blue hosts and
the corresponding number density profile of their satellites. Lastly, we
subdivide the satellites according to the redshifts at which they joined their
hosts. From this, we find that neither the oldest one third of the satellites
nor the youngest one third of the satellites faithfully trace the mean host
mass density.

consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE) nature. A soft X-ray flare is
detected with a delay of $\sim$200 days with respect to the optical/UV peak and
it is rapidly followed by the emergence of a broad He II $\lambda$4686 and by a
number of long-lasting high ionization coronal emission lines. This indicate a
clear connection between a TDE flare and the appearance of extreme coronal line
emission (ECLEs). An IR echo, resulting from dust re-radiation of the

well explained by a scenario in which a TDE occurs in a gas and dust rich
environment and its optical/UV, soft X-ray, and IR emission have different
origins and locations. The optical emission may be produced by stellar debris
stream collisions prior to the accretion disk formation, which is instead
responsible for the soft X-ray flare, emitted after the end of the

machine learning in the real world, but modern methods often produce
overconfident, uncalibrated uncertainty predictions. A common approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty, usable across a wide class of prediction
models, is to train a model ensemble. In a naive implementation, the ensemble
approach has high computational cost and high memory demand. This challenges in
particular modern deep learning, where even a single deep network is already
demanding in terms of compute and memory, and has given rise to a number of
attempts to emulate the model ensemble without actually instantiating separate
ensemble members. We introduce FiLM-Ensemble, a deep, implicit ensemble method
based on the concept of Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). That technique
was originally developed for multi-task learning, with the aim of decoupling
different tasks. We show that the idea can be extended to uncertainty
quantification: by modulating the network activations of a single deep network
with FiLM, one obtains a model ensemble with high diversity, and consequently
well-calibrated estimates of epistemic uncertainty, with low computational
overhead in comparison. Empirically, FiLM-Ensemble outperforms other implicit
ensemble methods, and it and comes very close to the upper bound of an explicit
ensemble of networks (sometimes even beating it), at a fraction of the memory
cost.

multiple-planet system tend to exhibit a striking degree of uniformity in their
sizes. A similar trend has also been found to hold for the masses of such
planets, but considerations of such intra-system mass uniformity have generally
been limited to statistical samples wherein a majority of systems have
constituent planetary mass measurements obtained via analysis of transit timing
variations (TTVs). Since systems with strong TTV signals typically lie in or
near mean motion resonance, it remains to be seen whether intra-system mass
uniformity is still readily emergent for non-resonant systems with non-TTV mass
provenance. We thus present in this work a mass uniformity analysis of 17
non-TTV systems with masses measured via radial velocity (RV) measurements.
Using the Gini index, a common statistic for economic inequality, as our
primary metric for uniformity, we find that our sample of 17 non-TTV systems
displays intra-system mass uniformity at a level of $\sim 2.5 \sigma$
confidence. We provide additional discussion of possible statistical and
astrophysical underpinnings for this result. We also demonstrate the existence
of a correlation ($r = 0.25$) between characteristic solid surface density
($\Sigma_0$) of the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN) and system mass Gini
index, suggesting that more massive disks may generally form systems with more
unequal planetary masses.

extend previous formulations to enable excitation of the MG by the active array
elements, deriving analytical relations connecting the passive and active

eventually allowing resolution of the detailed device configuration leading to
optimal directivity. Importantly, considering typical active array
applications, the semianalytical synthesis scheme is further developed to take
full advantage of the various degrees of freedom in the system, harnessing them
to support scanning in a wide range of extreme angles while maintaining a

the agent at the word-level, and thus, have to deal with a combinatorially
complex action space even for a medium-size vocabulary. As a result, they
struggle to produce a successful and engaging dialogue even if they are

lead-halide perovskites, we find that different valence states have different
bonding characters, leading to opposing strengthening or weakening of bonds

to an increase in the magnetic field intensity, the magnetic energy being
proportional to the extra mechanical power beyond threshold. In the transient

chromospheric heating. A similar SSD mechanism is expected to be active in the
near-surface convection of other cool main-sequence stars, but this has never
been investigated. We aim to investigate changes in stratification and
convection due to inclusion of SSD fields for F3V, G2V, K0V and M0V spectral
types in the near-surface convection. 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of
the four stellar boxes, covering the subsurface convection zone up to the lower
photosphere in a small cartesian box, are studied using the \textit{MURaM}
radiative-MHD simulation code. The SSD runs are compared against reference
hydrodynamic runs. An SSD is found to efficiently produce magnetic field with
energies ranging between 5\% to 80\% of the plasma kinetic energy at different
depths. This ratio tends to be larger for larger $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The
relative change in density and gas pressure stratification for the deeper
convective layers due to SSD magnetic fields is negligible, except for the
F-star. For the F-star, there is a substantial reduction in convective
velocities due to Lorentz force feedback from magnetic fields, which, in turn,
reduces the turbulent pressure. SSD in near-surface convection for cool
main-sequence stars introduces small but significant changes in thermodynamic
stratification (especially for the F-star) due to reduction in convective
velocities.

prototype model which is trained solely on two inputs: Geo infrared imagery
leading up to the synoptic time of interest and intensity estimates up to 6
hours prior to that time. To estimate future TC structure, we compute cloud-top
temperature radial profiles from infrared imagery and then simulate the
evolution of an ensemble of those profiles over the subsequent 12 hours by
applying a Deep Autoregressive Generative Model (PixelSNAIL). To forecast TC
intensities at hours 6 and 12, we input operational intensity estimates up to
the current time (0 h) and simulated future radial profiles up to +12 h into a
``nowcasting'' convolutional neural network. We limit our inputs to demonstrate
the viability of our approach and to enable quantification of value added by
the observed and simulated future radial profiles beyond operational intensity
estimates alone. Our prototype model achieves a marginally higher error than
the National Hurricane Center's official forecasts despite excluding
environmental factors, such as vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature.
We also demonstrate that it is possible to reasonably predict short-term

the forward diffusion process, which gradually adds noise to the input signal.
Although DDGMs are well studied, it is still unclear how the small amount of
noise is transformed during the backward diffusion process. Here, we focus on
analyzing this problem to gain more insight into the behavior of DDGMs and
their denoising and generative capabilities. We observe a fluid transition
point that changes the functionality of the backward diffusion process from
generating a (corrupted) image from noise to denoising the corrupted image to
the final sample. Based on this observation, we postulate to divide a DDGM into
two parts: a denoiser and a generator. The denoiser could be parameterized by a
denoising auto-encoder, while the generator is a diffusion-based model with its
own set of parameters. We experimentally validate our proposition, showing its

often comes at the expense of model accuracy. While aspects of the
fairness-accuracy tradeoff have been studied, most work reports the fairness
and accuracy of various models separately; this makes model comparisons nearly
impossible without a model-agnostic metric that reflects the balance of the two
desiderata. We seek to identify, quantify, and optimize the empirical Pareto
frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, we identify and
outline the empirical Pareto frontier through
Tradeoff-between-Fairness-and-Accuracy (TAF) Curves; we then develop a metric
to quantify this Pareto frontier through the weighted area under the TAF Curve
which we term the Fairness-Area-Under-the-Curve (FAUC). TAF Curves provide the
first empirical, model-agnostic characterization of the Pareto frontier, while
FAUC provides the first metric to impartially compare model families on both
fairness and accuracy. Both TAF Curves and FAUC can be employed with all group
fairness definitions and accuracy measures. Next, we ask: Is it possible to
expand the empirical Pareto frontier and thus improve the FAUC for a given
collection of fitted models? We answer affirmately by developing a novel fair
model stacking framework, FairStacks, that solves a convex program to maximize
the accuracy of model ensemble subject to a score-bias constraint. We show that
optimizing with FairStacks always expands the empirical Pareto frontier and
improves the FAUC; we additionally study other theoretical properties of our
proposed approach. Finally, we empirically validate TAF, FAUC, and FairStacks
through studies on several real benchmark data sets, showing that FairStacks
leads to major improvements in FAUC that outperform existing algorithmic
fairness approaches.

to Bayesian inference. Parallel tempering (PT) addresses this problem by
constructing a Markov chain on the expanded state space of a sequence of
distributions interpolating between the posterior distribution and a fixed
reference distribution, which is typically chosen to be the prior. However, in
the typical case where the prior and posterior are nearly mutually singular, PT
methods are computationally prohibitive. In this work we address this challenge
by constructing a generalized annealing path connecting the posterior to an
adaptively tuned variational reference. The reference distribution is tuned to
minimize the forward (inclusive) KL divergence to the posterior distribution
using a simple, gradient-free moment-matching procedure. We show that our
adaptive procedure converges to the forward KL minimizer, and that the forward
KL divergence serves as a good proxy to a previously developed measure of PT
performance. We also show that in the large-data limit in typical Bayesian
models, the proposed method improves in performance, while traditional PT
deteriorates arbitrarily. Finally, we introduce PT with two references -- one
fixed, one variational -- with a novel split annealing path that ensures stable
variational reference adaptation. The paper concludes with experiments that
demonstrate the large empirical gains achieved by our method in a wide range of

instance, a correct and complete set of topics assigned to a repository can
increase its visibility. Consequently, this improves the outcome of tasks such

Unfortunately, assigned topics are usually highly noisy, and some repositories
do not have well-assigned topics. Thus, there have been efforts on recommending
topics for software projects, however, the semantic relationships among these
topics have not been exploited so far.
  We propose two recommender models for tagging software projects that
incorporate the semantic relationship among topics. Our approach has two main
phases; (1) we first take a collaborative approach to curate a dataset of
quality topics specifically for the domain of software engineering and
development. We also enrich this data with the semantic relationships among
these topics and encapsulate them in a knowledge graph we call SED-KGraph.
Then, (2) we build two recommender systems; The first one operates only based
on the list of original topics assigned to a repository and the relationships
specified in our knowledge graph. The second predictive model, however, assumes
there are no topics available for a repository, hence it proceeds to predict
the relevant topics based on both textual information of a software project and
SED-KGraph.
  We built SED-KGraph in a crowd-sourced project with 170 contributors from
both academia and industry. The experiment results indicate that our solutions
outperform baselines that neglect the semantic relationships among topics by at
least 25% and 23% in terms of ASR and MAP metrics.

dynamical state at small radii, evolution at intermediate radii, and a
combination of evolution and mass dependence at large radii. Furthermore, the
overall flattening of the mean scaled pressure profile in the low-$z$ sample
compared to the mid-$z$ sample is consistent with expectations due to
differences in mass accretion rate and the fractional impact of feedback
mechanisms. In agreement with previous studies, the fractional scatter about
the mean scaled pressure profile reaches a minimum of $\simeq 20$ per cent near
0.5R$_{500}$. This scatter is consistent between the low-$z$ and mid-$z$

applications due to the scarcity of labeled data, as annotations are expensive
and require specialized expertise. However, in medical imaging, few-shot
learning research is sparse, limited to private data sets and is at its early
stage. In particular, the few-shot setting is of high interest in histology due
to the diversity and fine granularity of cancer related tissue classification
tasks, and the variety of data-preparation techniques. This paper introduces a
highly diversified public benchmark, gathered from various public datasets, for
few-shot histology data classification. We build few-shot tasks and
base-training data with various tissue types, different levels of domain shifts
stemming from various cancer sites, and different class-granularity levels,
thereby reflecting realistic scenarios. We evaluate the performances of
state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods on our benchmark, and observe that
simple fine-tuning and regularization methods achieve better results than the
popular meta-learning and episodic-training paradigm. Furthermore, we introduce
three scenarios based on the domain shifts between the source and target
histology data: near-domain, middle-domain and out-domain. Our experiments
display the potential of few-shot learning in histology classification, with
state-of-art few shot learning methods approaching the supervised-learning
baselines in the near-domain setting. In our out-domain setting, for 5-way
5-shot, the best performing method reaches 60% accuracy. We believe that our
work could help in building realistic evaluations and fair comparisons of
few-shot learning methods and will further encourage research in the few-shot

a likelihood that is bounded by the product of binary likelihoods, suggesting a
natural posterior approximation. This approximation makes inference
straightforward and fast; using well-known auxiliary variables for probit or
logistic regression, the product of binary models admits conjugate closed-form
variational inference that is embarrassingly parallel across categories and
invariant to category ordering. Moreover, an independent binary model
simultaneously approximates multiple CB models. Bayesian model averaging over
these can improve the quality of the approximation for any given dataset. We
show that our approach scales to thousands of categories, outperforming

shorting. Methods for incorporating these cases into the dipole design

environment. It has become an essential element of models that describe the
formation and evolution of baryons in massive virialized halos. The baryons'
radiative losses in the cores of these halos might lead to massive cooling and
vigorous star formation on the order of 10-1000 Msun/yr, whereas observations
show that the star formation rates are considerably less. It has now become
clear from an observational, theoretical and simulation perspective that the
activity of the central SMBH compensates for gas cooling losses and prevents
very high star formation rates in massive galaxies, which otherwise would be
much brighter than observed today. While AGN feedback is important over a broad
range of halo masses, the most massive objects like galaxy groups and clusters
truly provide outstanding laboratories for understanding the intrinsic details
of AGN feedback. Partly, this is because in the nearby massive objects we can
directly see what AGN feedback is doing to its surrounding hot halo in
exquisite details, as opposed to less massive systems. Yet another reason is
that in the most massive objects, the magnitude of AGN feedback has to be
extremely large, providing the most stringent constraints. In a nutshell, the
AGN feedback paradigm in groups and clusters postulates that (i) a SMBH in the
center of a halo can release a vast amount of energy, (ii) this energy can be
intercepted and thermalized by the gaseous atmosphere and (iii) the system
self-regulates so that the energy released scales with the properties of the
halo. A combination of multi-wavelength observations provides compelling
evidence of the AGN feedback importance. Similarly, theoretical arguments
suggest that self-regulation might be a natural property of a system consisting
of a gaseous atmosphere and a SMBH at the bottom of the potential well.

a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to
predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined
text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target
translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the
translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy

  Consumption",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microarchitectural attacks have become more threatening the hardware security
than before with the increasing diversity of attacks such as Spectre and
Meltdown. Vendor patches cannot keep up with the pace of the new threats, which
makes the dynamic anomaly detection tools more evident than before.
Unfortunately, previous studies utilize hardware performance counters that lead
to high performance overhead and profile limited number of microarchitectural
attacks due to the small number of counters that can be profiled concurrently.
This yields those detection tools inefficient in real-world scenarios.
  In this study, we introduce MAD-EN dynamic detection tool that leverages
system-wide energy consumption traces collected from a generic Intel RAPL tool
to detect ongoing anomalies in a system. In our experiments, we show that
CNN-based MAD-EN can detect 10 different microarchitectural attacks with a
total of 15 variants with the highest F1 score of 0.999, which makes our tool
the most generic attack detection tool so far. Moreover, individual attacks can
be distinguished with a 98% accuracy after an anomaly is detected in a system.
We demonstrate that MAD-EN introduces 69.3% less performance overhead compared
to performance counter-based detection mechanisms.

  Models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a class of Cox models with time-dependent effects that may be
zero over certain unknown time regions or, in short, sparse time-varying
effects. The model is particularly useful for biomedical studies as it
conveniently depicts the gradual evolution of effects of risk factors on
survival. Statistically, estimating and drawing inference on infinite
dimensional functional parameters with sparsity (e.g., time-varying effects
with zero-effect time intervals) present enormous challenges. To address them,
we propose a new soft-thresholding operator for modeling sparse, piecewise
smooth and continuous time-varying coefficients in a Cox time-varying effects
model. Unlike the common regularized methods, our approach enables one to
estimate non-zero time-varying effects and detect zero regions simultaneously,
and construct a new type of sparse confidence intervals that accommodate zero
regions. This leads to a more interpretable model with a straightforward
inference procedure. We develop an efficient algorithm for inference in the
target functional space, show that the proposed method enjoys desired
theoretical properties, and present its finite sample performance by way of
simulations. We apply the proposed method to analyze the data of the Boston
Lung Cancer Survivor Cohort, an epidemiological cohort study investigating the
impacts of risk factors on lung cancer survival, and obtain clinically useful
results.

medical image classification to mobile devices, potentially unlocking new

This makes communication between agents often necessary. This general setting
allows to recover and extend several recent models for collaborative bandit

coding. The three-dimensional DHT (3D DHT) can be employed to compress medical
image data, such as magnetic resonance and X-ray angiography. However, the
computation of the 3D DHT involves several multiplications by irrational
quantities, which require floating-point arithmetic and inherent truncation
errors. In recent years, a significant progress in wireless and implantable
biomedical devices has been achieved. Such devices present critical power and
hardware limitations. The multiplication operation demands higher hardware,
power, and time consumption than other arithmetic operations, such as addition
and bit-shifts. In this work, we present a set of multiplierless DHT
approximations, which can be implemented with fixed-point arithmetic. We derive
3D DHT approximations by employing tensor formalism. Such proposed methods
present prominent computational savings compared to the usual 3D DHT approach,
being appropriate for devices with limited resources. The proposed transforms
are applied in a lossy 3D DHT-based medical image compression algorithm,
presenting practically the same level of visual quality ($>98\%$ in terms of
SSIM) at a considerable reduction in computational effort ($100 \%$
multiplicative complexity reduction). Furthermore, we implemented the proposed
3D transforms in an ARM Cortex-M0+ processor employing the low-cost Raspberry
Pi Pico board. The execution time was reduced by $\sim$70% compared to the
usual 3D DHT and $\sim$90% compared to 3D DCT.

collision-free paths for a team of multiple agents while minimizing some global
cost, such as the sum of the time travelled by all agents, or the time
travelled by the last agent. Conflict Based Search (CBS) is a leading complete
and optimal MAPF solver which lazily explores the joint agent state space,
using an admissible heuristic joint plan. Such an admissible heuristic joint
plan is computed by combining individual shortest paths found without
considering inter-agent conflicts, and which becomes gradually more informed as
constraints are added to individual agents' path planning problems to avoid
discovered conflicts. In this paper, we seek to speedup CBS by finding a more
informed heuristic joint plan which is bounded from above. We first propose the
budgeted Class-Ordered A* (bCOA*), a novel algorithm that finds the shortest
path with minimal number of conflicts that is upper bounded in terms of length.
Then, we propose a novel bounded-cost variant of CBS, called CBS-Budget (CBSB)
by using a bCOA* search at the low-level search of the CBS and by using a
modified focal search at the high-level search of the CBS. We prove that CBSB
is complete and bounded-suboptimal. In our numerical experiments, CBSB finds a
near optimal solution for hundreds of agents within a fraction of a second.
CBSB shows state-of-the-art performance, comparable to Explicit Estimation CBS

to implement than EECBS, since only two priority queues at the high-level

First, it employs logical optimizations that pass information between the data

quantum theory; and (2) the origin and magnitude of the cosmological dark
energy driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe.
  In this Snowmass white paper it is proposed that these twin puzzles on
disparate scales are related, and that their resolution depends upon taking
full account of the conformal anomaly of quantum matter in gravitational
fields. The topological term in the anomaly leads naturally to the introduction
of an abelian $3$-form gauge field, whose field strength can account for a
variable gravitational condensate with the vacuum dark energy equation of state
$p=-\rho$, the magnitude of which depends upon macroscopic boundary conditions
rather than ultraviolet cutoffs. The resulting Effective Field Theory (EFT) of
low energy quantum gravity results in a non-singular `BH' interior and physical
surface replacing the classical event horizon, which is a gravitational
condensate star free of any information paradox. The development and
predictions of this EFT can be tested by gravitational waves and observational
cosmology in the coming decade.

in the process mining field to refer to constraints that span multiple process

interest, which at runtime calls for suitable monitoring techniques. Even
though event data are often stored in some sort of database, there is a lack of
database-oriented approaches to tackle compliance checking and monitoring of
(instance-spanning) constraints. In this paper, we fill this gap by showing how
well-established technology from database query processing can be effectively
used for this purpose. We propose to define an instance-spanning constraint
through an ensemble of four database queries that retrieve the satisfying,
violating, pending-satisfying, and pending-violating cases of the constraint.
In this context, the problem of compliance monitoring then becomes an
application of techniques for incremental view maintenance, which is
well-developed in database query processing. In this paper, we argue for our
approach in detail, and, as a proof of concept, present an experimental

sectioning, resolution, and detection efficiency. High-numerical-aperture (NA)
detection objective lenses provide high resolution but their narrow depth of
field fails to capture effectively the fluorescence signal generated by the
illumination light sheets, in imaging large volumes. Here, we present ExD-SPIM
(extended depth-of-field selective-plane illumination microscopy), an improved
light-sheet microscopy strategy that solves this limitation by extending the
depth of field (DOF) of high-NA detection objectives to match the thickness of
the illumination light sheet. This extension of the DOF uses a phase mask to
axially stretch the point-spread function of the objective lens while largely
preserving lateral resolution. This matching of the detection DOF to the
illumination-sheet thickness increases total fluorescence collection, reduces
background, and improves the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We
demonstrate, through numerical simulations and imaging of bead phantoms as well
as living animals, that ExD-SPIM increases the SNR by more than three-fold and
dramatically reduces the rate of fluorescence photobleaching, when compared to
a low-NA system with an equivalent depth of field. Compared to conventional
high-NA detection, ExD-SPIM improves the signal sensitivity and volumetric
coverage of whole-brain activity imaging, increasing the number of detected
neurons by over a third.

categorized into two types, i.e., source-agnostic backdoor attacks (SABAs) and
source-specific backdoor attacks (SSBAs). Compared to traditional SABAs, SSBAs
are more advanced in that they have superior stealthier in bypassing mainstream
countermeasures that are effective against SABAs. Nonetheless, existing SSBAs
suffer from two major limitations. First, they can hardly achieve a good
trade-off between ASR (attack success rate) and FPR (false positive rate).
Besides, they can be effectively detected by the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
countermeasures (e.g., SCAn). To address the limitations above, we propose a
new class of viable source-specific backdoor attacks, coined as CASSOCK. Our
key insight is that trigger designs when creating poisoned data and cover data
in SSBAs play a crucial role in demonstrating a viable source-specific attack,
which has not been considered by existing SSBAs. With this insight, we focus on
trigger transparency and content when crafting triggers for poisoned dataset
where a sample has an attacker-targeted label and cover dataset where a sample
has a ground-truth label. Specifically, we implement $CASSOCK_{Trans}$ and
$CASSOCK_{Cont}$. While both they are orthogonal, they are complementary to
each other, generating a more powerful attack, called $CASSOCK_{Comp}$, with
further improved attack performance and stealthiness. We perform a
comprehensive evaluation of the three $CASSOCK$-based attacks on four popular
datasets and three SOTA defenses. Compared with a representative SSBA as a
baseline ($SSBA_{Base}$), $CASSOCK$-based attacks have significantly advanced
the attack performance, i.e., higher ASR and lower FPR with comparable CDA
(clean data accuracy). Besides, $CASSOCK$-based attacks have effectively
bypassed the SOTA defenses, and $SSBA_{Base}$ cannot.

to collect and provides weak supervision signals. Recent works reveal a huge
gap between the implicit feedback and user-item relevance due to the fact that
implicit feedback is also closely related to the item exposure. To bridge this
gap, existing approaches explicitly model the exposure and propose unbiased
estimators to improve the relevance. Unfortunately, these unbiased estimators
suffer from the high gradient variance, especially for long-tail items, leading
to inaccurate gradient updates and degraded model performance. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a low-variance unbiased estimator from a probabilistic
perspective, which effectively bounds the variance of the gradient. Unlike
previous works which either estimate the exposure via heuristic-based
strategies or use a large biased training set, we propose to estimate the
exposure via an unbiased small-scale validation set. Specifically, we first
parameterize the user-item exposure by incorporating both user and item
information, and then construct an unbiased validation set from the biased
training set. By leveraging the unbiased validation set, we adopt bi-level
optimization to automatically update exposure-related parameters along with
recommendation model parameters during the learning. Experiments on two

generative models for synthetic data often do not admit explicit probability
distributions, classical statistical procedures for assessing model
goodness-of-fit may not be applicable. In this paper, we propose a principled
procedure to assess the quality of a synthetic data generator. The procedure is
a kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD)-type test which is based on a
non-parametric Stein operator for the synthetic data generator of interest.
This operator is estimated from samples which are obtained from the synthetic
data generator and hence can be applied even when the model is only implicit.
In contrast to classical testing, the sample size from the synthetic data
generator can be as large as desired, while the size of the observed data,
which the generator aims to emulate is fixed. Experimental results on synthetic
distributions and trained generative models on synthetic and real datasets
illustrate that the method shows improved power performance compared to

binding energies can vary by more than 2 eV due to insertion at different
lattice sites, at grain boundaries, in disordered Ta, and in the vicinity of
various impurities. However, the total range of Li 1s shifts does not exceed 4
eV, even for extreme amorphous disorder. Further, when investigating the
effects on the Li 2s levels, we find broadening of more than 5 eV due to
hybridization with the Ta band structure. Materials effects are shown to
contribute significantly to peak broadening in Ta-based sensors that are used
to search for physics beyond the standard model in the EC decay of $^7$Be, but
they do not explain the full extent of observed broadening. Understanding these

analysis to quantify the lifetime survival benefit associated with a new
intervention, due to the restricted duration of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs). Current approaches of extrapolation often assume that the treatment
effect observed in the trial can continue indefinitely, which is unrealistic
and may have a huge impact on decisions for resource allocation. Objective We
introduce a novel methodology as a possible solution to alleviate the problem
of performing survival extrapolation with heavily censored data from clinical
trials. Method The main idea is to mix a flexible model (e.g., Cox
semi-parametric) to fit as well as possible the observed data and a parametric
model encoding assumptions on the expected behaviour of underlying long-term
survival. The two are ""blended"" into a single survival curve that is identical
with the Cox model over the range of observed times and gradually approaching
the parametric model over the extrapolation period based on a weight function.
The weight function regulates the way two survival curves are blended,
determining how the internal and external sources contribute to the estimated
survival over time. Results A 4-year follow-up RCT of rituximab in combination
with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone
for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is used to
illustrate the method. Conclusion Long-term extrapolation from immature trial
data may lead to significantly different estimates with various modelling
assumptions. The blending approach provides sufficient flexibility, allowing a
wide range of plausible scenarios to be considered as well as the inclusion of
genuine external information, based e.g. on hard data or expert opinion. Both
internal and external validity can be carefully examined.

of Virgo dwarfs in the central part of the cluster has significantly higher
values of [CII]/TIR than the sample from the southern part of the cluster and
the sample from the DGS, while the southern sample is consistent with the DGS.
This [CII]/TIR excess implies that a significant fraction of the [CII] in the
dwarf galaxies in the cluster center has an origin other than star formation

cortical function and has achieved equal performance to BP on supervised

approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient

BP. Our results further show how the standard implementation of IL can be
altered to better approximate implicit SGD. Our novel implementation
considerably improves the stability of IL across learning rates, which is

such ratings tend to be averaged across all users and then utilized as feedback
to improve the system or personalize its behavior. While this method can be
useful to understand broad, general issues with the system and its behavior, it
does not take into account differences between users that affect their ratings.
In this work, we conduct a study to better understand how people rate their
interactions with conversational agents. One macro-level characteristic that
has been shown to correlate with how people perceive their inter-personal
communication is personality. We specifically focus on agreeableness and
extraversion as variables that may explain variation in ratings and therefore
provide a more meaningful signal for training or personalization. In order to
elicit those personality traits during an interaction with a conversational
agent, we designed and validated a fictional story, grounded in prior work in
psychology. We then implemented the story into an experimental conversational
agent that allowed users to opt-in to hearing the story. Our results suggest
that for human-conversational agent interactions, extraversion may play a role
in user ratings, but more data is needed to determine if the relationship is
significant. Agreeableness, on the other hand, plays a statistically
significant role in conversation ratings: users who are more agreeable are more
likely to provide a higher rating for their interaction. In addition, we found
that users who opted to hear the story were, in general, more likely to rate
their conversational experience higher than those who did not.

a very steep decline. A spectrum taken during this steep decline phase shows
clear signatures of shock interaction with dense circumstellar medium (CSM).
Here we explore the possibility of iPTF14hls as an interaction-powered SN. The
light curve of iPTF14hls can be fitted with wind-like CSMs. Analytic modeling
indicates that iPTF14hls may have undertaken six episodes of mass loss during

establish the existence of self-similarity in F-1, B-1 and B-3, and universal

pixel-wise annotated data. Due to their costly nature, these annotations might
not be available for the task at hand. To alleviate this problem, unsupervised
domain adaptation approaches aim at aligning the feature distributions between
the labeled source and the unlabeled target data. While these strategies lead
to noticeable improvements, their effectiveness remains limited. To guide the
domain adaptation task more efficiently, previous works attempted to include
human interactions in this process under the form of sparse single-pixel
annotations in the target data. In this work, we propose a new domain
adaptation framework for semantic segmentation with annotated points via active
selection. First, we conduct an unsupervised domain adaptation of the model;
from this adaptation, we use an entropy-based uncertainty measurement for
target points selection. Finally, to minimize the domain gap, we propose a
domain adaptation framework utilizing these target points annotated by human
annotators. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness
of our methods against existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. The
propose pipeline is generic and can be included as an extra module to existing
domain adaptation strategies.

  Leibe","Differentiable Soft-Masked Attention","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2112.09131",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformers have become prevalent in computer vision due to their
performance and flexibility in modelling complex operations. Of particular
significance is the 'cross-attention' operation, which allows a vector
representation (e.g. of an object in an image) to be learned by attending to an
arbitrarily sized set of input features. Recently, ""Masked Attention"" was
proposed in which a given object representation only attends to those image
pixel features for which the segmentation mask of that object is active. This
specialization of attention proved beneficial for various image and video
segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose another specialization of
attention which enables attending over `soft-masks' (those with continuous mask
probabilities instead of binary values), and is also differentiable through
these mask probabilities, thus allowing the mask used for attention to be
learned within the network without requiring direct loss supervision. This can
be useful for several applications. Specifically, we employ our ""Differentiable
Soft-Masked Attention"" for the task of Weakly-Supervised Video Object
Segmentation (VOS), where we develop a transformer-based network for VOS which
only requires a single annotated image frame for training, but can also benefit
from cycle consistency training on a video with just one annotated frame.
Although there is no loss for masks in unlabeled frames, the network is still
able to segment objects in those frames due to our novel attention formulation.

residential load rationing, and incentive-based demand response. By simulating
on a synthetic but realistic large-scale Texas grid model along with demand
flexibility modeling and electricity outage data, we identify portfolios of
mixing mechanisms that exactly avoid outages, which a single mechanism may fail
due to decaying marginal effects. We also reveal a complementary relationship
between interruptible load and residential load rationing and find nonlinear
impacts of incentive-based demand response on the efficacy of other mechanisms.

establish the $L_p$-sine Blaschke-Santal\'{o} inequality for the $L_p$-sine
centroid body.
  The $L_p$-sine centroid body $\Lambda_p K$ for a star body
$K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a convex body based on the $L_p$-sine transform, and
its associated Blaschke-Santal\'{o} inequality provides an upper bound for the
volume of $\Lambda_p^{\circ}K$, the polar body of $\Lambda_p K$, in terms of
the volume of $K$. Thus, this inequality can be viewed as the ""sine cousin"" of
the $L_p$ Blaschke-Santal\'{o} inequality established by Lutwak and Zhang. As
$p\rightarrow \infty$, the limit of $\Lambda_p^{\circ} K$ becomes the sine
polar body $K^{\diamond}$ and hence the $L_p$-sine Blaschke-Santal\'{o}
inequality reduces to the sine Blaschke-Santal\'{o} inequality for the sine
polar body. The sine polarity naturally leads to a new class of convex bodies
$\mathcal{C}_{e}^n$, which consists of all origin-symmetric convex bodies
generated by the intersection of origin-symmetric closed solid cylinders. Many
notions in $\mathcal{C}_{e}^n$ are developed, including the cylindrical support
function, the supporting cylinder, the cylindrical Gauss image, and the
cylindrical hull. Based on these newly introduced notions, the equality
conditions of the sine Blaschke-Santal\'{o} inequality are settled.

the communication bottleneck for the busiest node among all clients and, at the

calculations based on the frame of Migdal-Eliashberg theory successfully
reproduce the two-gap superconductivity of MgB2. The results show that the
tensile biaxial strain can increase the critical temperature of MgB2 while the
compressive biaxial strain would decrease the critical temperature. The
detailed microscopic mechanism of the biaxial strain effect on the
superconducting properties was studied by calculations of electronic structures
and phonon dispersions. The increased Tc is a combining result of the increased
electron density at the Fermi level and the in-plane boron phonon softening. By
means of high-throughput screening of proper substrates, it is found that most
of the substrates would result in tensile strain in MgB2 film, which is in

they do not always learn the correct linguistic concepts. Specifically, they

We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to validate the method and surface
how well various deep NLP models learn word order. Using synthetic data, we
first show that OSV is more faithful in explaining model behavior than
gradient-based methods. Second, applying to the HANS dataset, we discover that
the BERT-based NLI model uses only the word occurrences without word orders.
Although simple data augmentation improves accuracy on HANS, OSV shows that the
augmented model does not fundamentally improve the model's learning of order.
Third, we discover that not all sentiment analysis models learn negation
properly: some fail to capture the correct syntax of the negation construct.
Finally, we show that pretrained language models such as BERT may rely on the
absolute positions of subject words to learn long-range Subject-Verb Agreement.
With each NLP task, we also demonstrate how OSV can be leveraged to generate

positively associated and 2) the association between these counts in two
distinct areas decays exponentially with respect to distance outside some small

for the Normal approximation technique for associated point processes, i.e.,
the establishment of non-asymptotic $L^1$ bounds for the functionals of these

Therefore, the available reflection-refraction models are insufficient to

optimizing the hybrid beamforming of IOS-assisted networks and hence improving

findings, and to evaluate the performance of full-dimensional beamforming, we
implement a prototype of IOS and deploy an IOS-assisted wireless communication

to suffer from performance degradation when applied to new data that differs
from training data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address this challenge
by adapting a model to unlabeled data at test time. TTA can be applied to
pretrained networks without modifying their training procedures, enabling them
to utilize a well-formed source distribution for adaptation. One possible
approach is to align the representation space of test samples to the source
distribution (\textit{i.e.,} feature alignment). However, performing feature
alignment in TTA is especially challenging in that access to labeled source
data is restricted during adaptation. That is, a model does not have a chance
to learn test data in a class-discriminative manner, which was feasible in
other adaptation tasks (\textit{e.g.,} unsupervised domain adaptation) via
supervised losses on the source data. Based on this observation, we propose a
simple yet effective feature alignment loss, termed as Class-Aware Feature
Alignment (CAFA), which simultaneously 1) encourages a model to learn target
representations in a class-discriminative manner and 2) effectively mitigates
the distribution shifts at test time. Our method does not require any

products between the queries and keys, which results from the use of
unnormalized Gaussian kernels with the assumption that the queries follow a
mixture of Gaussian distribution. There is no guarantee that this assumption is
valid in practice. In response, we first interpret attention in transformers as
a nonparametric kernel regression. We then propose the FourierFormer, a new
class of transformers in which the dot-product kernels are replaced by the
novel generalized Fourier integral kernels. Different from the dot-product
kernels, where we need to choose a good covariance matrix to capture the
dependency of the features of data, the generalized Fourier integral kernels
can automatically capture such dependency and remove the need to tune the
covariance matrix. We theoretically prove that our proposed Fourier integral
kernels can efficiently approximate any key and query distributions. Compared
to the conventional transformers with dot-product attention, FourierFormers
attain better accuracy and reduce the redundancy between attention heads. We
empirically corroborate the advantages of FourierFormers over the baseline

estimation in generalized linear models (GLMs), a generalization of linear
models when the link function can be non-linear. While GD has optimal
statistical and computational complexities for estimating the true parameter
under the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime of the GLMs, it has
sub-optimal complexities when the SNR is low, namely, the iterates of GD
require polynomial number of iterations to reach the final statistical radius.
The slow convergence of GD for the low SNR case is mainly due to the local
convexity of the least-square loss functions of the GLMs. Even though Newton's
method can be used to resolve the flat curvature of the loss functions, its
computational cost is prohibitive in high-dimensional settings due to its per
iteration cost of $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$. To address the shortcomings of GD and
Newton's method, we propose to use Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
quasi-Newton method to solve parameter estimation of the GLMs, which has a per
iteration cost of $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$. On the optimization side, when the SNR is
low, we demonstrate that iterates of BFGS converge linearly to the optimal
solution of the population least-square loss function, and the contraction
coefficient of the BFGS algorithm is comparable to that of Newton's method. On
the statistical side, we prove that the iterates of BFGS reach the final

In this paper, a tiny VITS-based TTS model, named AdaVITS, for low computing
resource speaker adaptation is proposed. To effectively reduce parameters and
computational complexity of VITS, an iSTFT-based wave construction decoder is
proposed to replace the upsampling-based decoder which is resource-consuming in
the original VITS. Besides, NanoFlow is introduced to share the density
estimate across flow blocks to reduce the parameters of the prior encoder.
Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity of the textual encoder,
scaled-dot attention is replaced with linear attention. To deal with the
instability caused by the simplified model, instead of using the original text
encoder, phonetic posteriorgram (PPG) is utilized as linguistic feature via a
text-to-PPG module, which is then used as input for the encoder. Experiment

the SNR, but mainly in the north-east. The CO distribution revealed an enhanced
line intensity ratio of CO($J$ = 2-1)/($J$ = 1-0) transitions as well as CO
line broadening, which indicate shock heating/acceleration. The results support
that Puppis A is located at 1.4 kpc, in the local arm. The ISM interacting with
the SNR has a large mass of $\sim$10$^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$ which is dominated by
HI, showing good spatial correspondence with the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray image.
This favors the hadronic origin of the gamma-rays, while additional
contribution of the leptonic component is not excluded. The distribution of the
X-ray ionization timescales within the shell suggests that the shock front
ionized various parts of the ISM at epochs ranging over a few to ten 1000 yr.
We therefore suggest that the age of the SNR is around 10$^{4}$ yr as given by
the largest ionization timescale. We estimate the total cosmic ray energy
$W_{\rm p}$ to be 10$^{47}$ erg, which is well placed in the cosmic-ray
escaping phase of an age-$W_{\rm p}$ plot including more than ten SNRs.

similarity matching based on the distance metric, without considering
inter-binary semantic interactions. Moreover, they often rely on the
large-scale external code corpus for instruction embeddings pre-training, which
is heavyweight and easy to suffer the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. In this
paper, we propose an interaction-based cross-architecture IoT binary similarity
comparison system, Inter-BIN. Our key insight is to introduce interaction
between instruction sequences by co-attention mechanism, which can flexibly
perform soft alignment of semantically related instructions from different
architectures. And we design a lightweight multi-feature fusion-based
instruction embedding method, which can avoid the heavy workload and the OOV
problem of previous approaches. Extensive experiments show that Inter-BIN can
significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on cross-architecture
binary similarity comparison tasks of different input granularities.
Furthermore, we present an IoT malware function matching dataset from real
network environments, CrossMal, containing 1,878,437 cross-architecture reuse
function pairs. Experimental results on CrossMal prove that Inter-BIN is
practical and scalable on real-world binary similarity comparison collections.

many object detection tasks, but the generalization ability of those methods is
still quite challenging for cross-domain adaptation scenarios. To address the
cross-domain issue, a straightforward way is to perform token alignment with
adversarial training in transformers. However, its performance is often
unsatisfactory as the tokens in detection transformers are quite diverse and
represent different spatial and semantic information. In this paper, we propose
a new method called Spatial-aware and Semantic-aware Token Alignment (SSTA) for
cross-domain detection transformers. In particular, we take advantage of the
characteristics of cross-attention as used in detection transformer and propose
the spatial-aware token alignment (SpaTA) and the semantic-aware token
alignment (SemTA) strategies to guide the token alignment across domains. For
spatial-aware token alignment, we can extract the information from the
cross-attention map (CAM) to align the distribution of tokens according to
their attention to object queries. For semantic-aware token alignment, we
inject the category information into the cross-attention map and construct
domain embedding to guide the learning of a multi-class discriminator so as to
model the category relationship and achieve category-level token alignment
during the entire adaptation process. We conduct extensive experiments on
several widely-used benchmarks, and the results clearly show the effectiveness
of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.

the given data example into two views, which is considered essential and
irreplaceable. However, the predetermined composition of multiple data
augmentations brings two drawbacks. First, the artificial choice of
augmentation types brings specific representational invariances to the model,
which have different degrees of positive and negative effects on different
downstream tasks. Treating each type of augmentation equally during training
makes the model learn non-optimal representations for various downstream tasks
and limits the flexibility to choose augmentation types beforehand. Second, the
strong data augmentations used in classic contrastive learning methods may
bring too much invariance in some cases, and fine-grained information that is
essential to some downstream tasks may be lost. This paper proposes a general
method to alleviate these two problems by considering where and what to
contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. We first propose to learn
different augmentation invariances at different depths of the model according
to the importance of each data augmentation instead of learning
representational invariances evenly in the backbone. We then propose to expand
the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to reduce the misleading
effects of strong data augmentations. Experiments based on several baseline
methods demonstrate that we learn better representations for various benchmarks
on classification, detection, and segmentation downstream tasks.

cost function subject to the satisfaction of one or more safety conditions with
high probability, given that the probability distribution of the uncertain
problem parameters affecting the safety condition(s) is only known to belong to
some ambiguity set. We study three popular approximation schemes for
distributionally robust chance constrained programs over Wasserstein balls,
where the ambiguity set contains all probability distributions within a certain
Wasserstein distance to a reference distribution. The first approximation
replaces the chance constraint with a bound on the conditional value-at-risk,
the second approximation decouples different safety conditions via Bonferroni's
inequality, and the third approximation restricts the expected violation of the
safety condition(s) so that the chance constraint is satisfied. We show that
the conditional value-at-risk approximation can be characterized as a tight
convex approximation, which complements earlier findings on classical
(non-robust) chance constraints, and we offer a novel interpretation in terms
of transportation savings. We also show that the three approximations can
perform arbitrarily poorly in data-driven settings, and that they are generally
incomparable with each other.

mechanisms or explicit communication protocols to ensure convergence. This
paper studies the problem of distributed multi-agent learning without resorting
to centralized components or explicit communication. It examines the use of
distribution matching to facilitate the coordination of independent agents. In
the proposed scheme, each agent independently minimizes the distribution
mismatch to the corresponding component of a target visitation distribution.
The theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions, each agent
minimizing its individual distribution mismatch allows the convergence to the
joint policy that generated the target distribution. Further, if the target
distribution is from a joint policy that optimizes a cooperative task, the
optimal policy for a combination of this task reward and the distribution
matching reward is the same joint policy. This insight is used to formulate a
practical algorithm (DM$^2$), in which each individual agent matches a target
distribution derived from concurrently sampled trajectories from a joint expert
policy. Experimental validation on the StarCraft domain shows that combining
(1) a task reward, and (2) a distribution matching reward for expert
demonstrations for the same task, allows agents to outperform a naive
distributed baseline. Additional experiments probe the conditions under which
expert demonstrations need to be sampled to obtain the learning benefits.

from expert demonstrations. A generalizable reward function is even desired as
it captures the fundamental motivation of the expert. However, classical IRL
methods can only recover reward functions coupled with the training dynamics,
thus are hard to generalize to a changed environment. Previous
dynamics-agnostic reward learning methods have strict assumptions, such as that
the reward function has to be state-only. This work proposes a general approach
to learn transferable reward functions, Dynamics-Agnostic
Discriminator-Ensemble Reward Learning (DARL). Following the adversarial
imitation learning (AIL) framework, DARL learns a dynamics-agnostic
discriminator on a latent space mapped from the original state-action space.
The latent space is learned to contain the least information of the dynamics.
Moreover, to reduce the reliance of the discriminator on policies, the reward
function is represented as an ensemble of the discriminators during training.
We assess DARL in four MuJoCo tasks with dynamics transfer. Empirical results
compared with the state-of-the-art AIL methods show that DARL can learn a
reward that is more consistent with the true reward, thus obtaining higher
environment returns.

network captures the uncertainty of prediction by putting a prior distribution
for the parameter of the model and computing the posterior distribution. In
this paper, we show that the Bayesian neural network using spike-and-slab prior
has consistency with nearly minimax convergence rate when the true regression
function is in the Besov space. Even when the smoothness of the regression
function is unknown the same posterior convergence rate holds and thus the
spike-and-slab prior is adaptive to the smoothness of the regression function.
We also consider the shrinkage prior, which is more feasible than other priors,
and show that it has the same convergence rate. In other words, we propose a
practical Bayesian neural network with guaranteed asymptotic properties.

which can satisfy the users' various needs with one-stop convenience. Recent
methods usually take advantage of both user-bundle and user-item interactions
information to obtain informative representations for users and bundles,
corresponding to bundle view and item view, respectively. However, they either
use a unified view without differentiation or loosely combine the predictions
of two separate views, while the crucial cooperative association between the
two views' representations is overlooked. In this work, we propose to model the
cooperative association between the two different views through cross-view
contrastive learning. By encouraging the alignment of the two separately
learned views, each view can distill complementary information from the other
view, achieving mutual enhancement. Moreover, by enlarging the dispersion of
different users/bundles, the self-discrimination of representations is
enhanced. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin. Meanwhile, our method
requires minimal parameters of three set of embeddings (user, bundle, and item)
and the computational costs are largely reduced due to more concise graph
structure and graph learning module. In addition, various ablation and model
studies demystify the working mechanism and justify our hypothesis. Codes and

the transmission overhead. Moreover, since each task is of different difficulty

develop the multi-exit architecture to provide early-exit results for
relatively simple tasks. In the experiments, we employ a proposed U-DeepSC to

Linear proportional-integral (PI) controllers are almost always used in
practice, but the linear parameterization of the controller fundamentally
limits its performance. Learning-based approaches are becoming popular in
designing nonlinear controllers, but the lack of stability guarantees makes the
learned controllers difficult to apply in practical applications. This paper
bridges the gap between neural network-based controller design and the need for
stability guarantees. Using equilibrium-independent passivity, a property
present in a wide range of physical systems, we propose structured neural-PI
controllers that have provable guarantees on the convergence of output to a
desired agreement value. If communication between neighbours is available, we
further extend the controller to distributedly achieve optimal resource
allocation at the steady state. We explicitly characterize the stability
conditions and engineer neural networks that satisfy them by design.
Experiments on traffic and power networks demonstrate that the proposed
approach can improve transient and steady-state performances compared to
existing state-of-the-art, while unstructured neural networks lead to unstable

drugs, which can accelerate the drug development process and play an important
role in the existing drug discovery system. However, the number of validated
drug-disease associations is scarce compared to the number of drugs and
diseases in the real world. Too few labeled samples will make the
classification model unable to learn effective latent factors of drugs,
resulting in poor generalization performance. In this work, we propose a
multi-task self-supervised learning framework for computational drug
repositioning. The framework tackles label sparsity by learning a better drug
representation. Specifically, we take the drug-disease association prediction
problem as the main task, and the auxiliary task is to use data augmentation
strategies and contrast learning to mine the internal relationships of the
original drug features, so as to automatically learn a better drug
representation without supervised labels. And through joint training, it is
ensured that the auxiliary task can improve the prediction accuracy of the main
task. More precisely, the auxiliary task improves drug representation and
serving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we
design a multi-input decoding network to improve the reconstruction ability of
the autoencoder model. We evaluate our model using three real-world datasets.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task
self-supervised learning framework, and its predictive ability is superior to
the state-of-the-art model.

  We develop the Processing-in-DRAM (PiDRAM) framework, the first flexible,

ease of use of PiDRAM, we implement two PiM techniques: (1) RowClone, an
in-DRAM copy and initialization mechanism (using command sequences proposed by
ComputeDRAM), and (2) D-RaNGe, an in-DRAM true random number generator based on
DRAM activation-latency failures.
  Our end-to-end evaluation of RowClone shows up to 14.6X speedup for copy and
12.6X initialization operations over CPU copy (i.e., conventional memcpy) and

we address this question for the spin $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the

the quantum phase diagram. The U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state of the
nearest-neighbor antiferromagnet remains remarkably robust till intermediate
coupling strengths when it transitions into a pinwheel valence bond crystal
displaying signatures of half-moons in its structure factor. Our work thus
identifies a microscopic setting that realizes one of the proximate orders of
the Dirac spin liquid identified in a recent work [Song, Wang, Vishwanath, He,

which are transductive and do not naturally generalise to unseen nodes. To make
those models inductive, they use extra resources, like pretrained word

an optimal set of informative feature fields for efficient and effective

the importance of feature fields by using their corresponding continuous
weights from the model, then remove the feature fields with small weight
values. However, removing many features that correspond to small but not exact
zero weights will inevitably hurt model performance and not be friendly to
hot-start model training. There is also no theoretical guarantee that the
magnitude of weights can represent the importance, thus possibly leading to
sub-optimal results if using these methods.
  To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Learnable Polarizing Feature
Selection (LPFS) method using a smoothed-$\ell^0$ function in literature.
Furthermore, we extend LPFS to LPFS++ by our newly designed
smoothed-$\ell^0$-liked function to select a more informative subset of
features. LPFS and LPFS++ can be used as gates inserted at the input of the
deep network to control the active and inactive state of each feature. When
training is finished, some gates are exact zero, while others are around one,
which is particularly favored by the practical hot-start training in the
industry, due to no damage to the model performance before and after removing

the quality of the selected network routes and nodes' energy consumption. In
this paper, we present RLProbe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in

waste. To achieve this goal, RLProbe leverages both synchronous and
asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link
quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility.
Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring
procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing
operations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of
simulations and real experiments. Results demonstrated that RLProbe helps in
effectively improving packet loss rates, allowing nodes to promptly react to
link quality variations as well as to link failures due to node mobility.

their modular structure. Cascading ensembles are a popular instance of
black-box ensembles that appear to improve certified robust accuracies in
practice. However, we show that the robustness certifier used by a cascading

robust at an input $x$ (with respect to $\epsilon$), there can be inputs $x'$
in the $\epsilon$-ball centered at $x$, such that the cascade's prediction at
$x'$ is different from $x$ and thus the ensemble is not locally robust. Our
theoretical findings are accompanied by empirical results that further
demonstrate this unsoundness. We present \emph{cascade attack} (CasA), an
adversarial attack against cascading ensembles, and show that: (1) there exists
an adversarial input for up to 88\% of the samples where the ensemble claims to

saturating counters are in and further infer sensitive information. To obtain
theoretical guarantees, we use Markov chain to formalize the attack algorithm
applied to the saturating counter, investigate into the optimal attack strategy
and calculate the probability of successful attack. Furthermore, we find that
the attacker is able to accurately guess the branch execution of the victim's
process in the existing saturating counters. To avoid this, we design a new
probabilistic saturating counter, which generalizes the existing conventional
and probabilistic saturating counters. The guarantee of differential privacy is
applied to deduce parameters of the new saturating counters so that the
security requirement can be satisfied. We also theoretically calculate the
misprediction rate when the saturating counter reaches the steady state. The
experimental results on testing programs show that the calculated theoretical
results agree with the experimental performances. Compared with the existing

radically over the last decade, it is become easier and easier to study at

questions and overall pipelines differ radically, almost all start with a
crucial first step - evaluation of global perceptual similarity between
different images. That initial step is crucial for overall pipeline performance
and processes most images. A number of algorithms are available and currently
used to perform it, but so far no comprehensive review was available to guide
the choice of researchers as to the choice of an algorithm best suited to their
question, assumptions and computational resources. With this paper we aim to
fill this gap, showing that classical computer vision methods are not
necessarily the best approach, whereas a pair of relatively little used methods

intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We present a systematic search for a
putative IMBH in 81 Milky Way GCs, based on archival Chandra X-ray
observations. We find in only six GCs a significant X-ray source positionally
coincident with the cluster center, which have 0.5-8 keV luminosities between
$\sim1\times 10^{30}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ to $\sim 4\times10^{33}~{\rm
erg~s^{-1}}$. However, the spectral and temporal properties of these six
sources can also be explained in terms of binary stars. The remaining 75 GCs do
not have a detectable central source, most with $3\sigma$ upper limits ranging
between $10^{29-32}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ over 0.5-8 keV, which are significantly
lower than predicted for canonical Bondi accretion. To help understand the
feeble X-ray signature, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of stellar wind
accretion onto a $1000~{\rm M_\odot}$ IMBH from the most-bound orbiting star,
for stellar wind properties consistent with either a main-sequence (MS) star or
an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. We find that the synthetic X-ray
luminosity for the MS case ($\sim 10^{19}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) is far below the
current X-ray limits. The predicted X-ray luminosity for the AGB case ($\sim
10^{34}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$), on the other hand, is compatible with the detected
central X-ray sources, in particular the ones in Terzan 5 and NGC 6652.
However, the probability of having an AGB star as the most-bound star around
the putative IMBH is very low. Our study strongly suggests that it is very
challenging to detect the accretion-induced X-ray emission from IMBHs, even if
they were prevalent in present-day GCs.

language processing, and have recently gained a lot of attention. To determine
the insdel distances of linear codes is a very challenging problem. The
half-Singleton bound on the insdel distances of linear codes due to
Cheng-Guruswami-Haeupler-Li is a basic upper bound on the insertion-deletion
error-correcting capabilities of linear codes. On the other hand the natural
direct upper bound $d_I(\mathcal C) \leq 2d_H(\mathcal C)$ is valid for any
insdel code. In this paper, for a linear insdel code $\mathcal C$ we propose a
strict half-Singleton upper bound $d_I(\mathcal C) \leq 2(n-2k+1)$ if $\mathcal
C$ does not contain the codeword with all 1s, and a stronger direct upper bound
$d_I(\mathcal C) \leq 2(d_H(\mathcal C)-t)$ under a weak condition, where
$t\geq 1$ is a positive integer determined by the generator matrix. We also
give optimal linear insdel codes attaining our strict half-Singleton bound and
direct upper bound, and show that the code length of optimal binary linear
insdel codes with respect to the (strict) half-Singleton bound is about twice

of products where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed
without child labour, while the producer uses the term to signify that their
new product uses marginally less power than the previous generation of that
products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different
notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards
optimising our subject of study towards one specific sustainability metric -
let's say energy consumption - while being blissfully unaware of, e.g., social
impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.
  In this paper I dissect the idea of sustainable safety and security, starting
from the questions of what we want to sustain, and for whom we want to sustain
it. I believe that a general ""people and planet"" answer is inadequate here
because this form of sustainability cannot be the property of a single industry
sector but must be addressed by society as a whole. However, with sufficient
understanding of life-cycle impacts we may very well be able to devise research
and development efforts, and inform decision making processes towards the use
of integrated safety and security solutions that help us to address societal
challenges in the context of the climate and ecological crises, and that are
aligned with concepts such as intersectionality and climate justice. Of course,
these solutions can only be effective if they are embedded in societal and
economic change towards more frugal uses of data and ICT.

spatial domains. The imposition of the boundary conditions is realized weakly
via non-standard functionals; the latter classically arise in the construction
of Galerkin-type numerical methods and are often referred to as ""Nitsche-type""

Otto (JKO) \cite{jko}, we consider the second class of discrete gradient flows
for special classes of dissipative evolution PDE problems with non-essential

network approximations. A key, distinct aspect of the proposed methods is that
the discretization is constructed via a sequence of residual-type deep neural
networks (DNN) corresponding to implicit time-stepping. As a result, a DNN
represents the PDE problem solution at each time node. This approach offers
several advantages in the training of each DNN. We present a series of

alignment operation, although most do not focus on efficiency. Therefore, an
image alignment block which can both work in time and/or space and can work on
edge devices would be beneficial for almost all networks dealing with multiple
images. Given its wide usage and importance, we propose an efficient,
cross-attention-based, multi-purpose image alignment block (XABA) suitable to
work within edge devices. Using cross-attention, we exploit the relationships
between features extracted from images. To make cross-attention feasible for
real-time image alignment problems and handle large motions, we provide a
pyramidal block based cross-attention scheme. This also captures local
relationships besides reducing memory requirements and number of operations.
Efficient XABA models achieve real-time requirements of running above 20 FPS
performance on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier with 30W power consumption compared to
other powerful computers. Used as a sub-block in a larger network, XABA also
improves multi-image super-resolution network performance in comparison to

observed at various telescopes and expected on the large telescopes under
construction. This so-called island effect induces differential pistons, tips
and tilts on the pupil petals, deforming the instrumental PSF, and is one of
the main limitations to the detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging.
These aberrations have different origins such as the low-wind effect or
petaling errors in the adaptive-optics reconstruction. In this paper, we
propose to alleviate the impact of the aberrations induced by island effects on
high-contrast imaging by adapting the coronagraph design in order to increase
its robustness to petal-level aberrations. Following a method first developed
for errors due to primary mirror segmentation (segment phasing errors, missing
segments...), we develop and test Redundant Apodized Pupils (RAP), i.e.
apodizers designed at the petal-scale, then duplicated and rotated to mimic the
pupil petal geometry. We apply this concept to the ELT architecture, made of
six identical petals, to yield a 10^-6 contrast in a dark region from 8 to
40lambda/D. Both amplitude and phase apodizers proposed in this paper are
robust to differential pistons between petals, with minimal degradation to
their coronagraphic PSFs and contrast levels. In addition, they are also more
robust to petal-level tip-tilt errors than apodizers designed for the whole
pupil, with which the limit of contrast of 10^-6 in the coronagraph dark zone
is achieved for constraints up to 2 rad RMS of these petal-level modes. The RAP
concept proves its robustness to island effects (low-wind effect and
post-adaptive optics petaling), with an application to the ELT architecture. It
can also be considered for other 8- to 30-meter class ground-based units such
as VLT/SPHERE, Subaru/SCExAO, GMT/GMagAO-X, or TMT/PSI.

routinely used in two-phase (liquid-gas) detectors for low-energy

visible-light EL in two-phase argon detectors have been systematically studied
for the first time. In particular, two unusual slow components in the EL
signal, with their contributions and time constants increasing with electric
field, were observed. This puzzling property is not expected in any of the
known mechanisms of photon and electron emission in two-phase media. Time
constants of these components is about 4-5 $\mu$s and 50 $\mu$s. In addition, a
specific threshold behavior of the slow components was revealed: they emerged
at a threshold in reduced electric field of 4.8 $\pm$ 0.2 Td regardless of the
gas phase density, which is about 1 Td above the onset of standard (excimer)
EL. There is a conspicuous similarity between this threshold and reduced field
threshold of EL in NIR occurring via higher atomic excited states
Ar$^{*}(3p^{5}4p)$. An unexpected temperature dependence of slow components was
also observed: their contribution decreased with temperature, practically
disappearing at room temperature. We show that the puzzling properties of slow
components can be explained in the framework of hypothesis that these are
produced in the charge signal itself due to trapping of drifting electrons on
metastable negative argon ions.

uncertainties in products derived from down-the-line processing and imaging
tasks. The outstanding capabilities of deep learning in denoising of natural
and medical images have recently spur a number of applications of neural
networks in the context of seismic data denoising. A limitation of the majority
of such methods is that the deep learning procedure is supervised and requires
clean (noise-free) data as a target for training the network. Blindspot
networks were recently proposed to overcome this requirement, allowing training
to be performed directly on the noisy field data as a powerful suppressor of
random noise. A careful adaptation of the blind-spot methodology allows for an
extension to coherent noise suppression. In this work, we expand the
methodology of blind-spot networks to create a blind-trace network that
successfully removes trace-wise coherent noise. Through an extensive synthetic
analysis, we illustrate the denoising procedure's robustness to varying noise
levels, as well as varying numbers of noisy traces within shot gathers. It is
shown that the network can accurately learn to suppress the noise when up to
60% of the original traces are noisy. Furthermore, the proposed procedure is
implemented on the Stratton 3D field dataset and is shown to restore the
previously corrupted direct arrivals. Our adaptation of the blind-spot network
for self-supervised, trace-wise noise suppression could lead to other use-cases
such as the suppression of coherent noise arising from wellsite activity,
passing vessels or nearby industrial activity.

particular by low-search-cost Differentiable NAS (DNAS) solutions. We overcome
this limitation proposing the first DNAS that directly addresses the most

the MLPerf Tiny benchmark suite, we obtain rich Pareto sets of architectures in

cases, agent Intention can be perceived or inferred by the other agent, but in
others, it has to be explicitly informed to the other agent to succeed the goal
of the HRC task. The Perception-Intention-Action cycle includes three basic
functional procedures: Perception-Intention, Situation Awareness and Action.
The Perception and the Intention are the input of the Situation Awareness,
which evaluates the current situation and projects it, into the future
situation. The agents receive this information, plans and agree with the
actions to be executed and modify their action roles while perform the HRC

widespread method used in clinics to improve signal-to-noise ratio of MR
images. To obtain training data for transfer learning, we model, in a
data-driven fashion, the effects of echo-planar imaging (EPI): Nyquist ghosting
and ramp sampling. We introduce these effects to the digital phantom of brain
anatomy (BrainWeb). Instead of simulating pseudo-random noise with a defined
probability distribution, we perform noise scans with a brain-DWI-designed
protocol to obtain realistic noise maps. We combine them with the simulated,
noise-free EPI images. We also measure the Point Spread Function in a DW image
of an AJR-approved geometrical phantom and inter-scan movement in a brain scan
of a healthy volunteer. Their influence on image denoising and averaging of
repeated images is investigated at different signal-to-noise ratio levels.
Denoising performance is evaluated quantitatively using the simulated EPI

application of our method allows for a significant reduction in scan time by
lowering the number of repeated scans. Visual comparisons made in the acquired

paper, we address the content distribution scheduling problem in mmWave
vehicular networks. It has been challenging for all vehicles in the same
network to complete content downloading due to the limited communication
resources of roadside units (RSUs) and the high mobility of vehicles. We
propose a joint vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-tovehicle (V2V)
scheduling scheme to minimize the total number of content distribution time
slots from a global optimization perspective. In the V2I phase, the RSU
serially transmits integrity content to vehicles, which are selected according
to the vehicular network topology and transmission scheduling scheme. In the
V2V phase, full-duplex communications and concurrent transmissions are
exploited to achieve content sharing between vehicles and improve transmission
efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme
reduces the number of time slots and significantly improves system throughput
when compared with other schemes, especially under large-size file transfers
and a large number of vehicles.

  Learning","Released without the permission of all co-authors",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based offline optimization with dynamics-aware policy provides a new
perspective for policy learning and out-of-distribution generalization, where
the learned policy could adapt to different dynamics enumerated at the training
stage. But due to the limitation under the offline setting, the learned model
could not mimic real dynamics well enough to support reliable
out-of-distribution exploration, which still hinders policy to generalize well.
To narrow the gap, previous works roughly ensemble randomly initialized models
to better approximate the real dynamics. However, such practice is costly and
inefficient, and provides no guarantee on how well the real dynamics could be
approximated by the learned models, which we name coverability in this paper.
We actively address this issue by generating models with provable ability to
cover real dynamics in an efficient and controllable way. To that end, we
design a distance metric for dynamic models based on the occupancy of policies
under the dynamics, and propose an algorithm to generate models optimizing
their coverage for the real dynamics. We give a theoretical analysis on the
model generation process and proves that our algorithm could provide enhanced
coverability. As a downstream task, we train a dynamics-aware policy with minor
or no conservative penalty, and experiments demonstrate that our algorithm
outperforms prior offline methods on existing offline RL benchmarks. We also

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.07043",,,,"cs.NI eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past few years, the concept of VR has attracted increasing interest
thanks to its extensive industrial and commercial applications. Currently, the
3D models of the virtual scenes are generally stored in the VR visor itself,
which operates as a standalone device. However, applications that entail
multi-party interactions will likely require the scene to be processed by an
external server and then streamed to the visors. However, the stringent Quality
of Service (QoS) constraints imposed by VR's interactive nature require Network
Slicing (NS) solutions, for which profiling the traffic generated by the VR
application is crucial. To this end, we collected more than 4 hours of traces
in a real setup and analyzed their temporal correlation. More specifically, we
focused on the CBR encoding mode, which should generate more predictable
traffic streams. From the collected data, we then distilled two prediction
models for future frame size, which can be instrumental in the design of
dynamic resource allocation algorithms. Our results show that even the
state-of-the-art H.264 CBR mode can have significant fluctuations, which can
impact the NS optimization. We then exploited the proposed models to
dynamically determine the Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters in an NS
scenario, providing service with the required QoS while minimizing resource
usage.

guarantees the existence of the pointwise nontangential boundary trace for
smooth null-solutions satisfying a strong vanishing Carleson measure condition,
but also includes a Poisson integral representation formula of solutions along
with a characterization of $\mathrm{CMO}(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}, \mathbb{C}^N)$ in

establish the well-posedness of the Dirichlet problem in $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ for a

differential equation (SPDE, for short) with fractionally integrated additive
noise, which is general and includes many (fractional) SPDEs with additive

solution are presented. Then the Mittag--Leffler Euler integrator is proposed
as a time-stepping method to numerically solve the underlying model. Two key
ingredients are developed to overcome the difficulty caused by the interaction
between the time-fractional derivative and the fractionally integrated noise.
One is a novel decomposition way for the drift part of the mild solution, named
here the integral decomposition technique, and the other is to derive some fine
estimates associated with the solution operator by making use of the properties
of the Mittag--Leffler function. Consequently, the proposed Mittag--Leffler
Euler integrator is proved to be convergent with order $\min\{ \frac{1}{2} +
\frac{\alpha}{2\beta}(r+\lambda-\kappa), 1 \}$ if $\alpha + \gamma = 1$,
otherwise order $\min\{ \frac{\alpha}{2\beta}\min\{\kappa,r+\lambda\} +

of our scheme to a two-level system reveals that the system processes an
infinite speedup capacity in the noiseless case, which is destroyed by the
presence of an environment under the Born-Markovian approximation. It is
interesting to find that the capacity in the noiseless case is recovered in the
non-Markovian dynamics as long as a bound state is formed in the energy
spectrum of the total system. Enriching the quantification schemes of QSL, our
result provides an efficient way to control the QSL in practical environments.

indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using

we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols

  Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly

that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols
(7.2% vs. 0.4%), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5% of hosts).
Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to

fundamental role for the study of quantum system evolution towards thermal
equilibrium in an open system. The non-Markovian quantum state diffusion
(NMQSD) equation approach is used to calculate the dynamics of the spin chain.
The effects of bath non-Markovinity, temperature difference and system-bath
interaction strength on the energy current and the coherence in warm and cold
baths are analyzed, respectively. For both cases, our calculation results show
that strong non-Markovianity, weak system-bath interaction and low temperature
difference will be helpful to maintain the coherence of the system and
correspond to a small energy current. Interestingly, the warm baths destroy the
coherence while the cold baths help to generate coherence. Furthermore, the
effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya ($DM$) interaction and the external
magnetic field on the energy current and coherence are analyzed. Both energy
current and coherence will change due to the improvement of the system energy

architectures of Transformers can be categorized into two types: Post-LN and
Pre-LN. Recent Transformers tend to be Pre-LN because, in Post-LN with deep
Transformers (e.g., those with ten or more layers), the training is often
unstable, resulting in useless models. However, Post-LN has consistently
achieved better performance than Pre-LN in relatively shallow Transformers
(e.g., those with six or fewer layers). This study first investigates the
reason for these discrepant observations empirically and theoretically and made
the following discoveries: 1, the LN in Post-LN is the main source of the
vanishing gradient problem that leads to unstable training, whereas Pre-LN
prevents it, and 2, Post-LN tends to preserve larger gradient norms in higher
layers during the back-propagation, which may lead to effective training.
Exploiting the new findings, we propose a method that can provide both high
stability and effective training by a simple modification of Post-LN. We

the dynamics between the AI governance actors. The model also offers a starting

of physics-based simulation involves multiple benefits and advantages at a
reasonable cost while eliminating risks to prototypes, drivers and vulnerable
road users. However, there are two main limitations. First, the well-known
reality gap which refers to the discrepancy between reality and simulation that
prevents simulated autonomous driving experience from enabling effective
real-world performance. Second, the lack of empirical knowledge about the
behavior of real agents, including backup drivers or passengers and other road
users such as vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists. Agent simulation is usually
pre-programmed deterministically, randomized probabilistically or generated
based on real data, but it does not represent behaviors from real agents
interacting with the specific simulated scenario. In this paper we present a
preliminary framework to enable real-time interaction between real agents and
the simulated environment (including autonomous vehicles) and generate
synthetic sequences from simulated sensor data from multiple views that can be
used for training predictive systems that rely on behavioral models. Our
approach integrates immersive virtual reality and human motion capture systems
with the CARLA simulator for autonomous driving. We describe the proposed
hardware and software architecture, and discuss about the so-called behavioural
gap or presence. We present preliminary, but promising, results that support
the potential of this methodology and discuss about future steps.

ImageNet dataset, to extract image features and utilize transfer learning to
reduce the amount of required training data. Extracted image features are
further processed by a combination of convolutional and transformer layers, so
that the convolutional layers can focus on local information and the
transformer layers on global information. Our centroid-based cell detection
method represents cells as ellipses and is end-to-end trainable. Furthermore,
we show that our proposed model can outperform fully convolutional one-stage

the simulation of biological populations potentially growing from a few

efficient, while being reasonably accurate on the level of individual cell
trajectories. In this work, we increase the robustness, accuracy, and
efficiency of the simulation of center-based models by choosing the time steps
adaptively in the numerical method. We investigate the gain in using single
rate time stepping for the forward and backward Euler methods, based on local
estimates of the numerical errors and the stability of the method in the case
of the explicit forward Euler method. Furthermore, we propose a multirate time
stepping scheme that simulates regions with high local force gradients (e.g. as
they happen after cell division) with multiple smaller time steps within a
larger single time step for regions with smoother forces. These methods are
compared for different model systems in numerical experiments. We conclude that
the adaptive single rate forward Euler method results in significant gains in
terms of reduced wall clock times for the simulation of a linearly growing
tissue, while at the same time eliminating the need for manual determination of
a suitable time step size.

compared to other technologies such as inductive loops, radar or laser.
However, accurate speed measurement remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of cameras to provide accurate range estimates. In addition,
classical vision-based methods are very sensitive to extrinsic calibration
between the camera and the road. In this context, the use of data-driven
approaches appears as an interesting alternative. However, data collection
requires a complex and costly setup to record videos under real traffic
conditions from the camera synchronized with a high-precision speed sensor to
generate the ground truth speed values. It has recently been demonstrated that
the use of driving simulators (e.g., CARLA) can serve as a robust alternative
for generating large synthetic datasets to enable the application of deep
learning techniques for vehicle speed estimation for a single camera. In this
paper, we study the same problem using multiple cameras in different virtual
locations and with different extrinsic parameters. We address the question of
whether complex 3D-CNN architectures are capable of implicitly learning
view-invariant speeds using a single model, or whether view-specific models are
more appropriate. The results are very promising as they show that a single

camera-specific models, paving the way towards a view-invariant vehicle speed

that sample capacitance C is strongly diminishing for both gate field

well-developed hysteresis with the gate voltage sweep direction for the

explained by the known dependence of the Rashba parameter on the electric field
for giant Rashba splitting in GeTe. In this case, the hysteresis in capacitance
should be ascribed to polarization evolution in GeTe surface layers, which also
allows to realize the regime of dynamic negative capacitance. The latter can be
directly observed in time-dependent resistive measurements, as non-monotonic
evolution of voltage response to the step-like current pulse. Thus, the
negative capacitance regime can indeed improve performance and, therefore, the

However, the parametrization of FF is time consuming and has traditionally been
based largely on experimental data, which is scarce for many functional groups.
Recent years have therefore seen increasing efforts to automatize FF
parametrization and a move towards FF fitted against quantum-mechanical
reference data. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to parametrize
intermolecular interactions, which makes use of machine learning and
gradient-descent based optimization while retaining a functional form founded

parametrization methods. In the proposed approach, graph neural networks are
used in conjunction with automatic differentiation to parametrize physically
motivated models to potential-energy surfaces, enabling full automatization and
broad applicability in chemical space. As a result, highly accurate FF models
are obtained which retain the computational efficiency, interpretability and
robustness of classical FF. To showcase the potential of the proposed method,
both a fixed-charge model and a polarizable model are parametrized for

  Lai","DeepCluE: Enhanced Image Clustering via Multi-layer Ensembles in Deep
  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep clustering has recently emerged as a promising technique for complex
image clustering. Despite the significant progress, previous deep clustering
works mostly tend to construct the final clustering by utilizing a single layer
of representation, e.g., by performing $K$-means on the last fully-connected
layer or by associating some clustering loss to a specific layer. However, few
of them have considered the possibilities and potential benefits of jointly
leveraging multi-layer representations for enhancing the deep clustering
performance. In light of this, this paper presents a Deep Clustering via
Ensembles (DeepCluE) approach, which bridges the gap between deep clustering
and ensemble clustering by harnessing the power of multiple layers in deep
neural networks. Particularly, we utilize a weight-sharing convolutional neural
network as the backbone, which is trained with both the instance-level
contrastive learning (via an instance projector) and the cluster-level
contrastive learning (via a cluster projector) in an unsupervised manner.
Thereafter, multiple layers of feature representations are extracted from the
trained network, upon which a set of diversified base clusterings can be
generated via a highly efficient clusterer. Then, the reliability of the
clusters in multiple base clusterings is automatically estimated by exploiting
an entropy-based criterion, based on which the multiple base clusterings are
further formulated into a weighted-cluster bipartite graph. By partitioning
this bipartite graph via transfer cut, the final image clustering result can
therefore be obtained. Experimental results on six image datasets confirm the
advantages of our DeepCluE approach over the state-of-the-art deep clustering
approaches.

over the past decade. In particular, microresonators with the second order,
chi(2), nonlinearity have the advantages of broad spectral tunability and low
power frequency conversion. Recent observations have highlighted that the
parametric frequency conversion in chi(2) microresonators is accompanied by
stepwise changes in the signal and idler frequencies. Therefore, a better
understanding of the mechanisms and development of the theory underpinning this
behaviour is timely. Here, we report that the stepwise frequency conversion
originates from the discrete sequence of the so-called Eckhaus instabilities.
After discovering these instabilities in fluid dynamics in the 1960s, they have
become a broadly spread interdisciplinary concept. Now, we demonstrate that the
Eckhaus mechanism also underpins the ladder-like structure of the frequency
tuning curves in chi(2) microresonators.

nonsmooth differentially private stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), which
exploits the stability of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) for the privacy

requirement that the base algorithm needs to have bounded sensitivity, and
allows the use of sophisticated variance-reduced accelerated methods to achieve
near-linear time-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
near-linear time algorithms with near-optimal guarantees on the population
duality gap for smooth DP-SMO, when the objective is
(strongly-)convex--(strongly-)concave. Additionally, based on our flexible

et al, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 369, 2311-2319 (2011)] on a rectangular lattice
is utilized. Due to the anisotropy of discrete velocities on a rectangular
lattice, the third-order moment of REDF is inconsistent with that of popular LB
method, and thus the previous unified framework of MRT-LB method cannot be
directly applied to the NSEs using the REDF on the rectangular rDdQq lattice.
The macroscopic NSEs can be recovered from the RMRT-LB method through the
direct Taylor expansion method by properly selecting the relaxation sub-matrix
$\mathbf{S}_2$ which is related to kinetic viscosity and bulk viscosity. While
the rectangular lattice does not lead to the change of the zero-th, first and
second-order moments of REDF, thus the unified framework of MRT-LB method can
be directly applied to the NCDE. It should be noted that the RMRT-LB model for
NSEs can be derived on the rDdQq lattice, including rD2Q9, rD3Q19, and rD3Q27
lattices, and the RMRT-LB versions (if existed) of the previous MRT-LB models

shaped by a complex dynamics, the footprint of which is the nested structure of
the activities in which different countries are competitive. Nestedness is a
persistent feature across multiple kinds (layers) of activities related to the
production of knowledge and goods: scientific research, technological
innovation, industrial production and trade. We observe that in the layers of
innovation and trade the competitiveness of countries correlates unambiguously
with their diversification, while the science layer displays some peculiar
feature. The evolution of scientific domains leads to an increasingly modular
structure, in which the most developed nations become less competitive in the
less advanced scientific domains, where they are replaced by the emerging
countries. This observation is in line with a capability-based view of the
evolution of economic systems, but with a slight twist. Indeed, while the
accumulation of specific know-how and skills is a fundamental step towards
development, resource constraints force countries to acquire competitiveness in
the more complex research fields at the price of losing ground in more basic,
albeit less visible (or more crowded), fields. This tendency towards a
relatively specialized basket of capabilities leads to a trade-off between the
need to diversify in order to evolve and the need to allocate resources
efficiently. Collaborative patterns among developed nations reduce the
necessity to be competitive in the less sophisticated fields, freeing resources
for the more complex domains.

made searches to an article collection of Finnish newspaper Uusi Suometar

using graded relevance scale of 0-3 without knowing about the optical character
recognition quality differences of the otherwise identical articles. Analysis.
Analysis of the user evaluations was performed by comparing mean averages of

nineties and has seen a resurgence of interest with the positive resolution of
their conjecture on directed reachability in DynFO DKMSZ18. Since then many
natural problems related to reachability and matching have been placed in DynFO
and related classes DMVZ18,DKMTVZ20,DTV21. In this work, we place some dynamic
problems from group theory in DynFO.
  In particular, suppose we are given an arbitrary multiplication table over n
elements representing an unstructured binary operation (representing a
structure called a magma). Suppose the table evolves through a change in one of
its n^2 entries in one step. For a set S of magma elements which also changes
one element at a time, we can maintain enough auxiliary information so that
when the magma is a group, we are able to answer the Cayley Group Membership
(CGM) problem for S and a target t (i.e. ""Is t a product of elements from S? "")
using an FO query at every step. This places the dynamic CGM problem (for
groups) when the ambient magma is specified via a table in DynFO. In contrast,
for the table setting, statically CGM was known to be in the class Logspace
BarringtonM06. Building on the dynamic CGM result, we can maintain the
isomorphism of of two magmas, whenever both are Abelian groups, in DynFO.
  Our techniques include a way to maintain the powers of the elements of a
magma in DynFO using left associative parenthesisation, the notion of cube
independence to cube generate a subgroup generated by a set, a way to maintain
maximal cube independent sequences in a magma along with some group theoretic
machinery available from McKenzieCook. The notion of cube independent sequences
is new as far as we know and may be of independent interest. These techniques
are very different from the ones employed in Dynamic Complexity so far.

transaction tracing technique to identify cybercrime financial relationships.
Given seed addresses belonging to a cybercrime campaign, it outputs a
transaction graph, and identifies paths corresponding to relationships between
the campaign under study and external services and other cybercrime campaigns.
Back-and-forth exploration provides two key contributions. First, it explores
both forward and backwards, instead of only forward as done by prior work,
enabling the discovery of relationships that cannot be found by only exploring
forward (e.g., deposits from clients of a mixer). Second, it prevents graph
explosion by combining a tagging database with a machine learning classifier
for identifying addresses belonging to exchanges. We evaluate back-and-forth
exploration on 30 malware families. We build oracles for 4 families using
Bitcoin for C&C and use them to demonstrate that back-and-forth exploration
identifies 13 C&C signaling addresses missed by prior work, 8 of which are
fundamentally missed by forward-only explorations. Our approach uncovers a
wealth of services used by the malware including 44 exchanges, 11 gambling

2 mixers. In 4 families, the relations include new attribution points missed by
forward-only explorations. It also identifies relationships between the malware

of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited for harmoniously
accommodating the sensing and communication functionalities. We first reveal
that the developing trend of ISAC is from \emph{orthogonality} to
\emph{non-orthogonality}, and introduce the fundamental models of the downlink
and uplink ISAC while identifying the design challenges from the MA
perspective. (1) For the downlink ISAC, we propose two novel designs, namely
\emph{NOMA-empowered} downlink ISAC and \emph{NOMA-inspired} downlink ISAC to
effectively coordinate the inter-user interference and the
sensing-to-communication interference, respectively. (2) For the uplink ISAC,
we first propose a \emph{pure-NOMA-based} uplink ISAC design, where a fixed
communication-to-sensing successive interference cancellation order is employed
for distinguishing the mixed sensing-communication signal received over the
fully shared radio resources. Then, we propose a general \emph{semi-NOMA-based}
uplink ISAC design, which includes the conventional orthogonal multiple
access-based and pure-NOMA-based uplink ISAC as special cases, thus being
capable of providing flexible resource allocation strategies between sensing
and communication. Along each proposed NOMA-ISAC design, numerical results are
provided for showing the superiority over conventional ISAC designs.

capability of joint representation learning and clustering via deep neural

an effective technique to substantially enhance the deep clustering
performance. However, the existing contrastive learning based deep clustering
algorithms mostly focus on some carefully-designed augmentations (often with
limited transformations to preserve the structure), referred to as weak
augmentations, but cannot go beyond the weak augmentations to explore the more
opportunities in stronger augmentations (with more aggressive transformations
or even severe distortions). In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep
clustering approach termed Strongly Augmented Contrastive Clustering (SACC),
which extends the conventional two-augmentation-view paradigm to multiple views
and jointly leverages strong and weak augmentations for strengthened deep
clustering. Particularly, we utilize a backbone network with triply-shared
weights, where a strongly augmented view and two weakly augmented views are
incorporated. Based on the representations produced by the backbone, the
weak-weak view pair and the strong-weak view pairs are simultaneously exploited
for the instance-level contrastive learning (via an instance projector) and the
cluster-level contrastive learning (via a cluster projector), which, together
with the backbone, can be jointly optimized in a purely unsupervised manner.
Experimental results on five challenging image datasets have shown the
superiority of our SACC approach over the state-of-the-art. The code is

cross-entropy between label similarity and latent similarity. This concept
enhances the capabilities of supervised contrastive loss by fully utilizing the

contrastive loss, we construct a tailored framework: the Generalized Supervised

high-mass binary stars is determined by the interplay of phenomena such as
tides, winds, accretion, common-envelope evolution, natal kicks, and stellar
core-envelope coupling. In previous work, we identified regions of the
parameter space that may produce BBHs with large misalignments from natal kicks
and high spin magnitudes from three mechanisms - tides, accretion, or
inheritance via minimal core-envelope coupling. Here, we explore the spin
precession of such BBHs using five parameters that describe the amplitude and
frequency with which the orbital angular momentum precesses and nutates about
the total angular momentum, modulating the gravitational-wave emission.
Precession is generally possible for sufficiently strong natal kicks provided
at least one of the black holes is spinning. Nutation is a consequence of
spin-spin coupling and depends on the three spin-up mechanisms. Tidal
synchronization can leave a distinct correlation between the aligned effective
spin and the nutation frequency, but does not produce large nutations. When a
black hole accretes $\gtrsim 20\%$ of its companion's envelope, the precession
frequency and amplitude are large. A much smaller amount of accretion, e.g.,
$\approx 2\%$, is needed to provide a large precession frequency and amplitude
when the accretor is a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. The inheritance of high natal WR
spins ($\gtrsim 5\%$ of their maximum breakup value) via minimal core-envelope
coupling is the most promising mechanism for producing nutating BBHs, implying
that a measurement of nutation from gravitational-wave observations may suggest
isolated-binary origin with minimal core-envelope coupling.

from digital footprints on one of the world's largest online discussion forum.
We compiled a unique data set from the online discussion forum reddit that
contains information on the political ideology of around 91,000 users as well
as records of their comment frequency and the comments' text corpus in over
190,000 different subforums of interest. Applying a set of statistical learning
approaches, we show that information about activity in non-political discussion
forums alone, can very accurately predict a user's political ideology.
Depending on the model, we are able to predict the economic dimension of
ideology with an accuracy of up to 90.63% and the social dimension with and
accuracy of up to 82.02%. In comparison, using the textual features from actual
comments does not improve predictive accuracy. Our paper highlights the
importance of revealed digital behaviour to complement stated preferences from
digital communication when analysing human preferences and behaviour using

probability distributions. Development of efficient algorithms for generating
unbiased and independent samples from graphical models remains an active
research topic. Sampling from graphical models that describe the statistics of
discrete variables is a particularly challenging problem, which is intractable
in the presence of high dimensions. In this work, we provide the first method
that allows one to provably generate unbiased and independent samples from
general discrete factor models with a quantum circuit. Our method is compatible
with multi-body interactions and its success probability does not depend on the
number of variables. To this end, we identify a novel embedding of the
graphical model into unitary operators and provide rigorous guarantees on the
resulting quantum state. Moreover, we prove a unitary Hammersley-Clifford
theorem -- showing that our quantum embedding factorizes over the cliques of
the underlying conditional independence structure. Importantly, the quantum
embedding allows for maximum likelihood learning as well as maximum a
posteriori state approximation via state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical
methods. Finally, the proposed quantum method can be implemented on current
quantum processors. Experiments with quantum simulation as well as actual
quantum hardware show that our method can carry out sampling and parameter
learning on quantum computers.

in diverse settings, including safety and security-critical applications. As a
result, the characteristics of these models have become sensitive intellectual
properties that require protection from malicious users. Extracting the
architecture of a DNN through leaky side-channels (e.g., memory access) allows
adversaries to (i) clone the model, and (ii) craft adversarial attacks. DNN
obfuscation thwarts side-channel-based architecture stealing (SCAS) attacks by
altering the run-time traces of a given DNN while preserving its functionality.
In this work, we expose the vulnerability of state-of-the-art DNN obfuscation
methods to these attacks. We present NeuroUnlock, a novel SCAS attack against
obfuscated DNNs. Our NeuroUnlock employs a sequence-to-sequence model that
learns the obfuscation procedure and automatically reverts it, thereby
recovering the original DNN architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
NeuroUnlock by recovering the architecture of 200 randomly generated and
obfuscated DNNs running on the Nvidia RTX 2080 TI graphics processing unit
(GPU). Moreover, NeuroUnlock recovers the architecture of various other
obfuscated DNNs, such as the VGG-11, VGG-13, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32 networks.
After recovering the architecture, NeuroUnlock automatically builds a
near-equivalent DNN with only a 1.4% drop in the testing accuracy. We further
show that launching a subsequent adversarial attack on the recovered DNNs
boosts the success rate of the adversarial attack by 51.7% in average compared
to launching it on the obfuscated versions. Additionally, we propose a novel
methodology for DNN obfuscation, ReDLock, which eradicates the deterministic
nature of the obfuscation and achieves 2.16X more resilience to the NeuroUnlock
attack. We release the NeuroUnlock and the ReDLock as open-source frameworks.

with these stars being genuine thermally pulsing AGB stars. On the other hand,

both post-click behaviors and early conversions as stochastic post-click

highlight informative and timely signals. We validate our analysis on public

mass. The resulting measurement $M_{\rm 200}=0.83^{+0.29}_{-0.16} \cdot
10^{12}$\,M$_{\odot}$ falls on the lower end of the current Milky Way mass
estimates, but once corrected for the likely bias in the escape velocity
(approximately $10$ percent increase of the escape velocity), our mass estimate
yields $M_{\rm 200}=1.26^{+0.40}_{-0.22} \cdot 10^{12}$\,M$_{\odot}$, which is
in agreement with estimates based on different diagnostics of the Milky Way
mass. The MW mass within $20$\,kpc then corresponds to $M_{\rm MW} \left(r <
20\,\text{kpc} \right)=1.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \times 10^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$ without

offset in escape velocities.

paradigms, have recently emerged as an exciting avenue to create bespoke
combinations of desired macroscopic material responses. In some instances,
rather unique structures have emerged from advanced geometrical concepts (e.g.
gyroids, menger cubes, or origami/kirigami-based structures), while in others
innovation has emerged from mimicking nature in bio-inspired materials (e.g.

manufacturing has enabled the facile fabrication of complex geometrical and
bio-inspired architectures, using computer aided design models. The combination
of simulations and experiments on these structures has led to an enhancement of

for solving linear systems of equations with a growing body of applications to
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and CFD-like problems. This work extends
previous work by developing a non-linear hybrid quantum-classical CFD solver
and using it to generate fully converged solutions. The hybrid solver uses the
SIMPLE CFD algorithm, which is common in many industrial CFD codes, and applies
it to the 2-dimensional lid driven cavity test case. A theme of this work is
the classical processing time needed to prepare the quantum circuit with a
focus on the decomposition of the CFD matrix into a linear combination of
unitaries (LCU). CFD meshes with up to 65x65 nodes are considered with the
largest producing a LCU containing 32,767 Pauli strings. A new method for
rapidly re-computing the coefficients in a LCU is proposed, although this
reduces, rather than eliminates, the classical scaling issues. The quantum
linear equation solver uses the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm via a
state-vector emulator. Test matrices are sampled from the classical CFD solver
to investigate the solution accuracy that can be achieved with HHL. For the
smallest 5x5 and 9x9 CFD meshes, full non-linear hybrid CFD calculations are
performed. The impacts of approximating the LCU and the varying the number of
ancilla rotations in the eigenvalue inversion circuit are studied. Preliminary
timing results indicate that the classical computer preparation time needed for
a hybrid solver is just as important to the achievement of quantum advantage in
CFD as the time on the quantum computer. The reported HHL solutions and LCU
decompositions provide a benchmark for future research. The CFD test matrices
used in this study are available upon request.

that maintains the broad cavity between the two belts.
  Aims. We present a dedicated monitoring of HD 95086 with the VLT/SPHERE
instrument to refine the orbital and atmospheric properties of HD 95086 b, and
to search for additional planets in this system.
  Methods. SPHERE observations, spread over ten epochs from 2015 to 2019 and
including five new datasets, were used. Combined with archival observations,
from VLT/NaCo (2012-2013) and Gemini/GPI (2013-2016), the extended set of
astrometric measurements allowed us to refine the orbital properties of HD
95086 b. We also investigated the spectral properties and the presence of a
circumplanetary disk around HD 95086 b by using the special fitting tool
exploring the diversity of several atmospheric models. In addition, we improved
our detection limits in order to search for a putative planet c via the
K-Stacker algorithm.
  Results. We extracted for the first time the JH low-resolution spectrum of HD
95086 b by stacking the six best epochs, and confirm its very red spectral
energy distribution. Combined with additional datasets from GPI and NaCo, our
analysis indicates that this very red color can be explained by the presence of
a circumplanetary disk around planet b, with a range of high-temperature
solutions (1400-1600 K) and significant extinction (Av > 10 mag), or by a
super-solar metallicity atmosphere with lower temperatures (800-1300 K), and
small to medium amount of extinction (Av < 10 mag). We do not find any robust
candidates for planet c, but give updated constraints on its potential mass and
location.

Simpson-Visser and conformally transformed geometries depend on mass, spin, and
an additional regularisation parameter $l$. In both cases, we investigate how
the spin and regularisation parameter $l$ affects the configuration of an
ergoregion and event horizons. Surprisingly, we find that the energy extraction
efficiency from the event horizon surface is not dependent on the
regularisation parameter $l$ in the Simpson-Visser regular spacetimes and hence
it does not vary from the Kerr black hole case. While, in the conformally
transformed singular and regular black holes, we obtain the efficiency rate of
extracted energies are extremely high compared to the Kerr black hole scenario.
This distinct signature of the conformally transformed singular and regular

paper, we present major building blocks towards a collaborative approach for
optimization of data processing cluster configurations based on runtime data

the reliance on the recurrence of individual processing jobs or, else,

as discretisation of grasp angles into bins and an attentional loss function.
Despite negligible difference according to the standard rectangle metric,
Gaussian maps better reproduce the training data and therefore improve success
rates when tested on the same simulated robot arm by avoiding collisions with
the object: achieving 87.94\% accuracy. Furthermore, the best performing model
is shown to operate with a high success rate when transferred to a real robotic

fate of plumes of waterborne contaminant transported through a chemically

we follow the dynamic of a passive scalar injected in a packed bed consisting
of a mixture of chemically inert and adsorbing spherical particles. By varying
the fraction of the adsorbers $\xi$, randomly distributed in the porous volume,
we find that the waterborne solute forms concentration plumes emerging between
pairs of adsorbing particles. This deformation is a consequence of the
different mechanisms of transport characterising the transport of molecules in
the proximal and remote pores relative to the adsorbers, diffusion and
advection, respectively. The resulting isoscalar surface embedding the plumes
grows at a rate proportional to the average pore-scale velocity $U$ and
inversely proportional to the adsorbers' interparticle dimensionless distance,
i.e. $\gamma \propto U/\ell_\xi$. We provide a quantification of the
characteristic diffusive time scale of the plume $t_\eta \propto
\ell_\xi^2/D_m$, which dissipates the concentration differences in the vicinity
of the adsorbers. Thus, by quantifying the relative importance of the
advection-sustained stretching rate $\gamma$ and plume mixing rate $1/t_\eta$

evolutions scale as $\propto \sqrt{t}$ and $\propto t$, respectively. Such a

infinitely-long solenoid or an infinitely-long flux line. The main reason for
this is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal
configuration is too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is
modelled by a closed flux line of arbitrary shape and size then the formal
treatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably simplified, and
well-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the
electromagnetic, topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We
demonstrate that the AB phase in a closed flux line is determined by a linking
number and has the same form as the AB phase in an infinitely-long flux line
which is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit
interference shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the
same as that associated with an infinitely-long flux line. We emphasise the
topological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux line by demonstrating that
this phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations of
the closed flux line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the
closed flux line, and the interchange between the charge path and the closed
flux line. We also discuss the local and nonlocal interpretations of the AB
effect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge in which the
vector potential vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the
closed flux line, implying that this potential is zero along the path of the
charged particle except on the crossing point where this path intersects the
surface bounded by the closed flux line, a result that questions the alleged
physical significance of the vector potential and the local interpretation of
the AB effect.

still not identified. This work investigates how we can distinguish between two
fundamental driving mechanisms: the accumulated effect of stellar feedback
versus the energy injection from Galactic scales. We perform a series of
numerical simulations describing a stratified star forming ISM subject to
self-consistent stellar feedback. Large scale external turbulent driving of
various intensities is added to mimic galactic driving mechanisms. We analyse
the resulting column density maps with a technique called Multi-scale
non-Gaussian segmentation that separates the coherent structures and the
Gaussian background. This effectively discriminates between the various
simulations and is a promising method to understand the ISM structure. In
particular the power spectrum of the coherent structures flattens above 60 pc
when turbulence is driven only by stellar feedback. When large-scale driving is
applied, the turn-over shifts to larger scales. A systematic comparison with
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is then performed. Only 1 out of 25 regions
has a coherent power spectrum which is consistent with the feedback-only
simulation. A detailed study of the turn-over scale leads us to conclude that
regular stellar feedback is not enough to explain the observed ISM structure on
scales larger than 60 pc. Extreme feedback in the form of supergiant shells
likely plays an important role but cannot explain all the regions of the LMC.
If we assume ISM structure is generated by turbulence, another large scale
driving mechanism is needed to explain the entirety of the observations.

recording of a performance, in the symbolic form as a computer readable score,

provides a way to navigate among multiple representations of music in a unified
manner by generating an accurate mapping between them, lending itself
applicable to a myriad of domains like music education, performance analysis,
automatic accompaniment and music editing. Traditional synchronisation methods
compute alignment using knowledge-driven and stochastic approaches, typically
employing handcrafted features. These methods are often unable to generalise
well to different instruments, acoustic environments and recording conditions,
and normally assume complete structural agreement between the performances and
the scores. This PhD furthers the development of performance-score
synchronisation research by proposing data-driven, context-aware alignment
approaches, on three fronts: Firstly, I replace the handcrafted features by
employing a metric learning based approach that is adaptable to different
acoustic settings and performs well in data-scarce conditions. Secondly, I
address the handling of structural differences between the performances and
scores, which is a common limitation of standard alignment methods. Finally, I
eschew the reliance on both feature engineering and dynamic programming, and
propose a completely data-driven synchronisation method that computes
alignments using a neural framework, whilst also being robust to structural
differences between the performances and scores.

independent task branches. This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations

overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by
applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction

generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for

separates providing information (simple, done by the task) from exploiting it

area of explainable AI, aiming at developing intelligible and accurate
predictive models. While most of the previous research efforts focus on
creating post-hoc explanations, in this paper we investigate how to train
effective and intrinsically-interpretable ranking models. Developing these
models is particularly challenging and it also requires finding a trade-off
between ranking quality and model complexity. State-of-the-art rankers, made of
either large ensembles of trees or several neural layers, exploit in fact an
unlimited number of feature interactions making them black boxes. Previous
approaches on intrinsically-interpretable ranking models address this issue by
avoiding interactions between features thus paying a significant performance
drop with respect to full-complexity models. Conversely, ILMART, our novel and
interpretable LtR solution based on LambdaMART, is able to train effective and
intelligible models by exploiting a limited and controlled number of pairwise
feature interactions. Exhaustive and reproducible experiments conducted on
three publicly-available LtR datasets show that ILMART outperforms the current
state-of-the-art solution for interpretable ranking of a large margin with a
gain of nDCG of up to 8%.

  In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of the existing forgery

protect the shared facial images from attackers who are capable of applying the
popular forgery techniques. Our proposed method generates perceptual-aware
perturbations in an incessant manner which is vastly different from the prior

reveal that our perceptual-aware perturbations are robust to diverse image

introduce a fast root-finding algorithm for univariate polynomials based on the

the basic AE algorithm and discussing its properties, we will optimize it for
solving binary lens equations, which are fifth degree polynomials with complex
coefficients. Our method is about $1.8$ to $2.0$ times faster than the SG
algorithm. Since, for calculating magnification factors for point-like or
finite source stars, it is necessary to solve the binary lens equation and find
the positions of the produced images in the image plane first, this new method

rectifiers and AC-DC converters. At low temperatures, however, conventional
semiconductor diodes possess a high resistivity, which yields energy loss and
heating during operation. The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which relies
on broken inversion symmetry in a superconductor may mitigate this obstacle: in
one direction a zero-resistance supercurrent can flow through the diode, but
for the opposite direction of current flow, the device enters the normal state
with ohmic resistance. The application of a magnetic field can induce SDE in
Nb/V/Ta superlattices with a polar structure, in superconducting devices with
asymmetric patterning of pinning centres, or in superconductor/ferromagnet
hybrid devices with induced vortices. The need for an external magnetic field
limits their practical application. Recently, a field-free SDE was observed in
a NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2 junction, and it originates from asymmetric Josephson
tunneling that is induced by the Nb3Br8 barrier and the associated NbSe2/Nb3Br8
interfaces. Here, we present another implementation of zero-field SDE using
noncentrosymmetric [Nb/V/Co/V/Ta]20 multilayers. The magnetic layers provide
the necessary symmetry breaking and we can tune the SDE by adjusting the
structural parameters, such as the constituent elements, film thickness,
stacking order, and number of repetitions. We control the polarity of the SDE
through the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic layers. Artificially
stacked structures, as the one used in this work, are of particular interest as
they are compatible with microfabrication techniques and can be integrated with
devices such as Josephson junctions. Energy-loss-free SDEs as presented in this
work may therefore enable novel non-volatile memories and logic circuits with
ultralow power consumption.

wavefront shaping provides an effective method to retrieve information; it
relies on measuring how the propagation of different optical wavefronts are
impacted by scattering. Based on this principle, several wavefront shaping
techniques were successfully developed, but most of them are highly invasive
and limited to proof-of-principle experiments. Here, we propose to use a neural
network approach to non-invasively characterize and control light scattering

our neural network with its layers, connected nodes and activation functions

dataset built from a series of incident light patterns and corresponding camera
snapshots. We apply our physics-based neural network to a fluorescence

tasks, having a compact and energy-efficient deployable model has become fairly
important. Most of the existing deep architectures use Rectifier Linear Unit

activation to give one more degree of freedom to the architecture. We show that
this activation wherein the rotation is learned via training results in the

feature extractors and unnecessary features can be eliminated before
retraining. Our studies indicate that features always choose to pass through a
lesser number of filters in architectures such as ResNet and its variants.
Hence, by rotating the ReLU, the weights or the filters that are not necessary
are automatically identified and can be dropped thus giving rise to significant
savings in memory and computation. Furthermore, in some cases, we also notice
that along with saving in memory and computation we also obtain improvement

optimization problem. The main thought in this method is to select a
combination of the current descent direction and past multi-step iterative
information as a new search direction and to obtain a stepsize by virtue of two
types of strategies. It is proved that the developed direction with suitable

viscosity to resistivity) on the turbulent transport and energetics of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is poorly understood, despite the
realization of this regime in astrophysical environments as disparate as discs
from binary neutron star mergers, the inner regions of low mass X-ray binaries
and active galactic nuclei, and the interiors of protoneutron stars. We
investigate the MRI dynamo and associated turbulence in the regime
$\text{Pm}>1$ by carrying out fully compressible, 3D MHD shearing box
simulations using the finite-volume code \textsc{PLUTO}, focusing mostly on the
case of Keplerian shear relevant to accretion discs. We find that when the
magnetic Reynolds number is kept fixed, the turbulent transport (as
parameterized by $\alpha$, the ratio of stress to thermal pressure) scales with
the magnetic Prandtl number as $\alpha \sim \text{Pm}^{\delta}$, with $\delta
\sim 0.5-0.7$ up to $\text{Pm} \sim 128$. However, this scaling weakens as the
magnetic Reynolds number is increased. Importantly, compared to previous
studies, we find a new effect at very large $\text{Pm}$ -- the turbulent energy
and stress begin to plateau, no longer depending on ${\rm Pm}$. To understand
these results we have carried out a detailed analysis of the turbulent dynamics
in Fourier space, focusing on the effect of increasing $\text{Pm}$ on the
transverse cascade -- a key non-linear process induced by the disc shear flow
that is responsible for the sustenance of MRI turbulence. Finally, we find that
$\alpha$-$\text{Pm}$ scaling is sensitive to the box vertical-to-radial aspect
ratio, as well as to the background shear.

that the shortest unstable periodic orbits build the framework of the system

while the perturbation theory can locally analyze the structure of dynamical

two techniques together. Based on the integrability near the marginal orbits
and the hyperbolicity in the part away from the singularities in intermittent
systems, the chief idea of this paper is to revise intermittent maps and
maintain the natural measure produced by the original maps. We get the natural

Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of electron bunches with energy

with dense phase space and an angular-spectral charge density beyond the
initial drive beam parameters. These results unambiguously show that staged
LWFA-PWFA can help to tailor the electron-beam quality for certain applications

treatment effect, cannot detect differences in distribution parameters other
than the mean (e.g., variance). To resolve this weakness of existing methods,
we propose a feature selection framework for discovering {\it distributional

that quantifies how strongly the feature attributes influence the discrepancy

the type I error rate to the desired level. Experimental results show that our

multiple labels simultaneously, where the high cost of annotating all relevant
labels for each training example is challenging for real-world applications. To
cope with the challenge, we investigate single-positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) where each example is annotated with only one relevant label, and show
that one can successfully learn a theoretically grounded multi-label classifier
for the problem. In this paper, a novel SPMLL method named SMILE, i.e.,
Single-positive MultI-label learning with Label Enhancement, is proposed.
Specifically, an unbiased risk estimator is derived, which could be guaranteed
to approximately converge to the optimal risk minimizer of fully supervised
learning and shows that one positive label of each instance is sufficient to
train the predictive model. Then, the corresponding empirical risk estimator is
established via recovering the latent soft label as a label enhancement
process, where the posterior density of the latent soft labels is approximate
to the variational Beta density parameterized by an inference model.
Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

as a tool to induce a set of useful priors about semantic consistency and
improve sample efficiency and generalization performance. However, even when
the prior is useful for generalization, distilling it to RL agent often
interferes with RL training and degenerates sample efficiency. Meanwhile, the
agent is forgetful of the prior due to the non-stationary nature of RL. These
observations suggest two extreme schedules of distillation: (i) over the entire
training; or (ii) only at the end. Hence, we devise a stand-alone network
distillation method to inject the consistency prior at any time (even after
RL), and a simple yet efficient framework to automatically schedule the
distillation. Specifically, the proposed framework first focuses on mastering
train environments regardless of generalization by adaptively deciding which
{\it or no} augmentation to be used for the training. After this, we add the
distillation to extract the remaining benefits for generalization from all the
augmentations, which requires no additional new samples. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, in particular, that
considers postponing the augmentation to the end of RL training.

of the conventional preheating. This is a new type of particle production
scenario via the nonperturbative QCD preheating, which is fulfilled before the
quark condensate reaches the true vacuum and the static hadron phase is formed
in the evolving Universe. The baryon and antibaryon pairs created by the QCD
preheating are overproduced by two orders of magnitude more than those

treatment assigned to a plot also affects its neighboring plots within a block.
For the purpose of estimating total effects, the circular neighbor balanced
design was shown to be universally optimal among designs which do not allow
treatments to be neighbors of themselves. Our study shows that self-neighboring
block sequences are actually the main ingredient for an optimal design. Here,
we adopt the approximate design framework and study optimal designs in the
whole design space. Our approach is flexible enough to accommodate all possible
design parameters, that is the block size and the number of blocks and
treatments. This approach can be broken down into two main steps: the
identification of the minimal supporting set of block sequences and the
optimality condition built on it. The former is critical for reducing the
computational time from almost infinity to seconds. Meanwhile, the task of
finding the minimal set is normally achieved through numerical methods, which
can only handle small block sizes. Our approach is of a hybrid nature in order
to deal with all design sizes. When block size is not large, we provide
explicit expressions of the minimal set instead of relying on numerical
methods. For larger block sizes when a typical numerical method would fail, we
theoretically derived a reasonable size intermediate set of sequences, from
which the minimal set can be quickly derived through a customized algorithm.
Taking it further, the optimality conditions allow us to obtain both symmetric
and asymmetric designs. Lastly, we also investigate the trade-off issue between
circular and noncircular designs, and provide guidelines on the choices.

struggle to meet these requirements due to fundamental limitations such as

controllers that can address these constraints are needed. Reset controllers
are potential alternatives with the advantage of phase lead in comparison to
their linear counterparts. However, reset controllers are incompatible with the
loop-shaping analysis technique, since loop-shaping relies on the simple
first-order element, whereas reset controllers include complex higher-order
harmonics. Thus, the analysis and design of reset controllers remain
bottlenecks in their way of widespread application. In this paper, a new
analytical technique for reset controllers is proposed to break the
limitations. A novel pulse-based model for analyzing general reset control
systems both in open-loop and closed-loop is developed, for the first time
enabling loop-shaping implemented into the analysis of reset control systems
accurately. Corresponding sensitivity functions are subsequently illustrated.
Finally, through intuitive examples, the accuracy of the proposed model is

novel joint active and passive beamforming design for RIS-enabled ISAC system
in consideration of the target size. First, the detection probability for
target sensing is derived in closed-form based on the illumination power on an
approximated scattering surface area of the target, and a new concept of
ultimate detection resolution (UDR) is defined for the first time to measure
the target detection capability. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to
maximize the SNR at the UE under a minimum detection probability constraint. To
solve the non-convex problem, a novel alternative optimization approach is
developed. In this approach, the solutions of the communication and sensing
beamformers are obtained by our proposed bisection-search based method. The
optimal receive combining vector is derived from an equivalent
Rayleigh-quotient problem. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, the Charnes-Cooper
transformation is conducted to cope with the fractional objective, and a novel
convexification process is proposed to convexify the detection probability
constraint with matrix operations and a real-valued first-order Taylor
expansion. After the convexification, a successive convex approximation (SCA)
based algorithm is designed to yield a suboptimal phase-shift solution.
Finally, the overall optimization algorithm is built, followed by detailed
analysis on its computational complexity, convergence behavior and problem
feasibility condition. Extensive simulations are carried out to testify the
analytical properties of the proposed beamforming design, and to reveal two
important trade-offs, namely, communication vs. sensing trade-off and UDR vs.
sensing-duration trade-off. In comparison with several existing benchmarks, our
proposed approach is validated to be superior when detecting targets with
practical sizes.

12740 using data from SDO, STEREO-A, IRIS, and NSO/GONG. AR 12740 was a
decaying region formed by a very disperse following polarity and a strong
leading spot, surrounded by a highly dynamic zone where moving magnetic
features (MMFs) were seen constantly diverging from the spot. Our analysis
indicates that the filament was formed by the convergence of fibrils at a
location where magnetic flux cancellation was observed. Furthermore, we
conclude that its destabilization was also related to flux cancellation
associated to the constant shuffling of the MMFs. A two-ribbon flare occurred
associated to the filament eruption; however, because the large-scale magnetic
configuration of the AR was quadrupolar, two additional flare ribbons developed
far from the two main ones. We model the magnetic configuration of the AR using
a force-free field approach at the AR scale size. This local model is
complemented by a global potential-field source-surface one. Based on the local
model, we propose a scenario in which the filament failed eruption and flare
are due to two reconnection processes, one occurring below the erupting
filament, leading to the two-ribbon flare, and another one above it between the
filament flux-rope configuration and the large-scale closed loops. Our
computation of the reconnected magnetic flux added to the erupting flux rope,
compared to that of the large-scale field overlying it, lets us conclude that
the latter was large enough to prevent the filament eruption. A similar
conjecture can be drawn from the computation of the magnetic tension derived

At low temperature simulating the direct effect we find negative values for the

Approaching the phase transition temperature these values remain negative and

truncated using higher-order singular value decompositions. The method is
validated by comparing the partition function, the chiral condensate and the

small lattices up to volumes of $4\times4$. For larger volumes, we present
first tensor results for the chiral condensate as a function of the mass and

fairness is to translate a fairness notion into constraints over the parameters

predictions of the trained neural network model. To address this challenge, we
develop a counterexample-guided post-processing technique to provably enforce
fairness constraints at prediction time. Contrary to prior work that enforces
fairness only on points around test or train data, we are able to enforce and
guarantee fairness on all points in the input domain. Additionally, we propose
an in-processing technique to use fairness as an inductive bias by iteratively
incorporating fairness counterexamples in the learning process. We have
implemented these techniques in a tool called FETA. Empirical evaluation on
real-world datasets indicates that FETA is not only able to guarantee fairness
on-the-fly at prediction time but also is able to train accurate models

decision-making framework where the learner's feedback is determined by a
directed graph over the action set. We present a computationally efficient
algorithm for learning in this framework that simultaneously achieves
near-optimal regret bounds in both stochastic and adversarial environments. The
bound against oblivious adversaries is $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{\alpha T})$, where $T$
is the time horizon and $\alpha$ is the independence number of the feedback
graph. The bound against stochastic environments is $O\big( (\ln T)^2
\max_{S\in \mathcal I(G)} \sum_{i \in S} \Delta_i^{-1}\big)$ where $\mathcal
I(G)$ is the family of all independent sets in a suitably defined undirected
version of the graph and $\Delta_i$ are the suboptimality gaps. The algorithm
combines ideas from the EXP3++ algorithm for stochastic and adversarial bandits
and the EXP3.G algorithm for feedback graphs with a novel exploration scheme.
The scheme, which exploits the structure of the graph to reduce exploration, is
key to obtain best-of-both-worlds guarantees with feedback graphs. We also
extend our algorithm and results to a setting where the feedback graphs are

can infer from them about the quantum nature of gravity, as well as the
electromagnetic analogues of such tests. We show that it is not possible to
draw conclusions about mediators: even within relativistic physics,
entanglement generation can equally be described in terms of mediators or in
terms of non-local processes -- relativity does not dictate a local channel.
Such indirect tests therefore have limited ability to probe the nature of the
process establishing the entanglement as their interpretation is inherently
ambiguous. We also show that cosmological observations already demonstrate some
aspects of quantization that these proposals aim to test. Nevertheless, the

topological structures that are held in common between the networks and
clustering the collection into sub-collections of structurally homogeneous
networks. We tackle these two questions with a probabilistic model based
approach. We propose an extension of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) adapted
to the joint modeling of a collection of networks. The networks in the
collection are assumed to be independent realizations of SBMs. The common
connectivity structure is imposed through the equality of some parameters. The
model parameters are estimated with a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm. We derive an ad-hoc penalized likelihood criterion to select the
number of blocks and to assess the adequacy of the consensus found between the
structures of the different networks. This same criterion can also be used to
cluster networks on the basis of their connectivity structure. It thus provides
a partition of the collection into subsets of structurally homogeneous
networks. The relevance of our proposition is assessed on two collections of
ecological networks. First, an application to three stream food webs reveals
the homogeneity of their structures and the correspondence between groups of
species in different ecosystems playing equivalent ecological roles. Moreover,
the joint analysis allows a finer analysis of the structure of smaller
networks. Second, we cluster 67 food webs according to their connectivity
structures and demonstrate that five mesoscale structures are sufficient to
describe this collection.

Consequently, the learning of default/non-default can benefit from
rejection/approval. Accordingly, we for the first time propose to model the

propose a novel Reject-aware Multi-Task Network (RMT-Net), which learns the
task weights that control the information sharing from the rejection/approval

probabilities. RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the
larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs
to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to
RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies.
Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies

acceleration, and this approximation has been widely used in the study of
geophysical phenomena. However, the justification of the traditional
approximation is questionable under a few circumstances. In particular,
dynamics with substantial vertical velocities or geophysical phenomena in the
tropics have non-negligible cosine Coriolis terms. Such cases warrant
investigations with the non-traditional setting, i.e., the full Coriolis
acceleration. In this manuscript, we study the effect of the non-traditional
setting on an isothermal, hydrostatic and compressible atmosphere assuming a
meridionally homogeneous flow. Employing linear stability analysis, we show
that, given appropriate boundary conditions, i.e., a bottom boundary condition
that allows for a vertical energy flux and non-reflecting boundary at the top,
the atmosphere at rest becomes prone to a novel unstable mode. The validity of
assuming a meridionally homogeneous flow is investigated via scale analysis.
Numerical experiments were conducted, and Rayleigh damping was used as a
numerical approximation for the non-reflecting top boundary. Our three main
results are as follows. 1) Experiments involving the full Coriolis terms
exhibit an exponentially growing instability, yet experiments subjected to the
traditional approximation remain stable. 2) The experimental instability growth
rate is close to the theoretical value. 3) A perturbed version of the unstable
mode arises even under sub-optimal bottom boundary conditions. Finally, we
conclude our study by discussing the limitations, implications, and remaining
open questions. Specifically, the influence on numerical deep-atmosphere models
and possible physical interpretations of the unstable mode are discussed.

reasonable performance for computing clustered eigenvalues is ensured by a

exact-inverse (exact shift-inverse) preconditioning by adapting classical

more general preconditioning are still improvable. We expect to extend certain
sharp estimates for the corresponding vector iterations to BPG where proper

although actual ant colonies are capable of consistently choosing a higher
quality, further site instead of a lower quality, closer site, existing models
are much less accurate in this scenario. Existing models are also more prone to
committing to a low quality site if it is on the path between the agents'
starting site and a higher quality site. We present a new model for the site
selection problem and verify via simulation that is able to better handle these

signatures of nonergodicity in thermal equilibrium, revealed in the recent
experimental and theoretical studies of micro and nanomechanical resonators.
However, a universal yet intuitive physical description for these diverse and

experimentally reveal persistent nonlinear phase-locked states occurring at

the transient dynamics of nonlinear systems with coupled eigenmodes. The
measured dynamics of a fully observable micromechanical resonator system are
quantitatively described by the lower frequency mode entering, maintaining, and
exiting a persistent phase-locked period tripling state generated by the
nonlinear driving force exerted by the higher frequency mode. This model
describes the observed phase-locked coherence times, the direction and

hand, complex communication topologies lead to specific training processes that
can not be generalized to other contexts, demanding re-training every time the
configuration changes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to
generalize the training process of a vehicular platoon, such that the
acceleration command of each agent becomes independent of the network topology.
Also, we have modeled the acceleration input as a term with integral action,
such that the Artificial Neural Network is capable of learning corrective

real-world entities by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex
topologies. Complex networks are known to be graphs that capture such
non-trivial topologies; they are able to represent human phenomena such as
epidemic processes, the dynamics of populations, and the urbanization of
cities. The investigation of complex networks has been extrapolated to many
fields of science, with particular emphasis on computing techniques, including
artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the interaction
between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning of
algorithms, a paradigm whose investigation is able to expand the state of the
art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm, this thesis puts together
complex networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding
of the human phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street
networks. Accordingly, we contribute with: (i) a new neural network
architecture capable of modeling dynamic processes observed in spatial and
temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting,
and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning
methodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility
between all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying
inconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most
influential vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We
obtained results sustained by sound evidence of advances to the state of the
art in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation.
Our findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains,
demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.

are employed in mission-critical applications, the ability to precisely predict
the end of discharge under highly variable environmental and operating
conditions is of paramount importance in order to support operational
decision-making. While there are accurate predictive models of the processes
underlying the charge and discharge phases of batteries, the modelling of
ageing and its effect on performance remains poorly understood. Such a lack of
understanding often leads to inaccurate models or the need for time-consuming
calibration procedures whenever the battery ages or its conditions change
significantly. This represents a major obstacle to the real-world deployment of
efficient and robust battery management systems. In this paper, we propose for
the first time an approach that can predict the voltage discharge curve for
batteries of any degradation level without the need for calibration. In
particular, we introduce Dynaformer, a novel Transformer-based deep learning
architecture which is able to simultaneously infer the ageing state from a
limited number of voltage/current samples and predict the full voltage
discharge curve for real batteries with high precision. Our experiments show
that the trained model is effective for input current profiles of different
complexities and is robust to a wide range of degradation levels. In addition
to evaluating the performance of the proposed framework on simulated data, we
demonstrate that a minimal amount of fine-tuning allows the model to bridge the
simulation-to-real gap between simulations and real data collected from a set
of batteries. The proposed methodology enables the utilization of
battery-powered systems until the end of discharge in a controlled and
predictable way, thereby significantly prolonging the operating cycles and
reducing costs.

recommendation as it directly affects product operational metrics such as daily
active users (DAUs) and dwell time. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) is
widely regarded as a promising framework for optimizing long-term engagement in
sequential recommendation. However, due to expensive online interactions, it is
very difficult for RL algorithms to perform state-action value estimation,
exploration and feature extraction when optimizing long-term engagement. In
this paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better
than, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data
near the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated,
and there is no need to perform online exploration. Directly optimizing this
policy is difficult due to the huge policy space. ResAct instead solves it by
first reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it. Our main
contributions are fourfold. First, we design a generative model which
reconstructs behaviors of the online-serving policy by sampling multiple action
estimators. Second, we design an effective learning paradigm to train the
residual actor which can output the residual for action improvement. Third, we
facilitate the extraction of features with two information theoretical
regularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features. Fourth,
we conduct extensive experiments on a real world dataset consisting of millions
of sessions, and our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines in various of long term engagement optimization tasks.

electrochemical degradation of model persistent contaminants of emerging
concern in one-pass, flow through mode, and using low-conductivity supporting

addition of hBN promoted the adsorption of more hydrophobic organic
contaminants via van der Waals and {\pi}-{\pi} interactions. Functionalization
of the graphene sponge anode with borophene enhanced the generation of oxidant
species such as H2O2 and O3 and yielded an order of magnitude higher

  Learning and Decision Making (RLDM)"" 2022",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant
advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades. One of the
central challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent
usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the
objects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals
with partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does
so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also
informative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a
hard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to
balance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in
order to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball
without any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show
that the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the
agent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically.
Finally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial
in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods
that do not exhibit directed exploration fail.

Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks performed far worse compared to

with merits such as biological plausibility and unsupervised learning
capability. Previous works have shown that converting Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) into SNNs is a practical and efficient approach for
implementing an SNN. However, the basic principle and theoretical groundwork
are lacking for training a non-accuracy-loss SNN. This paper establishes a
precise mathematical mapping between the biological parameters of the Linear
Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model (LIF)/SNNs and the parameters of ReLU-AN/Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). Such mapping relationship is analytically proven under
certain conditions and demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments. It
can serve as the theoretical basis for the potential combination of the
respective merits of the two categories of neural networks.

data-driven analysis. Our data set consists of nearly one million songs, with
song-mood associations derived from user playlists on the Spotify streaming
platform. We take advantage of state-of-the-art natural language processing
models based on transformers to learn the association between the lyrics and
moods. We find that a pretrained transformer-based language model in a
zero-shot setting -- i.e., out of the box with no further training on our data
-- is powerful for capturing song-mood associations. Moreover, we illustrate
that training on song-mood associations results in a highly accurate model that
predicts these associations for unseen songs. Furthermore, by comparing the
prediction of a model using lyrics with one using acoustic features, we observe
that the relative importance of lyrics for mood prediction in comparison with
acoustics depends on the specific mood. Finally, we verify if the models are
capturing the same information about lyrics and acoustics as humans through an
annotation task where we obtain human judgments of mood-song relevance based on
lyrics and acoustics.

  RL",,,,,"cs.MA cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is making rapid
progress for solving tasks in a grid world and real-world scenarios, in which
agents are given different attributes and goals, resulting in different
behavior through the whole multi-agent task. In this study, we quantify the
agent's behavior difference and build its relationship with the policy
performance via {\bf Role Diversity}, a metric to measure the characteristics
of MARL tasks. We define role diversity from three perspectives: action-based,
trajectory-based, and contribution-based to fully measure a multi-agent task.
Through theoretical analysis, we find that the error bound in MARL can be
decomposed into three parts that have a strong relation to the role diversity.
The decomposed factors can significantly impact policy optimization on three
popular directions including parameter sharing, communication mechanism, and
credit assignment. The main experimental platforms are based on {\bf Multiagent
Particle Environment (MPE)} and {\bf The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC). Extensive experiments} clearly show that role diversity can serve as a
robust measurement for the characteristics of a multi-agent cooperation task
and help diagnose whether the policy fits the current multi-agent system for a
better policy performance.
