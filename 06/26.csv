decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). We prove that the consensus
model learned by D-SGD is $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-1}+m^{-1} +\lambda^2)}$-stable in
expectation in the non-convex non-smooth setting, where $N$ is the total sample
size, $m$ is the worker number, and $1+\lambda$ is the spectral gap that
measures the connectivity of the communication topology. These results then
deliver an $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+
m^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+\lambda^{1+\alpha} + \phi_{\mathcal{S}})}$ in-average
generalization bound, which is non-vacuous even when $\lambda$ is closed to
$1$, in contrast to vacuous as suggested by existing literature on the
projected version of D-SGD. Our theory indicates that the generalizability of
D-SGD is positively correlated with the spectral gap, and can explain why
consensus control in initial training phase can ensure better generalization.
Experiments of VGG-11 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet

literature are designed to work primarily with low-resolution images. When
applied on very large images, challenges related to GPU memory, smaller

incorporate multi-scale features arise. The resolution of input images can be
reduced, however, with significant loss of critical information. Based on the
outlined issues, we introduce a novel research problem of training CNN models
for very large images, and present 'UltraMNIST dataset', a simple yet
representative benchmark dataset for this task. UltraMNIST has been designed
using the popular MNIST digits with additional levels of complexity added to
replicate well the challenges of real-world problems. We present two variants
of the problem: 'UltraMNIST classification' and 'Budget-aware UltraMNIST
classification'. The standard UltraMNIST classification benchmark is intended
to facilitate the development of novel CNN training methods that make the
effective use of the best available GPU resources. The budget-aware variant is
intended to promote development of methods that work under constrained GPU
memory. For the development of competitive solutions, we present several
baseline models for the standard benchmark and its budget-aware variant. We
study the effect of reducing resolution on the performance and present results
for baseline models involving pretrained backbones from among the popular
state-of-the-art models. Finally, with the presented benchmark dataset and the
baselines, we hope to pave the ground for a new generation of CNN methods
suitable for handling large images in an efficient and resource-light manner.

strong interactions between photonic modes of the same energy, where the level
repulsion and the hybridization between modes causes the emergence of photonic
bandgaps. However, most often this phenomenon does not lead to a complete and
inverted bandgap formation over the entire Brillouin zone. Here, by
systematically breaking the symmetry of a two-dimensional square photonic

level repulsion between degenerate modes along the line nodes of a

treatment effect (HTE) estimation, is an essential part of decision-making and
policy implementation. The accumulation of large amounts of data in many

developing data-driven algorithms for estimating heterogeneous effects from
observational and experimental data. However, these methods often make strong
assumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model
structure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation. At the same time,
accounting for the causal structure of real-world data is rarely trivial since
the causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data are typically unknown. To
address this problem, we develop a feature selection method that considers each
feature's value for HTE estimation and learns the relevant parts of the causal
structure from data. We provide strong empirical evidence that our method
improves existing data-driven HTE estimation methods under arbitrary underlying
causal structures. Our results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world
datasets show that our feature selection algorithm leads to lower HTE

transportation systems, including planners, travelers, service providers, and
managers. This common and core interest stimulates extensive studies on

many of which have been incorporated into transportation models, policies, and
project appraisals. Adopting the network perspective, this paper aims to
provide an integrated framework for reviewing the methodological developments
of modeling TTR in transportation networks, including its characterization,
evaluation and valuation, and traffic assignment. Specifically, the TTR
characterization provides a whole picture of travel time distribution in
transportation networks. TTR evaluation and TTR valuation (known as the value
of reliability, VOR) simply and intuitively interpret abstract characterized
TTR to be well understood by different stakeholders of transportation systems.
TTR-based traffic assignment investigates the effects of TTR on the individual
users travel behavior and consequently the collective network flow pattern. As
the above three topics are mainly separately studied in different disciplines
and research areas, the integrated framework allows us to better understand
their relationships and may contribute to developing possible combinations of
TTR modeling philosophy. Also, the network perspective enables to focus on
common challenges of modeling TTR, especially the uncertainty propagation from
the uncertainty sources to the TTR at spatial levels including link, route, and
the entire network. Some directions for future research are discussed in the
era of new data environment, applications, and emerging technologies.

significantly more efficiency than traditional methods in solving complex

named spectral operator learning (SOL) is introduced, and one variant called
the orthogonal polynomial neural operator (OPNO), developed for PDEs with

strict BC satisfaction properties and the universal approximation capacity of
the OPNO are theoretically proven. A variety of numerical experiments with
physical backgrounds show that the OPNO outperforms other existing deep

the order of 1e-6), and is up to almost 5 magnitudes faster than the

motivates the need for efficient solutions for simultaneous model selection and
training. Many methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of iterative
learners, including DNNs, attempt to solve this problem by querying and
learning a response surface while searching for the optimum of that surface.
However, many of these methods make myopic queries, do not consider prior
knowledge about the response structure, and/or perform a biased cost-aware
search, all of which exacerbate identifying the best-performing model when a
total cost budget is specified. This paper proposes a novel approach referred

efficient non-myopic Bayesian optimization solution that accounts for the
budget and leverages the prior knowledge about the objective function and cost
function to select better configurations and to take more informed decisions
during the evaluation (training). Experiments on diverse HPO benchmarks for
iterative learners show that BAPI performs better than state-of-the-art

are expected to be robust to single-source faults due to the availability of

robustness of multimodal neural networks against worst-case (i.e., adversarial)
perturbations on a single modality. We first show that standard multimodal
fusion models are vulnerable to single-source adversaries: an attack on any
single modality can overcome the correct information from multiple unperturbed
modalities and cause the model to fail. This surprising vulnerability holds
across diverse multimodal tasks and necessitates a solution. Motivated by this
finding, we propose an adversarially robust fusion strategy that trains the
model to compare information coming from all the input sources, detect
inconsistencies in the perturbed modality compared to the other modalities, and
only allow information from the unperturbed modalities to pass through. Our

Heat transfer performance is also significantly improved with the inclusion of

also to the sphere and the hyperbolic plane. In the latter curved spaces,
$\mathcal H_N $ is expressed in geodesic polar coordinates showing that such a
new superintegrable Hamiltonian can be regarded as a superposition of the
isotropic 1:1 curved (Higgs) oscillator with even-order anharmonic curved
oscillators plus another superposition of higher-order momentum-dependent
potentials. Furthermore, the symmetry algebra determined by the constants of
the motion is also studied, giving rise to a $(2N-1)$th-order polynomial
algebra. As a byproduct, the Hamiltonian $\mathcal H_N $ is interpreted as a
family of superintegrable perturbations of the classical Zernike system.
Finally, it is shown that $\mathcal H_N$ (and so the Zernike system as well) is
endowed with a Poisson $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$-coalgebra symmetry which

promising approach for multi-agent cooperation through the interaction of the
agents and environments. However, traditional DRL solutions suffer from the
high dimensions of multiple agents with continuous action space during policy
search. Besides, the dynamicity of agents' policies makes the training
non-stationary. To tackle the issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement
learning approach with high-level decision-making and low-level individual
control for efficient policy search. In particular, the cooperation of multiple
agents can be learned in high-level discrete action space efficiently. At the
same time, the low-level individual control can be reduced to single-agent
reinforcement learning. In addition to hierarchical reinforcement learning, we
propose an opponent modeling network to model other agents' policies during the
learning process. In contrast to end-to-end DRL approaches, our approach
reduces the learning complexity by decomposing the overall task into sub-tasks
in a hierarchical way. To evaluate the efficiency of our approach, we conduct a
real-world case study in the cooperative lane change scenario. Both simulation

limited constraints on its chemistry in star- and planet-forming regions: to
date, phosphorus carriers have only been detected towards a few low-mass
protostars. Motivated by an apparent association between phosphorus molecule
emission and outflow shocking, we used the IRAM 30m telescope to target PN and
PO lines towards seven Solar-type protostars with well-characterized outflows,
and firmly detected phosphorus molecules in three new sources. This sample,
combined with archival observations of three additional sources, enables the
first exploration of the demographics of phosphorus chemistry in low-mass
protostars. The sources with PN detections show evidence for strong outflow
shocks based on their H$_2$O 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$ fluxes. On the other hand, no
protostellar properties or bulk outflow mechanical properties are found to
correlate with the detection of PN. This implies that gas-phase phosphorus is
specifically linked to shocked gas within the outflows. Still, the PN and PO
line kinematics suggest an emission origin in post-shocked gas rather than
directly shocked material. Despite sampling a wide range of protostellar
properties and outflow characteristics, we find a fairly narrow range of
source-averaged PO/PN ratios (0.6-2.2) and volatile P abundances as traced by
(PN+PO)/CH$_3$OH ($\sim$1-3%). Spatially resolved observations are needed to
further constrain the emission origins and environmental drivers of the

$^{234m}$Pa. After that, step by step, it was realized that different types of
nuclear isomers exist, including spin isomer, K isomer, seniority isomers, and
``shape and fission'' isomer. The spin isomer occurs when the spin change
$\Delta I$ of a transition is very large. The larger $\Delta I$, the lower the
electromagnetic transition rates, the longer the half-lives. The K-isomer
exists due to the significant change in K, where K is the projection of the
total angular momentum on the symmetry axis. The seniority isomers arise due to
a very small transition probability in seniority conserving transitions around
semi-magic nuclei, where the seniority, which corresponds to the number of
unpaired nucleons, is a reasonably pure quantum number. For a so-called shape
isomer, the inhibition of the decay transition comes from the associated shape
changes. It is caused by that a nucleus is trapped in a deformed shape which is
its secondary minimum and is hard to decay back to its ground state.

capacity degradation. Recent phase field fracture studies have investigated
particle cracking behaviour. However, only the beginning of life has been
considered and effects such as damage accumulation have been neglected. Here, a
multi-physics phase field fatigue model has been developed to study crack
propagation in battery electrode particles undergoing hundreds of cycles. In
addition, we couple our electrochemo-mechanical formulation with X-ray CT
imaging to simulate fatigue cracking of realistic particle microstructures.
Using this modelling framework, non-linear crack propagation behaviour is
predicted, leading to the observation of an exponential increase in cracked
area with cycle number. Three stages of crack growth (slow, accelerating and
unstable) are observed, with phenomena such as crack initialisation at concave
regions and crack coalescence having a significant contribution to the
resulting fatigue crack growth rates. The critical values of C-rate, particle
size and initial crack length are determined, and found to be lower than those
reported in the literature using static fracture models. Therefore, this work
demonstrates the importance of considering fatigue damage in battery
degradation models and provides insights on the control of fatigue crack
propagation to alleviate battery capacity degradation.

and cabinets when assisting humans in everyday settings like homes and offices.
These constraints make manipulation difficult by reducing grasp accessibility,
so robots need to use non-prehensile strategies that leverage
object-environment contacts to perform manipulation tasks. To tackle the
challenge of planning and controlling contact-rich behaviors in such settings,
this work uses Hybrid Force-Velocity Controllers (HFVCs) as the skill
representation and plans skill sequences with learned preconditions. While
HFVCs naturally enable robust and compliant contact-rich behaviors, solvers
that synthesize them have traditionally relied on precise object models and
closed-loop feedback on object pose, which are difficult to obtain in
constrained environments due to occlusions. We first relax HFVCs' need for
precise models and feedback with our HFVC synthesis framework, then learn a
point-cloud-based precondition function to classify where HFVC executions will
still be successful despite modeling inaccuracies. Finally, we use the learned
precondition in a search-based task planner to complete contact-rich
manipulation tasks in a shelf domain. Our method achieves a task success rate
of $73.2\%$, outperforming the $51.5\%$ achieved by a baseline without the
learned precondition. While the precondition function is trained in simulation,
it can also transfer to a real-world setup without further fine-tuning. See

additional parameters. Notably, the MP mode has the ability to capture
transitions related to the heterogeneity of time scales and concentration
scales in the abstracted quantitative system and which are not captured by
asynchronous modes. So far, the analysis of MPBNs has focused on Boolean
dynamical properties, such as the existence of particular trajectories or
attractors. This paper addresses the sampling of trajectories from MPBNs in
order to quantify the propensities of attractors reachable from a given initial
BN configuration. The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is
performed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of
iterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth
corresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the
potential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted
quantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models
from the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the
robustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model

degrees, betweenness, or clustering coefficients are attacked with higher
probability. We mathematically and experimentally analyze the sizes of the
giant components of the networks under different types of targeted attacks, and
compare the results with the corresponding sizes under random attacks. We show
that networks disintegrate faster for targeted attacks compared to random
attacks. A targeted attack on a small fraction of high degree nodes
disintegrates one or both of the networks, whereas both the networks contain
giant components for random attack on the same fraction of nodes. An important
observation is that an attacker has an advantage if it compromises nodes based
on their betweenness, rather than based on degree or clustering coefficient.
  We next study adaptive attacks, where an attacker compromises nodes in
rounds. Here, some nodes are compromised in each round based on their degree,
betweenness or clustering coefficients, instead of compromising all nodes
together. In this case, the degree, betweenness, or clustering coefficient is

broken by an ideal gas. Inside the ideal gas, there is a narrow energy barrier.
The barrier width is much less than the nominal particle mean free path, so
that in the barrier, particle-particle collision is sparse and the local
particle trajectories tend to be nonchaotic. The steady-state distribution of
particle number density across the barrier is intrinsically in a non-Boltzmann
form. Consequently, a global particle flow can be spontaneously generated from
unforced thermal movement. The system entropy decreases without energetic
penalty, allowing for production of useful work in a cycle through heat
absorption from a single thermal reservoir. This model is large-sized and
contains many particles; the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is steady
and significant.

worldwide. Effective detection of falls can reduce the risk of complications
and injuries. Fall detection can be performed using wearable devices or ambient
sensors; these methods may struggle with user compliance issues or false
alarms. Video cameras provide a passive alternative; however, regular RGB
cameras are impacted by changing lighting conditions and privacy concerns. From
a machine learning perspective, developing an effective fall detection system
is challenging because of the rarity and variability of falls. Many existing
fall detection datasets lack important real-world considerations, such as
varied lighting, continuous activities of daily living (ADLs), and camera
placement. The lack of these considerations makes it difficult to develop
predictive models that can operate effectively in the real world. To address
these limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modality dataset (MUVIM) that
contains four visual modalities: infra-red, depth, RGB and thermal cameras.
These modalities offer benefits such as obfuscated facial features and improved
performance in low-light conditions. We formulated fall detection as an anomaly
detection problem, in which a customized spatio-temporal convolutional
autoencoder was trained only on ADLs so that a fall would increase the
reconstruction error. Our results showed that infra-red cameras provided the
highest level of performance (AUC ROC=0.94), followed by thermal (AUC
ROC=0.87), depth (AUC ROC=0.86) and RGB (AUC ROC=0.83). This research provides
a unique opportunity to analyze the utility of camera modalities in detecting

of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be

in front of strong winds. Due to the insect's cryptic lifestyle, gallery
analyses have usually been studied by destructive methods. However, they alter
the homeostasis of the insect-fungi interaction, modifies the topology of the
gallery and, more importantly, does not reveal the 100% complex structure made
by the insect. Therefore, a novel way to study this structure is by imaging the
galleries by means of computerized axial tomography (CT). This method allows
obtaining a three-dimensional representation of the gallery and the pupal
chambers to be studied, while the wood and insect sample is not disturbed and
generates a high amount of data. The isolation of the galleries and pupal
chambers from the CT background images is not simple, because there is not
enough contrast between the grey levels of the galleries and the marks
generated by internal components of the trunk itself. In this paper, we present
a robust algorithm that allows automating the isolation of the galleries and

the difficulty of interpreting missing data within a trajectory gap and the

under-explored research areas in speech technology. Recently, deep
learning-based methods and Transformer-based pretrained models have achieved
superb performances in both areas. However, most accent classification tasks
focused on classifying different kinds of English accents and little attention
was paid to geographically-proximate accent classification, especially under a
low-resource setting where forensic speech science tasks usually encounter. In
this paper, we explored three main accent modelling methods combined with two
different classifiers based on 105 speaker recordings retrieved from five urban
varieties in Northern England. Although speech representations generated from
pretrained models generally have better performances in downstream
classification, traditional methods like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) and formant measurements are equipped with specific strengths. These
results suggest that in forensic phonetics scenario where data are relatively
scarce, a simple modelling method and classifier could be competitive with
state-of-the-art pretrained speech models as feature extractors, which could
enhance a sooner estimation for the accent information in practices. Besides,
our findings also cross-validated a new methodology in quantifying
sociophonetic changes.

earned tremendous interest in recent years, and the Prescribed Performance
Control (PPC) scheme is often adopted to tackle this problem. Nevertheless,
traditional PPC schemes have inherent problems, which the solution still lacks,
such as the singularity problem when the state constraint is violated and the
potential over-control problem when the state trajectory approaches the
constraint boundary.
  This paper proposes a Singularity-Avoidance Prescribed Performance Control
scheme (SAPPC) to deal with these problems. A novel shear mapping-based error
transformation is proposed to provide a globally non-singular error
transformation procedure, while a time-varying constraint boundary is employed
to exert appropriate constraint strength at different control stages,
alleviating the potential instability caused by the over-control problem.
Besides, a novel piece-wise reference performance function (RPF) is constructed
to provide a relevant reference trajectory for the state responding signals,
allowing precise control of the system's responding behavior. Based on the
proposed SAPPC scheme, a backstepping controller is developed, with the
predefined-time stability technique and the dynamic surface control technique
employed to enhance the controller's robustness and performance. Finally,
theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results are presented to validate
the proposed control scheme's effectiveness and robustness.

  The fragmentation occurs quasi-statically via tensile-activated nucleation
and growth of multiple cracks producing a complex fracture network. Coupling
breakage with microstructural information, we determine quantitatively the
impact of ore textural features on fracture patterns and mineral liberation.
This information can be compared to the ore mechanical behaviour, in particular
to measurements of the deformation energy, the strain deformation field or the
stress relaxation response. The copper liberation, fragment size distribution
and breakage patterns are statistically characterised and related to two
dominant comminution mechanisms which are clearly identified in the sequence of
tomographic images.
  Our results show that in-situ micro-CT experiments could inform new studies

strong environmental assumptions and can complicate policy training. We
therefore propose moving the learning of conventions to the belief space.
Specifically, we propose a belief learning model that can maintain beliefs over
rollouts of policies not seen at training time, and can thus decode and adapt
to novel conventions at test time. We show how to leverage this model for both

place in the statistical analysis of mixture models. This work proposes a new

inference on the Wasserstein distance between mixing measures in topic models.
  We consider the general setting of an identifiable mixture model consisting
of mixtures of distributions from a set $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with an
arbitrary metric $d$, and show that the Wasserstein distance between mixing
measures is uniquely characterized as the most discriminative convex extension
of the metric $d$ to the set of mixtures of elements of $\mathcal{A}$. The
Wasserstein distance between mixing measures has been widely used in the study
of such models, but without axiomatic justification. Our results establish this
metric to be a canonical choice.
  Specializing our results to topic models, we consider estimation and
inference of this distance. Though upper bounds for its estimation have been
recently established elsewhere, we prove the first minimax lower bounds for the
estimation of the Wasserstein distance in topic models. We also establish fully
data-driven inferential tools for the Wasserstein distance in the topic model
context. Our results apply to potentially sparse mixtures of high-dimensional
discrete probability distributions. These results allow us to obtain the first
asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the Wasserstein distance in topic

over time, most existing approaches still model the temporal session data in
discrete state spaces, which are incapable of capturing the fine-grained

propose Graph Nested GRU ordinary differential equation (ODE), namely GNG-ODE,
a novel continuum model that extends the idea of neural ODEs to continuous-time
temporal session graphs. The proposed model preserves the continuous nature of
dynamic user preferences, encoding both temporal and structural patterns of
item transitions into continuous-time dynamic embeddings. As the existing ODE
solvers do not consider graph structure change and thus cannot be directly
applied to the dynamic graph, we propose a time alignment technique, called
t-Alignment, to align the updating time steps of the temporal session graphs
within a batch. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that GNG-ODE
significantly outperforms other baselines.

that Chao et al's construction will have a smaller teraquop footprint for

for the phase transformation (PT). The volumetric misfit strain due to the

presence of precipitates, the critical thermal driving forces remarkably differ
between the direct and reverse PTs, resulting in a hysteresis behavior. For the
precipitate radius small compared to the interface width, the misfit strain
does not practically show any effect on the critical thermal driving force.
Also, the critical thermal driving force value nonlinearly increases vs. the
precipitate concentration for both the direct and reverse PTs. Change in the
precipitate surface energy significantly changes the PT morphology and the
critical thermal driving forces. The critical thermal driving force shows
dependence on the misfit strain for large precipitate sizes compared to the
interface width. For both the constant surface energy (CSE) and variable
surface energy (VSE) boundary conditions (BCs) at the precipitate surface, the
critical thermal driving force linearly increases vs. the misfit strain
coefficient for the direct PT while it is almost independent of it for the

nonlinearly increases vs. the precipitate concentration for the direct PT. For
the reverse PT, its value for the CSE BCs linearly increases vs. the

in higher thermal critical driving forces, a smaller hysteresis range, and a

in particular, nonparametric scan statistics (NPSSs) identify subgraphs with a
higher than expected proportion of individually significant nodes. However, we
show that recently proposed NPSS methods are miscalibrated, failing to account

results in both reduced detection power for subtle signals, and low precision

parameters. Such a large model may not be suitable for directly deploying on
low computation and low capacity units (e.g., edge devices). Knowledge
distillation (KD) has recently been recognized as a powerful model compression
method to decrease the model parameters effectively. The central concept of KD
is to extract useful information from the feature maps of a large model (i.e.,
teacher model) as a reference to successfully train a small model (i.e.,
student model) in which the model size is much smaller than the teacher one.
Although many KD methods have been proposed to utilize the information from the
feature maps of intermediate layers in the teacher model, most did not consider
the similarity of feature maps between the teacher model and the student model.
As a result, it may make the student model learn useless information. Inspired
by the attention mechanism, we propose a novel KD method called representative
teacher key (RTK) that not only considers the similarity of feature maps but
also filters out the useless information to improve the performance of the
target student model. In the experiments, we validate our proposed method with
several backbone networks (e.g., ResNet and WideResNet) and datasets (e.g.,
CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and CINIC10). The results show that our proposed RTK

Our derived bounds are verified by comparing them with analytical scattering

overcome degraded performance in low-resolution quantization. However, large
quantization errors between real values and their low-bit quantized ones cause
difficulties in achieving acceptable performance for complex networks and large
datasets. The proposed training method softly delivers the knowledge of
pretrained models to low-bit quantized models in multiple quantization steps.
In each quantization step, the trained weights of a model are used to
initialize the weights of the next model with the quantization bit depth
reduced by one. With small change of the quantization bit depth, the
performance gap can be bridged, thus providing better weight initialization. In
cyclic training, after training a low-bit quantized model, its trained weights
are used in the initialization of its accurate model to be trained. By using
better training ability of the accurate model in an iterative manner, the
proposed method can produce enhanced trained weights for the low-bit quantized
model in each cycle. Notably, the training method can advance Top-1 and Top-5
accuracies of the binarized ResNet-18 on the ImageNet dataset by 5.80% and

concern on fairness violations. Although there has been a surge of work that
improves algorithmic fairness, most of them are under the assumption of an
identical training and test distribution. In many real-world applications,
however, such an assumption is often violated as previously trained fair models
are often deployed in a different environment, and the fairness of such models
has been observed to collapse. In this paper, we study how to transfer model
fairness under distribution shifts, a widespread issue in practice. We conduct
a fine-grained analysis of how the fair model is affected under different types
of distribution shifts and find that domain shifts are more challenging than
subpopulation shifts. Inspired by the success of self-training in transferring
accuracy under domain shifts, we derive a sufficient condition for transferring
group fairness. Guided by it, we propose a practical algorithm with a fair
consistency regularization as the key component. A synthetic dataset benchmark,
which covers all types of distribution shifts, is deployed for experimental
verification of the theoretical findings. Experiments on synthetic and real

Gleason grading through whole slide images (WSIs) have excellent prospects.
Since the size of WSIs is extremely large, the image label usually contains
only slide-level label or limited pixel-level labels. The current mainstream
approach adopts multi-instance learning to predict Gleason grades. However,
some methods only considering the slide-level label ignore the limited
pixel-level labels containing rich local information. Furthermore, the method
of additionally considering the pixel-level labels ignores the inaccuracy of
pixel-level labels. To address these problems, we propose a mixed supervision
Transformer based on the multiple instance learning framework. The model
utilizes both slide-level label and instance-level labels to achieve more
accurate Gleason grading at the slide level. The impact of inaccurate
instance-level labels is further reduced by introducing an efficient random
masking strategy in the mixed supervision training process. We achieve the
state-of-the-art performance on the SICAPv2 dataset, and the visual analysis
shows the accurate prediction results of instance level. The source code is

  Based on Energy Circuit Modeling in the Frequency Domain",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With more energy networks being interconnected to form integrated energy
systems (IESs), the optimal energy flow (OEF) problem has drawn increasing
attention. Extant studies on OEF models mostly utilize the finite difference
method (FDM) to address partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints related
to the dynamics in natural gas networks (NGNs) and district heating networks
(DHNs). However, this time-domain approach suffers from a heavy computational
burden with regard to achieving high finite-difference accuracy. In this paper,
a novel OEF model that formulates NGN and DHN constraints in the frequency
domain and corresponding model compaction techniques for efficient solving are
contributed. First, an energy circuit method (ECM) that algebraizes the PDEs of
NGNs and DHNs in the frequency domain is introduced. Then, an ECM-based OEF
model is formulated, which contains fewer variables and constraints than an
FDM-based OEF model and thereby yields better solving efficiency. Finally,
variable space projection is employed to remove implicit variables, by which
another constraint generation algorithm is enabled to remove redundant
constraints. These two techniques further compact the OEF model and bring about
a second improvement in solving efficiency. Numerical tests on actual systems
indicate the final OEF model reduces variables and constraints by more than 95%
and improves the solving efficiency by more than 10 times. In conclusion, the
proposed OEF model and solving techniques well meet the optimization needs of
large-scale IESs.

through global bit-string statistics the predicted crossover from integrability

incompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs

encoders. Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders
(e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few
efforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of
representations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of
existing CF methods and design new learning objectives. In this paper, we
measure the representation quality in CF from the perspective of alignment and
uniformity on the hypersphere. We first theoretically reveal the connection
between the BPR loss and these two properties. Then, we empirically analyze the
learning dynamics of typical CF methods in terms of quantified alignment and
uniformity, which shows that better alignment or uniformity both contribute to
higher recommendation performance. Based on the analyses results, a learning
objective that directly optimizes these two properties is proposed, named
DirectAU. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the

the bulge population. We employed an accurate cross-match of BDBS with the
latest data release (EDR3) from the Gaia mission, matching more than 140
million sources with BDBS photometry and Gaia EDR3 photometry and astrometry.
We relied on Gaia EDR3 astrometry, without any photometric selection, to
produce clean BDBS bulge colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Gaia parallaxes were
used to filter out bright foreground sources, and a Gaussian mixture model fit
to Galactic proper motions could identify stars kinematically consistent with
bulge membership. We applied this method to 127 different bulge fields of $1$
deg$^2$ each, with $|\ell| \leq 9.5^\circ$ and $-9.5^\circ \leq b \leq
-2.5^\circ$. The astrometric cleaning procedure removes the majority of blue
stars in each field, especially near the Galactic plane, where the ratio of
blue to red stars is $\lesssim 10\%$, increasing to values $\sim 20\%$ at
higher Galactic latitudes. We rule out the presence of a widespread population
of stars younger than 2 Gyr. The vast majority of blue stars brighter than the
turnoff belong to the foreground population, according to their measured
astrometry. We introduce the distance between the observed red giant branch
bump and the red clump as a simple age proxy for the dominant population in the
field, and we confirm the picture of a predominantly old bulge. Further work is
needed to apply the method to estimate ages to fields at higher latitudes, and
to model the complex morphology of the Galactic bulge.

revealed the dip fine structure in the period-spacing versus period diagram of

of the dip structure by numerical calculations in previous studies, we present
in this paper the physical mechanism of how the dip is formed as a result of
the interaction between the gravito-inertial waves in the radiative envelope
and the pure inertial waves in the convective core. We analytically describe
the wave solutions in both of the radiative envelope and the convective core,
and match them at the interface to construct an eigenmode. We have found from
the analysis the following points: the dip structure is mainly controlled by a
parameter that has an inverse correlation with Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency at
the interface; the depth and the width of the dip is shallower and larger,
respectively, as the parameter gets large; the shape of the dip can be
approximated by the Lorentzian function; the period at the central position of
the dip is equal to or slightly smaller than that of the involved pure inertial
mode in the convective core. We have also understood based on the evolutionary
models of main-sequence stars that the parameter is inversely correlated with
the chemical composition gradient at the convective-core boundary. The dip
structure thus would provide information about the poorly-understood physical
processes, such as diffusion, convective overshooting and rotational mixing,
around the boundary between the convective core and the radiative envelope.

weight of jobs completed exactly at their deadline. Note that this uniquely
defines a processing time interval for each job on each machine.
  Interval Scheduling on Unrelated Machines is closely related to coloring
interval graphs and has been thoroughly studied for several decades. However,
as pointed out by Mnich and van Bevern [Computers \& Operations Research,
2018], the parameterized complexity for the number $m$ of machines as a
parameter remained open. We resolve this by showing that Interval Scheduling on
Unrelated Machines is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number $m$ of
machines. To this end, we prove W[1]-hardness with respect to $m$ of the
special case where we have parallel machines with eligible machine sets for
jobs. This answers Open Problem 8 of Mnich and van Bevern's list of 15 open

  Furthermore, we resolve the computational complexity status of the unweighted

NP-complete. This answers an open question by Sung and Vlach [Journal of

requires the determination of its electric field in both time and space
domains. However, previous methods, like the widely-used RABBITT and attosecond
streaking, only measure the temporal profile of the attosecond pulse. Here we
demonstrate an all-optical method for the measurement of the space-time
properties of an IAP. By introducing a non-collinear perturbing pulse to the
driving field, the process of IAP generation is modified both spatially and
temporally, manifesting as a spatial and a frequency modulation in the harmonic
spectrum. By using a FROG-like retrieval method, the spatio-spectral phases of
the harmonic spectrum are faithfully extracted from the induced spatio-spectral
modulations, which allows a thoroughgoing characterization of the IAP in both
time and space. With this method, the spatio-temporal structures of the IAP
generated in a two-color driving field in both the near- and far-field are
fully reconstructed, from which a weak spatio-temporal coupling in the IAP
generation is revealed. Our approach overcomes the limitation in the temporal
measurement in conventional in situ scheme, providing a reliable and holistic
metrology for IAP characterization.

(STAR-RIS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication systems

location, the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) of the

an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, where successive convex

tasks involving sequential data. They have, however, been plagued by a slew of
inherent flaws due to the intrinsic characteristics of chain-style conditional
modeling (e.g., exposure bias or lack of long-range coherence), severely
limiting their ability to model distributions properly. In this paper, we
propose a unique method termed E-ARM for training autoregressive generative
models that takes advantage of a well-designed energy-based learning objective.
By leveraging the extra degree of freedom of the softmax operation, we are
allowed to make the autoregressive model itself be an energy-based model for
measuring the likelihood of input without introducing any extra parameters.
Furthermore, we show that E-ARM can be trained efficiently and is capable of
alleviating the exposure bias problem and increase temporal coherence for
autoregressive generative models. Extensive empirical results, covering
benchmarks like language modeling, neural machine translation, and image
generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

that the presence of the inner Cauchy horizon ($\mathcal{CH}$) in the black

\lesssim t_\mathrm{rise} \lesssim 100\,\mathrm{sec}$ and $0.5 \lesssim \Delta
F/F_{\star} \lesssim 20$, respectively. The flare light curves mostly show
steeper rises and shallower decays than those obtained from the Kepler
one-minute cadence data and tend to have flat peak structures. Assuming a
blackbody spectrum with temperatures of $9,000-15,000\,\mathrm{K}$, the peak
luminosities and bolometric energies are estimated to be
$10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,sec^{-1}} \lesssim L_\mathrm{peak} \lesssim
10^{31}\,\mathrm{erg\,sec^{-1}}$ and $10^{31}\,\mathrm{erg} \lesssim E_{\rm

optical flares for M dwarfs. We confirm that more than 90\% of the host stars
of the detected flares are magnetically active based on their H$\alpha$
emission line intensities obtained by LAMOST. The estimated occurrence rate of
the detected flares is $\sim 0.7$ per day per an active star, indicating they
are common in magnetically active M dwarfs. We argue that the flare light
curves can be explained by the chromospheric compression model; the rise time
is broadly consistent with the Alfv\'en transit time of a magnetic loop with a
length scale of $l_\mathrm{loop} \sim 10^4\,\mathrm{km}$ and a field strength
of $1,000\,\mathrm{G}$, while the decay time is likely determined by the
radiative cooling of the compressed chromosphere down to near the photosphere
with a temperature of $\gtrsim 10,000\,\mathrm{K}$. These flares from M dwarfs
could be a major contamination source for a future search of fast optical
transients of unknown types.

end, we study a hydrodynamic model of an active polar material. To account for
the effect of the protein gradient, the polar field is coupled to the
boundary-provided gradient of a scalar field that also advects with material
flows. Focusing on the large system size limit, we show in particular: (i) The
system can be stable for an effectively extensile coupling between scalar field
gradient and active stresses, i.e. gradient-extensile coupling, while it is
always unstable for a gradient-contractile coupling. Intriguingly, there are
many systems in the biological literature that are gradient-extensile, while we
could not find any that are clearly gradient-contractile. (ii) Stability is
strongly affected by the way polarity magnitude is controlled. Taken together,

purpose of decreasing the intense data exchange required for parallelizing
distributed computing systems. Under the famous MapReduce paradigm, this coded
approach has been shown to decrease this communication overhead by a factor
that is linearly proportional to the overall computation load during the
mapping phase. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that this overhead remains a
main bottleneck in distributed computing. To address this, we take a new
approach and we explore a new system model which, for the same aforementioned
overall computation load of the mapping phase, manages to provide astounding
reductions of the communication overhead and, perhaps counterintuitively, a
substantial increase of the computational parallelization. In particular, we
propose multi-access distributed computing (MADC) as a novel generalization of
the original CDC model, where now mappers and reducers are distinct computing
nodes that are connected through a multi-access network topology. Focusing on
the MADC setting with combinatorial topology, which implies $\Lambda$ mappers
and $K$ reducers such that there is a unique reducer connected to any $\alpha$
mappers, we propose a novel coded scheme and a novel information-theoretic
converse, which jointly identify the optimal inter-reducer communication load
to within a constant gap of $1.5$. Additionally, a modified coded scheme and
converse identify the optimal max-link communication load across all existing
links to within a gap of $4$. The unparalleled coding gains reported here
should not be simply credited to having access to more mapped data, but rather
to the powerful role of topology in effectively aligning mapping outputs. This
realization raises the open question of which multi-access network topology
guarantees the best possible performance in distributed computing.

licensed sub-bands to several buyer MNOs. We first analyze the per-user

we formulate the joint problem of power control and licensed sub-band sharing
to maximize the expected profit of all MNOs as a multiobjective optimization
problem (MOOP) under the users' quality of service requirement and the
nonnegative return on investment constraints. To transform the MOOP into a
single objective form, we use a combination of the $\epsilon$-constraint and

the presence of binary variables and nonconvex rate functions in the objective

explains these signals as harmonics of non-radial modes of degrees 8 or 9 in

selected at least triple-mode RR Lyrae stars pulsating in radial and non-radial

follow the growth of a planet from a small embryo through its subsequent
evolution. We estimate the accretion rate range based on a protoplanetary disk
model at a large enough distance from the central star, for water ice to be a
major component. We assume the accreted material to be a mixture of silicate
rock and ice, with no H-He envelope, as the accretion timescale is much longer
than the time required for the nebular gas to dissipate. We adopt a thermal
evolution model that includes accretional heating, radioactive energy release,
and separation of ice and rock. Taking the Safronov parameter and the
ice-to-rock ratio as free parameters, we compute growth and evolutionary
sequences for different parameter combinations, for 4.6 Gyr.
  We find the final structure to depend significantly on both parameters. Low
initial ice to rock ratios and high accretion rates, each resulting in
increased heating rate, lead to the formation of extended rocky cores, while
the opposite conditions leave the composition almost unchanged and result in
relatively low internal temperatures. When rocky cores form, the ice-rich outer
mantles still contain rock mixed with the ice. We find that a considerable
fraction of the ice evaporates upon accretion, depending on parameters, and
assume it is lost, thus the final surface composition and bulk density of the
planet do not necessarily reflect the protoplanetary disk composition.

effectively prevent privacy breaches and provide strong protection to the
original templates. However, to suit resource-constrained IoT devices,
oversimplified templates would compromise authentication performance

the designed re-indexing scheme; and 2) lightweight cancelable feature
generation based on the designed encoding-nested-difference-XOR scheme.
Comprehensive experimental results on public databases~FVC2002 DB1-DB4 and

achieves equivalent authentication performance to state-of-the-art methods in

by combining limited traffic volume and vehicle trajectory data. While traffic
volume data from loop detectors have been the common data source for link flow
estimation, the detectors only cover a subset of links. Vehicle trajectory data
collected from vehicle tracking sensors are also incorporated these days.
However, trajectory data are often sparse in that the observed trajectories
only represent a small subset of the whole population, where the exact sampling
rate is unknown and may vary over space and time. This study proposes a novel
generative modelling framework, where we formulate the link-to-link movements
of a vehicle as a sequential decision-making problem using the Markov Decision
Process framework and train an agent to make sequential decisions to generate
realistic synthetic vehicle trajectories. We use Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based methods to find the best behaviour of the agent, based on which
synthetic population vehicle trajectories can be generated to estimate link
flows across the whole network. To ensure the generated population vehicle
trajectories are consistent with the observed traffic volume and trajectory
data, two methods based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Constrained
Reinforcement Learning are proposed. The proposed generative modelling
framework solved by either of these RL-based methods is validated by solving
the link flow estimation problem in a real road network. Additionally, we
perform comprehensive experiments to compare the performance with two existing
methods. The results show that the proposed framework has higher estimation
accuracy and robustness under realistic scenarios where certain behavioural
assumptions about drivers are not met or the network coverage and penetration
rate of trajectory data are low.

the magnetar may emit extended gravitational wave (GW) emission associated with
the X-ray plateau due to non-axisymmetric deformation or various stellar
oscillations. The advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors have searched for
long-duration GW transients for several years, no evidence of GWs from any
magnetar has been found until now. In this work, we attempt to search for
signature of GW radiation in the electromagnetic observation of 30 LGRBs under
the assumption of the magnetar model.
  We utilize the observations of the LGRB plateau to constrain the properties
of the new-born magnetar, including the initial spin period $P_0$, diploe
magnetic field strength $B_p$ and the ellipticity $\epsilon$. We find that
there are some tight relations between magnetar parameters, e.g., $\epsilon
\propto B_p^{1.29}$ and $B_p\propto P_0^{1.14}$.
  In addition, we derive the GW strain for magnetar sample via their spin-down
processes, and find that the GWs from these objects may not be detectable by
the aLIGO and ET detectors. For a rapidly spinning magnetar ($P\sim 1\mbox{
ms}$, $ B \sim10^{15}\mbox{ G}$), the detection horizon for advanced LIGO O5
detector is $\sim 180\mbox{ Mpc}$. The detection of such GW signal associated
with the X-ray plateau would be a smoking gun that the central engine of GRB is

forms. One is relativistic causality, which is tied to a space-time structure
and forbids signalling outside the future. A second is an operational notion of
causation that considers the flow of information between physical systems and
interventions on them. In [Vilasini and Colbeck, Phys. Rev. A. 106, 032204
(2022)], we propose a framework for characterising when a causal model can
coexist with relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling, while
allowing for cyclic and non-classical causal influences and the possibility of
causation without signalling. In a theory without superluminal causation, both
superluminal signalling and causal loops are not possible in Minkowski
space-time. Here we demonstrate that if we only forbid superluminal signalling,
superluminal causation remains possible and show the mathematical possibility
of causal loops that can be embedded in a Minkowski space-time without leading
to superluminal signalling. The existence of such loops in the given space-time
could in principle be operationally verified using interventions. This
establishes that the physical principle of no superluminal signalling is not by
itself sufficient to rule out causal loops between Minkowski space-time events.
Interestingly, the conditions required to rule out causal loops in a space-time
depend on the dimension. Whether such loops are possible in three spatial
dimensions remains an important open question.

decompose signal matrices from each view into the sum of shared and individual
structures, which are further used for dimension reduction, exploratory
analyses, and quantifying associations across views. However, existing methods
have limitations in modeling partially-shared structures due to either too
restrictive models, or restrictive identifiability conditions. To address these
challenges, we formulate a new model for partially-shared signals based on
grouping the views into so-called hierarchical levels. The proposed hierarchy
leads us to introduce a new penalty, hierarchical nuclear norm (HNN), for
signal estimation. In contrast to existing methods, HNN penalization avoids
scores and loadings factorization of the signals and leads to a convex
optimization problem, which we solve using a dual forward-backward algorithm.
We propose a simple refitting procedure to adjust the penalization bias and
develop an adapted version of bi-cross-validation for selecting tuning
parameters. Extensive simulation studies and analysis of the genotype-tissue

simultaneous sensing and transmission without any active modulation. However,
to maximize the sensing accuracy, the structures of meta-IoT sensors need to be
optimized considering their joint influence on sensing and transmission, which
is challenging due to the high computational complexity in evaluating the
influence, especially given a large number of sensors. In this paper, we
propose a joint sensing and transmission design method for meta-IoT systems

masses are much smaller than the initial separation between their centers, the
displacement-to-separation ratio is a natural parameter in which the
gravitational potential can be expanded. We show that entanglement in such
experiments is sensitive to initial relative momentum only when the system
evolves into non-Gaussian states, i.e., when the potential is expanded at least
up to the cubic term. A pivotal role of force gradient as the dominant
contributor to position-momentum correlations is demonstrated. We establish a
closed-form expression for the entanglement gain, which shows that the
contribution from the cubic term is proportional to momentum and from the
quartic term is proportional to momentum squared. From a quantum information
perspective, the results find applications as a momentum witness of
non-Gaussian entanglement. Our methods are versatile and apply to any number of
central interactions expanded to any order.

  Representation","27 pages",,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A vertical recursive relation approach to Riordan arrays is induced, while
the horizontal recursive relation is represented by $A$- and $Z$-sequences.
This vertical recursive approach gives a way to represent the entries of a
Riordan array $(g,f)$ in terms of a recursive linear combinations of the
coefficients of $g$. A matrix representation of the vertical recursive relation
is also given. The set of all those matrices forms a group, called the
quasi-Riordan group. The extensions of the horizontal recursive relation and
the vertical recursive relation in terms of $c$- and $C$- Riordan arrays are
defined with illustrations by using the rook triangle and the Laguerre
triangle. Those extensions represent a way to study nonlinear recursive
relations of the entries of some triangular matrices from linear recursive
relations of the entries of Riordan arrays. In addition, the matrix
representation of the vertical recursive relation of Riordan arrays provides
transforms between lower order and high order finite Riordan arrays, where the
$m$th order Riordan array is defined by $(g,f)_m=(d_{n,k})_{m\geq n,k\geq 0}$.
Furthermore, the vertical relation approach to Riordan arrays provides a
unified approach to construct identities.

for FL to alleviate the single point of failure and dishonest clients. These
impending challenges in the design philosophy of FL call for blockchain-based
federated learning (BFL) due to the benefits of coupling FL and blockchain
(e.g., democracy, incentive, and immutability). However, one problem in vanilla
BFL is that its capabilities do not follow adopters' needs in a dynamic
fashion. Besides, vanilla BFL relies on unverifiable clients' self-reported
contributions like data size because checking clients' raw data is not allowed
in FL for privacy concerns. We design and evaluate a novel BFL framework, and
resolve the identified challenges in vanilla BFL with greater flexibility and
incentive mechanism called FAIR-BFL. In contrast to existing works, FAIR-BFL
offers unprecedented flexibility via the modular design, allowing adopters to
adjust its capabilities following business demands in a dynamic fashion. Our
design accounts for BFL's ability to quantify each client's contribution to the
global learning process. Such quantification provides a rational metric for
distributing the rewards among federated clients and helps discover malicious
participants that may poison the global model.

Fourier cross-spectrum analysis shows that the phase lags between QPOs
components in different energy bands will have a simple linear relationship
with the phase lags between the total signals, so that the intrinsic phase lags
of the QPOs can be obtained by linear correction. The power density spectrum
(PDS) thus requires a multiplicative model to interpret the data. We briefly
discuss a physical scenario for interpreting the convolution. In this scenario,
the corona acts as a low-pass filter, the Green's function containing the noise
is convolved with the QPOs to form the low-frequency part of the PDS, while the
high-frequency part requires an additive component. We use a multiplicative PDS
model to fit the data observed by Insight-HXMT. The overall fitting results are
similar compared to the traditional additive PDS model. Neither the width nor
the centroid frequency of the QPOs obtained from each of the two PDS models
were significantly different, except for the r.m.s. of the QPOs. Our work thus

their pure self-interest at the expense of the global welfare. Known as social
dilemmas, this category of non-cooperative games offers situations where
multiple actors should all cooperate to achieve the best outcome but greed and
fear lead to a worst self-interested issue. Recently, the emergence of Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has generated revived interest in social dilemmas
with the introduction of Sequential Social Dilemma (SSD). Cooperative agents
mixing RL policies and Tit-for-tat (TFT) strategies have successfully addressed
some non-optimal Nash equilibrium issues. However, this kind of paradigm
requires symmetrical and direct cooperation between actors, conditions that are
not met when mutual cooperation become asymmetric and is possible only with at
least a third actor in a circular way. To tackle this issue, this paper extends
SSD with Circular Sequential Social Dilemma (CSSD), a new kind of Markov games
that better generalizes the diversity of cooperation between agents. Secondly,
to address such circular and asymmetric cooperation, we propose a candidate
solution based on RL policies and a graph-based TFT. We conducted some
experiments on a simple multi-player grid world which offers adaptable
cooperation structures. Our work confirmed that our graph-based approach is
beneficial to address circular situations by encouraging self-interested agents

consider different state representation approaches and reward design mechanisms

real-world critical care datasets: the MIMIC-III and the UCSF. Results
demonstrate that policy recommendations on transfusion achieved comparable
matching against true hospital policies via accuracy and weighted importance

Subsequently, it updates the model by combining the synthesized data with new
class data. Furthermore, we incorporate a cosine normalized Cross-entropy loss

separation among previous classes and new ones, and an intra-domain contrastive
loss to generalize the model trained on the synthesized data to real data. We

mechanisms in the limit of a large number of compositions. As a consequence of
the law of large numbers, in this regime the best privacy mechanism is the one
that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional output
distributions of the mechanism given two different inputs. We formulate an
optimization problem to minimize this divergence subject to a cost constraint
on the noise. We first prove that additive mechanisms are optimal. Since the
optimization problem is infinite dimensional, it cannot be solved directly;
nevertheless, we quantize the problem to derive near-optimal additive
mechanisms that we call ""cactus mechanisms"" due to their shape. We show that
our quantization approach can be arbitrarily close to an optimal mechanism.
Surprisingly, for quadratic cost, the Gaussian mechanism is strictly
sub-optimal compared to this cactus mechanism. Finally, we provide numerical
results which indicate that cactus mechanism outperforms the Gaussian mechanism
for a finite number of compositions.

is critical that we systematically align AI objectives with the goals and
values of humans. The human-AI alignment problem stems from the impracticality
of explicitly specifying the rewards that AI models should receive for all the
actions they could take in all relevant states of the world. One possible
solution, then, is to leverage the capabilities of AI models to learn those
rewards implicitly from a rich source of data describing human values in a wide
range of contexts. The democratic policy-making process produces just such data
by developing specific rules, flexible standards, interpretable guidelines, and
generalizable precedents that synthesize citizens' preferences over potential
actions taken in many states of the world. Therefore, computationally encoding
public policies to make them legible to AI systems should be an important part
of a socio-technical approach to the broader human-AI alignment puzzle. This
Essay outlines research on AI that learn structures in policy data that can be
leveraged for downstream tasks. As a demonstration of the ability of AI to
comprehend policy, we provide a case study of an AI system that predicts the
relevance of proposed legislation to any given publicly traded company and its
likely effect on that company. We believe this represents the ""comprehension""
phase of AI and policy, but leveraging policy as a key source of human values
to align AI requires ""understanding"" policy. Solving the alignment problem is
crucial to ensuring that AI is beneficial both individually (to the person or
group deploying the AI) and socially. As AI systems are given increasing
responsibility in high-stakes contexts, integrating democratically-determined
policy into those systems could align their behavior with human goals in a way
that is responsive to a constantly evolving society.

documentation and programming tutorials. To improve knowledge accessibility and
usage, several recent studies use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to
construct API know-what knowledge graph (API-KG) and programming task know-how
knowledge graph (Task-KG) from software documentation. Although being
promising, current API-KG and Task-KG are independent of each other, and thus
are void of inherent connections between the two types of knowledge. Our
empirical study on Stack Overflow questions confirms that only 36% of the API
usage problems can be answered by the know-how or the know-what knowledge
alone, while the rest questions require a fusion of both. Inspired by this
observation, we make the first attempt to fuse API-KG and Task-KG by API entity
linking. This fusion creates nine categories of API semantic relations and two
types of task semantic relations which are not present in the stand-alone
API-KG or Task-KG. According to the definitions of these new API and task
semantic relations, our approach dives deeper than the surface-level API
linking of API-KG and Task-KG, and infers nine categories of API semantic
relations from task descriptions and two types of task semantic relations with
the assistance of API-KG, which enrich the declaration or syntactic relations
in the current API-KG and Task-KG. Our fused and semantically-enriched API-Task
KG supports coherent API/Task-centric knowledge search by text or code queries.

predict that this discreetness could be manifested through Lorentz invariance
violations (LIV) over travelling particles at astronomical length distances.
However, reports on LIV are controversial, and space discreetness could still
be compatible with Lorentz invariance. Here, it is tested whether space
quantization on the order of Planck length could still be compatible with
Lorentz invariance through the application of a covariant geometric uncertainty
principle (GeUP) as a constraint over geodesics in FRW geometries. Space time
line elements compatible with the uncertainty principle are calculated for a
homogeneous, isotropic expanding Universe represented by the Friedmann Lemaitre
Robertson Walker solution to General Relativity (FLRW or FRW metric). A generic
expression for the quadratic proper space time line element is derived,
proportional to Planck length squared, and dependent on two contributions. The
first is associated to the energy time uncertainty, and the second depends on
the Hubble function. The results are in agreement with space-time quantization
on the expected length orders, according to quantum gravity theories, and
