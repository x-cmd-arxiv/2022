  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The leverage of large volumes of web videos paired with the searched queries
or surrounding texts (e.g., title) offers an economic and extensible
alternative to supervised video representation learning. Nevertheless, modeling
such weakly visual-textual connection is not trivial due to query polysemy
(i.e., many possible meanings for a query) and text isomorphism (i.e., same
syntactic structure of different text). In this paper, we introduce a new
design of mutual calibration between query and text to boost weakly-supervised
video representation learning. Specifically, we present Bi-Calibration Networks
(BCN) that novelly couples two calibrations to learn the amendment from text to
query and vice versa. Technically, BCN executes clustering on all the titles of
the videos searched by an identical query and takes the centroid of each
cluster as a text prototype. The query vocabulary is built directly on query
words. The video-to-text/video-to-query projections over text prototypes/query
vocabulary then start the text-to-query or query-to-text calibration to
estimate the amendment to query or text. We also devise a selection scheme to
balance the two corrections. Two large-scale web video datasets paired with
query and title for each video are newly collected for weakly-supervised video
representation learning, which are named as YOVO-3M and YOVO-10M, respectively.
The video features of BCN learnt on 3M web videos obtain superior results under
linear model protocol on downstream tasks. More remarkably, BCN trained on the
larger set of 10M web videos with further fine-tuning leads to 1.6%, and 1.8%
gains in top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400, and Something-Something V2 datasets

We build on existing approaches that detect coordinated groups by identifying
high levels of synchronized actions within a specified time window. A key
concern with this approach is the selection of the time window. We propose a
method that selects the optimal window size to accurately capture local
coordination while avoiding the capture of coincidental synchronicity. With
this enhanced method of coordination detection, we perform a comparative study

three dimensions of coordination for each event -- semantic, referral and

infected cells is the major obstacle for eradication of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Due to the noisy environment and multiple
influencing factors in the organism, current dynamical models cannot reach a
common understanding of the molecular mechanism of HIV latency. In this work,
through a new dynamical structure decomposition, the deterministic part of the
equation can be separated from the stochastic noise. Thus, the fixed-point
analysis of ordinary differential equation is enough to obtain the different
steady states of the system. Methods: We established a dynamical model of HIV
transcription process by using continuous stochastic differential equations,
which simplifies the dimensions of equations needed to describe the system and
increases the explorable space of the model. Different states between latency
and activation of virus and their relations can be intuitively represented by
potential functions and probability distribution functions. Results: Based on
our model, the influence of different dynamical parameters on stability is
quantitatively analyzed, the parameter ranges of the system in bistable and
monostable states are obtained respectively. The theoretical basis of this work
is verified by comparing the effects of different factors on dynamic
bifurcation with the results of biological experiments. Conclusion: This paper
goes beyond previous discrete stochastic methods, and can quantitatively
analyze the dynamic mechanism of HIV transcriptional regulation through
ordinary differential equations, which is beneficial to the promotion to deal
with the high-dimensional situation, and further study the occurrence and
development of AIDS in vivo, so as to guide the design of experiments and
search for clinical treatment.

satisfy the vacuum annihilation condition, a critical property for accurate

pions and, for the first time, event-by event measurements of neutron
kinematics. The time resolution defines the neutron energy resolution. We
present the results of time resolution measurements made with the SuperFGD
prototype that consists of 9216 plastic scintillator cubes (cube size is 1
cm$^3$) readout with 1728 wavelength-shifting fibers going along three
orthogonal directions. We use data from the muon beam exposure at CERN. The
time resolution of 0.97 ns was obtained for one readout channel after
implementing the time calibration with a correction for the time-walk effect.
The time resolution improves with energy deposited in a scintillator cube.
Averaging two readout channels for one scintillator cube improves the time
resolution to 0.68 ns which means that signals in different channels are not
synchronous. Therefore the contribution from the time recording step of 2.5 ns
is averaged as well. Averaging time values from N channels improves the time
resolution by $\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$. Therefore a very good time resolution should
be achievable for neutrons since neutron recoils hit typically several
scintillator cubes and in addition produce larger amplitudes than muons.
Measurements performed with a laser and a wide-bandwidth oscilloscope
demonstrated that the time resolution obtained with the muon beam is not far
from its expected limit. The intrinsic time resolution of one channel is 0.67
ns for signals of 56 photo-electron typical for minimum ionizing particles.

decomposition and the spatial correlation by the precision matrix inheriting
the neighboring structure. Their joint distribution constitutes a Gaussian
Markov random field, whose sparse precision matrix enables the usage of
efficient sampling algorithms. We cluster the areal units using a nonparametric
prior, thereby learning latent partitions of the areal units. The performance
of the model is assessed via an application to study regional unemployment
patterns in Italy. When compared to other spatial and spatio-temporal
competitors, the proposed model shows more precise estimates and the additional
information obtained from the clustering allows for an extended economic
interpretation of the unemployment rates of the Italian provinces.

work to propose and investigate the feasibility of using a privacy-friendly
synthetically generated face dataset to train face recognition models. Towards
this end, we utilize a class-conditional generative adversarial network to

privacy aspect of using such data to train a face recognition model, we provide
extensive evaluation experiments on the identity relation between the synthetic
dataset and the original authentic dataset used to train the generative model.
Our reported evaluation proved that associating an identity of the authentic
dataset to one with the same class label in the synthetic dataset is hardly
possible. We also propose to train face recognition on our privacy-friendly
dataset, SFace, using three different learning strategies, multi-class
classification, label-free knowledge transfer, and combined learning of
multi-class classification and knowledge transfer. The reported evaluation
results on five authentic face benchmarks demonstrated that the
privacy-friendly synthetic dataset has high potential to be used for training
face recognition models, achieving, for example, a verification accuracy of
91.87\% on LFW using multi-class classification and 99.13\% using the combined
learning strategy.

particular coordinate systems that we call ideal coordinates for $\mathbf{i}$,
to construct polytopes $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{i}}_\lambda$ inside
$\mathbb{R}^{R_+}$, associated to highest weight representations $V_\lambda$ of
$GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. Here $\mathbf{i}$ is a reduced expression of the longest
element of the Weyl group and $R_+$ is the set of positive roots of $GL_n$. The
lattice points of $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{i}}_\lambda$ can be used to encode a
basis of the representation $V_\lambda$. In particular, for a specific choice
of $\mathbf{i}$, the polytope $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{i}}_\lambda$ is
unimodularly equivalent to a Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope. The construction of the
polytopes involves tropicalisation of the superpotential.
  Using work of Judd (arXiv:1606.06883) we have that there is a unique positive
critical point of the superpotential $\mathcal{W}_{t^\lambda}$ over the field
of Puiseux series. Its coordinates, in terms of the ideal coordinates for
$\mathbf{i}$, are positive in the sense of having positive leading term. The
remarkable property of our new polytopes relates to the tropical version of
this critical point, which, for every choice of $\mathbf{i}$, gives a point in
$\mathbb{R}^{R_+}$ that lies in the interior of the polytope
$\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{i}}_\lambda$. We prove that this tropical critical point
is independent of the reduced expression $\mathbf{i}$, and that it is given by
a pattern called the ideal filling for $\lambda$ that was introduced by Judd.
  Finally, combining these results with work of Rietsch (arXiv:math/0511124)
relating critical points of the superpotential with Toeplitz matrices, we show
that for a totally positive lower-triangular Toeplitz matrix over the field of
Puiseux series factorized into simple root subgroups, the valuations of the

(e.g. location data) are surging. A standard method to mitigate the privacy
risks for location data is by adding noise to the true values to achieve
geo-indistinguishability. However, we argue that geo-indistinguishability alone
is insufficient to cover all privacy concerns. In particular, isolated
locations are not protected by the state-of-the-art Laplace mechanism (LAP) for
geo-indistinguishability. We focus on a mechanism that is generated by the
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BA) from rate-distortion theory. We show that BA, in
addition to providing geo-indistinguishability, enforces an elastic metric that
ameliorates the issue of isolation. We then study the utility of BA in terms of
the statistical precision that can be derived from the reported data, focusing
on the inference of the original distribution. To this purpose, we apply the
iterative Bayesian update (IBU), an instance of the famous
expectation-maximization method from statistics, that produces the most likely
distribution for any obfuscation mechanism. We show that BA harbours a better
statistical utility than LAP for high privacy and becomes comparable as privacy
decreases. Remarkably, we point out that BA and IBU, two seemingly unrelated
methods that were developed for completely different purposes, are dual to each
other. Exploiting this duality and the privacy-preserving properties of BA, we
propose an iterative method, PRIVIC, for a privacy-friendly incremental
collection of location data from users by service providers. In addition to
extending the privacy guarantees of geo-indistinguishability and retaining a
better statistical utility than LAP, PRIVIC also provides an optimal trade-off
between information leakage and quality of service. We illustrate the soundness
and functionality of our method both analytically and with experiments.

designing a particular architecture or accessing real training data. QuantFace
introduces privacy-friendly synthetic face data to the quantization process to

Papillary Mucosal Neoplasms (IPMN), in pancreas is a challenging and complex
task, and it may lead to a more favourable outcome. Once detected, grading
IPMNs accurately is also necessary, since low-risk IPMNs can be under

before they turn into cancer. Current standards (Fukuoka and others) for IPMN
classification show significant intra- and inter-operator variability, beside
being error-prone, making a proper diagnosis unreliable. The established
progress in artificial intelligence, through the deep learning paradigm, may
provide a key tool for an effective support to medical decision for pancreatic
cancer. In this work, we follow this trend, by proposing a novel AI-based IPMN
classifier that leverages the recent success of transformer networks in
generalizing across a wide variety of tasks, including vision ones. We
specifically show that our transformer-based model exploits pre-training better
than standard convolutional neural networks, thus supporting the sought
architectural universalism of transformers in vision, including the medical
image domain and it allows for a better interpretation of the obtained results.

from 2D image collections. To induce the 3D bias, such models typically rely on
volumetric rendering, which is expensive to employ at high resolutions. During
the past months, there appeared more than 10 works that address this scaling
issue by training a separate 2D decoder to upsample a low-resolution image (or
a feature tensor) produced from a pure 3D generator. But this solution comes at
a cost: not only does it break multi-view consistency (i.e. shape and texture
change when the camera moves), but it also learns the geometry in a low
fidelity. In this work, we show that it is possible to obtain a high-resolution
3D generator with SotA image quality by following a completely different route
of simply training the model patch-wise. We revisit and improve this
optimization scheme in two ways. First, we design a location- and scale-aware
discriminator to work on patches of different proportions and spatial
positions. Second, we modify the patch sampling strategy based on an annealed
beta distribution to stabilize training and accelerate the convergence. The
resulted model, named EpiGRAF, is an efficient, high-resolution, pure 3D
generator, and we test it on four datasets (two introduced in this work) at

uncertain cues. Depending on the context, decisions may be biased towards
events that were most frequently experienced in the past, or be more
explorative. A particular type of decision making central to cognition is
sequential memory recall in response to ambiguous cues. A previously developed
spiking neuronal network implementation of sequence prediction and recall
learns complex, high-order sequences in an unsupervised manner by local,
biologically inspired plasticity rules. In response to an ambiguous cue, the
model deterministically recalls the sequence shown most frequently during
training. Here, we present an extension of the model enabling a range of
different decision strategies. In this model, explorative behavior is generated
by supplying neurons with noise. As the model relies on population encoding,
uncorrelated noise averages out, and the recall dynamics remain effectively
deterministic. In the presence of locally correlated noise, the averaging
effect is avoided without impairing the model performance, and without the need
for large noise amplitudes. We investigate two forms of correlated noise
occurring in nature: shared synaptic background inputs, and random locking of
the stimulus to spatiotemporal oscillations in the network activity. Depending
on the noise characteristics, the network adopts various replay strategies.
This study thereby provides potential mechanisms explaining how the statistics
of learned sequences affect decision making, and how decision strategies can be
adjusted after learning.

decentralized raw data stored on multiple devices to protect data privacy. Due
to the diverse capacity of the devices, FL frameworks struggle to tackle the
problems of straggler effects and outdated models. In addition, the data
heterogeneity incurs severe accuracy degradation of the global model in the FL
training process. To address aforementioned issues, we propose a hierarchical
synchronous FL framework, i.e., FedHiSyn. FedHiSyn first clusters all available
devices into a small number of categories based on their computing capacity.
After a certain interval of local training, the models trained in different
categories are simultaneously uploaded to a central server. Within a single
category, the devices communicate the local updated model weights to each other
based on a ring topology. As the efficiency of training in the ring topology
prefers devices with homogeneous resources, the classification based on the
computing capacity mitigates the impact of straggler effects. Besides, the
combination of the synchronous update of multiple categories and the device
communication within a single category help address the data heterogeneity
issue while achieving high accuracy. We evaluate the proposed framework based
on MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets and diverse heterogeneous
settings of devices. Experimental results show that FedHiSyn outperforms six
baseline methods, e.g., FedAvg, SCAFFOLD, and FedAT, in terms of training

Affinis is introduced into the system to control the zika infection by preying
on the vector. The system has six practically feasible equilibrium points where
four of them are disease-free, and the rest are endemic. We discuss the
existence and stability conditions for the equilibria. We find that when sexual
transmission of zika comes to a halt then in absence of mosquitoes infection
cannot persist. Hence, one needs to eradicate mosquitoes to eradicate
infection. Moreover, we deduce that in the case of zika infection pushing the
basic reproduction number below unity is next to impossible. Therefore, O_0,
the mosquito survival threshold parameter, and O, the mosquito survival
threshold parameter with predation play a crucial role in getting rid of the
infection in respective cases since mosquitoes cannot survive when these are
less than unity. Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of reducing mosquito
biting rate and mutual contact rates between vector and host. It exhibits the
importance of increasing the natural mortality rate of vectors to reduce the
basic reproduction number. Numerical simulation shows that when the basic
reproduction number is close but greater than unity, the introduction of a
small amount of predatory fish Gambusia Affinis can completely swipe off the
infection. In case of high transmission or high basic reproduction number, this
fish increases the susceptible human population and keeps the infection under
control, hence, prohibiting it from becoming an epidemic.

probabilities of all possible output states with time complexity
$O\left({n\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}}\right)$, linear in the number of output states
$\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}$. It outperforms the na\""ive method by an exponential
factor, and for the restricted problem of computing the probability for one
given output it matches the current state-of-the-art. Our algorithm also has
additional versatility by virtue of its use of memorisation -- the storing of
intermediate results -- which is advantageous in situations where several input
states may be of interest. Additionally it allows for hybrid simulations, in
which outputs are sampled from output states whose probability exceeds a given
threshold, or from a restricted set of states. We consider a concrete,
optimised implementation, and we benchmark the efficiency of our approach
compared to existing tools.

Data Analysis. Even though PH has been used in many different types of

is not known for which classes of problems it is most effective, or to what
extent it can detect geometric or topological features. The goal of this work
is to identify some types of problems where PH performs well or even better
than other methods in data analysis. We consider three fundamental shape
analysis tasks: the detection of the number of holes, curvature and convexity
from 2D and 3D point clouds sampled from shapes. Experiments demonstrate that
PH is successful in these tasks, outperforming several baselines, including
PointNet, an architecture inspired precisely by the properties of point clouds.
In addition, we observe that PH remains effective for limited computational
resources and limited training data, as well as out-of-distribution test data,
including various data transformations and noise. For convexity detection, we
provide a theoretical guarantee that PH is effective for this task in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, and demonstrate the detection of a convexity measure on the
FLAVIA data set of plant leaf images. Due to the crucial role of shape
classification in understanding mathematical and physical structures and
objects, and in many applications, the findings of this work will provide some
knowledge about the types of problems that are appropriate for PH, so that it

tasks. However, its central component, softmax attention, prohibits vision
transformers from scaling up to high-resolution images, due to both the
computational complexity and memory footprint being quadratic. Although linear
attention was introduced in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to mitigate
a similar issue, directly applying existing linear attention to vision
transformers may not lead to satisfactory results. We investigate this problem
and find that computer vision tasks focus more on local information compared
with NLP tasks. Based on this observation, we present a Vicinity Attention that
introduces a locality bias to vision transformers with linear complexity.
Specifically, for each image patch, we adjust its attention weight based on its
2D Manhattan distance measured by its neighbouring patches. In this case, the
neighbouring patches will receive stronger attention than far-away patches.
Moreover, since our Vicinity Attention requires the token length to be much
larger than the feature dimension to show its efficiency advantages, we further
propose a new Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT) structure to reduce the feature
dimension without degenerating the accuracy. We perform extensive experiments
on the CIFAR100, ImageNet1K, and ADE20K datasets to validate the effectiveness

computes colorings on graphs, which can often be used to detect their

computer science.
  Knowing the expressive power of a certain dimension of the algorithm usually
amounts to understanding the computed colorings. An increase in the dimension
leads to finer computed colorings and, thus, more graphs can be distinguished.
For example, on the class of planar graphs, 3-WL solves the isomorphism
problem. However, the expressive power of 2-WL on the class is poorly
understood (and, in particular, it may even well be that it decides
isomorphism).
  In this paper, we investigate the colorings computed by 2-WL on planar
graphs. Towards this end, we analyze the graphs induced by edge color classes
in the graph. Based on the obtained classification, we show that for every
3-connected planar graph, it holds that: a) after coloring all pairs with their
2-WL color, the graph has fixing number 1 with respect to 1-WL, or b) there is
a 2-WL-definable matching that can be used to transform the graph into a

We build upon the extension to the bias-variance decomposition by Pfau (2013)
in order to gain crucial insights into the behavior of ensembles of
classifiers. Introducing a dual reparameterization of the bias-variance
tradeoff, we first derive generalized laws of total expectation and variance
for nonsymmetric losses typical of classification tasks. Comparing conditional
and bootstrap bias/variance estimates, we then show that conditional estimates
necessarily incur an irreducible error. Next, we show that ensembling in dual
space reduces the variance and leaves the bias unchanged, whereas standard
ensembling can arbitrarily affect the bias. Empirically, standard ensembling
reducesthe bias, leading us to hypothesize that ensembles of classifiers may
perform well in part because of this unexpected reduction.We conclude by an
empirical analysis of recent deep learning methods that ensemble over
hyperparameters, revealing that these techniques indeed favor bias reduction.
This suggests that, contrary to classical wisdom, targeting bias reduction may
be a promising direction for classifier ensembles.

Therefore, we assume that the underlying fine-scale network is generated by the
stochastic block model (SBM) -- often studied in community detection. We then
provide an algorithm that directly estimates the average controllability of the
fine-scale system using a coarse summary of SBM. Our analysis indicates the
necessity of underlying structure (e.g., in-built communities) to be able to
quantify accurately the controllability from coarsely characterized networked
dynamics. We also compare our method to that of the reduced-order method and
highlight the regimes where both can outperform each other. Finally, we provide
simulations to confirm our theoretical results for different scalings of
network size and density, and the parameter that captures how much
community-structure is retained in the coarse summary.

appropriately, can lead to the formation of a polarization singularity in the

In this paper we derive the necessary condition to realize this effect. We
explore the phase singularity characteristics associated to this
polarization-singular field; and explore the dynamics of the singularities due
to controlled variations of the input polarization. The simulation-generated
exact field information lead to the exploration of the unique Goos-H\""anchen,
Imbert-Fedorov and spin shifts of the optical-singular fields and the
anticipation of an exact mathematical characterization of spin-orbit
interaction phenomena involved therein. The formation of a phase singularity
independent of a polarization singularity is explained subsequently.
Interrelating these seemingly unconnected beam-field phenomena and generic
optical singularities can lead to a significant and fundamental understanding
of the inhomogeneously polarized beam-field; and additionally, our singularity
generation method can find potential application in experimental
characterization of the involved dielectric media.

gained great attention. This paper presents a novel scheme to learn the mutual
benefits of different modalities to achieve better segmentation results for
unpaired multi-modal medical images. Our approach tackles two critical issues
of this task from a practical perspective: (1) how to effectively learn the
semantic consistencies of various modalities (e.g., CT and MRI), and (2) how to
leverage the above consistencies to regularize the network learning while
preserving its simplicity. To address (1), we leverage a carefully designed
External Attention Module (EAM) to align semantic class representations and
their correlations of different modalities. To solve (2), the proposed EAM is
designed as an external plug-and-play one, which can be discarded once the
model is optimized. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
method on two medical image segmentation scenarios: (1) cardiac structure
segmentation, and (2) abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Extensive results
show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts by a wide margin.

direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context,
we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as
ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide
convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when
the operator is $\xi$-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints
are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is, in
addition, L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates
for the gap function of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ for
the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the
general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Moreover, unlike
previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the
constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of
ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is
notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center,
and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint,
ACVI efficiently handles the constraints.

However, power system dynamics are not snap-shot, steady-state operations.
These dynamics must be considered to ensure that the optimal solutions provided
by these models adhere to practical dynamical constraints, avoiding frequency
fluctuations and grid instabilities. Unfortunately, dynamic system models based
on ordinary or partial differential equations are frequently unsuitable for
direct application in control or state estimates due to their high
computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
machine learning method to approximate the behavior of power systems dynamics
in near real time. The proposed framework is based on gradient-enhanced

laws governing power systems. A key characteristic of the proposed gPINN is its
ability to train without the need of generating expensive training data. The
paper illustrates the potential of the proposed approach in both forward and

Discovering these equations directly from data is challenging because it
requires modeling relationships between various derivatives that are not
observed in the data (equation-data mismatch) and it involves searching across
a huge space of possible equations. Current approaches make strong assumptions
about the form of the equation and thus fail to discover many well-known
systems. Moreover, many of them resolve the equation-data mismatch by
estimating the derivatives, which makes them inadequate for noisy and
infrequently sampled systems. To this end, we propose D-CIPHER, which is robust

CoLLie, to help D-CIPHER search through this class efficiently. Finally, we
demonstrate empirically that it can discover many well-known equations that are

efficient algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in high
dimensions. Related learning problems are often stated as variational
formulations based on associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs),
which allow the minimization of corresponding losses using gradient-based
optimization methods. In respective numerical implementations it is therefore
crucial to rely on adequate gradient estimators that exhibit low variance in
order to reach convergence accurately and swiftly. In this article, we
rigorously investigate corresponding numerical aspects that appear in the
context of linear Kolmogorov PDEs. In particular, we systematically compare
existing deep learning approaches and provide theoretical explanations for
their performances. Subsequently, we suggest novel methods that can be shown to
be more robust both theoretically and numerically, leading to substantial
performance improvements.

atmospheric remote sensing of exoplanets. Recently, ESO commissioned the
CRIRES+ high-resolution infrared spectrograph at VLT. CRIRES+ is a
cross-dispersed spectrograph with high throughput and wide wavelength coverage
across the near-infrared (0.95-5.3 $\mu$m), designed to be particularly suited
for atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets. In this work, we report early
insights into the performance of CRIRES+ for exoplanet spectroscopy and conduct
a detailed assessment of the data reduction procedure. Because of the novelty
of the instrument, we perform two independent data reduction strategies, using
the official CR2RES pipeline and our new custom-built ExoRES pipeline. Using
science verification observations we find that the spectral resolving power of
CRIRES+ can reach $R \gtrsim 100,000$ for optimal observing conditions.
Similarly, we find the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to be consistent with
expected and empirical estimates for the observations considered. As a case
study, we perform the first application of CRIRES+ to the atmospheric
characterisation of an exoplanet - the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-1 b. We detect
CO and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of MASCARA-1 b at a S/N of 12.9 and 5.3,
respectively, and a temperature inversion revealed through the CO and H$_2$O
emission lines, the first for an exoplanet. We find a combined S/N of 13.8 for
CO and H$_2$O together, with a preference for lower H$_2$O abundance compared
to CO. Our findings demonstrate the scientific potential of CRIRES+ and
highlight the excellent opportunity for high-resolution atmospheric

black holes and neutron stars. Those are the afterlives of massive stars that
formed all across the Universe - at different times and with different
metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium). Birth metallicity
plays an important role in the evolution of massive stars. Consequently, the
population properties of mergers are sensitive to the metallicity dependent
cosmic star formation history (f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z)). In particular, within the
isolated formation scenarios (the focus of this paper), a strong low
metallicity preference of the formation of mergers involving black holes was
found. The origin of this dependence and its consequences are discussed. Most
importantly, uncertainty in the f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) (substantial even at low
redshifts, especially at low metallicity) cannot be ignored in the models and
makes the interpretation of current GW observations challenging. Possible paths
for imporvements and the role of future GW detectors are considered. Recent
efforts to determine f$_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) and the factors that dominate its
uncertainty are summarized. Many of those factors are related to the properties
of galaxies that are faint and distant and therefore difficult to observe. The
fact that they leave imprint on the properties of mergers as a function of
cosmic time makes future GW observations a promising (and complementary to
electromagnetic observations) tool to study chemical evolution of galaxies.

attribute the lower precision compared to literature results to non-solar twins
contaminating our solar twin sample and recommend a 1.5 Gyr systematic
uncertainty for stellar ages derived with any [Y/Mg]-Age relation. We also
analyzed the [Y/Mg] Clock as a function of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and
metallicity individually and find no strong trends, but compute statistically
significant [Y/Mg]-Age relations for subsamples defined by ranges in
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and metallicity. Finally, we compare [Y/Mg] and
rotation ages and find statistically similar trends as for isochrone ages,
although we find that rotation ages perform better for GK dwarfs while
isochrones perform better for FG subgiants. We conclude that the [Y/Mg] Clock
is most precise for solar twins and analogs but is also a useful age diagnostic

a $\sim 0.4 M_{\odot}$ K-type secondary transferring mass through a low-state
accretion disk to a non-magnetic $\sim 0.8 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf. The
secondary is overluminous for its mass and dominates the optical spectra at all
epochs, and must be evolved to fill its Roche Lobe at this orbital period. The
X-ray luminosity $L_X \sim 1$-$2 \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ derived from both
new XMM-Newton and archival observations, although high compared to most CVs,
still only requires a modest accretion rate onto the white dwarf of $\dot{M}
\sim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ to $3 \times 10^{-10} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, lower than
expected for a cataclysmic variable with an evolved secondary. No dwarf nova
outbursts have yet been observed from the system, consistent with the low
derived mass transfer rate. Several other cataclysmic variables with similar
orbital periods also show unexpectedly low mass transfer rates, even though
selection effects disfavor the discovery of binaries with these properties.
This suggests the abundance and evolutionary state of long-period, low mass
transfer rate cataclysmic variables is worthy of additional attention.

view will typically include ~ 10 SNe Ia at observable redshifts at a range of

  (ICR)",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian Processes (GPs) are highly expressive, probabilistic models. A major
limitation is their computational complexity. Naively, exact GP inference
requires $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ computations with $N$ denoting the number of
modeled points. Current approaches to overcome this limitation either rely on
sparse, structured or stochastic representations of data or kernel respectively
and usually involve nested optimizations to evaluate a GP. We present a new,
generative method named Iterative Charted Refinement (ICR) to model GPs on
nearly arbitrarily spaced points in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time for decaying kernels
without nested optimizations. ICR represents long- as well as short-range
correlations by combining views of the modeled locations at varying resolutions
with a user-provided coordinate chart. In our experiment with points whose
spacings vary over two orders of magnitude, ICR's accuracy is comparable to
state-of-the-art GP methods. ICR outperforms existing methods in terms of
computational speed by one order of magnitude on the CPU and GPU and has
already been successfully applied to model a GP with $122$ billion parameters.

data show differences in the predicted (sub)halo mass function, especially at
sub-galactic scales, where observations are challenging due to the inefficiency
of star formation. Strong gravitational lensing has been shown to be a useful
tool for detecting dark low-mass (sub)halos through perturbations in lensing
arcs, therefore allowing the testing of different DM scenarios. However,
measuring the total mass of a perturber from strong lensing data is
challenging. Over or underestimating perturber masses can lead to incorrect
inferences about the nature of DM. In this paper, we argue that inferring an
effective slope of the dark matter density profile, which is the power-law
slope of perturbers at intermediate radii, where we expect the perturber to
have the largest observable effect, is a promising way to circumvent these
challenges. Using N-body simulations, we show that (sub)halo populations under
different DM scenarios differ in their effective density slope distributions.
Using realistic mocks of Hubble Space Telescope observations of strong lensing
images, we show that the effective density slope of perturbers can be robustly
measured with high enough accuracy to discern between different models. We also
present our measurement of the effective density slope
$\gamma=1.96\substack{+0.12 \\ -0.12}$ for the perturber in JVAS B1938+666,
which we find to be a $2\sigma$ outlier of the cold dark matter scenario. More
measurements of this kind are needed to be able to draw robust conclusions
about the nature of dark matter.

We model the coronal magnetic fields of 42 active regions and quantify the
critical height at their central polarity inversion lines throughout their
observed lifetimes. We then compare these heights to the changing magnetic flux
at the photospheric boundary and identify CMEs in these regions. Results. In
our sample, the rates of CMEs per unit time are twice as high during phases
when magnetic flux is increasing than when it is decreasing, and during those
phases of increasing flux, the rate of CMEs is 63% higher when the critical
height is rising than when it is falling. Furthermore, we support and extend
the results of previous studies by demonstrating that the critical height in
active regions is generally proportional to the separation of their magnetic
polarities through time. When the separation of magnetic polarities in an
active region increases, for example during the continuous emergence and
expansion of a magnetic bipole, the critical height also tends to increase.
Conversely, when the polarity separation decreases, for example due to the
emergence of a new, compact bipole at the central inversion line of an existing
active region or into a quiet Sun environment, the critical height tends to
decrease.

black holes (MBHs). The ensuing multi-wavelength flares are possibly the
brightest thermal transients in the Universe. TDE emission encodes the mass and
even the spin of the underlying MBH, creating tremendous potential to measure
MBH demographics, to resolve open questions on MBH origins and evolution, and
even to test fundamental physics. Unfortunately, the geometry and power source
for TDE optical/UV photospheres remain unclear, as the dynamic range of the
problem has so far prevented {\it ab initio} hydrodynamical simulations. Here
we present the first ever 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a TDE from
disruption to peak emission, with typical astrophysical parameters. The light
curve is initially powered by shocks near pericenter, with inefficient
circularization and outflow production. Early times feature a novel source of
X-ray emission. Near peak light, stream-disk interactions efficiently
circularize returning debris and power stronger outflows. The peak optical/UV
luminosities we find are typical of TDE observations. Our results show that
peak emission in ""typical"" TDEs is shock- rather than accretion-powered, but
that circularization begins to run away near peak light. This simulation shows
how deterministic predictions of TDE light curves and spectra can be calculated
before the next generation of time-domain surveys, such as VRO and {\it
ULTRASAT}. Realistic simulations are urgently needed, as the observational
sample of TDEs will soon grow from dozens to thousands of observed flares.

and gluons; the coupling strength of the interaction, $\alpha_S$, is the least
precisely-known of all interactions in nature. An extraction of the strong
coupling from the radiation pattern within jets would provide a complementary
approach to conventional extractions from jet production rates and hadronic
event shapes, and would be a key achievement of jet substructure at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). Presently, the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets
in a sample is the limiting factor in such extractions, as this fraction is
degenerate with the value of $\alpha_S$ for the most well-understood
observables. To overcome this limitation, we apply recently proposed techniques
to statistically demix multiple mixtures of jets and obtain purified quark and
gluon distributions based on an operational definition. We illustrate that
studying quark and gluon jet substructure separately can significantly improve
the sensitivity of such extractions of the strong coupling. We also discuss how
using machine learning techniques or infrared- and collinear-unsafe information
can improve the demixing performance without the loss of theoretical control.
While theoretical research is required to connect the extract topics with the
quark and gluon objects in cross section calculations, our study illustrates
the potential of demixing to reduce the dominant uncertainty for the $\alpha_S$
extraction from jet substructure at the LHC.

neutron star (NS) binaries, result in the formation of a hot, differentially
rotating NS remnant. The timescales over which differential rotation is removed
by internal angular-momentum transport processes (`viscosity') has key
implications for the remnant's long-term stability and the NS equation-of-state
(EOS). Guided by a non-rotating model of a cooling proto-NS, we estimate the
dominant sources of viscosity using an externally imposed angular velocity
profile $\Omega(r)$. Although the magnetorotational instability provides the
dominant source of effective viscosity at large radii, convection and/or the
Spruit-Tayler dynamo dominate in the core of merger remnants where $d\Omega/dr
\geq 0$. Furthermore, the viscous timescale in the remnant core is sufficiently
short that solid body rotation will be enforced faster than matter is accreted
from rotationally-supported outer layers. Guided by these results, we develop a
toy model for how the merger remnant core grows in mass and angular momentum
due to accretion. We find that merger remnants with sufficiently massive and
slowly rotating initial cores may collapse to black holes via envelope
accretion, even when the total remnant mass is less than the usually considered
threshold $\approx 1.2 M_{\rm TOV}$ for forming a stable solid-body rotating NS
remnant (where $M_{\rm TOV}$ is the maximum non-rotating NS mass supported by
the EOS). This qualitatively new picture of the post-merger remnant evolution

today's cosmological parameters exist, if one starts from matter-dominated
initial conditions. It is worth remarking that universal trajectories
compatible with observations do appear, provided that the starting point at
early times is a phase of kinetic domination. However, justifying this choice
of initial conditions on solid grounds is far from easy. We conclude by
studying Q-ball formation in this class of models and discuss constraints

lattices with tunable band gap and winding number of the flat band. Using mean
field (MF) and exact density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations,
we show explicitly how the band gap affects pairing and superconductivity (SC)
in a Hubbard model with attractive interactions. We show excellent agreement
between MF and DMRG. When a phase twist is applied on the system, a phase
difference appears between pairing order parameters on different sublattices,
and this plays a very important role in the SC density. The SC weight, $D_s$,
on the gapped topological, $W\neq0$, flat band increases linearly with
interaction strength, $U$, for low values, and with a slope that depends on the
details of the compact localized state at $U=0$. As $U\to 0$ for the gapped
non-topological flat band ($W=0$), $D_s$ decays with a power law faster than
quadratic but slower than exponential. This indicates that isolated
non-topological flat bands are less beneficial to SC. In the gapless case (flat
band touching the band above it), we find at low $U$ (both for $W=0$ and $W\neq
0$) that $D_s\propto U^\varphi$ with $\varphi<1$ contrary to the $U{\rm ln}\,
({\rm const.}/U)$ behavior reported in the literature. In other words, $D_s$
increases faster than linearly for low $U$ thus favoring SC at weak interaction
more than the gapped case. For systems with touching bands, we observe that the
one-body correlation length, $\xi$, diverges as a power law as $U\rightarrow0$,
while for the isolated flat band $\xi(U\to 0)$ is a constant smaller than one
lattice spacing. Both behaviors are distinct from the exponential divergence of
$\xi$ in the dispersive case. Our results re-establish that the BCS mean field
and quantum metric alone are insufficient to characterize SC at weak coupling.

the near future. To perform the most sensitive tests of the nature of black
holes using ringdown measurements, it is critical to compute the deviations to
the spectrum of black holes in particular extensions of relativity. These
spectral shifts are also needed to interpret any violations of the predictions
of relativity that may be detected during ringdown. Here we present a first
step towards computing the shifts to the spectrum of Kerr black holes with
arbitrary spins, by deriving a modified Teukolsky equation governing the
perturbations of black holes in theories beyond GR. Our approach applies to a
class of theories which includes dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and
shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity, in the case where the deviations
from relativity are small. This allows for a perturbative approach to solving
the equations of motion. Further, we show how to use the modified equation to
compute the leading-order spectral shifts of Kerr black holes, using eigenvalue
perturbation methods. Our formalism provides a practical approach to predicting
ringdown for black holes in a range of promising extensions to relativity,
enabling future precision searches for their signatures in black hole ringdown.

reaction of 14O on 4He in the excitation energy range from 8 to 17 MeV, using
the active target TexAT. The analysis was performed using a multi-channel

R-matrix analysis: excitation energy of the states, spin and parity as well as
partial alpha and total widths. This information is compared with theoretical
models and previous data. Clustering structures appear to be robust and mostly
isospin symmetric. A good correspondence was found between the levels in 18O

data. This comparison suggests that strongly clustered states remain organized
in relation to the corresponding reaction channel identified by the number of
nodes in the relative alpha plus core wave function. The agreement between
theory and experiment is very good and especially useful when it comes to
understanding the clustering strength distribution. The comparison of the
experimental data with theory shows that certain states, especially at high
excitation energies, are significantly more clustered than predicted. This
indicates that the structure of these states is collective and is aligned
towards the corresponding alpha reaction channel.

comparison of these data with data from different epochs it is found that the
intensity of highly-ionized emission lines has been decreasing with time, while
the emission of low-ionization lines has been increasing, confirming that the
nebula is recombining, lowering its excitation class, as a consequence of the
changes in the central star which in 2002 had an effective temperature of
60,000 K and from then it has been getting colder. The present effective
temperature of the central star is about 40,000 K. It has been suggested that
the central star has suffered a late thermal pulse and it is returning to the

elements, except He and Ne, present sub solar abundances. The comparison of the
nebular abundances with the values predicted by stellar nucleosynthesis models

by events such as supernovae and jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and

entail a rejection of classical logic. The main arguments to support this claim
come from the non-commutativity of quantum observables, which allegedly would
generate a non-distributive lattice of propositions, and from quantum
superpositions, which would entail new rules for quantum disjunctions. While
the quantum logic program is not as popular as it once was, a crucial question
remains unsettled: what is the relationship between the logical structures of
classical and quantum mechanics? In this essay we answer this question by
showing that the original arguments promoting quantum logic contain serious
flaws, and that quantum theory does satisfy the classical distributivity law
once the full meaning of quantum propositions is properly taken into account.
Moreover, we show that quantum mechanics can generate a distributive lattice of
propositions, which, unlike the one of quantum logic, includes statements about
expectation values which are of undoubtable physical interest. Lastly, we show
that the lattice of statistical propositions in classical mechanics follows the
same structure, yielding an analogue non-commutative sublattice of classical
propositions. This fact entails that the purported difference between classical
and quantum logic stems from a misconstructed parallel between the two
theories.

However, their coherence times are still limited and exhibit temporal
fluctuations. Those phenomena are often attributed to the coupling between

two-level systems (TLSs). Among them, charge fluctuators inside amorphous oxide
layers contribute to both low-frequency $1/f$ charge noise and high-frequency
dielectric loss, causing fast qubit dephasing and relaxation. Moreover,
spectral diffusion from mutual TLS interactions varies the noise amplitude over
time, fluctuating the qubit lifetime. Here, we propose to mitigate those
harmful effects by engineering the relevant TLS noise spectral densities.
Specifically, our protocols smooth the high-frequency noise spectrum and
suppress the low-frequency noise amplitude via depolarizing and dephasing the
TLSs, respectively. As a result, we predict a drastic stabilization in qubit
lifetime and an increase in qubit pure dephasing time. Our detailed analysis of
feasible experimental implementations shows that the improvement is not
compromised by spurious coupling from the applied noise to the qubit.

autonomously discover novel semantic classes and improve accuracy on known
classes when exploring an unknown environment. To this end, we develop a
general framework for mapping and clustering that we then use to generate a
self-supervised learning signal to update a semantic segmentation model. In
particular, we show how clustering parameters can be optimized during
deployment and that fusion of multiple observation modalities improves novel
object discovery compared to prior work. Models, data, and implementations can

non-invasive bio-signals, which are widely used in human machine interface
(HMI) technologies (EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigm) for the rehabilitation of
physically disabled people. Successful decoding of EEG and EMG signals into
respective control command is a pivotal step in the rehabilitation process.
Recently, several Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architectures are
proposed that directly map the raw time-series signal into decision space and
the process of meaningful features extraction and classification are performed
simultaneously. However, these networks are tailored to the learn the expected
characteristics of the given bio-signal and are limited to single paradigm. In
this work, we addressed the question that can we build a single architecture
which is able to learn distinct features from different HMI paradigms and still
successfully classify them. Approach: In this work, we introduce a single
hybrid model called ConTraNet, which is based on CNN and Transformer
architectures that is equally useful for EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms.
ConTraNet uses CNN block to introduce inductive bias in the model and learn
local dependencies, whereas the Transformer block uses the self-attention
mechanism to learn the long-range dependencies in the signal, which are crucial
for the classification of EEG and EMG signals. Main results: We evaluated and
compared the ConTraNet with state-of-the-art methods on three publicly
available datasets which belong to EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms. ConTraNet
outperformed its counterparts in all the different category tasks (2-class,
3-class, 4-class, and 10-class decoding tasks). Significance: The results
suggest that ConTraNet is robust to learn distinct features from different HMI
paradigms and generalizes well as compared to the current state of the art
algorithms.

electrolysis which is cleaner. The relative cost and carbon intensity of
hydrogen production through SMR and electrolysis vary throughout the United
States because of differences in the grid. While many hydrogen cost models
exist, no regional hydrogen study has been conducted across the US. We studied
how the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) and carbon intensity for producing
hydrogen vary across the US. We looked at electrolysis technologies (Alkaline,
PEM, and SOEC) and compared them to SMR. In 2020, SMR with 90 percent CCUS has
a lower average LCOH and carbon intensity for hydrogen production than
electrolysis by SOEC. For states with cleaner grids, hydrogen produced through
SOEC has a lower carbon intensity than hydrogen produced using SMR with 90
percent CCUS. Washington has one of the lowest carbon footprints and the lowest
LCOH to produce hydrogen through electrolysis (alkaline). We predict that the
LCOH for hydrogen production will be 3.2 USD per kg for Alkaline, 3.1 USD per
kg for PEM, and 2.6 USD per kg for SOEC by 2050 with constant electricity
prices. These projected LCOHs are still higher than the LCOH for hydrogen
produced through SMR with 90 percent CCUS. If electricity costs decrease to 2c

inductive biases inherent to convolutional neural networks allow for
translation equivariance through kernels acting parallely to the horizontal and

death worldwide, among which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection.
The unavailability of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most
of these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force public health
officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by
reliable and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate forecasts of epidemics
can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination
campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand,
which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately,
most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary
characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent
variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyse a wide variety of
epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it EWNet model.
MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal
dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the nonlinear forecasting
scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet
network framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the
asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic
behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the
effect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposal.
From a practical perspective, we compare our proposed EWNet framework with
several statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Experimental
results show that the proposed EWNet is highly competitive compared to the
state-of-the-art epidemic forecasting methods.

progression in PD. These models, which employ connectivity calculated from
noninvasively measured functional MRI, differentially predict between PD and
the atypical lookalikes, predict progression on a disease-specific scale, and
predict cognitive decline. Further, we identify the connections most

progression in the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive assessment

range correlations (SRC) based on the nuclear scale separation. Specifically,
the entanglement between the SRC orbitals and the rest of the system. It should
be stressed that this is a single nucleon not a pair entanglement entropy
between the proton and neutron. The entanglement arises from the probability
for a nucleon to occupy a momentum state above the Fermi momentum. We separate
the momentum space of the nucleus into two parts such that nucleons can occupy
the meanfield part of the wave function, i.e. Fermi sea (FS) and separately the
high-momentum SRC part. The orbital entropy we obtain is between these two
parts where we essentially define two momentum subspaces, one containing all
the low momentum FS states and the other the high-momentum part as a SRC
""orbital"" state. For the calculation we employ the decoupling of low and
high-momenta which was established by the similarity normalization group the
SRC is viewed as a further ""orbital"" which can be multiply occupied. Since the
probability of the occupation of a single SRC is given by the nuclear contact
we are able to obtain a simple general expression of the orbital entanglement
entropy for SRC by employing the generalized contact formalism. This general
formula for the SRC orbital entanglement entropy of a nuclear structure in
terms of the nuclear contact, allows us to obtain the scaling of the entropy in
terms the mass number, $A$. We find that, unlike the entanglement entropy of
many quantum systems which scales with the surface area, the orbital
entanglement entropy associated with the SRC in large nuclei is linearly
dependent on $A$, i.e., it is shown to be extensive.

is primarily due to the limited availability of dedicated satellite ground
stations that tend to be bulky to deploy and expensive to rent. This paper
explores using LoRa radios in the ISM band for low-latency downlink
communication from CubeSats, primarily due to the availability of extensive
ground LoRa infrastructure and minimal interference to terrestrial
communication. However, the limited bandwidth of LoRa precludes rich satellite
Earth images to be sent - instead, the CubeSats can at best send short messages
(a few hundred bytes).
  This paper details our experience in communicating with a LoRa-enabled
CubeSat launched by our team. We present Vista, a communication system that
makes software modifications to LoRa encoding onboard a CubeSat and decoding on
commercial LoRa ground stations to allow for satellite imagery to be
communicated, as well as wide-ranging machine learning inference on these
images. This is achieved through a LoRa-channel-aware image encoding that is
informed by the structure of satellite images, the tasks performed on it, as
well as the Doppler variation of satellite signals. A detailed evaluation of
Vista through trace-driven emulation with traces from the LoRa-CubeSat launch

Whenever necessary, its low computational overhead is usually achieved by
strict working limits. PaPILO's parallelization framework aims at reducing the

presolve reductions, PaPILO uses a transaction-based design. This helps to
avoid both the memory-intensive allocation of multiple copies of the problem

combination of these results yields $2^{\aleph_0}$ pairwise non-equivalent

many functional materials, and especially semiconductors, are heavily
engineered alloys or solid solutions of multiple compounds rather than a single

work we propose a framework and open-source code to automatically construct
possible ""alloy pairs"" and ""alloy systems"" and detect ""alloy members"" from a

requiring any additional metadata beyond their crystal structure. We provide
analysis tools to estimate stability across each alloy. As a demonstration, we
apply this framework to all inorganic materials in the Materials Project

that can then be used in materials discovery studies to search for materials
with tunable properties. This new database has been incorporated into the

  Estimation Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), an agent learns from a set of
training tasks how to quickly solve a new task, drawn from the same task
distribution. The optimal meta RL policy, a.k.a. the Bayes-optimal behavior, is
well defined, and guarantees optimal reward in expectation, taken with respect
to the task distribution. The question we explore in this work is how many
training tasks are required to guarantee approximately optimal behavior with
high probability. Recent work provided the first such PAC analysis for a
model-free setting, where a history-dependent policy was learned from the
training tasks. In this work, we propose a different approach: directly learn
the task distribution, using density estimation techniques, and then train a
policy on the learned task distribution. We show that our approach leads to
bounds that depend on the dimension of the task distribution. In particular, in
settings where the task distribution lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we
extend our analysis to use dimensionality reduction techniques and account for
such structure, obtaining significantly better bounds than previous work, which
strictly depend on the number of states and actions. The key of our approach is
the regularization implied by the kernel density estimation method. We further
demonstrate that this regularization is useful in practice, when `plugged in'
the state-of-the-art VariBAD meta RL algorithm.

reflect how the mean outcome in a population or subpopulation would change if
all units received treatment versus control. Real-world policy changes,
however, are often incremental, changing the treatment status for only a small
segment of the population who are at or near ""the margin of participation."" To
capture this notion, two parallel lines of inquiry have developed in economics
and in statistics and epidemiology that define, identify, and estimate what we
call interventional effects. In this article, we bridge these two strands of
literature by defining interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a
treatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and marginal interventional
effect (MIE) as its limit when the size of the intervention approaches zero.
The IE and MIE can be viewed as the unconditional counterparts of the
policy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) proposed in
the economics literature. However, different from PRTE and MPRTE, IE and MIE
are defined without reference to a latent index model, and, as we show, can be
identified either under unconfoundedness or through the use of instrumental
variables. For both scenarios, we show that MIEs are typically identified
without the strong positivity assumption required of the ATE, highlight several
""stylized interventions"" that may be of particular interest in policy analysis,
discuss several parametric and semiparametric estimation strategies, and
illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example.

finite volume discretization and is also automatically differentiable like

testing, with many known test statistics, including ones based on counting
collisions, singletons, and the empirical TV distance. It is known that the
optimal sample complexity to distinguish the uniform distribution on $m$
elements from any $\epsilon$-far distribution with $1-\delta$ probability is $n
= \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{m \log (1/\delta)}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{\log
(1/\delta)}{\epsilon^2}\right)$, which is achieved by the empirical TV tester.
Yet in simulation, these theoretical analyses are misleading: in many cases,
they do not correctly rank order the performance of existing testers, even in
an asymptotic regime of all parameters tending to $0$ or $\infty$.
  We explain this discrepancy by studying the \emph{constant factors} required
by the algorithms. We show that the collisions tester achieves a sharp maximal
constant in the number of standard deviations of separation between uniform and
non-uniform inputs. We then introduce a new tester based on the Huber loss, and
show that it not only matches this separation, but also has tails corresponding
to a Gaussian with this separation. This leads to a sample complexity of $(1 +

sub-exponentially in $R$ at log-asymptotic rate $c_\alpha (\ell_c-\ell)^2 /

compared to that of the Ising RBM form usually studied. We obtain explicit
expressions for the expectation and variance of the lattice-gas RBM log
partition function per node in the thermodynamic limit. We also obtain explicit
expressions for the leading order finite size correction to the expected log
partition function per node, and the threshold for the stability of the
replica-symmetric approximation. We show that the stability threshold of the
replica-symmetric approximation is equivalent, in the thermodynamic limit, to
the stability threshold of a recent message-passing algorithm used to construct
a mean-field Bethe approximation to the RBM free energy. Given the
replica-symmetry assumption breaks down as the level of disorder in the
spin-spin couplings increases, we obtain asymptotic expansions, in terms of the
variance controlling this disorder, for the replica-symmetric log partition
function and the replica-symmetric stability threshold. We confirm the various
results derived using simulation.

accretion rates is unclear. It has been suggested that low-power jets may
explain the observed radiation at sub-parsec scales. The mechanisms for jet
formation at super-Eddington rates, however, are not well understood. On the
same scale, clouds from the broad-line region (BLR) propagating with supersonic
velocities in the wind launched by the accretion disk may lead to the
production of nonthermal radiation. We aim to characterize the nonthermal
emission produced by the propagation of clouds through the wind of the
accretion disk in super-accreting AGNs and to estimate the relevance of such
contribution to the radio band of the electromagnetic spectrum. We determine
the conditions under which the BLR clouds are not destroyed by shocks or
hydrodynamic instabilities when immersed in the powerful wind of the accretion
disk. These clouds form bowshocks that are suitable sites for particle
acceleration. We develop a semianalytical model to calculate the distribution
of relativistic particles in these bowshocks and the associated spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the emitted radiation. For typical parameters of
super-accreting AGNs, we find that the cloud-wind interactions can produce
nonthermal emission from radio up to a few tens of TeV, with slight absorption
effects, if the processes occur outside the wind photosphere. Radio emission in
AGNs without jets can be explained if the accretion rate is super-Eddington and
there is a broad-line region at sub-parsec scales around the central black
hole. The accretion rate must not be extremely high so most of the clouds orbit
outside of the wind photosphere and the radiation can escape to the observer.

are grouped. The morphology of a sample of 43 groupings containing 174
magnetized radio filaments are presented. Many grouped filaments show
harp-like, fragmented cometary tail-like, or loop-like structures in contrast
to many straight filaments running mainly perpendicular to the Galactic plane.
There are many striking examples of a single filament splitting into two prongs
at a junction, suggestive of a flow of plasma along the filaments. Spatial
variations in spectral index, brightness, bending and sharpening along the
filaments indicate that they are evolving on a 10^{5-6}-year time scale. The
mean spacings between parallel filaments in a given grouping peaks at
$\sim16''$. We argue by modeling that the filaments in a grouping all lie on
the same plane and that the groupings are isotropically oriented in 3D space.
One candidate for the origin of filamentation is interaction with an obstacle,
which could be a compact radio source, before a filament splits and bends into
multiple filaments. In this picture, the obstacle or sets the length scale of
the separation between the filaments. Another possibility is synchrotron
cooling instability occurring in cometary tails formed as a result of the
interaction of cosmic-ray driven Galactic center outflow with obstacles such as
stellar winds. In this picture, the mean spacing and the mean width of the
filaments are expected to be a fraction of a parsec, consistent with observed
spacing.

after an image underwent strong compression, most of the high frequency
artifacts are not available anymore. In this work, we explore an alternative
approach to splicing detection, which is potentially better suited for images
in-the-wild, subject to strong compression and downsampling. Our proposal is to
model the color formation of an image. The color formation largely depends on
variations at the scale of scene objects, and is hence much less dependent on
high-frequency artifacts. We learn a deep metric space that is on one hand
sensitive to illumination color and camera white-point estimation, but on the
other hand insensitive to variations in object color. Large distances in the
embedding space indicate that two image regions either stem from different
scenes or different cameras. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed
embedding space outperforms the state of the art on images that have been
subject to strong compression and downsampling. We confirm in two further
experiments the dual nature of the metric space, namely to both characterize
the acquisition camera and the scene illuminant color. As such, this work
resides at the intersection of physics-based and statistical forensics with

empower derivative-based algorithms in many applications, e.g., Bayesian
inverse problems, optimization under parameter uncertainty, and optimal
experimental design. The major difficulties include the computational cost of
generating derivative training data and the high dimensionality of the problem
leading to large training cost. To address these challenges, we exploit the
intrinsic low-dimensionality of the derivatives and develop algorithms for
compressing derivative information and efficiently imposing it in neural
operator training yielding derivative-informed neural operators. We demonstrate
that these advances can significantly reduce the costs of both data generation

parametric PDE maps), making the costs marginal or comparable to the costs
without using derivatives, and in particular independent of the discretization
dimension of the input and output functions. Moreover, we show that the

  In the present work, we use the subleading asymptotics in this Weyl law to
learn more about the algebraic structure of these homeomorphism groups in the

kernel of the Calabi homomorphism on the group of hameomorphisms is not simple,
answering an old question of Oh and M\""uller; this contrasts the smooth case,
where the kernel of Calabi is simple. We similarly show that the group of
hameomorphisms of the two-sphere is not simple. Related considerations allow us
to extend the Calabi homomorphism to the full group of compactly supported
area-preserving homeomorphisms, answering a longstanding question of Fathi. In
fact, we produce infinitely many distinct extensions.
  Central to the applications is that we show that the subleading asymptotics
for smooth, possibly time-dependent, Hamiltonians are always $O(1)$, and for
certain autonomous maps recover the Ruelle invariant. The construction of a
hameomorphism with ""infinite Ruelle invariant"" then shows that a normal

propagating in opposite directions along the same meridian inform us about
horizontal flows in the north-south direction. The longitudinal averages of the
north-south helioseismic travel-time shifts vary with the sunspot cycle. Aims.
We aim to study the contribution of inflows into solar active regions to this
solar-cycle variation. Methods. To do so, we identify the local flows around
active regions in the horizontal flow maps obtained from correlation tracking
of granulation in SDO/HMI continuum images. We compute the forward-modeled
travel-time perturbations caused by these inflows using 3D sensitivity kernels.
In order to compare with the observations, we average these forward-modeled
travel-time perturbations over longitude and time in the same way as the
measured travel times. Results. The forward-modeling approach shows that the
inflows associated with active regions may account for only a fraction of the
solar-cycle variations in the north-south travel-time measurements.
Conclusions. The travel-time perturbations caused by the large-scale inflows
surrounding the active regions do not explain in full the solar-cycle
variations seen in the helioseismic measurements of the meridional circulation.

ensure data privacy while allowing for efficient querying. This work proposes a
definition and components of a new secure and efficient outsourced database
system, which answers various types of queries, with different privacy
guarantees in different security models. This work starts with the survey of
five order-revealing encryption schemes that can be used directly in many
database indices and five range query protocols with various security /
efficiency tradeoffs. The survey systematizes the state-of-the-art range query
solutions in a snapshot adversary setting and offers some non-obvious
observations regarding the efficiency of the constructions. In
$\mathcal{E}\text{psolute}$, a secure range query engine, security is achieved
in a setting with a much stronger adversary where she can continuously observe
everything on the server, and leaking even the result size can enable a
reconstruction attack. $\mathcal{E}\text{psolute}$ proposes a definition,
construction, analysis, and experimental evaluation of a system that provably
hides both access pattern and communication volume while remaining efficient.
The work concludes with $k\text{-a}n\text{o}n$ -- a secure similarity search
engine in a snapshot adversary model. The work presents a construction in which
the security of $k\text{NN}$ queries is achieved similarly to OPE / ORE

are perturbed, but the query algorithm still produces accurate results. We use
TREC datasets and queries for the search, and track the rank quality metrics
such as MRR and nDCG. For the attacks, we build an LSTM model that trains on
the correlation between a sentence and its embedding and then predicts words
from the embedding.

  Neuroimaging Data",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the dynamics of functional brain connectivity patterns using
noninvasive neuroimaging techniques is an important focus in human
neuroscience. Vector autoregressive (VAR) processes and Granger causality
analysis (GCA) have been extensively used for this purpose. While
high-resolution multi-subject neuroimaging data are routinely collected
now-a-days, the statistics literature on VAR models has remained heavily
focused on small-to-moderate dimensional problems and single-subject data.
Motivated by these issues, we develop a novel Bayesian random effects panel VAR
model for multi-subject high-dimensional neuroimaging data. We begin with a
single-subject model that structures the VAR coefficients as a three-way
tensor, then reduces the dimensions by applying a Tucker tensor decomposition.
A novel sparsity-inducing shrinkage prior allows data-adaptive rank and lag
selection. We then extend the approach to a novel random effects model for
multi-subject data that carefully avoids the dimensions getting exploded with
the number of subjects but also flexibly accommodates subject-specific
heterogeneity. We design a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior
computation. Finally, GCA with posterior false discovery control is performed
on the posterior samples. The method shows excellent empirical performance in
simulation experiments. Applied to our motivating functional magnetic resonance
imaging study, the approach allows the directional connectivity of human brain
networks to be studied in fine detail, revealing meaningful but previously
unsubstantiated cortical connectivity patterns.

frameworks with symmetry. While group-theoretic methods for bifurcation
problems with symmetry are well known, their actual implementation in the
context of elastic frameworks is not straightforward. We consider frames
comprising assemblages of Cosserat rods, and the main difficulty arises from
the nonlinear configuration space, due to the presence of (cross-sectional)
rotation fields. We avoid this via a single-rod formulation, developed earlier
by one of the authors, whereby the governing equations are embedded in a linear
space. The field equations comprise the assembly of all rod equations,
supplemented by compatibility and equilibrium conditions at the joints. We
demonstrate their equivariance under the symmetry-group action, and the
implementation of group-theoretic methods is now natural within the
linear-space context. All potential generic, symmetry-breaking bifurcations are
predicted apriori. We then employ an open-source path-following code, which can
detect and compute simple, onedimensional bifurcations; multiple bifurcation
points are beyond its capabilities. For the latter, we construct
symmetry-reduced problems implemented by appropriate substructures. Multiple
bifurcations are rendered simple, and the path-following code is again
applicable. We first analyze a simple tripod framework, providing all details
of our methodology. We then treat a hexagonal space frame via the same
approach. The tripod and the hexagonal dome both exhibit simple and double
bifurcation points.

actuator designs with internal air cells is explored via simulation. The
actuators are parameterized by the number of cells and their width. Physically
viable actuator variants identified through the simulation are further tested
via hardware experiments. Two designs are selected and tested on a custom-built
physical model based on an infant's body anthropometrics. Comparisons between
force exerted to lift the arm, movement smoothness, path length and maximum

calculations, we investigate the properties of the spin-polarization texture in
momentum space in the prototype 2D centrosymmetric ferromagnetic (FM) bilayer
of CrI$_3$, with perpendicular magnetization. The FM bilayer displays a rich
in-plane spin texture in its highest valence bands. We show the existence of
two distinct spin canting effects, which result from the coupling of FM order
with structural chirality and electric polarization, in establishing the
in-plane spin texture. The first effect is generated by the chirality of the
layer stacking and the spin-orbit-polarized nature of the valence states, and
yields the same canting on both layers. The second effect is a Rashba-related
effect, which in a centrosymmetric ferromagnet induces in a single electronic
state two opposite spin-canted components on the two layers. Furthermore, using
the FM bilayer as an example, we provide general rules imposed by
magnetic-space-group symmetries on spin-polarization vectors, serving as
guidelines for the shape of the spin texture in the Brillouin zone of magnetic
crystals. Finally, we show that the above effects can be effectively used to
manipulate the spin texture via compressive strain, which induces in the FM

perspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the
explosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the
resulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of
the planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by
effectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand,
model-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact
dynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical
equivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and
empirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further
alleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and
quasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both
smoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective
for contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show
that classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in
global planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our
method on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we
demonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results
comparable to RL with dramatically less computation. Video:

electrodynamics (QED). However, due to the smallness of the signal,
conventional magnet-based and extremely intense laser-driven detection methods
are still very challenging. This is because in the first case the interaction
length is large but the field is limited, and vice versa in the second case. We
put forward a method to generate and detect VB in a plasma bubble wakefield,
which combines both advantages, providing large fields along large interaction
lengths. A polarized $\gamma$-photon beam is considered to probe the wakefield
along a propagation distance of millimeters to centimeters in the plasma
bubble. We find via plasma particle-in-cell simulations that the VB signal in
terms of Stokes parameters can reach about $ 10^{-5}$ ($10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$) for
tens of MeV (GeV) probe photons with moderately intense lasers
($10^{20}$-$10^{21}~\mathrm{W/cm^2}$). The main source of noise from plasma
electrons is mitigated, in particular, by a choice of $\gamma$-photon
polarization and by proper modulation of the plasma density. The proposed
method represents an attractive alternative for the experimental observation of
VB via laser-plasma interaction.

improved forecasting of the power generation of these systems at different time

depends on the resolution and horizon. Forecast combinations (ensembles), that
combine the forecasts of multiple models into a single forecast may be robust
in such cases. Therefore, in this paper, we provide comparisons and insights
into the performance of five state-of-the-art forecast models and existing
forecast combinations at multiple resolutions and horizons. We propose a
forecast combination approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that
will enable a forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for the task at hand by
weighting the forecasts produced by individual models. Furthermore, we compare
the performance of the proposed combination approach with existing forecast
combination approaches. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using a
real-world residential PV power data set measured at 25 houses located in three
locations in the United States. The results across four different resolutions
and four different horizons show that the PSO-based forecast combination
approach outperforms the use of any individual forecast model and other
forecast combination counterparts, with an average Mean Absolute Scaled Error
reduction by 3.81% compared to the best performing individual model. Our
approach enables a solar forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for their
application regardless of the forecast resolution or horizon.

concept of sensor observability index. The goal is to analyse and evaluate the
performance of distributed directional or axial-based sensors to observe
specific axes in task space as a function of joint configuration in serial
robot manipulators. For example, joint torque sensors are often used in serial
robot manipulators and assumed to be perfectly capable of estimating end
effector forces, but certain joint configurations may cause one or more
task-space axes to be unobservable as a result of how the joint torque sensors
are aligned. The proposed sensor observability provides a method to analyse the
quality of the current robot configuration to observe the task space. Parallels
are drawn between sensor observability and the traditional kinematic Jacobian
for the particular case of joint torque sensors in serial robot manipulators.
Although similar information can be retrieved from kinematic analysis of the
Jacobian transpose in serial manipulators, sensor observability is shown to be
more generalizable in terms of analysing non-joint-mounted sensors and other
sensor types. In addition, null-space analysis of the Jacobian transpose is
susceptible to false observability singularities. Simulations and experiments
using the robot Baxter demonstrate the importance of maintaining proper sensor
observability in physical interactions.

galaxies often rely on array of indirect observational tracers in preselection
of candidate leakers.
  Aims: Here, we investigate how much ionizing radiation might be missed due to
these selection criteria by completely removing them and performing a search
selected purely from rest-frame LyC emission; and how that affects our
estimates of the ionizing background.
  Methods: We invert the conventional method and perform a bottom-up search for
Lyman-continuum leaking galaxies at redshifts $2 < z < 3.5$. Using archival
data from HST and VLT/MUSE, we run source finding software on UV-filter HST
images from the HUDF, and subject all detected sources to a series of tests to
eliminate those that are inconsistent with being ionizing sources.
  Results: We find 6 new and one previously identified candidate leakers with
absolute escape fractions ranging from 36% to 100%. Our filtering criteria
eliminate one object previously reported as a candidate ionizing emitter in the
literature, while we report non-detection in the rest frame Lyman continuum of
two other previously reported sources. We find that our candidates make a
contribution to the metagalactic ionizing field of $\log_{10}(\epsilon_{\nu}) =
25.32(+0.25)(-0.21)$ and $25.29(+0.27)(-0.22)$ erg/s/Hz/cMpc$^3$ for the full
set of candidates and for the 4 strongest candidates only; both values are
higher than but consistent with other recent figures in the literature.
  Conclusions: Our findings suggest that galaxies that do not meet the usual
selection criteria may make a non-negligible contribution to the cosmic
ionizing field. We recommend that similar searches be carried out on a larger
scale in well-studied fields with both UV and large ancillary data coverage,
for example in the full set of CANDELS fields.

the condition for classical-quantum part of conditional mutual information is
obtained by considering the multipartite quantum discord and the

quantum discord of state extensions to the multipatite setting, so as to derive
a generalized Koashi-Winter-type monogamy equality for conditional mutual

slice-to-volume registration and update the volume and transformations
alternately to improve accuracy. Results on synthetic data show that our method
achieves lower registration error and better reconstruction quality compared
with existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments with real-world MRI data
are also performed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to improve

the transition probability of the TLS due to interaction with a multi-particle

efficient adversarial examples to evade human-eye perception and make objects

pre-trained models, which learned knowledge from large-scale general corpora,
have shown much success in software engineering tasks.
  In this work, we make the first attempt to fine-tune BART, which has been

parameters of a descriptor system based on its frequency response samples. Two
metrics are suggested respectively for measuring absolute and relative
sloppiness of the parameter vector at a prescribed value. In this descriptor
system, system matrices are assumed to depend on its parameters through a
linear fractional transformation (LFT). When an associated transfer function
matrix (TFM) is of full normal row rank, a matrix rank based necessary and
sufficient condition is derived for parameter identifiability with a set of
finitely many frequency responses. This condition can be verified recursively
which is computationally quite appealing, especially when the system is of a
large scale. From this condition, an algorithm is suggested to find a set of
frequencies with which the frequency responses of the system are capable to
uniquely determine its parameters. An ellipsoid approximation is given for the
set consisting of all the parameter values with which the associated descriptor
system has a frequency response that deviates within a prescribed distance,
from that corresponding to a globally identifiable parameter vector value.

with markedly different periods because their centers of mass are radially

wisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module
to obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a
contrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain
discriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in
the latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast
anomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement
module (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual
defects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to
reconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection
performance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect
restoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to
achieve noise-robust defect localization. We verify our method through
extensive experiments and test its practical deployment in collaborative
edge--cloud intelligent manufacturing scenarios by means of a multilevel

(e.g.,) the deployment of recommender systems. Recent studies bring proximity
graph-based methods into practitioners' attention -- proximity graph-based
methods outperform other solutions such as quantization, hashing, and
tree-based ANN algorithm families. In current recommendation systems, data
point insertions, deletions, and queries are streamed into the system in an
online fashion as users and items change dynamically. As proximity graphs are
constructed incrementally by inserting data points as new vertices into the
graph, online insertions and queries are well-supported in proximity graph.
However, a data point deletion incurs removing a vertex from the proximity
graph index, while no proper graph index updating mechanisms are discussed in
previous studies. To tackle the challenge, we propose an incremental proximity
graph maintenance (IPGM) algorithm for online ANN. IPGM supports both vertex
deletion and insertion on proximity graphs. Given a vertex deletion request, we
thoroughly investigate solutions to update the connections of the vertex. The
proposed updating scheme eliminates the performance drop in online ANN methods
on proximity graphs, making the algorithm suitable for practical systems.

works to create moir\'e patterns have been focused on a twist embedded inside
channel materials or between channel and substrate. However, the effects of a
twist inside the substrate materials on the unaligned channel materials are
much less explored. In this work, we report the realization of superlattice
multi-Dirac cones with the coexistence of the main Dirac cone in a monolayer

substrate. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of three pairs of
superlattice Dirac points around the pristine Dirac cone, featuring multiple
metallic or insulating states surrounding the charge neutrality point (CNP).
Displacement field tunable and electron-hole asymmetric Fermi velocities are
indicated from temperature dependent measurements, along with the gapless
dispersion of superlattice Dirac cones. The experimental observation of
multiple Dirac cones in MLG/tBN heterostructure is supported by band structure
calculations employing periodic moir\'e potential. Our results unveil the

large weights to them when training the main classifier. The committee is
learned as a bootstrapped ensemble so that a majority of its classifiers are
biased as well as being diverse, and intentionally fail to predict classes of
bias-conflicting data accordingly. The consensus within the committee on
prediction difficulty thus provides a reliable cue for identifying and
weighting bias-conflicting data. Moreover, the committee is also trained with
knowledge transferred from the main classifier so that it gradually becomes
debiased along with the main classifier and emphasizes more difficult data as
training progresses. On five real-world datasets, our method outperforms prior

used to assign stress labels (two- and three classes). Time (four from GSR and
PPG signals) and frequency (four from EEG signal) domain features are
extracted. Among EEG based features, using a frequency band selection algorithm
for selecting the optimum EEG frequency subband, the theta band was selected.
Further, a wrapper-based method is used for optimal feature selection. Human
stress level classification is performed using three different classifiers,

We highlight that XAI is not a monolithic set of technologies -- researchers
and practitioners have begun to leverage XAI algorithms to build XAI systems
that serve different usage contexts, such as model debugging and
decision-support. Algorithmic research of XAI, however, often does not account
for these diverse downstream usage contexts, resulting in limited effectiveness

practitioners to make technical choices. We argue that one way to close the gap
is to develop evaluation methods that account for different user requirements
in these usage contexts. Towards this goal, we introduce a perspective of
contextualized XAI evaluation by considering the relative importance of XAI
evaluation criteria for prototypical usage contexts of XAI. To explore the
context dependency of XAI evaluation criteria, we conduct two survey studies,
one with XAI topical experts and another with crowd workers. Our results urge
for responsible AI research with usage-informed evaluation practices, and
provide a nuanced understanding of user requirements for XAI in different usage

ML models are deployed on edge devices. However, running common ML models on
edge devices continuously may generate excessive heat from the computation,
forcing the device to ""slow down"" to prevent overheating, a phenomenon called
thermal throttling. This paper studies the impact of thermal throttling on
mobile phones: when it occurs, the CPU clock frequency is reduced, and the
model inference latency may increase dramatically. This unpleasant inconsistent
behavior has a substantial negative effect on user experience, but it has been
overlooked for a long time. To counter thermal throttling, we propose to
utilize dynamic networks with shared weights and dynamically shift between
large and small ML models seamlessly according to their thermal profile, i.e.,
shifting to a small model when the system is about to throttle. With the
proposed dynamic shifting, the application runs consistently without
experiencing CPU clock frequency degradation and latency increase. In addition,
we also study the resulting accuracy when dynamic shifting is deployed and show
that our approach provides a reasonable trade-off between model latency and

observed remarkably anisotropic thermal expansion with a c-axis negative
thermal expansion constant of {\alpha}c < -15 {\mu}K-1 in a wide temperature
range of T = 50-573 K. With decreasing temperature, the lattice constant a
decreases, while the lattice constant c continuously increases in CoZr2. The
origin of the anisotropic shrinkage/expansion of the a-axis/c-axis by cooling
is explained by the small change in the Co-Zr bond and the systematic decrease
in the Zr-Co-Zr angle. Similar thermal expansion was observed in alloyed
systems, (Fe,Co,Ni)Zr2 and (Fe,Co,Ni,Rh,Ir)Zr2, which suggests that the
phenomenon is common feature in the TrZr2 system. We propose that zero-thermal

black hole with non-vanishing dilaton and axion charges. The near-horizon
geometry of extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen spacetime possesses the $SL(2,R) \times U
(1)$ isometry allowing to employ the asymptotic symmetry group method to find
the corresponding central charge. We find two different branches of the mass
which correspond to CFT with two different central charges $c_L=12am_+$ and
$c_L=12am_-$. The exact agreement between the Bekenstain-Hawking entropy and
entropy from CFT is then found also in two different branches of extremal
entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this duality is robust insofar for
non-zero AdS length. We show that the duality holds for both dyonic
Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart. In both cases, we
obtain the expected entropy from CFT which matches exactly with the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Since dyonic and axion charges are proportional to
$1/m$, we note that there are possibly more than two branches of the central
charge for non-zero AdS length in terms of mass. When we turn off dyonic
charge, the axion charge vanishes showing the results of Kerr-Sen-AdS black
hole. Moreover, when we assume the equal electromagnetic charges, it recovers
the results when the dilaton charge vanishes. In the end, we compare the
results of dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart to
those of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole and the ultraspinning
counterpart. Depending on the dyonic charge parameters, it is found that
extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole is not always
superentropic.

significant deficit of HI absorption within a few Mpc of quasars along

the transverse direction is shadowed from the quasar UV radiation due to dust
torus. However, a critical weakness of this idea is that we have no information
on inclination angle of our sightline relative to the torus. In this study, we
examine environments of quasars with broad absorption troughs in their spectra
(i.e., BAL quasars) because it is widely believed that BAL troughs are observed
if the central continuum is viewed from the side through their powerful
outflows near the dust torus. With closely separated 12 projected quasar pairs
at different redshift with separation angle of $\theta$$<$120$^{\prime\prime}$,
we examine HI absorption at foreground BAL quasars in spectra of background
quasars. We confirm there exist optically thick gas around two of 12 BAL
quasars, and that the mean HI absorption strength is EW$_{\rm rest}$$\sim$1A.
These are consistent to the past results around non-BAL quasars, although not
statistically significant. However, the origins of optically thick HI absorbers
around BAL and non-BAL quasars could be different since their column densities
are different by $\sim$3 orders of magnitude. The larger sample would be
required for narrowing down possible scenarios for the anisotropic HI
absorption around quasars.

  Image Classification","MICCAI 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a fundamental task for the
diagnosis and treatment of diseases; but, curation of accurate labels is
time-consuming and limits the application of fully-supervised methods. To
address this, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular method that poses
classification as a weakly supervised learning task with slide-level labels
only. While current MIL methods apply variants of the attention mechanism to
re-weight instance features with stronger models, scant attention is paid to
the properties of the data distribution. In this work, we propose to
re-calibrate the distribution of a WSI bag (instances) by using the statistics
of the max-instance (critical) feature. We assume that in binary MIL, positive
bags have larger feature magnitudes than negatives, thus we can enforce the
model to maximize the discrepancy between bags with a metric feature loss that
models positive bags as out-of-distribution. To achieve this, unlike existing
MIL methods that use single-batch training modes, we propose balanced-batch
sampling to effectively use the feature loss i.e., (+/-) bags simultaneously.
Further, we employ a position encoding module (PEM) to model
spatial/morphological information, and perform pooling by multi-head
self-attention (PSMA) with a Transformer encoder. Experimental results on
existing benchmark datasets show our approach is effective and improves over
state-of-the-art MIL methods.

distance of 2.26$^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$ kpc, G345.88-1.10 exhibits a network of
parsec-long converging filaments. At the junction of these filaments lie four
infrared-quiet fragments. The densest fragment (with M=210 M$_{\odot}$,
R$_{\rm{eff}}=0.14$ pc) sits at the centre of a wide (opening angle of $\sim$
90$\pm$15$^{o}$) bipolar nebulosity. $^{12}$CO(2-1) observations show that
these infrared-bright nebulosities are spatially associated with a powerful
molecular outflow from the central fragment. Negligible radio continuum and no
H30$\alpha$ emission is detected towards the cavities, seemingly excluding that
ionising radiation drives the evolution of the cavities. Furthermore, radiative
transfer simulations are unable to reproduce the observed combination of a
low-luminosity ($\lesssim$ 500 L$_{\odot}$) central source and a surrounding
high-luminosity ($\sim 4000$ L$_{\odot}$) mid-infrared-bright bipolar cavity.
This suggests that radiative heating from a central protostar cannot be
responsible for the illumination of the outflow cavities. To our knowledge,
this is the first reported object of this type. The rarity of objects like
G345.88-1.10 is likely related to a very short phase in the massive star and/or
cluster formation process that was so far unidentified. We discuss whether
mechanical energy deposition by one episode or successive episodes of powerful
mass accretion in a collapsing hub might explain the observations. While
promising in some aspects, a fully coherent scenario that explains the presence
of a luminous bipolar cavity centred on an infrared-dark fragment remains
elusive at this point.

successive loading steps, using acoustic emission and ultrasonic sensing to
track internal damage. The primary creep rate is observed to follow a
(Omori-type) power-law decay in the strain rate, the number of acoustic
emission events as well as the amplitudes of the ultrasonic beams, supporting a
brittle-creep mechanism. The main outcome is however the discovery of
unexpected history effects that make the material less prone to creep when it
has been previously deformed and damaged under primary creep at a lower applied
stress. With the help of a progressive damage model implementing thermal
activation, we interpret this as an aging-under-stress phenomenon: during an
initial creep step at relatively low applied stress, the easy-to-damage sites
are exhausted first, depleting the excitation spectrum at low stress gap
values. Consequently, upon reloading under a larger applied stress, although
previously damaged, the material creeps (and damages) less than it would under
the same stress but without pre-creeping. Besides shedding a new light on the
fundamental physics of creep of disordered brittle materials, this has
important practical consequences in the interpretation of some experimental
procedures, such as stress-stepping experiments.

framework; however, the aggregation scheme of deterministic models cannot be
directly applied to probabilistic models since weights correspond to

various aggregation schemes for variational Bayesian neural networks. With
empirical results on three image classification datasets, we observe that the

security requirements set out by NIST by speeding up repeated kernel finding
operations using classical mathematics techniques. If quantum algorithms are
applied to perform these repeated operations, the rank-based attacks may be
more threatening and could dramatically lower the security level of Rainbow. In
this paper, we propose a novel MinRank attack called Q-rMinRank attack, the
first quantum approach to the key recovery attacks on Rainbow. By designing
quantum circuits that can find the kernel, we achieved quadratic speedup for
the MinRank attack to recover the private keys of Rainbow. We show that even
the parameter set V of Rainbow does not meet the 128-bit security level, the
minimum security requirement through our Q-rMinRank attack. It means that
Rainbow is no longer secure in quantum computing environments.

in the presence of a cluster of inhomogeneities undergo multiple interactions
between them. When these inhomogeneities have sub-wavelength sizes, the
dominating field due to the these multiple interactions is the Foldy-Lax field.
This field models the interaction between the equivalent point-like scatterers,
located at the centers of the small inhomogeneities, with scattering
coefficients related to geometrical/material properties of each
inhomogeneities, as polarization coefficients. One of the related questions
left open for a long time is whether we can reconstruct this Foldy-Lax field
from the scattered field measured far away from the cluster of the small
inhomogeneities. This is the Foldy-Lax approximation (or Foldy-Lax paradigm).
In this work, we show that this approximation is indeed valid as soon as the
inhomogeneities enjoy critical scales between their sizes and contrasts. These
critical scales allow them to generate resonances which can be characterized
and computed. The main result here is that exciting the cluster by incident
frequencies which are close to the real parts of these resonances allow us to
reconstruct the Fold-Lax field from the scattered waves collected far away from
the cluster itself (as the farfields). In short, we show that the Foldy-Lax
approximation is valid using nearly resonating incident frequencies. This
results is demonstrated by using, as small inhomogeneities, dielectric
nanoparticles for the 2D TM model of electromagnetic waves and bubbles for the
3D acoustic waves.

variety of applications in diverse domains. Although the modularity introduced
by Newman and Girvan (2004) has widely been used as a quality function for
community detection, it has some drawbacks. The modularity density introduced
by Li et al. (2008) is known to be an effective alternative to the modularity,
which mitigates one of the drawbacks called the resolution limit. A large body
of work has been devoted to designing exact and heuristic methods for
modularity density maximization, without any computational complexity analysis.
In this study, we investigate modularity density maximization from both
algorithmic and computational complexity aspects. Specifically, we first
accelerate column generation for the modularity density maximization problem.
To this end, we point out that the auxiliary problem appearing in column
generation can be viewed as a dense subgraph discovery problem. Then we employ
a well-known strategy for dense subgraph discovery, called the greedy peeling,
for approximately solving the auxiliary problem. Moreover, we reformulate the
auxiliary problem to a sequence of $0$--$1$ linear programming problems,
enabling us to compute its optimal value more efficiently and to get more
diverse columns. Computational experiments using a variety of real-world
networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Finally, we
show the NP-hardness of a slight variant of the modularity density maximization
problem, where the output partition has to have two or more clusters, as well
as showing the NP-hardness of the auxiliary problem.

under gluing along surfaces. For this purpose we extend the notion of Kauffman
bracket skein modules to $3$-manifolds with marking consisting of open
intervals and circles in the boundary. The new module is called the stated
skein module.
  The first main results concern non-injectivity of certain natural maps
defined when forming connected sums along a sphere or along a closed disk.
These maps are injective for surfaces, or for generic quantum parameter, but we
show that in general they are not injective when the quantum parameter is a
root of 1. The result applies to the classical skein modules as well. A
particular interesting result is that when the quantum parameter is a root of
1, the empty skein is zero in a connected sum where each constituent manifold
has non-empty marking.
  We also prove various non injectivity results for the Chebyshev-Frobenius map
and the natural map induced by the deletion of marked balls.
  We then consider the general case of gluing along a surface, showing that the
stated skein module can be interpreted as a monoidal symmetric functor from a
category of ""decorated cobordisms"" to a Morita category of algebras and their
bimodules. We apply this result to deduce several properties of stated skein
modules as a Van-Kampen like theorem as well as a computation through Heegaard
decompositions and a relation to Hochshild homology for trivial circle bundles
over surfaces.

trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in situ based on matter-wave
interference, which validates our previous theoretical work [arXiv:
2205.02416]. By sweeping the interval of double stand-wave pulses, the BEC wave
packet was splitted into different diffraction orders and then we counted the
oscillation curve of the population of zero-momentum state to calibrate the
momentum width. Compared with our simplified theory, we observed an accelerated
evolution of interference fringes in time-domain. We evaluated this
interference process minutely by numerically calculating the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation and using Wigner function to intuitively demonstrate the influence of
the external potential and nonlinear term. We confirmed that the reduction of
interference fringe evolution period actually originates from the synergistic
cooperation of the mean-field interaction of the BEC and spatial density
modulation caused by the interference between different momentum states. Our
approach could be generalized to other ultra-cold atomic gases with different
momentum distributions, and in principle a single shot can obtain the result.
This quantum thermometry is particularly suitable for momentum width
calibration in practical deep cooling experiments, while for atomic samples at
pK level the mean-field interaction can be safely ignored.

efficient use of preliminary data plays a crucial role. This work shows that a
simple feedforward type neural networks approach for learning preliminary
experimental data can provide quick access to simulate the experiment within
the learned range. The approach is especially beneficial for physical
properties measurements with scanning on multiple axes, where derivative or
integration of data are required to obtain the objective quantity. Due to its
simplicity, the learning process is fast enough for the users to perform
learning and simulation on-the-fly by using a combination of open-source
optimization techniques and deep-learning libraries. Here such a tool for
augmenting the experimental data is proposed, aiming to help researchers to
decide the most suitable experimental conditions before performing costly
experiments in real. Furthermore, this tool can also be used from the

(MIMO-OFDM), a fundamental transmission scheme, promises high throughput and
robustness against multipath fading. However, these benefits rely on the
efficient detection strategy at the receiver and come at the expense of the
extra bandwidth consumed by the cyclic prefix (CP). We use the iterative
orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm in this paper as the
prototype of the detector because of its remarkable potential for interference
suppression. However, OAMP is computationally expensive for the matrix
inversion per iteration. We replace the matrix inversion with the conjugate
gradient (CG) method to reduce the complexity of OAMP. We further unfold the
CG-based OAMP algorithm into a network and tune the critical parameters through
deep learning (DL) to enhance detection performance. Simulation results and
complexity analysis show that the proposed scheme has significant gain over
other iterative detection methods and exhibits comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art DL-based detector at a reduced computational cost.
Furthermore, we design a highly efficient CP-free MIMO-OFDM receiver
architecture to remove the CP overhead. This architecture first eliminates the
intersymbol interference by buffering the previously recovered data and then
detects the signal using the proposed detector. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the designed receiver offers a higher spectral efficiency than
traditional receivers. Finally, over-the-air tests verify the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed scheme in realistic environments.

detecting lung nodules on chest X-rays (CXR) versus radiologists of two
binational institutions, and to evaluate AI performance when using two
different modes: automated versus assisted (additional remote radiologist
review).
  Methods: The CXR public database (n = 247) of the Japanese Society of
Radiological Technology with various types and sizes of lung nodules was
analyzed. Eight radiologists evaluated the CXR images with regard to the
presence of lung nodules and nodule conspicuity. After radiologist review, the
AI software processed and flagged the CXR with the highest probability of
missed nodules. The calculated accuracy metrics were the area under the curve
(AUC), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, false negative case number (FN), and
the effect of different AI modes (automated/assisted) on the accuracy of nodule
detection.
  Results: For radiologists, the average AUC value was 0.77 $\pm$ 0.07, while
the average FN was 52.63 $\pm$ 17.53 (all studies) and 32 $\pm$ 11.59 (studies
containing a nodule of malignant etiology = 32% rate of missed malignant
nodules). Both AI modes -- automated and assisted -- produced an average
increase in sensitivity (by 14% and 12%) and of F1-score (5% and 6%) and a
decrease in specificity (by 10% and 3%, respectively).
  Conclusions: Both AI modes flagged the pulmonary nodules missed by
radiologists in a significant number of cases. AI as a second reader has a high
potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and radiology workflow. AI might
detect certain pulmonary nodules earlier than radiologists, with a potentially
significant impact on patient outcomes.

that the linear model presents a high accuracy for spherical asteroids in most
cases. The ranges of parameters in which the relative error of the linear model

oblate ones), the linear model systematically overestimates the transverse

a maximum up to 35\%. To estimate the strength of Yarkovsky effect directly

Universe after the end of inflation. To study this production channel, two
different approaches have commonly been considered, one of which is based on
the Boltzmann equation, and the other is based on the Bogoliubov
transformation. Each of these has pros and cons in practice. The collision term
in the Boltzmann equation can be computed based on quantum field theory in the
Minkowski spacetime, and thus many techniques have been developed so far. On
the other hand, the Bogoliubov approach may deal with the particle production
beyond the perturbation theory and is able to take into account the effect of
the curved spacetime, whereas in many cases one should rely on numerical
methods, such as lattice computation. We show by explicit numerical and
analytical computations of the purely gravitational production of a scalar that
these two approaches give consistent results for particle production with large
momenta during reheating, whereas the Boltzmann approach is not capable of
computing particle production out of vacuum during inflation. We also provide
analytic approximations of the spectrum of produced scalar with/without mass
for the low momentum regime obtained from the Bogoliubov approach.

limited, we propose a multiple RSUs cooperative radar sensing network

essential prerequisite and foundation for RSU-CRSN with signal-level fusion. In
this paper, we present an adjustable beam enabled spatial registration

adjusting the sensing beam width of RSU. To adjust the width of sensing beam
flexibly, a beamwidth adjustable beamforming algorithm (BABA) is proposed in

intra-operative observation is a critical step to track the motion of a soft
organ in augmented surgery. While many elastic registration procedures
introduce artificial forces into the direct physical model to drive the
registration, we propose in this paper a method to reconstruct the surface
loading that actually generated the observed deformation. The registration
problem is formulated as an optimal control problem where the unknown is the
surface force distribution that applies on the organ and the resulting
deformation is computed using an hyperelastic model. Advantages of this
approach include a greater control over the set of admissible force
distributions, in particular the opportunity to choose where forces should
apply, thus promoting physically-consistent displacement fields. The
optimization problem is solved using a standard adjoint method. We present
registration results with experimental phantom data showing that our procedure
is competitive in terms of accuracy. In an example of application, we estimate
the forces applied by a surgery tool on the organ. Such an estimation is
relevant in the context of robotic surgery systems, where robotic arms usually
do not allow force measurements, and providing force feedback remains a
challenge.

magnetization switching upon excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse.
Although this phenomenon is very promising for future opto-magnetic data
storage applications, the role of non-local spin transport in these systems is
scarcely understood. Using Co/Gd and Co/Tb bilayers we isolate the contribution
of the rare-earth materials to the generated spin currents by using the
precessional dynamics they excite in an adjacent ferromagnetic layer as a
probe. By measuring THz standing spin-waves as well as GHz homogeneous
precessional modes, we probe both the high- and low-frequency components of
these spin currents. The low-frequency homogeneous mode indicates a significant
contribution of Gd to the spin current, but not from Tb, consistent with the
difficulty in achieving all-optical switching in Tb-containing systems.
Measurements on the THz frequency spin waves reveal the inability of the
rare-earth generated spin currents to excite dynamics at the sub-ps timescale.
We present modelling efforts using the $s$-$d$ model, which effectively
reproduce our results and allow us to explain the behavior in terms of the

evaluating their performance is challenging. This issue is of vital importance
to push research forward and identify meaningful gains from random noise.
Currently, heuristic metrics such as the Inception score (IS) and Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) are the most common evaluation metrics, but what they
measure is not entirely clear. Additionally, there are questions regarding how
meaningful their score actually is. In this work, we study the evaluation
metrics of generative models by generating a high-quality synthetic dataset on

while FID and IS do correlate to several f-divergences, their ranking of close

extensive air showers, which can be measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
With its hybrid detector design, the Pierre Auger Observatory measures both the
longitudinal development of showers in the atmosphere and the lateral
distribution of particles that arrive at the ground. This way, observables that
are sensitive to hadronic interactions at ultra-high energies can be obtained.
While the hadronic interaction cross-section can be assessed from the
longitudinal profiles, the number of muons and their fluctuations measured with
the ground detectors are linked to other physical properties. In addition to
these direct studies, we discuss here how measurements of the atmospheric depth
of the maximum of air-shower profiles and the characteristics of the muon
signal at the ground can be used to test the self-consistency of the post-LHC
hadronic models.

practical importance: Based on recent work by the authors, it is shown that
pseudo-time iterations using explicit Runge-Kutta methods are locally
conservative but not necessarily flux consistent. An extension of the
Lax-Wendroff theorem is presented, revealing convergence towards weak solutions
of a temporally retarded system of conservation laws. Each equation is modified
in the same way, namely by a particular scalar factor multiplying the spatial
flux terms. A technique for enforcing flux consistency, and thereby recovering
convergence, is presented. Further, local conservation is established for all
Krylov subspace methods, with and without restarts, and for Newton's method
under certain assumptions on the discretization. Thus it is shown that
Newton-Krylov methods are locally conservative, although not necessarily flux
consistent. Numerical experiments with the 2D compressible Euler equations
corroborate the theoretical results. Further numerical investigations of the
impact of flux consistency on Newton-Krylov methods indicate that its effect is
case dependent, and diminishes as the number of iterations grow.

stress through solar shading during the daytime, their influence on the air
temperature under and around them during the nighttime, which is important for
nighttime thermal comfort, has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we
investigated the nocturnal cooling effect of trees in a physical urban space by
the coupled numerical simulation of longwave radiative transfer and
computational fluid dynamics. To represent the spatial structure of an actual
urban space, airborne LiDAR-derived three-dimensional data of leaf area density
distribution and building shape were used. The species-specific convective heat
transfer coefficient was also considered. An analysis of the calculated
sensible heat flux shows that both leaf area density and sky view factor are
important factors in the production of cool air. According to the calculated
distributions of air temperature and velocity, even under the condition of a
certain degree of incident flow, the cooled air can flow down to the space
under the crown, accumulate, and then diverge when the wind speed is
sufficiently low in the crown owing to the crown drag. Buildings contribute to
both the accumulation and dissipation of cool air. The findings of the present
study suggest that cool spots can be produced during nighttime by trees planted
near streets by devising a suitable arrangement and morphology of trees and

between ~10$^4$ and ~10$^5$ solar masses. The early radio observations of NGC
4395 with the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) network, High
Sensitivity Array (HSA), at 1.4 GHz in 2005 showed that its nucleus has a
sub-mJy outflow-like feature (E) extending over 15 mas. To probe the
possibility of the feature E as a continuous jet with a base physically coupled
with the accretion disc, we performed deep VLBI observations with the European
VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz, and analysed the archival data obtained with the
HSA at 1.4 GHz in 2008, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 12-18
GHz and the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) at 237 GHz. The
feature E displays more diffuse structure in the HSA image of 2008 and has no
compact substructure detected in the EVN image. Together with the optically
thin steep spectrum and the extremely large angular offset (about 220 mas) from
the accurate optical Gaia position, we explain the feature E as nuclear shocks
likely formed by the IMBH's episodic ejection or wide-angle outflow. The VLA
and ALMA observations find a sub-mJy pc-scale diffuse feature, possibly tracing
a thermal free-free emission region near the IMBH. There is no detection of a
jet base at the IMBH position in the VLBI maps. The non-detections give an
extremely low luminosity of <=4.7 x 10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 5 GHz and
indicate no evidence of a disc-jet coupling on sub-pc scales.

(MACs) with the assistance of non-signaling correlations between parties. It is
well-known that non-signaling assistance does not change the capacity of
classical point-to-point channels. However, it was recently observed that one
can construct MACs from two-player non-local games while relating the winning
probability of the game to the capacity of the MAC. By considering games for
which entanglement (a special kind of non-signaling correlation) increases the
winning probability (e.g., the Magic Square game), this shows that for some
specific kinds of channels, entanglement between the senders can increase the
capacity.
  In this work, we make several contributions towards understanding the
capacity region for MACs with the assistance of non-signaling correlations
between the parties. We develop a linear program computing the optimal success
probability for coding over $n$ copies of a MAC $W$ with size growing
polynomially in $n$. Solving this linear program allows us to achieve inner
bounds for MACs. Applying this method to the binary adder channel, we show that
using non-signaling assistance, the sum-rate $\frac{\log_2(72)}{4} \simeq
1.5425$ can be reached even with zero error, which beats the maximum sum-rate
capacity of $1.5$ in the unassisted case. For noisy channels, where the
zero-error non-signaling assisted capacity region is trivial, we can use
concatenated codes to obtain achievable points in the capacity region. Applied
to a noisy version of the binary adder channel, we show that non-signaling
assistance still improves the sum-rate capacity. Complementing these
achievability results, we give an outer bound on the non-signaling assisted
capacity region that has the same expression as the unassisted region except
that the channel inputs are not required to be independent.

optimization problems where the candidate solutions need to satisfy a

space size granted by ad-hoc crossover and mutation operators does not usually
translate to a substantial improvement of the GA performances. There is still
no clear explanation of this phenomenon, although it is suspected that a
balanced representation might yield a more irregular fitness landscape, where
it could be more difficult for GA to converge to a global optimum. In this
paper, we investigate this issue by adding a local search step to a GA with
balanced operators, and use it to evolve highly nonlinear balanced Boolean
functions. In particular, we organize our experiments around two research
questions, namely if local search (1) improves the convergence speed of GA, and
(2) decreases the population diversity. Surprisingly, while our results answer
affirmatively the first question, they also show that adding local search
actually \emph{increases} the diversity among the individuals in the
population. We link these findings to some recent results on fitness landscape
analysis for problems on Boolean functions.

reconnection effects in the disk and the halo of this galaxy. We combine the
Very Large Array (VLA) and Effelsberg radio maps of M101 to restore the
large-scale emission lost in the interferometric observations. From the
obtained maps, we derive magnetic field strengths and energy densities, and
compare them with the properties of the hot gas found with the spectral
analysis of the X-ray data. Most of the X-ray emission likely comes from the
hot gas in the halo of M101. Its temperature is highest above the massive
stellar arm and an inter-arm region with enhanced polarised radio emission, as
well as in the inter-arm area where neither Halpha nor HI emission is visible.
In regions outside of the spiral arms lower strengths, energy densities and
higher orders of the magnetic fields were observed. Although M101 does not
possess well-defined magnetic arms, a rudimentary magnetic arm was identified
in one of the inter-arm regions. We found weak signatures of additional heating
of the ISM there, as well as in the galactic halo, which could be explained by

weather conditions). We proposed a prediction model for traffic congestion that
can predict congestion based on day, time and several weather data (e.g.,
temperature, humidity). To evaluate our model, it has been tested against the
traffic data of New Delhi. With this model, congestion of a road can be
predicted one week ahead with an average RMSE of 1.12. Therefore, this model
can be used to take preventive measure beforehand.

detection through our experience of developing a computational support tool for

results so that expert coaches can take both the results and contexts into
account. The key idea behind this approach is to leave room for expert coaches
to unleash their open-ended interpretations, rather than simplifying the nature
of social interactions to well-defined problems that are tractable by
conventional supervised algorithms. In addition, we found that this approach
can be extended to nurturing novice coaches; by prompting them to interpret the
results from the system, it can provide the coaches with educational
opportunities. Although the applicability of this approach should be validated
in other domains, we believe that the idea of leveraging unsupervised anomaly
detection to construct AI-based interactive systems would shed light on another

inability to evade the adversarial defense. To overcome these shortcomings, we
create an original approach to generate adversarial examples by smoothing the

construct the adversarial examples without relying on any internal information

constraint to guide the Gabor filter to select appropriate angles and scales to
smooth the linear texture from the input images to generate adversarial

adversarial examples with strong transferability and solid evasiveness.
Finally, compared to the four advanced black-box adversarial attack methods,

document verification is critical in order to efficiently detect forgery and
therefore build user trust in the digital world. In this paper, an
authentication model for identity documents based on forgery detection of
guilloche patterns is proposed. The proposed approach is made up of two steps:
feature extraction and similarity measure between a pair of feature vectors of
identity documents. The feature extraction step involves learning the
similarity between a pair of identity documents via a convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture and ends by extracting highly discriminative
features between them. While, the similarity measure step is applied to decide
if a given identity document is authentic or forged. In this work, these two
steps are combined together to achieve two objectives: (i) extracted features
should have good anticollision (discriminative) capabilities to distinguish
between a pair of identity documents belonging to different classes, (ii)
checking out the conformity of the guilloche pattern of a given identity
document and its similarity to the guilloche pattern of an authentic version of
the same country. Experiments are conducted in order to analyze and identify
the most proper parameters to achieve higher authentication performance. The
experimental results are performed on the MIDV-2020 dataset. The results show
the ability of the proposed approach to extract the relevant characteristics of
the processed pair of identity documents in order to model the guilloche
patterns, and thus distinguish them correctly. The implementation code and the

state of a node is updated based on the information received from its
neighbours. Most message-passing models act as graph convolutions, where
features are mixed by a shared, linear transformation before being propagated
over the edges. On node-classification tasks, graph convolutions have been
shown to suffer from two limitations: poor performance on heterophilic graphs,
and over-smoothing. It is common belief that both phenomena occur because such
models behave as low-pass filters, meaning that the Dirichlet energy of the
features decreases along the layers incurring a smoothing effect that
ultimately makes features no longer distinguishable. In this work, we
rigorously prove that simple graph-convolutional models can actually enhance
high frequencies and even lead to an asymptotic behaviour we refer to as
over-sharpening, opposite to over-smoothing. We do so by showing that linear
graph convolutions with symmetric weights minimize a multi-particle energy that
generalizes the Dirichlet energy; in this setting, the weight matrices induce
edge-wise attraction (repulsion) through their positive (negative) eigenvalues,
thereby controlling whether the features are being smoothed or sharpened. We
also extend the analysis to non-linear GNNs, and demonstrate that some existing
time-continuous GNNs are instead always dominated by the low frequencies.
Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through ablations and real-world
experiments.

self-assemble into linear polymer chains. Their equilibrium properties in 2D

predicts a well-defined exponentially decaying equilibrium chain length
distribution. In experimental realizations, due to gravity, particles sediment
to the bottom of the suspension forming a monolayer of particles with a
gravitational height smaller than the particle diameter. In accordance with
experiments, an anomalously high monomer concentration is observed in
simulations which is not well understood. To account for this observation, we
interpret the polymerization as taking place in a highly confined quasi-2D
plane and extend the Wertheim thermodynamic perturbation theory by defining
addition reactions constants as functions of the chain length. We derive the
theory, test it on simple square well potentials, and apply it to the
experimental case of synthetic colloidal patchy particles immersed in a binary
liquid mixture that are described by an accurate effective critical Casimir
patchy particle potential. The important interaction parameters entering the
theory are explicitly computed using the integral method in combination with
Monte Carlo sampling. Without any adjustable parameter, the predictions of the
chain length distribution are in excellent agreement with explicit simulations
of self-assembling particles. We discuss generality of the approach, and its

different methods of incorporating phonetic information in a speech enhancement

group rings. In particular, we address the Isomorphism Problem for group rings
in the case where the ring is a reduced order. We prove that any non-zero
reduced order $R$ can be written as a group ring in a unique ``maximal'' way,
up to isomorphism. More precisely, there exist a ring $A$ and a finite abelian
group $G$, both uniquely determined up to isomorphism, such that $R\cong A[G]$
as rings, and such that if $B$ is a ring and $H$ is a group, then $R\cong B[H]$
as rings if and only if there is a finite abelian group $J$ such that $B\cong
A[J]$ as rings and $J\times H\cong G$ as groups. Computing $A$ and $G$ for
given $R$ can be done by means of an algorithm that is not quite
polynomial-time. We also give a description of the automorphism group of $R$ in
terms of $A$ and $G$.

classify action instances in long untrimmed videos with only video-level
category labels. Due to the lack of snippet-level supervision for indicating
action boundaries, previous methods typically assign pseudo labels for
unlabeled snippets. However, since some action instances of different
categories are visually similar, it is non-trivial to exactly label the
(usually) one action category for a snippet, and incorrect pseudo labels would
impair the localization performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel method from a category exclusion perspective, named Progressive
Complementary Learning (ProCL), which gradually enhances the snippet-level
supervision. Our method is inspired by the fact that video-level labels
precisely indicate the categories that all snippets surely do not belong to,
which is ignored by previous works. Accordingly, we first exclude these surely
non-existent categories by a complementary learning loss. And then, we
introduce the background-aware pseudo complementary labeling in order to
exclude more categories for snippets of less ambiguity. Furthermore, for the
remaining ambiguous snippets, we attempt to reduce the ambiguity by
distinguishing foreground actions from the background. Extensive experimental
results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two
popular benchmarks, namely THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3.

that this SN originated from a star with an initial mass of about 12 solar
masses that had lost all but tiny (<0.1 solar masses) fraction of its hydrogen
envelope. We also investigate the effects of the macroscopic mixing by
comparing macroscopically and microscopically mixed models, and by varying the
clumping geometry. In the photospheric phase, we find strong effects on the
effective opacity in the macroscopically mixed regions, which affects the model
lightcurves. The diffusion peak is considerably narrower in the macroscopically
mixed case, and differs strongly if the radioactive material in the helium
envelope is allowed to expand more than in our standard model. The effect is
mainly geometrical, and is driven by the expansion of the clumps containing
radioactive material. These findings has implications for lightcurve modelling
of stripped-envelope SNe in general, and the effect would increase the
estimated ejecta masses. In the nebular phase, we find strong effects on the
collisional cooling rates in the macroscopically mixed regions, which affects
lines driven by collisional cooling, in particular the [Ca II] 7291, 7323 and
[O I] 6300, 6364 lines. As these lines are often used for mass determinations,
it highlights the importance of how the calcium- and oxygen-rich material is
mixed. As shown in this and earlier work, both NLTE and macroscopic mixing are
essential ingredients to accurately model the lightcurves and spectra of Type
IIb SNe throughout their evolution.

the Accretion Induced Collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs process. It turns out that
the distribution of orbits peaks up to P_orb;f < 90 d with strong
circularization. Considering the different assumptions about the distribution
of companions He stars 3M< Mcom < 5M, the binary will affect the setups of the
balance condition of minimum energy. Our analytical approach is just the first
approach to the more complete models required for describing all binary
parameters after an asymmetric kick. Therefore, we have also run some numerical
simulations in order to compare their results with the analytical studies. We
aim to initiate the first exploration of the full complexity of the problem,
when combining a variable kick time and a variable kick vector direction.
Indeed, the numerical simulations show patterns resembling the complex behavior
found in chaotic scattering problems. Although we deal with a deterministic
problem and bounded orbits, the regular characteristic orbits are found in more
realistic phases during the AIC process. In addition, the overall process can
show complex behaviors strongly associated with the internal kick mechanisms.
This would lead us to identify the nature of regular orbits and their orbital
morphology.

To cope with such complexity, this paper introduces a new approach to cluster

extended version of the well-known Directly-Follow Graph supported by many
industrial and academic process mining tools. This graph is used to calculate a
similarity matrix for discovering clusters of similar case notions based on a

different clusters that can be discovered based on different levels of
similarity. Thus, the cluster discovery will not rely on merely analysts'
assumptions. The approach is implemented and released as a part of a python
library, called processmining, and it is evaluated through a Purchase to Pay

discovering Directly Follow-Multigraph by flattening the log based on the
clusters. The similarity between identified clusters is also evaluated by
calculating the similarity between the behavior of the process models
discovered for each case notion using inductive miner based on footprints

phase diagram of an interacting Chern insulator described by QAH-Hubbard model,
with nontrivial dynamical quantum physics being uncovered. We focus on the
dynamical properties of the system at a weak to intermediate Hubbard
interaction which mainly induces a ferromagnetic order under the mean-field
level. Remarkably, three characteristic times $t_s$, $t_c$, and $t^*$ are found
in the quench dynamics. The first two capture the emergence of dynamical
self-consistent particle density and dynamical topological phase transition
respectively, while the last one gives a linear scaling time on the topological
phase boundaries. A more interesting result is that $t_s>t^*>t_c$
($t^*<t_s<t_c$) occurs in repulsive (attractive) interaction and the Chern
number is determined by any two characteristic time scales when the system is
quenched from an initial nearly fully polarized state to the topologically
nontrivial regimes, showing a dynamical way to determine equilibrium mean-field
topological phase diagram via the time scales. Experimentally,the measurement
of $t_s$ is challenging while $t_c$ and $t^*$ can be directly readout by
measuring the spin polarizations of four Dirac points and the time-dependent
particle density, respectively. Our work reveals the novel interacting effects
on the topological phases and shall promote the experimental observation.

automatically estimating story points focus on applying pre-trained embedding

required expensive embedding models. We propose HeteroSP, a tool for estimating
story points from textual input of Agile software project issues. We select
GPT2SP [12] and Deep-SE [8] as the baselines for comparison. First, from the
analysis of the story point dataset [8], we conclude that software issues are
actually a mixture of natural language sentences with quoted code snippets and
have problems related to large-size vocabulary. Second, we provide a module to
normalize the input text including words and code tokens of the software
issues. Third, we design an algorithm to convert an input software issue to a
graph with different types of nodes and edges. Fourth, we construct a
heterogeneous graph neural networks model with the support of fastText [6] for
constructing initial node embedding to learn and predict the story points of
new issues. We did the comparison over three scenarios of estimation, including
within project, cross-project within the repository, and cross-project cross
repository with our baseline approaches. We achieve the average Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) as 2.38, 2.61, and 2.63 for three scenarios. We outperform GPT2SP
in 2/3 of the scenarios while outperforming Deep-SE in the most challenging
scenario with significantly less amount of running time. We also compare our
approaches with different homogeneous graph neural network models and the
results show that the heterogeneous graph neural networks model outperforms the
homogeneous models in story point estimation. For time performance, we achieve
about 570 seconds as the time performance in both three processes: node
embedding initialization, model construction, and story point estimation.

a goal of increasing the fault detection rate. Various TCP techniques have been
proposed based on different prioritization strategies. Among them, the
greedy-based techniques are the most widely-used TCP techniques. However,
existing greedy-based techniques usually reorder all candidate test cases in
prioritization iterations, resulting in both efficiency and effectiveness
problems. In this paper, we propose a generic partial attention mechanism,
which adopts the previous priority values (i.e., the number of
additionally-covered code units) to avoid considering all candidate test cases.
Incorporating the mechanism with the additional-greedy strategy, we implement a
novel coverage-based TCP technique based on partition ordering (OCP). OCP first
groups the candidate test cases into different partitions and updates the
partitions on the descending order. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on 19
versions of Java programs and 30 versions of C programs to compare the
effectiveness and efficiency of OCP with six state-of-the-art TCP techniques:
total-greedy, additional-greedy, lexicographical-greedy, unify-greedy,
art-based, and search-based. The experimental results show that OCP achieves a
better fault detection rate than the state-of-the-arts. Moreover, the time
costs of OCP are found to achieve 85%-99% improvement than most
state-of-the-arts.

on the electronic and magnetic structure in strained bulk LaNiO3 and
(LaNiO3)$_1$/(LaAlO3)$_1$(001) superlattices. For bulk LaNiO3, we find that
epitaxial strain induces a substantial anisotropy in the oxygen vacancy
formation energy. In particular, tensile strain promotes the selective
reduction of apical oxygen, which may explain why the recently observed
superconductivity of infinite-layer nickelates is limited to strained films.
For (LaNiO3)$_1$/(LaAlO3)$_1$(001) superlattices, the simulations reveal that
the NiO2 layer is most prone to vacancy formation, whereas the AlO2 layer
exhibits generally the highest formation energies. The reduction is
consistently endothermic, and a largely repulsive vacancy-vacancy interaction
is identified as a function of the vacancy concentration. The released
electrons are accommodated exclusively in the NiO2 layer, reducing the vacancy
formation energy in the AlO2 layer by 70% with respect to bulk LaAlO3. By
varying the vacancy concentration from 0% to 8.3% in the NiO2 layer at tensile
strain, we observe an unexpected transition from a localized
site-disproportionated (0.5%) to a delocalized (2.1%) charge accommodation, a
re-entrant site disproportionation leading to a metal-to-insulator transition
despite a half-filled majority-spin Ni $e_g$ manifold (4.2%), and finally a
magnetic phase transition (8.3%). While a band gap of up to 0.5 eV opens at
4.2% for compressive strain, it is smaller for tensile strain or the system is
metallic, which is in sharp contrast to the defect-free superlattice. The
strong interplay of electronic reconstructions and structural modifications
induced by oxygen vacancies in this system highlights the key role of an
explicit supercell treatment and exemplifies the complex response to defects in
artificial transition metal oxides.

This threshold, the 'metacommunity capacity', extends the metapopulation

illustrate how the joint structure of the spatial and the interaction networks
affects metacommunity capacity. It results that a weakly modular spatial

the most favourable configuration for the long-term persistence of a
mutualistic metacommunity. Our model that encodes several explicit ecological

state in the presence of indefinite causal order, then it is possible to hide
quantum information in the correlation. One may ask, does it then violate the
no-hiding theorem? We analyse this question and argue that in the extended
Hilbert space, it will still respect the no-hiding theorem. We also discuss how
to mask quantum information using superposition of two hiding maps. Our results
can have interesting implications in preserving the fidelity of information,
preservation of quantum coherence and work extraction in the presence of two
hiding maps with indefinite causal order. Furthermore, we apply the hiding maps
in the presence of indefinite causal order on half of an entangled pair and
show that entanglement cannot be preserved. Finally, we discuss that even

intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Having been constrained by the limited
number of qubits and shallow circuit depth, NISQ devices have nevertheless
demonstrated the potential of applications on various subjects. One example is
the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that was first introduced for
computing ground states. Although VQE has now been extended to the study of
excited states, the algorithms previously proposed involve a recursive
optimization scheme which requires many extra operations with significantly
deeper quantum circuits to ensure the orthogonality of different trial states.
Here we propose a new algorithm to determine many low energy eigenstates
simultaneously. By introducing ancillary qubits to purify the trial states so
that they keep orthogonal to each other throughout the whole optimization
process, our algorithm allows these states to be efficiently computed in one
quantum circuit. Our algorithm reduces significantly the complexity of circuits
and the readout errors, and enables flexible post-processing on the
eigen-subspace from which the eigenpairs can be accurately determined. We
demonstrate this algorithm by applying it to the transverse Ising model. By
comparing the results obtained using this variational algorithm with the exact
ones, we find that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian converge quickly with the
increase of the circuit depth. The accuracies of the converged eigenvalues are
of the same order, which implies that the difference between any two
eigenvalues can be more accurately determined than the eigenvalues themselves.

interaction with the standard model (SM) particles at low temperatures, may
undergo number-changing self-scatterings in the early Universe, eventually
freezing out to the observed DM abundance. If these reactions, such as a $3
\rightarrow 2$ process, take place when the DM is non-relativistic, DM
cannibalizes itself to cool much slower than standard non-relativistic matter
during the cannibal phase. As shown in earlier studies, if the cannibal phase
takes place during the matter-dominated epoch, there are very strong
constraints from structure formation. Considering scenarios in which the
cannibal phase freezes out in the radiation-dominated epoch instead, we show
that cannibal DM decoupled from the SM can be viable, consistent with all
present cosmological constraints. To this end, we solve the coupled evolution
equations of the DM temperature and density, and determine its abundance for
different DM self-couplings. We then evaluate the constraints on these
parameters from the cosmic-microwave background power spectrum, the big-bang
nucleosynthesis limits on the relativistic degrees of freedom, the
Lyman-$\alpha$ limits on the DM free-streaming length and the theoretical upper
bound on the $3 \rightarrow 2$ annihilation rate from $S-$matrix unitarity. We
find that depending upon the DM self-couplings, a scalar cannibal DM with mass

satisfy all the constraints, when the initial DM temperature ($T_{\rm DM}$) is

We used the minimal distance between a star and the Sun as a selecting tool
when compiling a list of interesting objects with close encounters with the
Solar System, and our selection for that study was based on Gaia DR2 data.
Aims. When the Gaia EDR3 data release was published, it became necessary to
update this database. Additionally, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to
obtain uncertainties on the parameters of the closest approach to the Sun of
each object. Methods. We recalculated the close approach parameters of all
stars in the previous StePPeD release, which resulted in removing approximately
one-third of the total. Then we searched for new candidates in the whole Gaia
EDR3 catalogue. We also take into account the duplicity of the found stars and
additionally searched for double stars passing near the Sun which had been
overlooked in previous papers. We also found the necessary mass estimates for
new objects and updated this information for previously selected stars.
Results. After a careful checking of all the collected data, we composed a new

applied a new threshold of 2 pc for the minimum star-Sun distance. This list
consists of 146 single stars and nine multiple systems. For each object, we
also estimated the uncertainty of the parameters of their closest approach to
the Sun. Among these stars, we found a new potential strong past perturber, HD
7977, and confirmed the plausibility of a similar action on the part of Gliese
710 in the future.

surgeons are scarce and are often overloaded with clinical and academic
workloads. This overload often limits their time answering questionnaires from
patients, medical students or junior residents related to surgical procedures.
At times, students and junior residents also refrain from asking too many
questions during classes to reduce disruption. While computer-aided simulators
and recording of past surgical procedures have been made available for them to
observe and improve their skills, they still hugely rely on medical experts to
answer their questions. Having a Surgical-VQA system as a reliable 'second
opinion' could act as a backup and ease the load on the medical experts in
answering these questions. The lack of annotated medical data and the presence
of domain-specific terms has limited the exploration of VQA for surgical
procedures. In this work, we design a Surgical-VQA task that answers
questionnaires on surgical procedures based on the surgical scene. Extending
the MICCAI endoscopic vision challenge 2018 dataset and workflow recognition
dataset further, we introduce two Surgical-VQA datasets with classification and
sentence-based answers. To perform Surgical-VQA, we employ vision-text

the influence of the number of input image patches and temporal visual features
on the model performance in both classification and sentence-based answering.

These applications will increase as AI capabilities continue to progress, which
has the potential to be highly beneficial for society, or to cause serious
harm. The role of AI governance is ultimately to take practical steps to
mitigate this risk of harm while enabling the benefits of innovation in AI.
This requires answering challenging empirical questions about current and
potential risks and benefits of AI: assessing impacts that are often widely
distributed and indirect, and making predictions about a highly uncertain
future. It also requires thinking through the normative question of what
beneficial use of AI in society looks like, which is equally challenging.
Though different groups may agree on high-level principles that uses of AI
should respect (e.g., privacy, fairness, and autonomy), challenges arise when
putting these principles into practice. For example, it is straightforward to
say that AI systems must protect individual privacy, but there is presumably
some amount or type of privacy that most people would be willing to give up to
develop life-saving medical treatments. Despite these challenges, research can

different radii (8.28$\pm$0.22 and 3.94$\pm$0.17 $R_{\odot}$). This similarity
in terms of mass makes it possible to study the system's differential stellar
evolution as well as some aspects of its tidal evolution. With regard to its
orbital elements, it was recently confirmed that its orbit is circular with an
orbital period of 75.7 days. The less massive component rotates about 17 times
faster than the primary one, which is synchronized with the mean orbital
angular velocity. Our main objective in this work is to study both the nuclear
and the tidal evolution of the system. We explored two scenarios regarding the
initial eccentricities: a high one (0.30) and a case of an initial circular
orbit. A good agreement has been found between the observational values of the
eccentricity, synchronism levels, and orbital period with the values predicted
by the integration of the tidal evolution equations. The influence of the
friction timescale on the evolution of the orbital elements of TZ For is also
studied here. The orbital elements most affected by the uncertainties in the
friction timescale are the synchronism levels of the two components. On the
other hand, we used the properties of the rotating models generated by the
GRANADA code as the initial angular velocities instead of using trial values.
In this case, comparisons between the theoretical values of the orbital
elements and their observed counterparts also lead to a good interagreement.

Nine abundance points are used to construct individual line curves-of-growth by
calculating the equivalent widths of 35 Na lines, 134 Mg lines, and 34 Al

improved in NLTE (0.18 dex). LTE abundances based on Mg II lines agree better
with models of Galactic chemical evolution. For Al, NLTE calculations strongly
reduce a 0.6 dex ionization imbalance seen in LTE for the metal-poor stars. The
abundance corrections presented in this work are in good agreement with
previous studies for the subset of lines that overlap, except for strongly

to be a protoplanetary remnant until it was recently shown that it could be
released in collisions of volatile-rich solids. As CO is released, interstellar
UV radiation photodissociates CO producing CI, which can shield CO allowing a
large CO mass to accumulate. However, this picture was challenged because CI is
inefficient at shielding if CO and CI are vertically mixed. Here, we study for
the first time the vertical evolution of gas to determine how vertical mixing
affects the efficiency of shielding by CI. We present a 1D model that accounts
for gas release, photodissociation, ionisation, viscous evolution, and vertical
mixing due to turbulent diffusion. We find that if the gas surface density is
high and the vertical diffusion weak ($\alpha_{\rm v}/\alpha<[H/r]^2$) CO
photodissociates high above the midplane, forming an optically thick CI layer
that shields the CO underneath. Conversely, if diffusion is strong
($\alpha_{\rm v}/\alpha>[H/r]^2$) CI and CO become well mixed, shortening the
CO lifetime. Moreover, diffusion could also limit the amount of dust settling.
High-resolution ALMA observations could resolve the vertical distribution of CO
and CI, and thus constrain vertical mixing and the efficiency of CI shielding.
We also find that the CO and CI scale heights may not be good probes of the
mean molecular weight, and thus composition, of the gas. Finally, we show that
if mixing is strong the CO lifetime might not be long enough for CO to spread
interior to the planetesimal belt where gas is produced.

an intricate structure which must be defined by the magnetic field. Applied to
quiet Sun observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)/Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), a novel method reveals a cellular network, with cells of
typical diameters 50\arcsec\ in the cool 304\AA\ channel, and 100\arcsec\ in
the coronal 193\AA\ channel. The 193\AA\ cells can overlie several 304\AA\
cells, although both channels share common source and sink regions. The sources
are points, or narrow corridors, of divergence that occupy the centres of
cells. They are significantly aligned with photospheric network features and
enhanced magnetic elements. This shows that the bright network is important to
the production of PDs, and confirms that the network is host to the source
footpoint of quiet coronal loops. The other footpoint, or the sinks of the PDs,
form the boundaries of the coronal cells. These are not significantly aligned
with the photospheric network - they are generally situated above the dark
internetwork photosphere. They form compact points or corridors, often without
an obvious signature in the underlying photosphere. We argue that these sink
points can either be concentrations of closed field footpoints associated with
minor magnetic elements in the internetwork, or concentrations of
upward-aligned open field. The link between the coronal velocity and magnetic
fields is strengthened by a comparison with a magnetic extrapolation, which
shows several general and specific similarities, thus the velocity maps offer a
valuable additional constraint on models.

is restricted to clean data that lie exactly in subspaces. Real data often
suffer from noise and they may lie close to subspaces. In this paper, we show
that an optimal solution to the optimization problem of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC
achieves subspace detection property (SDP), a key element with which data from
different subspaces are separated, under deterministic and semi-random model.
Our results provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness of noisy
$\ell^{0}$-SSC in terms of SDP on noisy data for the first time, which reveals
the advantage of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC in terms of much less restrictive
condition on subspace affinity. In order to improve the efficiency of noisy
$\ell^{0}$-SSC, we propose Noisy-DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC which provably recovers the
subspaces on dimensionality reduced data. Noisy-DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC first
projects the data onto a lower dimensional space by random projection, then
performs noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC on the projected data for improved efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Noisy-DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC.

identification, is an important biometric technology. Recent gait recognition
methods focus on learning the pattern of human movement or appearance during

However, different individuals have their own laws of movement patterns, simple
spatial-temporal features are difficult to describe changes in motion of human
parts, especially when confounding variables such as clothing and carrying are
included, thus distinguishability of features is reduced. In this paper, we
propose the Motion Excitation Module (MEM) to guide spatio-temporal features to
focus on human parts with large dynamic changes, MEM learns the difference
information between frames and intervals, so as to obtain the representation of
temporal motion changes, it is worth mentioning that MEM can adapt to frame
sequences with uncertain length, and it does not add any additional parameters.
Furthermore, we present the Fine Feature Extractor (FFE), which independently
learns the spatio-temporal representations of human body according to different
horizontal parts of individuals. Benefiting from MEM and FFE, our method
innovatively combines motion change information, significantly improving the
performance of the model under cross appearance conditions. On the popular

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on node
classification tasks in a semi-supervised learning setting. However, as in the
simpler homogeneous GNN case, message-passing-based heterogeneous GNNs may
struggle to balance between resisting the oversmoothing that may occur in deep
models, and capturing long-range dependencies of graph structured data.
Moreover, the complexity of this trade-off is compounded in the heterogeneous
graph case due to the disparate heterophily relationships between nodes of
different types. To address these issues, we propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture in which layers are derived from optimization steps that descend a
novel relation-aware energy function. The corresponding minimizer is fully
differentiable with respect to the energy function parameters, such that
bilevel optimization can be applied to effectively learn a functional form
whose minimum provides optimal node representations for subsequent
classification tasks. In particular, this methodology allows us to model
diverse heterophily relationships between different node types while avoiding
oversmoothing effects. Experimental results on 8 heterogeneous graph benchmarks
demonstrates that our proposed method can achieve competitive node

between these three concepts. This trade-off particularly reveals that (1)
under a global symmetry, any attempt to induce local dynamics that change the
conserved quantity will cause inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such
irreversibility could be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our fundamental
relation also admits broad applications in physics and quantum information
processing. In the context of thermodynamics, we derive a trade-off relation
between entropy production and quantum coherence in arbitrary isothermal
processes. We also apply our relation to black hole physics and obtain a
universal lower bound on how many bits of classical information thrown into a
black hole become unreadable under the Hayden-Preskill model with the energy
conservation law. This particularly shows that when the black hole is large
enough, under suitable encoding, at least about $m/4$ bits of the thrown $m$
bits will be irrecoverable until 99 percent of the black hole evaporates. As an
application to quantum information processing, we provide a lower bound on the
coherence cost to implement an arbitrary quantum channel. We employ this bound
to obtain a quantitative Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem that comes with a clear
operational meaning, as well as an error-coherence trade-off for unitary gate
implementation and an error lower bound for approximate error correction with

comprehension experiments published between 1979 and 2019. By systematically
structuring the design characteristics of code comprehension studies, we
provide a basis for subsequent discussion of the huge diversity of design
options in the face of a lack of basic research on their consequences and
comparability. We describe what topics have been studied, as well as how these
studies have been designed, conducted, and reported. Frequently chosen design
options and deficiencies are pointed out. We conclude with five concrete action
items that we as a research community should address moving forward to improve
publications of code comprehension experiments.

log-optimal investment. We study the problem of a saver whose core portfolio
consists in unlevered (1x) retirement plans with no access to margin debt.
However, the agent has a satellite investment account with recourse to
significant, but not unlimited, leverage; accordingly, we study optimal
controllers for the satellite gearing ratio. On a very short time horizon, the
best policy is to overbet the satellite, whereby the overriding objective is to
raise the aggregate beta toward a growth-optimal level. On an infinite horizon,
by contrast, the correct behavior is to blithely ignore the core and optimize
the exponential growth rate of the satellite, which will anyways come to
dominate the entire bankroll in the limit. For time horizons strictly between
zero and infinity, the optimal strategy is not so simple: there is a key
trade-off between the instantaneous growth rate of the composite bankroll, and
that of the satellite itself, which suffers ongoing volatility drag from the
overbetting. Thus, a very perspicacious policy is called for, since any losses
in the satellite will constrain the agent's access to leverage in the
continuation problem. We characterize the optimal feedback controller, and
compute it in earnest by solving the corresponding HJB equation recursively and
backward in time. This solution is then compared to the best open-loop
controller, which, in spite of its relative simplicity, is expected to perform
similarly in practical situations.

square error (RMSE) to learn and report their models' capabilities. This focus
on quantitative error metrics tends to ignore the more important behavioral
aspect of the models, raising the question of whether these models really
predict human-like behavior. Thus, we propose to analyze the output of
machine-learned models much like we would analyze human data in conventional
behavioral research. We introduce quantitative metrics to demonstrate presence
of three different behavioral phenomena in a naturalistic highway driving
dataset: 1) The kinematics-dependence of who passes a merging point first 2)
Lane change by an on-highway vehicle to accommodate an on-ramp vehicle 3) Lane
changes by vehicles on the highway to avoid lead vehicle conflicts. Then, we
analyze the behavior of three machine-learned models using the same metrics.
Even though the models' RMSE value differed, all the models captured the
kinematic-dependent merging behavior but struggled at varying degrees to
capture the more nuanced courtesy lane change and highway lane change behavior.
Additionally, the collision aversion analysis during lane changes showed that
the models struggled to capture the physical aspect of human driving: leaving
adequate gap between the vehicles. Thus, our analysis highlighted the
inadequacy of simple quantitative metrics and the need to take a broader
behavioral perspective when analyzing machine-learned models of human driving
predictions.

assigns a time-label to each edge in $E$. A path in $G$ with non-decreasing
time-labels is called temporal path and the distance from $u$ to $v$ is the
minimum length (i.e., the number of edges) of a temporal path from $u$ to $v$.
A temporal $\alpha$-spanner of $G$ is a (temporal) subgraph $H$ that preserves
the distances between any pair of vertices in $V$, up to a multiplicative
stretch factor of $\alpha$. The size of $H$ is the number of its edges.
  In this work we study the size-stretch trade-offs of temporal spanners. We
show that temporal cliques always admit a temporal $(2k-1)-$spanner with
$\tilde{O}(kn^{1+\frac{1}{k}})$ edges, where $k>1$ is an integer parameter of
choice. Choosing $k=\lfloor\log n\rfloor$, we obtain a temporal $O(\log
n)$-spanner with $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges that has almost the same size (up to
logarithmic factors) as the temporal spanner in [Casteigts et al., JCSS 2021]
which only preserves temporal connectivity.
  We then consider general temporal graphs. Since $\Omega(n^2)$ edges might be
needed by any connectivity-preserving temporal subgraph [Axiotis et al.,
ICALP'16], we focus on approximating distances from a single source. We show
that $\tilde{O}(n/\log(1+\varepsilon))$ edges suffice to obtain a stretch of
$(1+\varepsilon)$, for any small $\varepsilon>0$. This result is essentially
tight since there are temporal graphs for which any temporal subgraph
preserving exact distances from a single-source must use $\Omega(n^2)$ edges.
We extend our analysis to prove an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^2/\beta)$ on the
size of any temporal $\beta$-additive spanner, which is tight up to
polylogarithmic factors.
  Finally, we investigate how the lifetime of $G$, i.e., the number of its
distinct time-labels, affects the trade-off between the size and the stretch of
a temporal spanner.

Recent advances in deep learning and neural network-based optimization have
contributed to the development of methods that can help solve control problems

neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) provides an efficient
means to iteratively approximate continuous time control functions associated

network structure and optimizers on learning performance is still very limited.
Our work aims at addressing some of these knowledge gaps to conduct efficient

ability of neural networks to learn optimal control functions. Using analytical

predictive models. In this paper we develop a new analytic framework to analyze
noise-averaged properties of mini-batch SGD for linear models at constant
learning rates, momenta and sizes of batches. Our key idea is to consider the
dynamics of the second moments of model parameters for a special family of
""Spectrally Expressible"" approximations. This allows to obtain an explicit
expression for the generating function of the sequence of loss values. By
analyzing this generating function, we find, in particular, that 1) the SGD
dynamics exhibits several convergent and divergent regimes depending on the
spectral distributions of the problem; 2) the convergent regimes admit explicit
stability conditions, and explicit loss asymptotics in the case of power-law
spectral distributions; 3) the optimal convergence rate can be achieved at
negative momenta. We verify our theoretical predictions by extensive
experiments with MNIST, CIFAR10 and synthetic problems, and find a good
quantitative agreement.

eXplanation-based Counterfactual Retraining (XCR), which extracts feature
importance fastly. XCR applies the explanations generated by the XAI model as
counterfactual input to retrain the black-box model to address OOD and social
misalignment problems. Evaluation of popular image datasets shows that XCR can
improve model performance when only retaining 12.5% of the most crucial
features without changing the black-box model structure. Furthermore, the
evaluation of the benchmark of corruption datasets shows that the XCR is very
helpful for improving model robustness and positively impacts the calibration
of OOD problems. Even though not calibrated in the validation set like some OOD
calibration methods, the corrupted data metric outperforms existing methods.
Our method also beats current OOD calibration methods on the OOD calibration

interest. We assessed the performance of four optimized variants of the U-Net
architecture with truncation of its depth and addition of attention layers
(U-Net_AL). The corresponding results were compared to those from a patch-based
convolutional neural network (CNN) we previously designed. The segmentation
quality was assessed on the basis of a comparative analysis with manual
segmentation using several morphological (2D DSC, 3D DSC, precision) and a
volumetric metrics. The four networks outperformed the patch-based CNN in terms
of segmentation homogeneity and quality. The median 3D DSC value computed with
the U-Net_AL (0.817) was significantly larger than the corresponding DSC values
computed with the other networks. In addition, the U-Net_AL CNN provided the
lowest mean volume error (17%) and the highest Pearson correlation coefficient
(0.765) with respect to the ground truth. Of interest, the reproducibility
computed from using U-Net_AL was larger than the reproducibility of the manual
segmentation. U-net convolutional neural network with additional attention
layers provides the best wrist cartilage segmentation performance. In order to
be used in clinical conditions, the trained network can be fine-tuned on a
dataset representing a group of specific patients. The error of cartilage
volume measurement should be assessed independently using a non-MRI method.

cohesive groups. Whether suspended in the air (like honey bee clusters), built
on the ground (such as army ant bridges), or immersed in water (such as sludge
worm blobs), these collectives serve a multitude of biological functions, from
protection against predation to the ability to maintain a relatively desirable
local environment despite a variable ambient environment. In this review, we
survey dense aggregations of a variety of insects, other arthropods, and worms
from a soft matter standpoint. An aggregation can be orders of magnitude larger
than its individual organisms, consisting of tens to hundreds of thousands of
individuals, and yet functions as a coherent entity. Understanding how
aggregating organisms coordinate with one another to form a superorganism
requires an interdisciplinary approach. We discuss how the physics of the
aggregation can yield additional insights to those gained from ecological and
physiological considerations, given that the aggregating individuals exchange
information, energy, and matter continually with the environment and one
another. While the connection between animal aggregations and the physics of
non-living materials has been proposed since the early 1900s, the recent advent
of physics of behavior studies provides new insights into social interactions
governed by physical principles. Current efforts focus on eusocial insects;
however, we show that these may just be the tip of an iceberg of superorganisms
that take advantage of physical interactions and simple behavioral rules to
adapt to changing environments. By bringing attention to a wide range of
invertebrate aggregations, we wish to inspire a new generation of scientists to
explore collective dynamics and bring a deeper understanding of the physics of

found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple

complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization,
which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group

so far been leveraged in isolation by existing works. In this paper, we propose
CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of

annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-view CH K-Means
clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific
embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering

exploits the invariance of causal mechanisms across environments to achieve
fast and modular adaptation. By causally factorising a transition model, VCD is
able to identify reusable components across different environments. This is
achieved by combining causal discovery and variational inference to learn a
latent representation and transition model jointly in an unsupervised manner.
Specifically, we optimise the evidence lower bound jointly over a
representation model and a transition model structured as a causal graphical

observations, we show that VCD is able to successfully identify causal
variables, and to discover consistent causal structures across different

that, in the absence of monetary transfers, Pareto efficient and truthful rules

and efficiency under a relaxation of truthfulness called non-obvious
manipulability (NOM), recently proposed by Troyan and Morrill. We show that
this relaxation allows us to bypass the aforementioned negative results in a
very strong sense. Specifically, we prove that there are deterministic and EF1
algorithms that are not obviously manipulable, and the algorithm that maximizes
utilitarian social welfare (the sum of agents' utilities), which is Pareto
efficient but not dictatorial, is not obviously manipulable for $n \geq 3$
agents (but obviously manipulable for $n=2$ agents). At the same time,
maximizing the egalitarian social welfare (the minimum of agents' utilities) or
the Nash social welfare (the product of agents' utilities) is obviously
manipulable for any number of agents and items. Our main result is an
approximation preserving black-box reduction from the problem of designing EF1

work we numerically simulate a spherical monolayer of soft repulsive
spherocylinders (SRS) and study the packing of rods and their ordering
transition as a function of the packing fraction. In the model that we study,
centers of mass of the spherocylinders (situated at their geometric centers)
are constrained to move on a spherical surface. The spherocylinders are free to
rotate about any axis that passes through their respective centers of mass. We
show that at relatively lower packing fractions, there is a continuous
transition from a disordered fluid to a novel, orientationally ordered,
spherical fluid monolayer as the packing fractions is increased. This monolayer
of orientationally ordered SRS particles resembles a hedgehog -- long axes of
the SRS particles are aligned along the local normal to the sphere. At higher
packing fractions, system undergoes transition to the solid phase, which is
riddled with topological point defects (disclinations) and grain boundaries
that divide the whole surface into several domains.

frequencies of circular equatorial orbits under a change of the SSC in the Kerr

prograde and retrograde orbital frequencies, when these frequencies are
expanded in power series of the spin measure and the centroid of the body is
shifted from the Mathisson-Pirani or the Ohashi-Kyrian-Semerak frame to the
Tulczyjew-Dixon one. Since in Paper I, we have seen that the innermost stable
circular orbits (ISCOs) hold a special place in this comparison process, we
focus on them rigorously in this work. We introduce a novel method of finding
ISCOs for any SSC and employ it for the Tulczyjew-Dixon and the
Mathisson-Pirani formalisms. We resort to numerical investigation of the
convergence between the SSCs for the ISCO case, due to technical difficulties
not allowing Paper's I analytical treatment. Our conclusion, as in Paper I, is
that there appears to be a convergence in the power series of the frequencies
between the SSCs, which is improved when the proper shifts are taken into
account, but there exists a limit in this convergence due to the fact that in
the spinning body approximation we consider only the first two lower multipoles

extensively studied in recent years. The $2010$ paper [12] of Hambly and Lyons
showed that the signature is injective on the space of continuous
finite-variation paths up to a general notion of reparameterisation called
tree-like equivalence. The signature has been widely used in applications,
underpinned by the result [15] that guarantees uniform approximation of a
continuous function on a compact set by a linear functional of the signature.
  We study in detail, and for the first time, the properties of three candidate
topologies on the set of unparameterised paths (the tree-like equivalence
classes). These are obtained through properties of the signature and are: (1)
the product topology, obtained by equipping the tensor algebra with the product
topology and requiring $S$ to be an embedding, (2) the quotient topology
derived from the 1-variation topology on the underlying path space, and (3) the
metric topology associated to $d( [ \gamma] ,[ \sigma] ) := \vert\vert
\gamma^*-\sigma^*\vert\vert_{1}$ using suitable representatives $\gamma^*$ and
$\sigma^*$ of the equivalence classes. The topologies are ordered by strict
inclusion, (1) being the weakest and (3) the strongest. Each is separable and
Hausdorff, (1) being both metrisable and $\sigma$-compact, but not a Baire
space and so neither Polish nor locally compact. The quotient topology (2) is
not metrisable and the metric $d$ is not complete.
  An important function on (unparameterised) path space is the (fixed-time)
solution map of a controlled differential equation. For a broad class of such
equations, we prove measurability of this map for each topology. Under stronger
regularity assumptions, we show continuity on explicit compact subsets of the
product topology (1). We relate these results to the expected signature model
of [15].

the inferred Period-Radius, Period-Mass-Radius, and
Period-Mass-Luminosity-Temperature relations on the input parameters is

instability strip getting redder as the metallicity increases is confirmed for
the additional ML assumptions and mixing length values. From the obtained
multi-filter light curves, we derive mean magnitudes and colors and in turn
Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Wesenheit relations for each assumed
chemical composition, mass-luminosity relation and efficiency of
super-adiabatic convection. Application to a well-studied sample of Cepheids in
the Large Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the dependence of the
inferred distance modulus on the assumed mass-luminosity relation, and the
inclusion of the metallicity term in the derivation of Period-Wesenheit
relations allows us, for each assumed mass-luminosity relation, to predict the
metallicity dependence of the Cepheid distance scale. The obtained
metal-dependent Period-Wesenheit relations are compared with recent results in
the literature and applied to a sample of Gaia Early Data Release 3 Galactic
Cepheids with known metal abundances to derive individual parallaxes. The

diffusive. The scattering from phonons and impurities have been postulated to
be the two factors critical in causing the diffusive transport. In this work,
we evaluate the transport process by incorporating a bath of phonons and
impurities in order to understand the role played by each of the factors. While
methods like time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) can be
used to simulate isolated spin chains, the coupling with phonons make
simulations significantly more challenging. The recently developed multisite
tensor network path integral (MS-TNPI) method builds a framework for simulating
the dynamics in extended open quantum systems by combining ideas from tDMRG and
Feynman-Vernon influence functional. This MS-TNPI is used to characterize
dynamics in open, extended quantum systems. Simulations are done with the
commonly used sub-Ohmic, Ohmic and super-Ohmic spectral densities describing
the phononic bath. We show that while the transport in presence of impurities
eventually becomes diffusive, the exact details are dependent on the specifics
of the interactions and amount of impurities. In contrast, the presence of a

to the full data set relies on imputation which often leads to biased results

approach, called sharing pattern submodels, which i) makes predictions that are
robust to missing values at test time, ii) maintains or improves the predictive

interpretability. Parameter sharing is enforced through sparsity-inducing

evolution. They provide essential ionizations, dissociations, heating and
energy to the cold, dense cores. As cosmic rays pierce through the clouds they
are attenuated and lose energy, which leads to a dependency on the column
density of a system. The detailed effects these particles have on the central
regions still needs to be fully understood. Here, we revisit how cosmic rays
are treated in the UCLCHEM chemical modeling code by including both ionization
rate and H2 dissociation rate dependencies alongside the production of cosmic
ray induced excited species and we study in detail the effects of these
treatments on the chemistry of pre-stellar cores. We find that these treatments
can have significant effects on chemical abundances, up to several orders of
magnitude, depending on physical conditions. The ionization dependency is the
most significant treatment, influencing chemical abundances through increased
presence of ionized species, grain desorptions and enhanced chemical reactions.
Comparisons to chemical abundances derived from observations show the new
treatments reproduce these observations better than the standard handling. It
is clear that more advanced treatments of cosmic rays are essential to chemical
models and that including this type of dependency provides more accurate

In this paper, we show that when modeling one-dimensional conditional densities

applying it to realistic, high-dimensional density estimation tasks:
likelihood-based generative modeling on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and density

modelled under the assumption of LTE and population diagrams are derived for
positions at various distances to the south and west from the continuum peak.
Based on this analysis, resolved COM rotation temperature and COM abundance
profiles are derived. Based on the morphology, a rough separation into O- and
N-bearing COMs can be done. Temperature profiles are in agreement with
expectations of protostellar heating of an envelope with optically thick dust.
Abundance profiles reflect a similar trend as seen in the morphology and, to a
great extent, agree with results of astrochemical models that, besides the
co-desorption with water, predict that O-bearing COMs are mainly formed on dust
grain surfaces at low temperatures while at least some N-bearing COMs and
CH$_3$CHO are substantially formed in the gas phase at higher temperatures. Our
observational results, in comparison with model predictions, suggest that COMs
that are exclusively or to a great extent formed on dust grains desorb
thermally at ~100 K from the grain surface likely alongside water. Non-zero
abundance values below ~100 K suggest that another desorption process is at
work at these low temperatures: either non-thermal desorption or partial
thermal desorption related to lower binding energies experienced by COMs in the
outer, water-poor ice layers. In either case, this is the first time that the
transition between two regimes of COM desorption has been resolved in a hot

source and target image distributions in an embedded space using optimal

label shift between domains. In this work, we mitigate negative alignment by
explaining it as a noisy label assignment to target images. We then mitigate
its effect by appropriate regularization. We propose to couple the MixUp

  accepted to CTRLGEN Workshop@Neurips2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Linking neural representations to linguistic factors is crucial in order to
build and analyze NLP models interpretable by humans. Among these factors,
syntactic roles (e.g. subjects, direct objects,$\dots$) and their realizations
are essential markers since they can be understood as a decomposition of
predicative structures and thus the meaning of sentences. Starting from a deep
probabilistic generative model with attention, we measure the interaction
between latent variables and realizations of syntactic roles and show that it
is possible to obtain, without supervision, representations of sentences where
different syntactic roles correspond to clearly identified different latent
variables. The probabilistic model we propose is an Attention-Driven
Variational Autoencoder (ADVAE). Drawing inspiration from Transformer-based
machine translation models, ADVAEs enable the analysis of the interactions
between latent variables and input tokens through attention. We also develop an
evaluation protocol to measure disentanglement with regard to the realizations
of syntactic roles. This protocol is based on attention maxima for the encoder
and on latent variable perturbations for the decoder. Our experiments on raw
English text from the SNLI dataset show that $\textit{i)}$ disentanglement of
syntactic roles can be induced without supervision, $\textit{ii)}$ ADVAE
separates syntactic roles better than classical sequence VAEs and Transformer
VAEs, $\textit{iii)}$ realizations of syntactic roles can be separately
modified in sentences by mere intervention on the associated latent variables.
Our work constitutes a first step towards unsupervised controllable content
generation. The code for our work is publicly available.

cosmological solution that can be used for any model with an arbitrary, but
well-defined, $f(R)$ function (just satisfying given perturbation conditions)
is derived. This perturbative solution shows how the Hubble parameter $H (t)$
depends on time (along with the cosmological constant and the matter density)
to adapt to the evolution of the Universe. To illustrate, this approach is
applied to some specific test models. One of these models appears to be more
realistic as it could describe three phases of the Universe's evolution.
  Despite the fact that the perturbation is applied for a flat FLWR geometry
(according to the current cosmological observation) indicates that the obtained

work for an early Universe. As a next step, the present method can be applied
to the case with a more general FLRW geometry to increase the precision of the
description of different stages in the evolution of the Universe.
  Finally, it is shown that in a desription of the Universe's evolution the
perturbative $f(R)$-theory can be considered as an effective GR with the

that the dominant contribution comes from dark matter halos with a mass close
to the Jeans mass, $M_{\mathrm{halo}}\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, around the redshift
$z \sim 3$. Therefore, the intensity of the free-free emission is sensitive to
the small-scale primordial curvature perturbations that form such small-mass

free-free emission observed in the high galactic region, we find that the

dissipative behavior in material media inevitably implies the existence of
dispersion, i.e., a frequency dependence in the constitutive equations.
Basically, the relations are the frequency-domain expression of causality and
correspond mathematically to pairs of Hilbert transforms. The relations have
many forms and can be obtained with diverse mathematical tools. Here, two
different demonstrations are given in the electromagnetic case, illustrating
the eclectic mathematical apparatus available for this purpose. Then, we apply
the acoustic (mechanical)-electromagnetic analogy to obtain the elastic
versions. Finally, we discuss the concepts of stability and passivity and
provide a novel algorithm to compute the relations numerically by using the
fast Fourier transform.

are $SU(2)$ generators of a representation carried by the space of Pauli's
spinors determining the polarization of the plane wave solutions of Dirac's
equation. These operators are conserved via Noether theorem such that new
conserved polarization operators can be defined for various polarizations. The
corresponding one-particle operators of quantum theory are derived showing how
these are related to the isometry generators of the massive Dirac fermions of
any polarization, including momentum-dependent ones. In this manner, the
problem of separating conserved spin and orbital angular momentum operators is
solved naturally. Moreover, the operator proposed by Pryce as mass-center
coordinate is studied showing that after quantization this becomes in fact the
dipole one-particle operator. As an example, the quantities determining the
principal one-particle operators are derived for the first time in
momentum-helicity basis.

humans in a multi-armed bandit task, and shows signatures of model-based

rudimentary problem in camera-based advance driver assistance systems (ADAS).
Despite of the great achievement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
semantic segmentation task, the high computational efforts of CNN based methods
is still a challenging area. In recent work, we proposed a novel approach to
utilise the advantages of CNNs for the task of road segmentation at reasonable
computational effort. The runtime benefits from using irregular super pixels as
basis for the input for the CNN rather than the image grid, which tremendously
reduces the input size. Although, this method achieved remarkable low
computational time in both training and testing phases, the lower resolution of
the super pixel domain yields naturally lower accuracy compared to high cost
state of the art methods. In this work, we focus on a refinement of the road
segmentation utilising a Conditional Random Field (CRF).The refinement
procedure is limited to the super pixels touching the predicted road boundary
to keep the additional computational effort low. Reducing the input to the
super pixel domain allows the CNNs structure to stay small and efficient to
compute while keeping the advantage of convolutional layers and makes them
eligible for ADAS. Applying CRF compensate the trade off between accuracy and
computational efficiency. The proposed system obtained comparable performance
among the top performing algorithms on the KITTI road benchmark and its fast
inference makes it particularly suitable for realtime applications.

reliability of software systems. Unlike manual efforts that exploit all
available run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a
single type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make
effective use of the joint information among multi-source data. Consequently,
many false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system
anomalies, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study based on a large amount
of heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that
system anomalies could manifest distinctly in different data types. Thus,
integrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a
system's health status. In this context, we propose HADES, the first work to
effectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach
employs a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the
system status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures
discriminative features and meaningful interactions from multi-modal data via a
novel cross-modal attention module, enabling accurate system anomaly detection.
We evaluate HADES extensively on large-scale simulated and industrial datasets.
The experimental results present the superiority of HADES in detecting system
anomalies on heterogeneous data. We release the code and the annotated dataset
for reproducibility and future research.

impairments such as chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion (PMD)
in the digital signal processing. For cost-sensitive short-reach optical
networks, some advanced single-polarization (SP) optical field recovery schemes
are recently proposed to avoid chromatic dispersion-induced power fading
effect, and improve the spectral efficiency for larger potential capacity.
Polarization division multiplexing (PDM) can further double both the spectral
efficiency and the system capacity of these SP carrier-assisted direct
detection (DD) schemes. However, the so-called polarization fading phenomenon
induced by random polarization rotation is a fundamental obstacle which
prevents SP carrier-assisted DD systems from polarization diversity. In this
paper, we propose a receiver of Jones-space field recovery (JSFR) to realize
polarization diversity with SP carrier-assisted DD schemes in Jones space.
Different receiver structures and simplified recovery procedures for JSFR are
explored theoretically. The proposed JSFR pushes the SP DD schemes towards PDM
without extra optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty. In addition, the
JSFR shows good tolerance to PMD since the optical field recovery is conducted
before polarization recovery. In the concept-of-proof experiment, we
demonstrate 448-Gb/s reception over 80-km single-mode fiber using the proposed
JSFR based on 22 couplers. Furthermore, we qualitatively compare the optical
field recovery in Jones space and Stokes space from the perspective of the
modulation dimension. Qualitatively, we compare the optical field recovery in

reasonable choice for data passing when the appropriate number of functions is
