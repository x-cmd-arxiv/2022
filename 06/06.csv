hierarchical structure of data by learning high-level representations defined
in terms of low-level ones. In this paper we explore self-supervised learning
of hierarchical representations of speech by applying multiple levels of
Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). We observe that simply stacking two CPC
models does not yield significant improvements over single-level architectures.
Inspired by the fact that speech is often described as a sequence of discrete
units unevenly distributed in time, we propose a model in which the output of a
low-level CPC module is non-uniformly downsampled to directly minimize the loss
of a high-level CPC module. The latter is designed to also enforce a prior of
separability and discreteness in its representations by enforcing dissimilarity
of successive high-level representations through focused negative sampling, and
by quantization of the prediction targets. Accounting for the structure of the
speech signal improves upon single-level CPC features and enhances the
disentanglement of the learned representations, as measured by downstream
speech recognition tasks, while resulting in a meaningful segmentation of the
signal that closely resembles phone boundaries.

has been well described in the literature, modern research workflows often have
additional complexity in that related RNAseq experiments are performed
sequentially over time. The simplest and most widely used analysis strategy
ignores the temporal aspects and analyses each dataset separately. However,
this can lead to substantial inflation of the overall false discovery rate
(FDR). We propose applying recently developed methodology for online hypothesis
testing to analyse sequential RNAseq experiments in a principled way,
guaranteeing FDR control at all times while never changing past decisions.
Results: We show that standard offline approaches have variable control of FDR
of related RNAseq experiments over time and a naively composed approach may
improperly change historic decisions. We demonstrate that the online FDR
algorithms are a principled way to guarantee control of FDR. Furthermore, in
certain simulation scenarios, we observe empirically that online approaches
have comparable power to offline approaches. Availability and Implementation:

Especially the latter, which shows good numerical performance for large

the mesh motion technique is to a certain extent arbitrary and has no influence

to biological vision and fundamental particle physics. Information propagation
in a CNN is modeled via an analogy to an optical system, where information is
concentrated near a bottleneck where the 2D spatial resolution collapses about
a focal point $1\times 1=1$. A 3D space $(x,y,t)$ is defined by $(x,y)$
coordinates in the image plane and CNN layer $t$, where a principal ray
$(0,0,t)$ runs in the direction of information propagation through both the
optical axis and the image center pixel located at $(x,y)=(0,0)$, about which
the sharpest possible spatial focus is limited to a circle of confusion in the
image plane. Our novel insight is to model the principal optical ray $(0,0,t)$
as geometrically equivalent to the medial vector in the positive orthant
$I(x,y) \in R^{N+}$ of a $N$-channel activation space, e.g. along the greyscale
(or luminance) vector $(t,t,t)$ in $RGB$ colour space. Information is thus
concentrated into an energy potential $E(x,y,t)=\|I(x,y,t)\|^2$, which,
particularly for bottleneck layers $t$ of generic CNNs, is highly concentrated
and symmetric about the spatial origin $(0,0,t)$ and exhibits the well-known
""Sombrero"" potential of the boson particle. This symmetry is broken in
classification, where bottleneck layers of generic pre-trained CNN models
exhibit a consistent class-specific bias towards an angle $\theta \in U(1)$
defined simultaneously in the image plane and in activation feature space.
Initial observations validate our hypothesis from generic pre-trained CNN
activation maps and a bare-bones memory-based classification scheme, with no
training or tuning. Training from scratch using combined one-hot $+ U(1)$ loss
improves classification for all tasks tested including ImageNet.

decade, shaping methods evolved from passive phase plates to low-speed
electrostatic and magnetostatic displays. Recently, higher shaping speed and
flexibility have become feasible by the advent of ultrafast electron
microscopy, embodying a swift change of paradigm that relies on using light to
control free electrons. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that arbitrary
transverse modulation of electron beams is possible without the need for
designing and fabricating complicated electron-optics elements or material
nanostructures, but rather resorting to shaping light beams reflected from a
planar thin film. We demonstrate arbitrary transverse modulation of electron
wavepackets via inelastic interaction with a shaped ultrafast light field
controlled by an external spatial light modulator (SLM). We illustrate this
method by generating Hermite-Gaussian (HG) electron beams with HG10 and HG01
symmetry and discuss their possible use in enhancing the imaging contrast of
microscopic features. Relative to current schemes, our approach adopting an
external SLM dramatically widens the range of patterns that can be imprinted on
the electron wave function and makes electron shaping a much easier task to
perform.

sentences from around 30 multilingual websites. We compile a corpus of over
93,000 Kalaallisut sentences and over 140,000 Danish sentences, then use
cross-lingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbors search in
an attempt to mine near-translations from these corpora. Finally, we translate
the Danish sentence to English to obtain a synthetic Kalaallisut-English
aligned corpus. Although the resulting dataset is too small and noisy to
improve the pretrained MT model, we believe that with additional resources, we
could construct a better pseudoparallel corpus and achieve more promising
results on MT. We also note other possible uses of the monolingual Kalaallisut
data and discuss directions for future work. We make the code and data for our
experiments publicly available.

functions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for
alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences
between pairs of trajectory segments. These human preferences are typically
assumed to be informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each
segment. We find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling preferences
instead as arising from a different statistic: each segment's regret, a measure
of a segment's deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many
preferences generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a
reward function equivalent to the reward function that generated those
preferences. We also prove that the previous partial return model lacks this
identifiability property without preference noise that reveals rewards'
relative proportions, and we empirically show that our proposed regret
preference model outperforms it with finite training data in otherwise the same
setting. Additionally, our proposed regret preference model better predicts
real human preferences and also learns reward functions from these preferences
that lead to policies that are better human-aligned. Overall, this work
establishes that the choice of preference model is impactful, and our proposed
regret preference model provides an improvement upon a core assumption of
recent research.

Incorporating such thermal corrections opens up the possibility of dark matter
production via forbidden channels that remain kinematically disallowed in the

production of the dark matter in a minimally extended $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$

role of the dark matter is played by the scalar with a non-trivial charge under

a thermally corrected mass at high temperatures for a not-so-small
self-coupling. We show that the thermal correction to the dark matter mass

Although evidence of extensive review studies on HDR exists in the literature

Bengali handwritten digits along with a comprehensive insight of two decades of

requirements are an additional element to the decision making rationale, which
is typically driven by maximizing some utility function. In that sense,
algorithmic fairness can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem.
This paper contributes to the discussion on how to implement fairness, focusing
on the fairness concepts of positive predictive value (PPV) parity, false
omission rate (FOR) parity, and sufficiency (which combines the former two). We
show that group-specific threshold rules are optimal for PPV parity and FOR
parity, similar to well-known results for other group fairness criteria.
However, depending on the underlying population distributions and the utility
function, we find that sometimes an upper-bound threshold rule for one group is
optimal: utility maximization under PPV parity (or FOR parity) might thus lead
to selecting the individuals with the smallest utility for one group, instead
of selecting the most promising individuals. This result is counter-intuitive
and in contrast to the analogous solutions for statistical parity and equality
of opportunity. We also provide a solution for the optimal decision rules
satisfying the fairness constraint sufficiency. We show that more complex
decision rules are required and that this leads to within-group unfairness for
all but one of the groups. We illustrate our findings based on simulated and
real data.

ledger concept; however it has significant problems such as high transaction
fees and low throughput. Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced much
later, solves most of these problems with an innovative concept called
off-chain payments. With this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive
venue to perform micro-payments which can also be adopted in many IoT
applications (e.g., toll payments). Nevertheless, it is not feasible to host LN
and Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory, and processing
restrictions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure and efficient
protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through an untrusted
gateway node. Through this gateway which hosts the LN and Bitcoin nodes, the
IoT device can open & close LN channels and send & receive LN payments. This
delegation approach is powered by a threshold cryptography based scheme that
requires the IoT device and the LN gateway to jointly perform all LN
operations. Specifically, we propose thresholdizing LN's Bitcoin public and
private keys as well as its public and private keys for the new channel states
(i.e., commitment points). We prove with a game theoretical security analysis
that the IoT device is secure against collusion attacks. We implemented the
proposed protocol by changing LN's source code and thoroughly evaluated its
performance using several Raspberry Pis. Our evaluation results show that the
protocol; is fast, does not bring extra cost overhead, can be run on low data
rate wireless networks, is scalable and has negligible energy consumption
overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that implemented

the latter case, a consistent procedure to control the false discovery rate is
developed. The finite sample performance of the inference procedures introduced

realized for topological skyrmion phases under certain open boundary conditions
when their characteristic momentum-space spin textures trap topological
defects. They therefore serve as a second type of bulk-boundary correspondence
for the topological skyrmion phases. In the process of characterizing this
defect bulk-boundary correspondence, we develop recipes for constructing
physically-relevant model Hamiltonians for topological skyrmion phases,
efficient methods for computing the skyrmion number, and introduce

that allows GPU threads to execute additional GPU kernels, recursively. Apart
from making the programming of parallel hierarchical patterns easier, DP can
also speedup problems that exhibit a heterogeneous data layout by focusing,
through a subdivision process, the finite GPU resources on the sub-regions that
exhibit more parallelism. However, doing an optimal subdivision process is not
trivial, as there are different parameters that play an important role in the
final performance of DP. Moreover, the current programming abstraction for DP
also introduces an overhead that can penalize the final performance. In this
work we present a subdivision cost model for problems that exhibit self similar
density (SSD) workloads (such as fractals), in order understand what parameters
provide the fastest subdivision approach. Also, we introduce a new subdivision
implementation, named \textit{Adaptive Serial Kernels} (ASK), as a smaller
overhead alternative to CUDA's Dynamic Parallelism. Using the cost model on the
Mandelbrot Set as a case study shows that the optimal scheme is to start with
an initial subdivision between $g=[2,16]$, then keep subdividing in regions of
$r=2,4$, and stop when regions reach a size of $B \sim 32$. The experimental
results agree with the theoretical parameters, confirming the usability of the
cost model. In terms of performance, the proposed ASK approach runs up to $\sim
60\%$ faster than Dynamic Parallelism in the Mandelbrot set, and up to
$12\times$ faster than a basic exhaustive implementation, whereas DP is up to
$7.5\times$.

promising remedy of injecting instance noise into the discriminator input has

novel GAN framework that leverages a forward diffusion chain to generate
Gaussian-mixture distributed instance noise. Diffusion-GAN consists of three
components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion
timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and
generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each
diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the
timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data
from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator's
feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length
is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically
show that the discriminator's timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and
helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data
distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-GAN over strong GAN
baselines on various datasets, showing that it can produce more realistic

a one-dimensional renewal point process with inter-distances between points

characterization of the law of the first-ladder height $Y_{\mathcal{T}}$ and
length $L_{\mathcal{T}}(Y)$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the first-passage time of
$Y$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$. The study relies on the construction of a broader class
of processes, denoted \emph{Random Walks in Random Scenery on Bonds} (RWRSB)
that we briefly describe. The scenery is constructed by associating two random
variables with each bond of $\mathbb{Z}$, corresponding to the two possible
crossing directions of that bond. A random walk $S$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d
increments collects the scenery values of the bond it traverses: we denote this
composite process the RWRSB. Under suitable assumptions, we characterize the
tail distribution of the sum of scenery values collected up to the first exit

of the first-ladder length and height of $Y$. The main tools of investigation
are a generalized Spitzer-Baxter identity, that we derive along the proof, and
a suitable representation of the RWRSB in terms of local times of the random
walk $S$. All these results are easily generalized to the entire sequence of

conceptual model that reflects the knowledge about its domain as well as
knowledge about the functions it has to perform. In software engineering,
conceptual modeling has gained importance as a discipline that offers
languages, methods, and methodologies to address the complexity of software
development. The key to understanding such complexity is using tools such as
diagrams at various levels of representation. A conceptual model must include
all relevant static and behavioral aspects of its domain. In UML, the static
aspects include structural diagrams that represent the internal architecture of
a system with a special focus on the classes, the connections and interactions
that they have, and integrity constraints over the state of the domain. UML
does not have sufficient expressiveness for complete specifications of certain
constraints. Constraints assist in analyzing permissible design requirements
and the limitations of the intended functions. To overcome the limitations of
the graphical notation, other types of languages are used to complement the
diagrammatic language (e.g., the textual Object Constraint Language [OCL]). In
this paper, we study how to express constraints diagrammatically using the
thinging machine (TM) through examples taken from the UML/OCL literature. This
would contribute to further understanding the notion of constraint in
conceptual modeling. It also demonstrates the expressiveness and limitation of
the TM. The paper suggests that the TM can provide a diagrammatic constraints
language in conceptual models.

evolution of biological forms in a universe determined by fixed laws. These
laws underpin the origin of life, evolution, human culture and technology, as
set by the boundary conditions of the universe, however these laws cannot
predict the emergence of these things. By contrast evolutionary theory works in
the opposite direction, indicating how selection can explain why some things
exist and not others. To understand how open-ended forms can emerge in a
forward-process from physics that does not include their design, a new approach
to understand the non-biological to biological transition is necessary. Herein,
we present a new theory, Assembly Theory (AT), which explains and quantifies
the emergence of selection and evolution. In AT, the complexity of an
individual observable object is measured by its Assembly Index (a), defined as
the minimal number of steps needed to construct the object from basic building
blocks. Combining a with the copy number defines a new quantity called Assembly
which quantifies the amount of selection required to produce a given ensemble
of objects. We investigate the internal structure and properties of assembly
space and quantify the dynamics of undirected exploratory processes as compared
to the directed processes that emerge from selection. The implementation of
assembly theory allows the emergence of selection in physical systems to be
quantified at any scale as the transition from undirected-discovery dynamics to
a selected process within the assembly space. This yields a mechanism for the
onset of selection and evolution and a formal approach to defining life.
Because the assembly of an object is easily calculable and measurable it is
possible to quantify a lower limit on the amount of selection and memory
required to produce complexity uniquely linked to biology in the universe.

kinds of imperfections are uncertainty, imprecision, vagueness, incompleteness,
inconsistency, and context-dependency which can be handled pretty well by our
brain. Basic approaches like probability theory and standard logic are
intrinsically inefficient in modeling fallacious minds. The generalized
probability and nonstandard logic theories have epistemological motivations to
provide better models for information integration in cognitive agents. Among
many models of them, possibility theory and probabilistic logic theory are the
best approaches. I argue, based on a review of different approaches to
Imperfect Information Management, that a good framework for it is the Situation
theory of Barwise and the Channel theory of Barwise-Seligman. These theories
have relied on a powerful and unique epistemological-based notion of
information to refer to partiality. These frameworks have a proper approach for
context modeling to handle common knowledge and incomplete information. Also,
they distinguish belief from knowledge clearly to model the non-monotonic and
dynamic nature of knowledge. They discern the logic of the world from
information flow in the mind. The objectification process in these theories
reveals to us the nature of default or probabilistic rules in perceptions. The
concept of the channel can be used to represent those types of reasoning
mechanisms that move from one model or logic to another one. The imprecision in
our perceptions causes fuzziness in reasoning and vagueness in communication
that can be represented by some suitable classifications connected by some
channels. This new framework like a network framework can provide a scalable
and open framework to cover different models based on a relativistic notion of

domain shifts between source and target domains, by applying a well-performed
model in an unlabeled target domain via supervision of a labeled source domain.
Recent literature, however, has indicated that the performance is still far
from satisfactory in the presence of significant domain shifts. Nonetheless,
delineating a few target samples is usually manageable and particularly
worthwhile, due to the substantial performance gain. Inspired by this, we aim
to develop semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for medical image
segmentation, which is largely underexplored. We, thus, propose to exploit both
labeled source and target domain data, in addition to unlabeled target data in
a unified manner. Specifically, we present a novel asymmetric co-training (ACT)
framework to integrate these subsets and avoid the domination of the source
domain data. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, we explicitly decouple
the label supervisions in SSDA into two asymmetric sub-tasks, including
semi-supervised learning (SSL) and UDA, and leverage different knowledge from
two segmentors to take into account the distinction between the source and
target label supervisions. The knowledge learned in the two modules is then
adaptively integrated with ACT, by iteratively teaching each other, based on
the confidence-aware pseudo-label. In addition, pseudo label noise is
well-controlled with an exponential MixUp decay scheme for smooth propagation.
Experiments on cross-modality brain tumor MRI segmentation tasks using the
BraTS18 database showed, even with limited labeled target samples, ACT yielded

which in turn supports stable (2+1)D spatial optical SMs, as well as
ring-shaped soliton necklaces, including rotating ones. They feature a large
size, low generation power, and can be efficiently manipulated by tuning the
nonlocality degree of the Kerr nonlinearity. Stable (3+1)D spatiotemporal
optical SMs, composed of fundamental or vortex solitons, with low power and
ultraslow propagation velocity, can also be generated in the system. These SMs
can be stored and retrieved through the switching off and on of the control
laser field. The findings reported here suggest applications to data processing

used the log-rank test followed by the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model to
estimate the hazard ratio between the treatment groups. These are valid under
the assumption that the right-censoring mechanism is non-informative, i.e.
independent of the time-to-event of interest within each treatment group. More
generally, the censoring time might depend on additional covariates, and
inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) can be used to correct for
the bias resulting from the informative censoring. IPCW requires a correctly
specified censoring time model conditional on the treatment and the covariates.
Doubly robust inference in this setting has not been plausible previously due
to the non-collapsibility of the Cox model. However, with the recent
development of data-adaptive machine learning methods we derive an augmented
IPCW (AIPCW) estimator that has the following doubly robust (DR) properties: it
is model doubly robust, in that it is consistent and asymptotic normal (CAN),
as long as one of the two models, one for the failure time and one for the
censoring time, is correctly specified; it is also rate doubly robust, in that
it is CAN as long as the product of the estimation error rates under these two
models is faster than root-$n$. We investigate the AIPCW estimator using
extensive simulation in finite samples.

seizure the electrical activity in one or more regions in the brain becomes
correlated, we use neural MI estimators to measure inter-channel statistical
dependence. We also design a 1D CNN to extract additional features from raw EEG
signals. Since the soft estimates obtained as the combined features from the
neural MI estimator and the CNN do not capture the temporal correlation between
different EEG blocks, we use them not as estimates of the seizure state, but to
compute the function nodes of a factor graph. The resulting factor graphs
allows structured inference which exploits the temporal correlation for further
improving the detection performance. On public CHB-MIT database, We conduct
three evaluation approaches using the public CHB-MIT database, including 6-fold
leave-four-patients-out cross-validation, all patient training; and per patient

offers the starting point for the validation of various quantum devices. One of
the central tasks in the field of state tomography is to reconstruct with high
fidelity, the quantum states of a quantum system. From an experiment on a real
quantum device, one can obtain the mean measurement values of different
operators. With such a data as input, in this report we employ the maximal
entropy formalism to construct the least biased mixed quantum state that is
consistent with the given set of expectation values. Even though in principle,
the reported formalism is quite general and should work for an arbitrary set of
observables, in practice we shall demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on
an informationally complete (IC) set of Hermitian operators. Such a set
possesses the advantage of uniquely specifying a single quantum state from
which the experimental measurements have been sampled and hence renders the
rare opportunity to not only construct a least-biased quantum state but even
replicate the exact state prepared experimentally within a preset tolerance.
The primary workhorse of the algorithm is re-constructing an energy function
which we designate as the effective Hamiltonian of the system, and
parameterizing it with Lagrange multipliers, according to the formalism of
maximal entropy. These parameters are thereafter optimized variationally so
that the reconstructed quantum state of the system converges to the true
quantum state within an error threshold. To this end, we employ a parameterized
quantum circuit and a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm to obtain
such a target state making our recipe easily implementable on a near-term
quantum device.

applications. We demonstrate that motion planning problems such as minimum
constraint removal, belief-space planning, and visibility-aware motion planning
(VAMP) benefit from a path-dependent formulation, in which the state at a
search node is represented implicitly by the path to that node. A naive
approach to computing the feasibility of a successor node in such a
path-dependent formulation takes time linear in the path length to the node, in
contrast to a (possibly very large) constant time for a more typical search
formulation. For long-horizon plans, performing this linear-time computation,
which we call the lookback, for each node becomes prohibitive. To improve upon
this, we introduce the use of a fully persistent spatial data structure
(FPSDS), which bounds the size of the lookback. We then focus on the
application of the FPSDS in VAMP, which involves incremental geometric
computations that can be accelerated by filtering configurations with bounding
volumes using nearest-neighbor data structures. We demonstrate an asymptotic
and practical improvement in the runtime of finding VAMP solutions in several
illustrative domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a
fully persistent data structure for accelerating motion planning.

(i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and
usually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether
all negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an
Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative
contrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than
binary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more
semantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to
the positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a
more important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield
better performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global
semantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features
among the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During
the training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse
set of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation
boundaries and more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments across two
benchmark datasets and different unlabeled settings show that ACTION

coprime EMVS-MIMO radar is considered. Firstly, a 5-D tensor model was
constructed by using the multi-dimensional space-time characteristics of the
received data. Then, an 8-D tensor has been obtained by using the
auto-correlation calculation. To obtain the difference coarrays of transmit and
receive EMVS, the de-coupling process between the spatial response of EMVS and
the steering vector is inevitable. Thus, a new 6-D tensor can be constructed
via the tensor permutation and the generalized tensorization of the canonical
polyadic decomposition. {According} to the theory of the Tensor-Matrix Product
operation, the duplicated elements in the difference coarrays can be removed by
the utilization of two designed selection matrices. Due to the centrosymmetric
geometry of the difference coarrays, two DFT beamspace matrices were
subsequently designed to convert the complex steering matrices into the
real-valued ones, whose advantage is to improve the estimation accuracy of the
2D-DODs and 2D-DOAs. Afterwards, a third-order tensor with the third-way fixed
at 36 was constructed and the Parallel Factor algorithm was deployed, which can
yield the closed-form automatically paired 2D-DOD and 2D-DOA estimation. The
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can exhibit superior
estimation performance for the underdetermined 2D-DOD and 2D-DOA estimation.

water cloud are studied. Eulerian Lagrangian method involving two-way
gas-droplet coupling is applied. Different droplet (diameter, concentration)
and cloud (diameter) properties are considered. Results show that droplet size,
concentration and cloud radius have significant effects on peak pressure
trajectory of the detonation wave. Three propagation modes are identified:
perturbed propagation, leeward re-detonation, and detonation extinction.
Leeward re-detonation is analyzed from unsteady evolutions of gas and liquid
droplet quantities. The detonation is re-initiated by a local hot spot from
shock focusing of upper and lower diffracted detonations. Disintegration of
water droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the cloud. In
addition, detonation extinction is featured by quickly fading peak pressure
trajectories when the detonation wave passes the larger cloud, and no local
autoignition occurs in the shock focusing area. Evolutions of thermochemical
structures from the shocked area in an extinction process are also studied. The
transfer rates of mass, energy and momentum of detonation success and failure
are analyzed. Moreover, parametric studies demonstrate that the critical cloud
size to quench a detonation decreases when the droplet concentration is
increased. However, when the droplet concentration is beyond 0.84 kg/m3, the
critical cloud size is negligibly influenced due to small droplets. Two-phase
fluid interfacial instability is observed, and the mechanism of cloud evolution
is studied with the distributions of droplet, vorticity, density / pressure
gradient magnitudes, and gas velocity.

prove the coding theorems for linear codes, which unifies the channel coding
theorem, the source coding theorem and the joint source-channel coding (JSCC)
theorem. In the presented framework, the systematic bits and the corresponding
parity-check bits play different roles. Precisely, the noisy systematic bits
are used to limit the list size of typical codewords, while the noisy
parity-check bits are used to select from the list the maximum likelihood
codeword. This new framework for linear codes allows that the systematic bits
and the parity-check bits are transmitted in different ways and over different
channels. With this framework, we prove that the Bernoulli generator matrix
codes (BGMCs) are capacity-achieving over BIOS channels, entropy-achieving for
Bernoulli sources, and also system-capacity-achieving for JSCC applications. A
lower bound on the bit-error rate (BER) is derived for linear codes, which can
be used to predict the error floors and hence serves as a simple tool to design
the JSCC system. Numerical results show that the convolutional LDGM codes
perform well in the waterfall region and match well with the derived error
floors, which can be lowered down if required by simply increasing the encoding

low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites providing connections to the cloud server, an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and nearby base stations (BSs) providing edge
computing services are included. The UAV flies along a fixed trajectory to
collect tasks generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and forwards these
tasks to a BS or the cloud server for further processing. To facilitate
efficient processing, the UAV needs to decide where to offload as well as the
proportion of offloaded tasks. However, in practice, due to the variability of
environment and actual demand, the amount of arrival tasks is uncertain. If the
deterministic optimization is utilized to develop offloading strategy,
unnecessary system overhead or higher task drop rate may occur, which severely
damages the system robustness. To address this issue, we characterize the
uncertainty with a data-driven approach, and formulate a distributionally
robust optimization problem to minimize the expected energy-constrained system
latency under the worst-case probability distribution. Furthermore, the
distributionally robust latency optimization algorithm is proposed to reach the
suboptimal solution. Finally, we perform simulations on the realworld data set,
and compare with other benchmark schemes to verify the efficiency and

sequential user behaviors. In this way, item text can be directly utilized for

design the first asymptotic instance-optimal algorithm for general interactive

On \textit{every} instance $f$, our algorithm outperforms \emph{all} consistent

asymptotic regret $\mathcal{C}(f) \ln n$, where $\mathcal{C}(f)$ is an exact
characterization of the complexity of $f$. The key step of the algorithm
involves hypothesis testing with active data collection. It computes the most

transfer of ultrathin amorphous Ga$_2$O$_3$ synthesized on liquid Ga metal. A
comparison of temperature-dependent electrical measurements of millimetre-scale
passivated and bare graphene on SiO$_2$/Si indicate that the passivated
graphene maintains its high field effect mobility desirable for applications.
Surprisingly, the temperature-dependent resistivity is reduced in passivated
graphene over a range of temperatures below 220 K, due to the interplay of
screening of the surface optical phonon modes of the SiO$_2$ by
high-dielectric-constant Ga$_2$O$_3$, and the relatively high characteristic
phonon frequencies of Ga$_2$O$_3$. Raman spectroscopy and electrical
measurements indicate that Ga$_2$O$_3$ passivation also protects graphene from
further processing such as plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of
Al$_2$O$_3$.

impact on the thermal transport properties in non-metallic materials.
Understanding such effects requires the knowledge of defect phonon modes, which

characterization of phonons for the atomic-sized defects. Here, at the atomic
scale we directly measure the localized phonon modes of dislocations at a Si/Ge
interface using scanning transmission electron microscopy electron energy loss
spectroscopy. We find that the dislocation induces new phonon modes localized
within ~2-unit cells of the core, which experience a redshift of several
milli-electron-volts compared to the dislocation-free case. The observed
spectral features agree well with simulations. These localized modes are
expected to reduce the phonon transmission channels across the defect and thus
the local thermal conductivity. The revealed phonon modes localized at
dislocations may help us to improve the thermal properties in thermoelectric
generators and thermal management systems with proper defect engineering.

electron pair approximation (CEPA) methods can be constructed as simple
extensions of truncated configuration interaction (CI) that ensures size
extensivity. One of the major issues with the CEPA and its variants is that
singularities arise in the amplitude equations when the system starts to be
strongly correlated. In this work, we extend the traditional Slater
determinant-based coupled electron pair approaches like CEPA-0, averaged
coupled-pair functional (ACPF) and average quadratic coupled-cluster (AQCC) to
a new formulation based on tensor product states (TPS). We show that a TPS

destroy the accuracy of CEPA-based methods. A suitable TPS representation can
be formed by partitioning the system into separate disjoint clusters and
forming the final wavefunction as the tensor product of the many body states of
these clusters. We demonstrate the application of these methods on simple bond
breaking systems such as CH$_4$ and F$_2$ where determinant based CEPA methods
fail. We further apply the TPS-CEPA approach to stillbene isomerization and few

CLIP have shown impressive performance on various visual tasks. In this paper,
we propose to learn the rank concepts from the rich semantic CLIP latent space.
Specifically, we reformulate this task as an image-language matching problem
with a contrastive objective, which regards labels as text and obtains a
language prototype from a text encoder for each rank. While prompt engineering
for CLIP is extremely time-consuming, we propose OrdinalCLIP, a differentiable
prompting method for adapting CLIP for ordinal regression. OrdinalCLIP consists
of learnable context tokens and learnable rank embeddings; The learnable rank
embeddings are constructed by explicitly modeling numerical continuity,
resulting in well-ordered, compact language prototypes in the CLIP space. Once
learned, we can only save the language prototypes and discard the huge language
model, resulting in zero additional computational overhead compared with the
linear head counterpart. Experimental results show that our paradigm achieves
competitive performance in general ordinal regression tasks, and gains
improvements in few-shot and distribution shift settings for age estimation.

for each set $\Omega$ upon which $G$ acts faithfully, $G$ is the largest
subgroup of $\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ that leaves invariant each of the $G$-orbits
in the induced action on $\Omega\times\cdots\times \Omega=\Omega^k$. Each
finite group $G$ is totally $|G|$-closed, and $k(G)$ denotes the least integer
$k$ such that $G$ is totally $k$-closed. We address the question of determining
the closure number $k(G)$ for finite simple groups $G$. Prior to our work it
was known that $k(G)=2$ for cyclic groups of prime order and for precisely six
of the sporadic simple groups, and that $k(G)\geq3$ for all other finite simple
groups. We determine the value for the alternating groups, namely $k(A_n)=n-1$.
In addition, for all simple groups $G$, other than alternating groups and
classical groups, we show that $k(G)\leq 7$. Finally, if $G$ is a finite simple
classical group with natural module of dimension $n$, we show that $k(G)\leq
n+2$ if $n \ge 14$, and $k(G) \le \lfloor n/3 + 12 \rfloor$ otherwise, with
smaller bounds achieved by certain families of groups. This is achieved by
determining a uniform upper bound (depending on $n$ and the type of $G$) on the
base sizes of the primitive actions of $G$, based on known bounds for specific
actions. We pose several open problems aimed at completing the determination of
the closure numbers for finite simple groups.

video. At its core is understanding the alignments between visual scenes in
video and linguistic semantics in question to yield the answer. In leading
VideoQA models, the typical learning objective, empirical risk minimization
(ERM), latches on superficial correlations between video-question pairs and
answers as the alignments. However, ERM can be problematic, because it tends to
over-exploit the spurious correlations between question-irrelevant scenes and
answers, instead of inspecting the causal effect of question-critical scenes.
As a result, the VideoQA models suffer from unreliable reasoning. In this work,
we first take a causal look at VideoQA and argue that invariant grounding is
the key to ruling out the spurious correlations. Towards this end, we propose a
new learning framework, Invariant Grounding for VideoQA (IGV), to ground the
question-critical scene, whose causal relations with answers are invariant
across different interventions on the complement. With IGV, the VideoQA models
are forced to shield the answering process from the negative influence of
spurious correlations, which significantly improves the reasoning ability.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the superiority of IGV in
terms of accuracy, visual explainability, and generalization ability over the
leading baselines.

crucial role of electron diffusion and electron-phonon coupling on the
formation of stable periodic structures. Gold and stainless Steel are
considered as two materials to test the theoretical model while simulation
results appear to confirm the experimental results that, unlike gold,
fabrication of pronounced LIPSS on stainless Steel is feasible.

generalization ability of object detectors via knowledge transfer. Recent
advances in DAOD strive to change the emphasis of the adaptation process from
global to local in virtue of fine-grained feature alignment methods. However,
both the global and local alignment approaches fail to capture the topological
relations among different foreground objects as the explicit dependencies and
interactions between and within domains are neglected. In this case, only
seeking one-vs-one alignment does not necessarily ensure the precise knowledge
transfer. Moreover, conventional alignment-based approaches may be vulnerable
to catastrophic overfitting regarding those less transferable regions (e.g.
backgrounds) due to the accumulation of inaccurate localization results in the
target domain. To remedy these issues, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set
domain adaptation problem, in which the foregrounds and backgrounds are seen as
the ``known classes'' and ``unknown class'' respectively. Accordingly, we
propose a new and general framework for DAOD, named Foreground-aware
Graph-based Relational Reasoning (FGRR), which incorporates graph structures
into the detection pipeline to explicitly model the intra- and inter-domain
foreground object relations on both pixel and semantic spaces, thereby endowing
the DAOD model with the capability of relational reasoning beyond the popular
alignment-based paradigm. The inter-domain visual and semantic correlations are
hierarchically modeled via bipartite graph structures, and the intra-domain
relations are encoded via graph attention mechanisms. Empirical results
demonstrate that the proposed FGRR exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on
four DAOD benchmarks.

users. However, it requires an extremely high bandwidth network. One of the
common solutions for saving bandwidth consumption is to stream only a portion
of video covered by the user's viewport. To do that, the user's viewpoint
prediction is indispensable. In existing viewport prediction methods, they
mainly concentrate on the user's head movement trajectory and video saliency.
None of them consider navigation information contained in the video, which can
turn the attention of the user to specific regions in the video with high
probability. Such information can be included in video subtitles, especially
the one in 360-degree virtual tourism videos. This fact reveals the potential
contribution of video subtitles to viewport prediction. Therefore, in this
paper, a subtitle-based viewport prediction model for 360-degree virtual
tourism videos is proposed. This model leverages the navigation information in
the video subtitles in addition to head movement trajectory and video saliency,
to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed model outperforms baseline methods which only use head movement
trajectory and video saliency for viewport prediction.

neural machine translation (NMT) performance. It consists of two procedures:
bidirectional pretraining and unidirectional finetuning. Both procedures
utilize SimCut, a simple regularization method that forces the consistency
between the output distributions of the original and the cutoff sentence pairs.
Without leveraging extra dataset via back-translation or integrating
large-scale pretrained model, Bi-SimCut achieves strong translation performance
across five translation benchmarks (data sizes range from 160K to 20.2M): BLEU
scores of 31.16 for en -> de and 38.37 for de -> en on the IWSLT14 dataset,
30.78 for en -> de and 35.15 for de -> en on the WMT14 dataset, and 27.17 for
zh -> en on the WMT17 dataset. SimCut is not a new method, but a version of
Cutoff (Shen et al., 2020) simplified and adapted for NMT, and it could be
considered as a perturbation-based method. Given the universality and
simplicity of SimCut and Bi-SimCut, we believe they can serve as strong
baselines for future NMT research.

achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get
stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding
algorithms (\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive
since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora
(e.g., 0.02\% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for
generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship
between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous
repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that
1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The
sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more
times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of
continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial
probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by
our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO}
(Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion
Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize
probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data.
Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show
that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing
perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments
on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization

sports. Specifically, we focus on identifying the same player in images
captured from different camera viewpoints during any given moment of a match.
This task differs from traditional applications of person re-id in a few
important ways. Firstly, players from the same team wear highly similar
clothes, thereby making it harder to tell them apart. Secondly, there are only
a few number of samples for each identity, which makes it harder to train a
re-id system. Thirdly, the resolutions of the images are often quite low and
vary a lot. This combined with heavy occlusions and fast movements of players
greatly increase the challenges for re-id. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective hierarchical data sampling procedure and a centroid loss function
that, when used together, increase the mean average precision (mAP) by 7 - 11.5
and the rank-1 (R1) by 8.8 - 14.9 without any change in the network or
hyper-parameters used. Our data sampling procedure improves the similarity of
the training and test distributions, and thereby aids in creating better
estimates of the centroids of the embeddings (or feature vectors).
Surprisingly, our study shows that in the presence of severely limited data, as
is the case for our application, a simple centroid loss function based on
euclidean distances significantly outperforms the popular triplet-centroid loss
function. We show comparable improvements for both convolutional networks and
vision transformers. Our approach is among the top ranked methods in the

longitudes - while the drift direction is negative in the other $\sim 20\%$.
The subpulse separation for single pulses with positive drift, $P_2=(18.8\pm

$P_2=(17.5\pm 0.2)^{\circ}$. When the drift is stable, the measured repetition

Networks (GNNs) that work on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, little
has been done on adapting classical GNNs to less-homophilic graphs. Although
the ability to handle less-homophilic graphs is restricted, classical GNNs
still stand out in several nice properties such as efficiency, simplicity, and
explainability. In this work, we propose a novel graph restructuring method
that can be integrated into any type of GNNs, including classical GNNs, to
leverage the benefits of existing GNNs while alleviating their limitations. Our
contribution is threefold: a) learning the weight of pseudo-eigenvectors for an
adaptive spectral clustering that aligns well with known node labels, b)
proposing a new density-aware homophilic metric that is robust to label
imbalance, and c) reconstructing the adjacency matrix based on the result of
adaptive spectral clustering to maximize the homophilic scores. The
experimental results show that our graph restructuring method can significantly
boost the performance of six classical GNNs by an average of 25% on
less-homophilic graphs. The boosted performance is comparable to
state-of-the-art methods.

quantum correlations in interacting electronic systems, yet it requires
measuring all the single-particle correlators of a macroscopic sample. To
circumvent this bottleneck, we introduce a strategy to obtain the correlation
entropy of electronic systems solely from a set of local measurements. We
demonstrate that by combining local particle-particle and density-density
correlations with a neural-network algorithm, the correlation entropy can be
predicted accurately. Specifically, we show that for a generalized interacting

we introduce a design optimization method based on Generalized Differential

perform sizing for complex circuits with a large number of design variables and
many conflicting objectives to be optimized. While state-of-the-art methods
reduce multi-objective problems to single-objective optimization and
potentially induce a prior bias, we search directly over the multi-objective

the designers to choose from. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method
is the first to specifically address the diversity of the solutions, while also
focusing on minimizing the number of simulations required to reach feasible
configurations. We evaluate the introduced method on two voltage regulators
showing different levels of complexity and we highlight that the proposed
innovative candidate selection method and survival policy leads to obtaining
feasible solutions, with a high degree of diversity, much faster than with GDE3

The shape of the Mach cone and the associated diffusion wake are sensitive to
the initial jet production location and the jet propagation direction relative
to the radial flow because of the distortion by the collective expansion of the
QGP and large density gradient. The shape of jet-induced Mach cones and their
distortions in heavy-ion collisions provide a unique and direct probe of the

load balancing system under sparse communication, a problem that arises, for
instance, in data centers. At the core of our approach is state approximation,
where the load balancer first estimates the servers' states via a carefully
designed communication protocol, and subsequently feeds the said approximated
state into a load balancing algorithm to generate a routing decision.
Specifically, we show that by using a novel approximation algorithm and
server-side-adaptive communication protocol, the load balancer can obtain good
queue-length approximations using a communication frequency that decays
quadratically in the maximum approximation error. Furthermore, using a
diffusion-scaled analysis, we prove that the load balancer achieves
asymptotically optimal performance whenever the approximation error scales at a
lower rate than the square-root of the total processing capacity, which
includes as a special case constant-error approximations. Using simulations, we
find that the proposed policies achieve performance that matches or outperforms
the state-of-the-art load balancing algorithms while reducing communication
rates by as much as 90%. Taken as a whole, our results demonstrate that it is
possible to achieve good performance even under very sparse communication, and
provide strong evidence that approximate states serve as a robust and powerful
information intermediary for designing communication-efficient load balancing
systems.

maximizes the profit and minimizes the risk has been ubiquitous in the
financial industry. Initially, profit and risk were measured by the first two
moments of the portfolio's return, a.k.a. the mean and variance, which are
sufficient to characterize a Gaussian distribution. However, it is broadly
believed that the first two moments are not enough to capture the
characteristics of the returns' behavior, which have been recognized to be
asymmetric and heavy-tailed. Although there is ample evidence that portfolio
designs involving the third and fourth moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis,
will outperform the conventional mean-variance framework, they are non-trivial.
Specifically, in the classical framework, the memory and computational cost of
computing the skewness and kurtosis grow sharply with the number of assets. To
alleviate the difficulty in high-dimensional problems, we consider an
alternative expression for high-order moments based on parametric
representations via a generalized hyperbolic skew-t distribution. Then, we
reformulate the high-order portfolio optimization problem as a fixed-point
problem and propose a robust fixed-point acceleration algorithm that solves the
problem in an efficient and scalable manner. Empirical experiments also
demonstrate that our proposed high-order portfolio optimization framework is of
low complexity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 2

of Chandrasekhar (1961) on Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability, a large
portion of which is devoted to the convective instability near its onset or the
outstanding book of Getling (1998) where systematization of the knowledge on
convection has been continued with a thorough description of the weakly
nonlinear stages. Most of the works, however, considered weakly stratified,
that is the so-called Boussinesq convection.
  It is the aim of this book to continue the process of systematization. It
seems important to put the current knowledge on weakly and strongly stratified
convection in order and provide a comprehensive description of the marginal,
weakly nonlinear and fully developed stages of convective flow in both cases.
To that end the book provides a short compendium of knowledge on the linear and
weakly nonlinear limits of the Boussinesq convection, as a useful reference for
a reader and than proceeds with a review of the theory on fully developed,
weakly stratified convection. The entire third chapter is devoted to a detailed
derivation and a study of the three aforementioned stages of stratified
(anelastic) convection. The description of stratified convection requires
extreme care, since many aspects have to be considered simultaneously for full
consistency. Detailed and systematic explanations are therefore provided. This
book is meant as a textbook for courses on hydrodynamics and convective flows,
for the use of lecturers and students, however, it may also be of use for the
entire scientific community as a practical reference.

data distributions; they can be efficiently trained via variational inference
by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), at the expense of a gap to the
exact (log-)marginal likelihood. While VAEs are commonly used for
representation learning, it is unclear why ELBO maximization would yield useful
representations, since unregularized maximum likelihood estimation cannot
invert the data-generating process. Yet, VAEs often succeed at this task. We
seek to elucidate this apparent paradox by studying nonlinear VAEs in the limit
of near-deterministic decoders. We first prove that, in this regime, the
optimal encoder approximately inverts the decoder -- a commonly used but
unproven conjecture -- which we refer to as {\em self-consistency}. Leveraging
self-consistency, we show that the ELBO converges to a regularized
log-likelihood. This allows VAEs to perform what has recently been termed
independent mechanism analysis (IMA): it adds an inductive bias towards
decoders with column-orthogonal Jacobians, which helps recovering the true
latent factors. The gap between ELBO and log-likelihood is therefore welcome,
since it bears unanticipated benefits for nonlinear representation learning. In
experiments on synthetic and image data, we show that VAEs uncover the true
latent factors when the data generating process satisfies the IMA assumption.

effective algorithms to defend against adversarial attacks, their extremely
slow training process makes it hard to scale to large datasets like ImageNet.
The key idea of recent works to accelerate adversarial training is to
substitute multi-step attacks (e.g., PGD) with single-step attacks (e.g.,
FGSM). However, these single-step methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting,
where the accuracy against PGD attack suddenly drops to nearly 0% during
training, destroying the robustness of the networks. In this work, we study the
phenomenon from the perspective of training instances. We show that
catastrophic overfitting is instance-dependent and fitting instances with
larger gradient norm is more likely to cause catastrophic overfitting. Based on
our findings, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Training
with Adaptive Step size (ATAS). ATAS learns an instancewise adaptive step size
that is inversely proportional to its gradient norm. The theoretical analysis
shows that ATAS converges faster than the commonly adopted non-adaptive
counterparts. Empirically, ATAS consistently mitigates catastrophic overfitting
and achieves higher robust accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet when
evaluated on various adversarial budgets.

the frequency of the probe field, where the hysteresis cycle of the bistability
is controllable. In addition, the CPA regime can be transferred into the near

problem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in existing
multimodal segmentation methods. In this work, we present the first attempt to
exploit the Transformer for multimodal brain tumor segmentation that is robust
to any combinatorial subset of available modalities. Concretely, we propose a
novel multimodal Medical Transformer (mmFormer) for incomplete multimodal
learning with three main components: the hybrid modality-specific encoders that
bridge a convolutional encoder and an intra-modal Transformer for both local
and global context modeling within each modality; an inter-modal Transformer to
build and align the long-range correlations across modalities for
modality-invariant features with global semantics corresponding to tumor
region; a decoder that performs a progressive up-sampling and fusion with the
modality-invariant features to generate robust segmentation. Besides, auxiliary
regularizers are introduced in both encoder and decoder to further enhance the
model's robustness to incomplete modalities. We conduct extensive experiments
on the public BraTS $2018$ dataset for brain tumor segmentation. The results
demonstrate that the proposed mmFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods

Dynamics approach. Since the model under consideration possess a consistent
canonical quantization and also fulfils the physical constraints in order to

at finite temperature. We evaluate in details the instantaneous rate of energy
loss for a charge, and show that the radiation rate is significantly modified
at very high temperatures. Intriguingly, we further observe that when the
temperature goes to infinity the radiation rate goes to zero even if the

from clinical dialogues. However, it is difficult to collect and construct
large annotated resources for clinical dialogue tasks. Recent developments in
natural language processing suggest that large-scale pre-trained language
backbones could be leveraged for such machine comprehension and information
extraction tasks. Yet, due to the gap between pre-training and downstream
clinical domains, it remains challenging to exploit the generic backbones for
domain-specific applications. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
domain-specific language pre-training, to improve performance on downstream
tasks like dialogue comprehension. Aside from the common token-level masking
pre-training method, according to the nature of human conversations and
interactive flow of multi-topic inquiry-answering dialogues, we further propose
sample generation strategies with speaker and utterance manipulation. The
conversational pre-training guides the language backbone to reconstruct the
utterances coherently based on the remaining context, thus bridging the gap
between general and specific domains. Experiments are conducted on a clinical
conversation dataset for symptom checking, where nurses inquire and discuss
symptom information with patients. We empirically show that the neural model
with our proposed approach brings improvement in the dialogue comprehension
task, and can achieve favorable results in the low resource training scenario.

(EEND) has achieved overlap-aware speaker diarization by formulating it as a
multi-label classification problem. It has also been extended for a flexible
number of speakers by introducing speaker-wise attractors. However, the output
number of speakers of attractor-based EEND is empirically capped; it cannot
deal with cases where the number of speakers appearing during inference is
higher than that during training because its speaker counting is trained in a
fully supervised manner. Our method, EEND-GLA, solves this problem by
introducing unsupervised clustering into attractor-based EEND. In the method,
the input audio is first divided into short blocks, then attractor-based
diarization is performed for each block, and finally, the results of each block
are clustered on the basis of the similarity between locally-calculated
attractors. While the number of output speakers is limited within each block,
the total number of speakers estimated for the entire input can be higher than
the limitation. To use EEND-GLA in an online manner, our method also extends
the speaker-tracing buffer, which was originally proposed to enable online
inference of conventional EEND. We introduce a block-wise buffer update to make
the speaker-tracing buffer compatible with EEND-GLA. Finally, to improve online
diarization, our method improves the buffer update method and revisits the
variable chunk-size training of EEND. The experimental results demonstrate that
EEND-GLA can perform speaker diarization of an unseen number of speakers in
both offline and online inferences.

this approach is distribution-free (as for non-parametric and quantile-based
approaches) and can directly yield continuous probability densities, hence
avoiding quantile crossing. It relies on a base distribution and a set of
bijective mappings. Both the shape parameters of the base distribution and the
bijective mappings are approximated with neural networks. Spline-based
conditional normalizing flow is considered owing to its non-affine
characteristics. Over the training phase, the model sequentially maps input
examples onto samples of base distribution, given the conditional contexts,
where parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood. To issue
probabilistic forecasts, one eventually maps samples of the base distribution
into samples of a desired distribution. Case studies based on open datasets
validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and allows us to discuss its
advantages and caveats with respect to the state of the art.

covariate shift by providing principled probabilistic representations of

computational complexity of large-scale architectures and datasets. Node-based
BNNs have recently been introduced as scalable alternatives, which induce
epistemic uncertainty by multiplying each hidden node with latent random
variables, while learning a point-estimate of the weights. In this paper, we
interpret these latent noise variables as implicit representations of simple
and domain-agnostic data perturbations during training, producing BNNs that
perform well under covariate shift due to input corruptions. We observe that
the diversity of the implicit corruptions depends on the entropy of the latent
variables, and propose a straightforward approach to increase the entropy of
these variables during training. We evaluate the method on out-of-distribution
image classification benchmarks, and show improved uncertainty estimation of
node-based BNNs under covariate shift due to input perturbations. As a side
effect, the method also provides robustness against noisy training labels.

  Bayesian Optimisation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sparse Gaussian Processes are a key component of high-throughput Bayesian
optimisation (BO) loops -- an increasingly common setting where evaluation
budgets are large and highly parallelised. By using representative subsets of
the available data to build approximate posteriors, sparse models dramatically
reduce the computational costs of surrogate modelling by relying on a small set
of pseudo-observations, the so-called inducing points, in lieu of the full data
set. However, current approaches to design inducing points are not appropriate
within BO loops as they seek to reduce global uncertainty in the objective
function. Thus, the high-fidelity modelling of promising and data-dense regions
required for precise optimisation is sacrificed and computational resources are
instead wasted on modelling areas of the space already known to be sub-optimal.
Inspired by entropy-based BO methods, we propose a novel inducing point design
that uses a principled information-theoretic criterion to select inducing
points. By choosing inducing points to maximally reduce both global uncertainty
and uncertainty in the maximum value of the objective function, we build
surrogate models able to support high-precision high-throughput BO.

behavior. The same perspective can be applied to representations of the agent's
body. I analyze different examples from biology -- octopus and humans in
particular -- and compare them with robots and their body models. At one end of
the spectrum, the octopus, a highly intelligent animal, largely relies on the
mechanical properties of its arms and peripheral nervous system. No central
representations or maps of its body were found in its central nervous system.
Primate brains do contain areas dedicated to processing body-related
information and different body maps were found. Yet, these representations are
still largely implicit and distributed and some functionality is also offloaded
to the periphery. Robots, on the other hand, rely almost exclusively on their
body models when planning and executing behaviors. I analyze the pros and cons

solution, $y$, over a given $x$-interval. We see that the eODE's perturbative
solution converges exponentially fast in $n$ to the ODE solution when
$\epsilon=1$: $\vert y_n(x;\epsilon=1,p^*(n))-y(x)\vert<C\delta^{n+1}$ with
$\delta<1$. The method permits knowing the number of solutions for Boundary
Value Problems just by looking at the number of minima of the distance function
at each order in $n$, $p^{*,\alpha}(n)$, where each $\alpha$ defines a sequence
of functions $y_n$ that converges to one of the ODE's solutions. We present the
method by its application to several cases where we discuss its properties,
benefits and shortcomings, and some practical algorithmic improvements.

observations. In view of the large availability of theoretical evolutionary
models, both fields would benefit from a unified framework that allows a
straightforward comparison of physical parameters obtained by different stellar
and substellar models. To this aim, we developed the Manifold Age Determination
for Young Stars (MADYS), a flexible Python tool for the age and mass
determination of young stellar and substellar objects. In this first release,
MADYS automatically retrieves and crossmatches photometry from several
catalogs, estimates interstellar extinction, and derives age and mass estimates
for individual objects through isochronal fitting. Harmonizing the
heterogeneity of publicly available isochrone grids, the tool allows one to
choose amongst 17 models, many of which with customizable astrophysical
parameters, for a total of $\sim 110$ isochrone grids. Several dedicated
plotting functions are provided to allow for an intuitive visual perception of
the numerical output. After extensive testing, we have made the tool publicly
available. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of MADYS, summarizing
previously published results as well providing several new examples.

Kalman filter for high dimensional linear Gaussian state space models. EnKF
methods have also been developed for parameter inference of static Bayesian
models with a Gaussian likelihood, in a way that is analogous to likelihood
tempering sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). These methods are commonly referred to
as ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). Unlike SMC, the inference from EKI is only
asymptotically unbiased if the likelihood is linear Gaussian and the priors are
Gaussian. However, EKI is significantly faster to run. Currently, a large
limitation of EKI methods is that the covariance of the measurement error is
assumed to be fully known. We develop a new method, which we call
component-wise iterative ensemble Kalman inversion (CW-IEKI), that allows
elements of the covariance matrix to be inferred alongside the model parameters
at negligible extra cost. This novel method is compared to SMC on three
different application examples: a model of nitrogen mineralisation in soil that
is based on the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), a model
predicting seagrass decline due to stress from water temperature and light, and
a model predicting coral calcification rates. On all of these examples, we find
that CW-IEKI has relatively similar predictive performance to SMC, albeit with
greater uncertainty, and it has a significantly faster run time.

in all wavelengths. For both events, the measured timescales are consistent
with those observed in other black hole systems. Contemporaneous hard
X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray observations indicate a non-thermal electron energy

train a model using the local data of many distributed clients. A key challenge
in federated learning is that the data samples across the clients may not be
identically distributed. To address this challenge, personalized federated
learning with the goal of tailoring the learned model to the data distribution
of every individual client has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on this
problem and propose a novel personalized Federated Learning scheme based on
Optimal Transport (FedOT) as a learning algorithm that learns the optimal
transport maps for transferring data points to a common distribution as well as
the prediction model under the applied transport map. To formulate the FedOT
problem, we extend the standard optimal transport task between two probability
distributions to multi-marginal optimal transport problems with the goal of
transporting samples from multiple distributions to a common probability
domain. We then leverage the results on multi-marginal optimal transport
problems to formulate FedOT as a min-max optimization problem and analyze its
generalization and optimization properties. We discuss the results of several
numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of FedOT under heterogeneous
data distributions in federated learning problems.

make changes (e.g. new ranking features, different ranking models) and A/B test
them on a fraction of their users to establish the value of the change. An
alternative approach estimates the effectiveness of the proposed changes
offline, utilising previously collected clickthrough data on the old ranker to
posit what the user behaviour on ranked lists produced by the new ranker would
have been. A majority of offline evaluation approaches invoke the well studied
inverse propensity weighting to adjust for biases inherent in logged data. In
this paper, we propose the use of parametric estimates for these propensities.

Tensor network methods allow to emulate quantum circuits with a large number of

fifty qubits showing that their entanglement, measured in terms of entanglement
entropy between qubits, tends to that of Haar distributed random states as the

introduce a new measure to characterize the entanglement production in QNNs:
the entangling speed. Our results characterise the entanglement properties of
quantum neural networks, and provides new evidence of the rate at which these

sell in view of uncertain future offers. Classical stopping theory assumes that
sellers have full knowledge of the value distributions, and leverage this
knowledge to determine stopping rules that maximize expected welfare. In
practice, however, stopping rules must often be determined under partial
information, based on scarce data or expert predictions. Consider a seller that
has one item for sale and receives successive offers drawn from some value
distributions. The decision on whether or not to accept an offer is
irrevocable, and the value distributions are only partially known. We therefore
let the seller adopt a robust maximin strategy, assuming that value
distributions are chosen adversarially by nature to minimize the value of the
accepted offer. We provide a general maximin solution to this stopping problem
that identifies the optimal (threshold-based) stopping rule for the seller for
all possible statistical information structures. We then perform a detailed
analysis for various ambiguity sets relying on knowledge about the common mean,
dispersion (variance or mean absolute deviation) and support of the
distributions. We show for these information structures that the seller's
stopping rule consists of decreasing thresholds converging to the common mean,
and that nature's adversarial response, in the long run, is to always create an
all-or-nothing scenario. The maximin solutions also reveal what happens as
dispersion or the number of offers grows large.

a gap of band structure at 20 GPa on the background of normal metallic states.
At 20 GPa, this compressed system could act as a host of superconductor being
judged from a sharp jump of spontaneous magnetic susceptibility with an
evanescent spin density of state at Fermi level along with the competition
between spin density wave and superconductivity. Finally, electron pairing glue
for ErH2 at these three typical pressures was attributed to the

bubble surface, which models the action of the short range attractive-repulsive
potential acting on them when they get sufficiently close to the surface
\cite{multiscale_mod}. In the domain occupied by the fluid, the particles are
transported by the fluid motion generated by the bubble oscillations. The
method adopted to solve the equation for $c$ is based on a finite-difference
scheme on a uniform Cartesian grid and implemented in 2D and 3D axisymmetric
domains. We use a level-set function to define the region occupied by the
bubble, while the boundary conditions are discretized by a ghost-point
technique to guarantee second order accuracy at the curved boundary. The sparse
linear system is finally solved with a geometric multigrid technique designed
\textit{ad-hoc\/} for this specific problem. Several accuracy tests are
provided to prove second order accuracy in space and time.
  The fluid dynamics generated by the oscillating bubble is governed by the
Stokes equation solved with a second order accurate method based on a
monolithic approach, where the momentum and continuity equations are solved
simultaneously. Since the amplitude of the bubble oscillations are very small,
a simplified model is presented where the computational bubble is actually
steady and its oscillations are represented purely with time-dependent boundary
conditions. A numerical comparison with the moving domain model confirms that
this simplification is perfectly reasonable for the class of problems
investigated in this paper.

very long spike trains (up to 1000) to reach an accuracy similar to their
artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts for large models, which offsets
efficiency and inhibits its application to low-power systems for real-world use
cases. To alleviate this problem, emerging neural encoding schemes are proposed
to shorten the spike train while maintaining the high accuracy. However,
current accelerators for SNN cannot well support the emerging encoding schemes.
In this work, we present a novel hardware architecture that can efficiently
support SNN with emerging neural encoding. Our implementation features energy
and area efficient processing units with increased parallelism and reduced

importantly, by controlling the driving fields in our system, the two-photon

Meanwhile, it can have an order of magnitude factor improvement over the
Heisenberg limit in the low-photon-number regime, which is very valuable for
fragile systems that cannot withstand large photon fluxes. This work proposes

important role in the study of planetary compositions, from their unique
ability to provide bulk elemental abundances of planetary material in their

white dwarfs. This paper predicts the population of planets that Gaia will
detect around white dwarfs, evolved from known planets orbiting main-sequence
stars. We predict that Gaia will detect $8\pm2$ planets around white dwarfs:
$8\pm\,3\%$ will lie inside 3\,au and $40\pm10\,\%$ will be less massive than
Jupiter. As surviving planets likely become dynamically detached from their
outer systems, those white dwarfs with Gaia detected planets may not have
planetary material in their atmospheres. Comparison between the predicted
planet population and that found by Gaia will reveal the importance of
dynamical instabilities and scattering of planets after the main-sequence, as
well as whether photoevaporation removes the envelopes of gas giants during
their giant branch evolution.

Existing theoretical developments mainly focus on the field of time series with
the assumption of strong auto-correlation among temporally ordered

observations. Under quite mild assumptions, this article kicks off
matricization of raw weakly correlated tensor observations within the TuTFaM

We develop their asymptotic behaviors, including mainly convergence rates and

leverage recent advancements in self-supervised speech representation learning

Specifically, we employ our recently formulated Conditional Disentangled
Sequential Variational Auto-encoder (C-DSVAE) as the backbone UTTS AM, which
offers well-structured content representations given unsupervised alignment
(UA) as condition during training. For UTTS inference, we utilize a lexicon to
map input text to the phoneme sequence, which is expanded to the frame-level
forced alignment (FA) with a speaker-dependent duration model. Then, we develop
an alignment mapping module that converts FA to UA. Finally, the C-DSVAE,
serving as the self-supervised TTS AM, takes the predicted UA and a target
speaker embedding to generate the mel spectrogram, which is ultimately
converted to waveform with a neural vocoder. We show how our method enables
speech synthesis without using a paired TTS corpus. Experiments demonstrate
that UTTS can synthesize speech of high naturalness and intelligibility

exceptional physical properties are intimately related to their morphological

reinforces their mechanical strength and alters their tribological and

rationalized in terms of interlayer registry patterns. Regardless of the
nanotube identity (that is, diameter, chirality, chemical composition),
faceting requires the matching of the chiral angles of adjacent layers. Above a
critical diameter that corresponds well with experimental results, achiral
multiwalled nanotubes display evenly spaced extended axial facets whose number
equals the interlayer difference in circumferential unit cells. Elongated
helical facets, commonly observed in experiment, appear in nanotubes that
exhibit small interlayer chiral angle mismatch. When the wall chiralities are
uncorrelated, faceting is suppressed and outer layer corrugation, which is
induced by the moir\'e superlattice, is obtained in agreement with experiments.
Finally, we offer an explanation for the higher incidence of faceting in
multiwalled boron nitride nanotubes with respect to their carbon-based
counterparts.

expansion, are not sufficient to obtain an accurate representation of the
original model response. Through applying a rational approximation instead, the
approximation error can be efficiently reduced for models whose non-linearity
is accurately described through a rational function. Specifically, our aim is
to approximate complex-valued models. A common approach to obtain the
coefficients in the surrogate is to minimize the sample-based error between
model and surrogate in the least-square sense. In order to obtain an accurate
representation of the original model and to avoid overfitting, the sample set
has be two to three times the number of polynomial terms in the expansion. For
models that require a high polynomial degree or are high-dimensional in terms

average, by suppressing the chance of the same error being present on all of
the copies. Third, we find that minimum-strength anti-ferromagnetic links
perform best, by counteracting the spin-flips induced by the errors. We have
numerically tested our innovations on small instances of spin glasses from
Callison et al [NJP 21, 123022, 2019], and we find improved error tolerance for
three or more copies in configurations that include frustration. Interpreted as
an effective precision increase, we obtain several extra bits of precision for
three copies connected in a triangle. This provides proof-of-concept of a
method for scaling quantum annealing beyond the precision limits of hardware, a
step towards fault tolerance in this setting.

satellite systems (GNSS) signals is considered. To ensure safe driving of
automated vehicles, the vehicle must plan its trajectory to avoid navigating on
unsafe roads (e.g., icy conditions, construction zones, narrow streets, etc.).
Such information can be derived from the roads' physical properties, vehicle's
capabilities, and weather conditions. From a GNSS-based navigation perspective,
the reliability of GNSS signals in different locales, which is heavily
dependent on the road layout within the surrounding environment, is crucial to
ensure safe automated driving. An urban road environment surrounded by tall
objects can significantly degrade the accuracy and availability of GNSS
signals. This article proposes an approach to predict the reliability of
GNSS-based navigation to ensure safe urban navigation. Satellite navigation
reliability at a given location and time on a road is determined based on the
probabilistic position error bound of the vehicle-mounted GNSS receiver. A
metric for GNSS reliability for ground vehicles is suggested, and a method to
predict the conservative probabilistic error bound of the GNSS navigation
solution is proposed. A satellite navigation reliability map is generated for
various navigation applications. As a case study, the reliability map is used
in the proposed optimization problem formulation for automated ground vehicle
safety-constrained path planning.

ISO/IEC MPEG has recently been working on a standard that aims to efficiently

with ITU-T VCEG, has also specified the VVC standard. VVC introduced recently
the concept of subpicture. This tool was specifically designed to provide
independent accessibility and decodability of sub-bitstreams for
omnidirectional applications. This paper shows the benefit of using subpictures
in the MIV use-case. While different ways in which subpictures could be used in
MIV are discussed, a particular case study is selected. Namely, subpictures are
used for parallel encoding and to reduce the number of decoder instances.
Experimental results show that the cost of using subpictures in terms of
bitrate overhead is negligible (0.1% to 0.4%), when compared to the overall
bitrate. The number of decoder instances on the other hand decreases by a

attracted increasing attention. Compared with conventional communication
systems, semantic communication systems are not only affected by physical noise
existing in the wireless communication environment, e.g., additional white
Gaussian noise, but also by semantic noise due to the source and the nature of
deep learning-based systems. In this paper, we elaborate on the mechanism of
semantic noise. In particular, we categorize semantic noise into two
categories: literal semantic noise and adversarial semantic noise. The former
is caused by written errors or expression ambiguity, while the latter is caused
by perturbations or attacks added to the embedding layer via the semantic
channel. To prevent semantic noise from influencing semantic communication
systems, we present a robust deep learning enabled semantic communication
system (R-DeepSC) that leverages a calibrated self-attention mechanism and
adversarial training to tackle semantic noise. Compared with baseline models
that only consider physical noise for text transmission, the proposed R-DeepSC
achieves remarkable performance in dealing with semantic noise under different
signal-to-noise ratios.

shown to translate into tighter generalization bounds. The bounds are then
applied to the distributed support vector machines (SVM), suggesting that the
generalization error of the distributed setting decays faster than that of the
centralized one with a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\log(K)/\sqrt{K})$. This finding
is validated also experimentally. A similar conclusion is obtained for a
multiple-round federated learning setup where each client uses stochastic

this reduced manifold using continuously differentiable neural fields, which
may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous
system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations.
We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from
voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Compared to prior
discretization-dependent ROM methods, such as linear subspace proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) and nonlinear manifold neural-network-based autoencoders,
CROM features higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, dynamically adaptive
resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. For equal latent space
dimension, CROM exhibits 79$\times$ and 49$\times$ better accuracy, and
39$\times$ and 132$\times$ smaller memory footprint, than POD and autoencoder

achieved in part by providing one with an explicit construction for inverting
condensations, i.e. finding an orbifold datum $\mathbb{A}$ in
$\mathcal{C}_B^\circ$ whose associated MFC is equivalent to $\mathcal{C}$. As a
tool used in this construction we also explore what kinds of functors

properties, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and superlubricity.
Depending on the twist angle, periodic moir\'e superlattices form in twisted
bilayer graphene, with inhomogeneous interlayer coupling and lattice
deformation. For a small twist angle (typically <2{\deg}), each moir\'e
supercell contains a large number of atoms (>10,000), making it computationally
expensive for first-principles and atomistic modeling. In this work, a finite
element method based on a continuum model is used to simulate the inhomogeneous
interlayer and intralayer deformations of twisted graphene flakes on a rigid
graphene substrate. The van der Waals interactions between the graphene layers
are described by a periodic potential energy function, whereas the graphene
flake is treated as a continuum membrane with effective elastic properties. Our
simulations show that structural relaxation and the induced strain localization
are most significant in a relatively large graphene flake at small twist
angles, where the strain distribution is highly localized as shear strain
solitons along the boundaries between neighboring domains of commensurate AB
stacking. Moreover, it is found that there exist many metastable equilibrium
configurations at particular twist angles, depending on the flake size. The
nonlinear mechanics of twisted bilayer graphene is thus expected to be
essential for understanding the strain distributions in the moir\'e
superlattices and the strain effects on other physical properties.

diblock copolymer (BCP) bulk melts. The melt is confined within two parallel
solid walls at the top and bottom of the simulation box. The shear is induced
by allowing the walls to move in a direction with a specific velocity. We
explore the following cases: (i) walls are fixed, (ii) only the top wall moves,
(iii) both walls move in the same direction, and (iv) both walls move in
opposite directions. After the temperature quench, we monitor the effect of
shear on evolution morphology, the scaling behavior of the system, and the
characteristic length scale and growth. The characteristic length scale follows
typical power-law behavior at early times and saturates at late times when both
walls are fixed. The length scale changes significantly with shear caused by
wall velocities. The usual lamellar morphology, which is not achieved for case
1 within the considered simulation time steps, is noticed much earlier for the
nonzero wall velocity cases. Specifically, it is seen much before in case 4
than in the other cases. We find that the shear viscosity decreases
(shear-thinning) with wall velocity (shear rate) for all the cases at a given
coarsening time. Overall, we report the influence rule of shear rates on
microphase separation kinetics of BCP melts. This study can provide a scheme to
anticipate and design anisotropic microstructures under the application of
externally controlled wall shear that may further guide in producing the
various composite materials with superior mechanical and physical properties.

$\tau = 5$ Myr to $\tau = 1$ Gyr. Given a set of isochrones and a Kroupa (2001)
initial mass function, we sample $b(\tau\,|\,\vec{x}, \vec{\alpha})$ to
maximize the likelihood of the data, accounting for the selection function.
This results in a set of mono-age stellar density maps across a sizeable
portion of the Galactic disc. These maps show that some, but not all, spiral
arms are reflected in overdensities of stars younger than 500 Myr. The maps of
the youngest stars ($<10$ Myr) trace major star forming regions. The maps at
all ages exhibit an outward density gradient and distinct spiral-like spatial
structure, which is qualitatively similar on large scales among all age
intervals. When summing over the maps' area and extrapolating to the whole
disc, we find an effective star-formation rate over the last 10 Myr of $\approx
3.3 \mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$, higher than previously published estimates.
Remarkably, our stellar age distribution implies that the star-formation rate
has been three times lower throughout most of the last Gyr, having risen
distinctly only in the very recent past.

privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a set of clients. However, the
data distribution among clients often exhibits non-IID, i.e., distribution
shift, which makes efficient optimization difficult. To tackle this problem,
many FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across
clients by increasing the performance of the global model. However, almost all
algorithms leverage Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) to be the local
optimizer, which is easy to make the global model fall into a sharp valley and
increase a large deviation of parts of local clients. Therefore, in this paper,
we revisit the solutions to the distribution shift problem in FL with a focus
on local learning generality. To this end, we propose a general, effective
algorithm, \texttt{FedSAM}, based on Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) local
optimizer, and develop a momentum FL algorithm to bridge local and global

these two algorithms and demonstrate the generalization bound of
\texttt{FedSAM}. Empirically, our proposed algorithms substantially outperform
existing FL studies and significantly decrease the learning deviation.

input to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the
Bird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have
constant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate
system and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search
with a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are
compared against a single target representation to predict both position and
rotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is
the fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision

limitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a
latency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain
data frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time

dimensionality of three-dimensional problems is so high that it is too
difficult and expensive to prepare sufficient samples. Therefore, transfer
learning has become a promising approach to reuse well-trained two-dimensional
models and greatly reduce the need for samples for three-dimensional problems.
This paper proposes to reuse the baseline models trained on supercritical
airfoils to predict finite-span swept supercritical wings, where the simple
swept theory is embedded to improve the prediction accuracy. Two baseline
models for transfer learning are investigated: one is commonly referred to as
the forward problem of predicting the pressure coefficient distribution based
on the geometry, and the other is the inverse problem that predicts the
geometry based on the pressure coefficient distribution. Two transfer learning
strategies are compared for both baseline models. The transferred models are
then tested on the prediction of complete wings. The results show that transfer
learning requires only approximately 500 wing samples to achieve good
prediction accuracy on different wing planforms and different free stream
conditions. Compared to the two baseline models, the transferred models reduce
the prediction error by 60% and 80%, respectively.

framework unifies many existing and new policy optimization algorithms. We show
that the state-wise average policy of this algorithm converges to an
approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game, as long as the matrix game
algorithms achieve low weighted regret at each state, with respect to weights
determined by the speed of the value updates. Next, we show that this framework
instantiated with the Optimistic Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL)
algorithm at each state (and smooth value updates) can find an
$\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(T^{-5/6})$ approximate NE in $T$ iterations, and a
similar algorithm with slightly modified value update rule achieves a faster
$\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(T^{-1})$ convergence rate. These improve over the
current best $\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(T^{-1/2})$ rate of symmetric policy
optimization type algorithms. We also extend this algorithm to multi-player

inherent stochasticity exhibited by interacting populations of species in areas

performing exact fully Bayesian inference in either modelling framework is
challenging due to the intractability of the observed data likelihood,
necessitating the use of computationally intensive techniques such as particle
Markov chain Monte Carlo (particle MCMC). It is proposed to increase the

hold with respect to Mach number. Time-resolved pressure measurements at the
flow separation points on the cylinder aft surface show that coherent
oscillatory activity occurs with a phase difference of $\pi$ radians between
the two statistically-symmetric halves of the flow. This aspect of the flow
dynamics at high speeds is in common with its low-speed counterpart, i.e. the
canonical problem of cylinder wake in an incompressible flow.

gigapixel whole-slide imaging (WSI) in computational pathology, WSIs can be as

interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We introduce a new ViT

leverages the natural hierarchical structure inherent in WSIs using two levels
of self-supervised learning to learn high-resolution image representations.
HIPT is pretrained across 33 cancer types using 10,678 gigapixel WSIs, 408,218

inductive biases about the hierarchical structure of phenotypes in the tumor

to stop the online to batch conversion early and outperform the risk of the

design an algorithm that samples less when the variance is large, while
guaranteeing the optimal regret bound in expectation. In online learning with

concentration of energy dissipation in a small set of fractal dimension less
than three, the inverse cascade of two-dimensional turbulence can also display
lack of self-similarity and intermittency if the energy injection is
constrained in a fractal set of dimension less than two. A series of numerical
simulations of two dimensional turbulence are examined, using different forcing
functions of the same forcing length-scale but different fractal dimension $D$
that varies from the classical $D=2$ case to the point vortex case $D=0$. It is
shown that as the fractal dimension of the forcing is decreased from $D=2$, the
self-similarity is lost and intermittency appears, with the scaling of the
different structure functions $\langle |\delta u_\|^p| \rangle\propto
r^{\zeta_p}$ differs from the dimensional analysis prediction $\zeta_p=p/3$.
The present model thus provides a unique example that intermittency is
controlled and can thus shed light and provide test beds for multi-fractal
models of turbulence.

world constantly changes, and the predictions the system makes change the
environment in which it operates. For example, a music recommender observes
exogeneous changes in the user distribution as different communities have
increased access to high speed internet. If users under the age of 18 enjoy
their recommendations, the proportion of the user base comprised of those under
18 may endogeneously increase. Most of the study of endogenous shifts has
focused on the single decision-maker setting, where there is one learner that
users either choose to use or not.
  This paper studies participation dynamics between sub-populations and
possibly many learners. We study the behavior of systems with
\emph{risk-reducing} learners and sub-populations. A risk-reducing learner
updates their decision upon observing a mixture distribution of the
sub-populations $\mathcal{D}$ in such a way that it decreases the risk of the
learner on that mixture. A risk reducing sub-population updates its
apportionment amongst learners in a way which reduces its overall loss.
  Previous work on the single learner case shows that myopic risk minimization
can result in high overall loss~\citep{perdomo2020performative,
miller2021outside} and representation disparity~\citep{hashimoto2018fairness,
zhang2019group}. Our work analyzes the outcomes of multiple myopic learners and
market forces, often leading to better global loss and less representation
disparity.

operating in public are increasing. Adopting AI-based techniques and, more
specifically, Deep Learning (DL) approaches to control and guide these UAVs can
be beneficial in terms of performance but can add concerns regarding the safety
of those techniques and their vulnerability against adversarial attacks.
Confusion in the agent's decision-making process caused by these attacks can
seriously affect the safety of the UAV. This paper proposes an innovative
approach based on the explainability of DL methods to build an efficient
detector that will protect these DL schemes and the UAVs adopting them from
attacks. The agent adopts a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for
guidance and planning. The agent is trained with a Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) DRL scheme that
utilises Artificial Potential Field (APF) to improve training times and
obstacle avoidance performance. A simulated environment for UAV explainable
DRL-based planning and guidance, including obstacles and adversarial attacks,
is built. The adversarial attacks are generated by the Basic Iterative Method
(BIM) algorithm and reduced obstacle course completion rates from 97\% to 35\%.
Two adversarial attack detectors are proposed to counter this reduction. The
first one is a Convolutional Neural Network Adversarial Detector (CNN-AD),
which achieves accuracy in the detection of 80\%. The second detector utilises
a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. It achieves an accuracy of 91\% with
faster computing times compared to the CNN-AD, allowing for real-time
adversarial detection.

gravitational waves from mergers of solar-mass black holes in 2015. More
recently, the development of numerical tools and the precision observational
data have rekindled the effort to constrain the black hole abundance in the
lower mass range, that is $M < 10^{23}$g. In particular, primordial black holes
of asteroid mass $M \sim 10^{17}-10^{23}\,$g may represent 100\% of dark
matter. While the microlensing and stellar disruption constraints on their
abundance have been relieved, Hawking radiation of these black holes seems to
be the only detection (and constraining) mean. Hawking radiation constraints on
primordial black holes date back to the first papers by Hawking. Black holes
evaporating in the early universe may have generated the baryon asymmetry,
modified big bang nucleosynthesis, distorted the cosmic microwave background,
or produced cosmological backgrounds of stable particles such as photons and
neutrinos. At the end of their lifetime, exploding primordial black holes would
produce high energy cosmic rays that would provide invaluable access to the
physics at energies up to the Planck scale. In this review, we describe the
main principles of Hawking radiation, which lie at the border of general
relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical physics. We then present an
up-to-date status of the different constraints on primordial black holes that
rely on the evaporation phenomenon, and give, where relevant, prospects for
future work. In particular, non-standard black holes and emission of beyond the
Standard Model degrees of freedom is currently a hot subject.

the principle of exclusivity is violated and are therefore classified as

the transition graphs, which describe the plastic deformation pathways under
athermal quasi-static shear. In particular, the analysis of the stability
ranges of the strongly connected components of the transition graphs reveals
the emergence of a phase-separation like process associated with the aging of
the glass. Increasing the age and hence stability of the initial glass, results
in a gradual break-up of the landscape of dynamically accessible stable states
into three distinct regions: one region centered around the initially prepared
glass phase, and two additional regions, characterized by well-separated ranges

an energy perspective. In recent years, with the establishment of the field of
stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, the ideas of thermodynamics have been
generalized to small fluctuating systems. Independently developed in
mathematics and statistics, the optimal transport theory concerns the means by
which one can optimally transport a source distribution to a target
distribution, deriving a useful metric between probability distributions,
called the Wasserstein distance. Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an
intimate connection between these fields has been unveiled in the context of
continuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing several important implications
for nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous connection
for discrete cases by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal
transport. We first introduce a novel quantity called dynamical state mobility,
which significantly improves the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and
provides insights into the precision of currents in nonequilibrium Markov jump
processes. We then derive variational formulas that connect the discrete
Wasserstein distances to stochastic and quantum thermodynamics of discrete
Markovian dynamics described by master equations. Specifically, we rigorously
prove that the Wasserstein distance equals the minimum product of irreversible
entropy production and dynamical state mobility over all admissible Markovian
dynamics. These formulas not only unify the relationship between thermodynamics
and the optimal transport theory for discrete and continuous cases but also
generalize it to the quantum case. In addition, we demonstrate that the
obtained variational formulas lead to remarkable applications in stochastic and
quantum thermodynamics.

interactions, has attracted increasing attention in many online applications.
Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic
user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However,
the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential
recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In
many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often
multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type
behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users
and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance
to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we
tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of
multi-behavior interactive patterns. Towards this end, we propose a new
Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) recommendation framework to jointly capture
dynamic short-term and long-range user-item interactive patterns, by exploring
the evolving correlations across different types of behaviors. The new TGT
method endows the sequential recommendation architecture to distill dedicated
knowledge for type-specific behavior relational context and the implicit
behavior dependencies. Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our
method TGT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation
methods. Our model implementation codes are available at

fault-tolerant quantum computing, the fault-tolerant quantum protocols should
be transformed into executable quantum circuits based on the nearest-neighbor

operations fundamentally, for the concatenated codes, it is possible to obtain
the circuits composed of the local operations by applying the quantum circuit
synthesis. However, by the existing quantum circuit synthesis developed for
ordinary quantum computational algorithms, the fault-tolerant of the protocol
may not be preserved in the resulting circuit. Besides, we have to consider
something more to implement the quantum circuit of universal fault-tolerant
quantum computing. First, we have not to propagate quantum errors on data
qubits when selecting a qubit move path (a sequence of \emph{SWAP} gates) to
satisfy the geometric locality constraint. Second, the circuit should be
self-contained so that it is possible to act independently regardless of the

multiple fault-tolerant quantum circuits of multiple fault-tolerant quantum
protocols acting on the same input, a logical data qubit. Last, we need to
recall fault-tolerant protocols such as syndrome measure and encoder implicitly
include classical control processing conditioned on the measurement outcomes,

high-dimensional data, e.g., selecting significant variables and controlling

multiple hypothesis testing is the false discovery rate (FDR). In recent years,
local false discovery rate (fdr) has drawn much attention, due to its advantage
of accessing the confidence of individual hypothesis. However, most methods
estimate fdr through p-values or statistics with known null distributions,
which are sometimes not available or reliable. Adopting the innovative
methodology of competition-based procedures, e.g., knockoff filter, this paper
proposes a new approach, named TDfdr, to local false discovery rate estimation,
which is free of the p-values or known null distributions. Simulation results
demonstrate that TDfdr can accurately estimate the fdr with two
competition-based procedures. In real data analysis, the power of TDfdr on

connectivity still holds when restricted to triangulations containing some
constrained edges between the points; (3) for $P$ in general position of size
$n$, the flip graph is $\lceil \frac{n}{2} -2 \rceil$-connected, a recent
result of Wagner and Welzl (SODA 2020).
  We introduce the study of connectivity properties of the flip graph when some
edges between points are forbidden. An edge $e$ between two points is a flip
cut edge if eliminating triangulations containing $e$ results in a disconnected
flip graph. More generally, a set $X$ of edges between points of $P$ is a flip
cut set if eliminating all triangulations that contain edges of $X$ results in
a disconnected flip graph. The flip cut number of $P$ is the minimum size of a
flip cut set.
  We give a characterization of flip cut edges that leads to an $O(n \log n)$
time algorithm to test if an edge is a flip cut edge and, with that as
preprocessing, an $O(n)$ time algorithm to test if two triangulations are in
the same connected component of the flip graph. For a set of $n$ points in

is unidentifiable under the instance-dependent noise(IDN). To address this
problem, we have noticed that, there are psychological and physiological
evidences showing that we humans are more likely to annotate instances of

shape parameters of shielded Gas Metal Arc Welded (GMAW) fillet joints.
Extensive testing was carried out on low carbon mild steel plates of
thicknesses ranging from 3mm to 10mm. Welding voltage, welding current, and
moving heat source speed were considered as the welding parameters. Three types
of multiple linear regression models (MLR) were created to establish an
empirical equation for defining GMAW bead shape parameters considering
interactive and higher order terms. Additionally, artificial neural network
(ANN) models were created based on similar scheme, and the relevance of
specific features was investigated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
The results reveal that MLR-based approach performs better than the ANN based
models in terms of predictability and error assessment. This study shows the
usefulness of the predictive tools to aid numerical analysis of welding.

combining all the models, a COVID-19 Ontology is developed and performs various
queries using SPARQL query on designed Ontology which accumulate the risk
factors, provide appropriate diagnosis, precautions and preventive suggestions
for COVID Patients. After comparing the performance of SARIMA and FBProphet, it
is observed that the SARIMA model performs better in forecasting of COVID

insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits
the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node

contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In
our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent feature by
enlarging the margin of decision boundaries and improving the cross-view
consistency of the latent representation. Specifically, we first adopt an
interpolation-based strategy to conduct data augmentation in the latent space
and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second,
we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two
interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across
views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we
extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and
the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning.
Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

electromagnetic and gravitational fields, by means of the rotational
transformations of octonion coordinate systems. The scholars utilize the
octonions to analyze the electromagnetic and gravitational fields
simultaneously, including the octonion field potential, field strength, field
source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque and force. When the octonion
coordinate system transforms rotationally, the vector part of one octonion may
alter, while the scalar part of the octonion will remain unchanged. This
property allows one to deduce a few invariants, such as the scalar part of
octonion radius vector, speed of light, and norm of octonion radius vector.
These invariants are the basic postulates for the Galilean transformation and
Lorentz transformation. Further, from the rotation transform of octonion
coordinate systems, it is capable of deducing several invariants, including the
mass, energy and power relevant to gravitational fields, in one octonion space
$\mathbb{O}$. And the term relevant to the electric charge will transform with
the rotation of coordinate systems. In another octonion space $\mathbb{O}_u$,
it is capable of inferring a few invariants, including the electric charge
related to electromagnetic fields. And the terms relevant to the mass and
energy will vary with the rotation of octonion coordinate systems. So the
invariants are divided into two different groups. In particular, the mass
conservation law and energy conservation law can be effective simultaneously.
But the charge conservation law and mass conservation law are unable to be
valid simultaneously, in the strict sense. It is beneficial to further
understand the laws of conservation.

pressure vessel has a critical role. The pressure vessel contains dry
electronics, power sources, and other sensors that can not be flooded. A
traditional design approach for a pressure vessel design involves running
multiple Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulations and optimizing the
design to find the best suitable design which meets the requirement. Running
these FEAs are computationally very costly for any optimization process and it
becomes difficult to run even hundreds of evaluation. In such a case, a better
approach is the surrogate design with the goal of replacing FEA-based
prediction with some learning-based regressor. Once the surrogate is trained
for a class of problem, then the learned response surface can be used to
analyze the stress effect without running the FEA for that class of problem.
The challenge of creating a surrogate for a class of problems is data
generation. Since the process is computationally costly, it is not possible to
densely sample the design space and the learning response surface on sparse
data set becomes difficult. During experimentation, we observed that a Deep
Learning-based surrogate outperforms other regression models on such sparse
data. In the present work, we are utilizing the Deep Learning-based model to
replace the costly finite element analysis-based simulation process. By
creating the surrogate we speed up the prediction on the other design much
faster than direct Finite element Analysis. We also compared our DL-based
surrogate with other classical Machine Learning (ML) based regression models(
random forest and Gradient Boost regressor). We observed on the sparser data,
the DL-based surrogate performs much better than other regression models.

learning communication protocols that are more robust and with much better

Fact-checking dataset of 10K real-world claims. The dataset covers multiple
domains, ranging from politics to public health, and provides annotated
evidence retrieved from the Internet. Further, we develop established baselines
and a novel approach that is able to model the evidence retrieval as a latent
variable, allowing jointly training with the veracity prediction model in an
end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments show that CHEF will provide a
challenging testbed for the development of fact-checking systems designed to
retrieve and reason over non-English claims.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large language models distill broad knowledge from text corpora. However,
they can be inconsistent when it comes to completing user specified tasks. This
issue can be addressed by finetuning such models via supervised learning on
curated datasets, or via reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
novel offline RL method, implicit language Q-learning (ILQL), designed for use
on language models, that combines both the flexible utility maximization
framework of RL algorithms with the ability of supervised learning to leverage
previously collected data, as well as its simplicity and stability. Our method
employs a combination of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset
support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide
language model generations towards maximizing user-specified utility functions.
In addition to empirically validating ILQL, we present a detailed empirical
analysis of situations where offline RL can be useful in natural language
generation settings, demonstrating how it can be a more effective utility
optimizer than prior approaches for end-to-end dialogue, and how it can
effectively optimize high variance reward functions based on subjective
judgement, such as whether to label a comment as toxic or not.

their study, there exists a formal definition for the concept of center in both
cases. In this paper, the relation between symmetries of polygons and multisets
of points in the plane and the coincidence and collinearity of their centers is
studied. First, a precise statement for the problem is given. Then, it is
proved that, given a polygon or a multiset of points in the plane, a given
point in the plane is a center for this object if and only if it belongs to the
set of points fixed by its group of symmetries.

Timing is everything, since
only one surface is exposed to heat at a given time. Should we flip only once,
or many times? We present a simple model of cooking by flipping, and some
interesting observations emerge. The rate of cooking depends on the spectrum of
a linear operator, and on the fixed point of a map. If the system has symmetric
thermal properties, the rate of cooking becomes independent of the sequence of
flips, as long as the last point to be cooked is the midpoint. After numerical
optimization, the flipping intervals become roughly equal in duration as their
number is increased, though the final interval is significantly longer. We find
that the optimal improvement in cooking time, given an arbitrary number of
flips, is about 29% over a single flip. This toy problem has some
characteristics reminiscent of turbulent thermal convection, such as a uniform
average interior temperature with boundary layers.

authors input the separated data into the data-driven failure analysis model to
analyze the time and latency of the connection by the concern of the impact and

funds to a selection of stocks. This is a particularly well-suited problem for
reinforcement learning, as daily rewards are compounding and objective
functions may include more than just profit, e.g., risk and sustainability. We
developed a novel utility function with the Sharpe ratio representing risk and
the environmental, social, and governance score (ESG) representing
sustainability. We show that a state-of-the-art policy gradient method -
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG) - fails to find the
optimum policy due to flat policy gradients and we therefore replaced gradient
descent with a genetic algorithm for parameter optimization. We show that our
system outperforms MADDPG while improving on deep Q-learning approaches by
allowing for continuous action spaces. Crucially, by incorporating risk and
sustainability criteria in the utility function, we improve on the
state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization; risk and
sustainability are essential in any modern trading strategy and we propose a
system that does not merely report these metrics, but that actively optimizes
the portfolio to improve on them.

  modules",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Biological neural networks operate in the presence of task disruptions as
they guide organisms toward goals. A familiar stream of stimulus-response
causations can be disrupted by subtask streams imposed by the environment. For
example, taking a familiar path to a foraging area might be disrupted by the
presence of a predator, necessitating a ""detour"" to the area. The detour can be
a known alternative path that must be dynamically composed with the original
path to accomplish the overall task. In this project, overarching base paths
are disrupted by independently learned path modules in the form of insertion,
substitution, and deletion modifications to the base paths such that the
resulting modified paths are novel to the network. The network's performance is
then tested on these paths that have been learned in piecemeal fashion. In sum,
the network must compose a new task on the fly. Several network architectures
are tested: Time delay neural network (TDNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM),
Temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Morphognosis, a hierarchical neural
network. LSTM and Morphognosis perform significantly better for this task.

  Tumor Segmentation and Classification",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In today's world of health care, brain tumor (BT) detection has become a
common occurrence. However, the manual BT classification approach is
time-consuming and only available at a few diagnostic centres. So Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is introduced in the medical field for
making accurate diagnoses and aiding in the patient's treatment before surgery.
But these networks have problems such as overfitting and being unable to
extract necessary features for classification. To overcome these problems, we
developed the TDA-IPH and Convolutional Transfer learning and Visual Recurrent
learning with Elephant Herding Optimization hyper-parameter tuning (CTVR-EHO)
models for BT segmentation and classification. Initially, the Topological Data
Analysis based Improved Persistent Homology (TDA-IPH) is designed to segment
the BT image. Then, from the segmented image, features are extracted
simultaneously using TL via the AlexNet model and Bidirectional Visual Long
Short Term Memory (Bi-VLSTM). Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) is used to
tune the hyper parameters of both networks to get an optimal result. Finally,
extracted features are concatenated and classified using the softmax activation
layer. The simulation result of this proposed CTVR-EHO and TDA-IPH method is
analysed based on some metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, loss, and F
score. When compared to other existing BT segmentation and classification
models, the proposed CTVR-EHO and TDA-IPH approaches show high accuracy
(99.8%), high recall (99.23%), high precision (99.67%), and high F score
(99.59%).
