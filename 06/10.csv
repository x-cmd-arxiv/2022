in antiferromagnet MnBi4Te7, a natural superlattice of alternating MnBi2Te4 and
Bi2Te3 layers, using cryogenic magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The observation
of magnetic contrast across domain walls and step edges confirms that the
antiferromagnetic order persists to the surface layers. The magnetic field
dependence of the MFM images reveals that the surface magnetic layer undergoes
a first-order spin-flip transition at a magnetic field that is lower than the
bulk transition, in excellent agreement with a revised Mills' model. Our
analysis indicates an enhancement of the order parameter in the surface
magnetic layer, implying robust ferromagnetism in the single-layer limit. The
direct visualization of surface spin-flip transition not only opens up
exploration of surface metamagnetic transitions in layered antiferromagnets,
but also provides experimental support for realizing quantized transport in
ultra-thin films of MnBi4Te7 and other natural superlattice topological
magnets.

  2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The seminal paper by Mazumdar and Saha \cite{MS17a} introduced an extensive
line of work on clustering with noisy queries. Yet, despite significant
progress on the problem, the proposed methods depend crucially on knowing the
exact probabilities of errors of the underlying fully-random oracle. In this
work, we develop robust learning methods that tolerate general semi-random
noise obtaining qualitatively the same guarantees as the best possible methods
in the fully-random model.
  More specifically, given a set of $n$ points with an unknown underlying
partition, we are allowed to query pairs of points $u,v$ to check if they are
in the same cluster, but with probability $p$, the answer may be adversarially
chosen. We show that information theoretically $O\left(\frac{nk \log n}
{(1-2p)^2}\right)$ queries suffice to learn any cluster of sufficiently large
size. Our main result is a computationally efficient algorithm that can
identify large clusters with $O\left(\frac{nk \log n} {(1-2p)^2}\right) +
\text{poly}\left(\log n, k, \frac{1}{1-2p} \right)$ queries, matching the
guarantees of the best known algorithms in the fully-random model. As a
corollary of our approach, we develop the first parameter-free algorithm for
the fully-random model, answering an open question by \cite{MS17a}.

GKT can run at $72.3$ FPS on 3090 GPU / $45.6$ FPS on 2080ti GPU and is robust
to the camera deviation and the predefined BEV height. And GKT achieves the
state-of-the-art real-time segmentation results, i.e., 38.0 mIoU
(100m$\times$100m perception range at a 0.5m resolution) on the nuScenes val

two social cues by following gaze, estimating gaze direction, and recognizing
affect. These features are then transformed into spatiotemporal maps through

the second stage (GASP) where we explore various techniques of late fusion for

that gaze direction and affective representations contribute a prediction to

improve GASP, supporting the necessity of considering affect-biased attention

reciprocal, i. e. position and momentum space covariant, way that the quadratic
Generalized Extended Uncertainty principle can alternatively be described in
terms of quantum dynamics on a general curved cotangent manifold. In the case

the admissible models to an interesting subclass of noncommutative geometries
which has not been studied before. Furthermore, we reverse the approach to
derive general anisotropically deformed uncertainty relations from general
background geometries. As an example, this formalism is applied to (anti)-de

outliers caused by the fit sticking in a false minimum, and with an improvement
of around three orders of magnitude in speed. We also demonstrate that using
principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data prior to
inputting it into the neural net can significantly increase the accuracy of the
parameter estimation for negligible computational cost, while also allowing a
simpler network architecture to be used.

nature of the mind, wresting it down from the intangible logic of Platonic
philosophy to a material basis for empirical science. However, as with many
long-lasting metaphors in science, the computer metaphor has been explored and
stretched long enough to reveal its boundaries. These boundaries highlight
widening gaps in our understanding of the brain's role in an organism's
goal-directed, intelligent behaviors and thoughts. In search of a more
appropriate metaphor that reflects the potentially noncomputable functions of
mind and brain, eight author groups answer the following questions: (1) What do
we understand by the computer metaphor of the brain and cognition? (2) What are
some of the limitations of this computer metaphor? (3) What metaphor should
replace the computational metaphor? (4) What findings support alternative
metaphors? Despite agreeing about feeling the strain of the strictures of
computer metaphors, the authors suggest an exciting diversity of possible
metaphoric options for future research into the mind and brain.

energy levels, radiative and collisional rates for HF, CF$^+$, HC$_3$N,
ArH$^+$, HCl, HCN, CN, CH, and CH$_2$. Simultaneously, we expand our molecular
network involving these molecules. For this purpose, we have added 561 new
reactions and have updated the existing 165 molecular reaction rates involving
these molecules. As a result, CLOUDY now predicts all the lines arising from
these nine molecules. In addition, we also update H$_2$--H$_2$ collisional data
up to rotational levels $J$=31 for $v$=0. We demonstrate spectroscopic
simulations of these molecules for a few astrophysical environments. Our
existing model for globules in the Crab nebula successfully predicts the
observed column density of ArH$^+$. Our model predicts a detectable amount of
HeH$^+$, OH$^+$, and CH$^+$ for the Crab nebula. We also model the ISM towards
HD185418, W31C, NGC 253, and our predictions match with most of the observed
column densities within the observed error bars. Very often molecular lines
trace various physical conditions. Hence, this update will be very supportive
for spectroscopic modelling of various astrophysical environments, particularly
involving sub-millimeter and mid-infrared observations using ALMA and JWST,

laws of black holes in terms of pure quantum states. We start with the two
opposed regions I and II in the Penrose diagram, and study the evolution of
matter in these regions, using the algebra derived earlier from the Shapiro
effect in quantum particles. Since this spacetime has two distinct asymptotic
regions, one must assume that there is a mechanism that reduces the number of
states. In earlier work we proposed that region II describes the angular
antipodes of region I, the `antipodal identification', but this eventually
leads to contradictions. Our much simpler proposal is now that all states
defined in region II are exact quantum clones of those in region I. This
indicates more precisely how to restore unitarity by making all quantum states
observable, and in addition suggests that generalisations towards other black
hole structures will be possible. An apparent complication is that the wave
function must evolve with a purely antisymmetric, imaginary-valued Hamiltonian,
but this complication can be well-understood in a realistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative
impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to
inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and
ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present
and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address
this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark
(BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442
authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from
linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology,
physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on
tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language
models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense
transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench,
across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In
addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide
a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both
improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with
rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes,
though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and
predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component,
whereas tasks that exhibit ""breakthrough"" behavior at a critical scale often
involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically
increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be
improved with prompting.

and to continually aim the camera at the landing pad during approach and
landing. This method demonstrates successful search, tracking, and landing with
4 of 5 tested fiducial systems on a physical drone with no human intervention.
Per fiducial system, we present the distributions of the distances from the

show representative examples of flight trajectories, marker tracking

we discuss qualitative strengths and weaknesses underlying each system.

adaptation is a key challenge in modern machine learning. Modelling causal
structure into neural networks holds the promise to accomplish robust zero and
few-shot adaptation. Recent advances in differentiable causal discovery have
proposed to factorize the data generating process into a set of modules, i.e.
one module for the conditional distribution of every variable where only causal
parents are used as predictors. Such a modular decomposition of knowledge
enables adaptation to distributions shifts by only updating a subset of
parameters. In this work, we systematically study the generalization and
adaption performance of such modular neural causal models by comparing it to
monolithic models and structured models where the set of predictors is not
constrained to causal parents. Our analysis shows that the modular neural
causal models outperform other models on both zero and few-shot adaptation in
low data regimes and offer robust generalization. We also found that the

LED carries both data and energy to an energy harvester relay node. In the
second phase (i.e., RF communication), the relay utilizes the harvested energy
to re-transmit the decoded information to the far RF user. During this phase,
the LED continues to transmit power (no information) to the relay node, aiming
to harvest energy that can be used in the next transmission block. We formulate
the optimization problem in the sense of maximizing the data rate under the
assumption of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. As the design parameters, the
direct current (DC) bias and the assigned time duration for VLC transmission
are taken into account. In particular, the joint non-convex optimization is
split into two sub-problems, which are then cyclically solved. In the first
sub-problem, we fix the assigned time duration to VLC link and utilize the

problem. In the second sub-problem, we fix the DC bias obtained in the previous

inductive bias in the VT architecture helps reducing the number of samples
necessary for training. However, the architecture modifications lead to a loss
of generality of the Transformer backbone, partially contradicting the push
towards the development of uniform architectures, shared, e.g., by both the
Computer Vision and the Natural Language Processing areas. In this work, we
propose a different and complementary direction, in which a local bias is
introduced using an auxiliary self-supervised task, performed jointly with
standard supervised training. Specifically, we exploit the observation that the
attention maps of VTs, when trained with self-supervision, can contain a
semantic segmentation structure which does not spontaneously emerge when
training is supervised. Thus, we explicitly encourage the emergence of this
spatial clustering as a form of training regularization. In more detail, we
exploit the assumption that, in a given image, objects usually correspond to
few connected regions, and we propose a spatial formulation of the information
entropy to quantify this object-based inductive bias. By minimizing the
proposed spatial entropy, we include an additional self-supervised signal
during training. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed
regularization leads to equivalent or better results than other VT proposals
which include a local bias by changing the basic Transformer architecture, and
it can drastically boost the VT final accuracy when using small-medium training
sets. The code is available at https://github.com/helia95/SAR.

we derive prior-free Bayesian regret bounds for vanilla-IDS which learns the

extend our analysis to linear MDPs and prove similar regret bounds for Thompson

a significant role for INOV in the case of low-luminous high accreting AGNs

integration of the associated stochastic differential equation. Here, we study
an alternative scheme based on integrating an ordinary differential equation
that describes the flow of probability. Acting as a transport map, this
equation deterministically pushes samples from the initial density onto samples
from the solution at any later time. Unlike integration of the stochastic
dynamics, the method has the advantage of giving direct access to quantities
that are challenging to estimate from trajectories alone, such as the
probability current, the density itself, and its entropy. The probability flow
equation depends on the gradient of the logarithm of the solution (its
""score""), and so is a-priori unknown. To resolve this dependence, we model the
score with a deep neural network that is learned on-the-fly by propagating a
set of samples according to the instantaneous probability current. We show
theoretically that the proposed approach controls the KL divergence from the
learned solution to the target, while learning on external samples from the

divergence. Empirically, we consider several high-dimensional Fokker-Planck
equations from the physics of interacting particle systems. We find that the

resonant meta-atoms -- has shown great promise in manipulating light-matter
interactions through subwavelength control of the phase, amplitude, and
polarization of light. These active metasurfaces arbitrarily transform an
incident wavefront using a reconfigurable spatial phase profile and thus have
been limited to manipulating coherent external sources. Light emitting
metasurfaces obtained through integration of incoherent emitters with
meta-atoms, have been used to statically increase the quantum efficiency of the
emission through Purcell factor enhancement and control the far-field emission
properties of the light to collimate and focus spontaneous emission. Active
manipulation of such incoherent light sources, however, remains a challenge as
current phase-sensitive approaches used for coherent sources cannot be directly
applied. Spatiotemporal control at ultrafast timescales of incoherent light

well-known to cause deviations to the parallax and proper motion of a star. In
a previous paper in this series, we argue that the astrometric mission Gaia can
identify long-period binaries by precisely measuring these arcs. An arc in a
star's path can also be caused by a fly-by -- the hyperbolic encounter with
another massive object. We quantify the apparent acceleration over time induced
by a companion star as a function of the impact parameter, velocity of
interaction, and companion mass. In principle, Gaia could be used to
astrometrically identify the contribution of massive compact halo objects to
the local dark matter potential of the Milky Way. However, after quantifying
their rate and Gaia's sensitivity, we find that fly-bys are so rare that Gaia
will probably never observe one. Therefore every star in the Gaia database
exhibiting astrometric acceleration is likely in a long-period binary with
another object. Nevertheless, we show how intermediate mass black holes, if
they exist in the Solar Neighborhood, could be detected by the anomalously
large accelerations they induce on nearby stars.

  We apply the tools that we develop to the case of $\mu$-random permutations

the existence of at least one phase transition for a generalized version of the

observed that very large models got over-fitted with relatively small data;
(ii) The length of training matters. Large models trained with masked image

Extensive evaluations clearly show that our method outperforms

can process various tasks with shared parameters and do not have any
task-specific modules. While generalist models achieve promising results on
various benchmarks, they have performance degradation on some tasks compared
with task-specialized models. In this work, we find that interference among
different tasks and modalities is the main factor to this phenomenon. To
mitigate such interference, we introduce the Conditional Mixture-of-Experts
(Conditional MoEs) to generalist models. Routing strategies under different
levels of conditions are proposed to take both the training/inference cost and
generalization ability into account. By incorporating the proposed Conditional
MoEs, the recently proposed generalist model Uni-Perceiver can effectively
mitigate the interference across tasks and modalities, and achieves
state-of-the-art results on a series of downstream tasks via prompt tuning on
1% of downstream data. Moreover, the introduction of Conditional MoEs still
holds the generalization ability of generalist models to conduct zero-shot
inference on new tasks, e.g., video-text retrieval and video caption. Code and
pre-trained generalist models shall be released.

first-order phase transition (FOPT). The right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) are
massless in the old vacuum, while they acquire a mass in the new vacuum
bubbles, and the mass gap is huge compared with the FOPT temperature. The
ultra-relativistic bubble walls sweep the RHNs into the bubbles, where the RHNs
experience fast decay and generate the lepton asymmetry, which is further
converted to the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). Since the RHNs are out
of equilibrium inside the bubble, the generated BAU does not suffer from the
thermal bath washout. We first discuss the general feature of such a FOPT
leptogenesis mechanism, and then realize it in an extended $B-L$ model. The
gravitational waves from $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking could be detected at the future
interferometers.

some of the most recent observations made after the model was made. These
include the complexity of the stellar populations in the Magellanic Bridge, for
which kinematics, ages, and distances are well measured, and the North Tidal
Arm, for which the model predicts its formation from the Milky Way tidal
forces. It appears that this over-constrained model provides a good path to
investigate the Stream properties. This contrasts with tidal models that
reproduce only half of the Stream's main properties, in particular a tidal tail
cannot reproduce the observed inter-twisted filaments, and its gas content is
not sufficiently massive to provide the large amount of HI and HII gas
associated to the Stream. Despite the efforts made to reproduce the large
amounts of gas brought by the Clouds, it seems that no viable solution for the

independent of all other probes. One key ingredient in time delay cosmography
are high accuracy lens models. Those are currently expensive to obtain, both,
in terms of computing and investigator time (10$^{5-6}$ CPU hours and $\sim$
0.5-1 year, respectively). Major improvements in modeling speed are therefore
necessary to exploit the large number of lenses that are forecast to be
discovered over the current decade. In order to bypass this roadblock, building
on the work by Shajib et al. (2019), we develop an automated modeling pipeline
and apply it to a sample of 30 quadruply imaged quasars and one lensed compact
galaxy, observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in multiple bands. Our automated
pipeline can derive models for 30/31 lenses with few hours of human time and
<100 CPU hours of computing time for a typical system. For each lens, we
provide measurements of key parameters and predictions of magnification as well
as time delays for the multiple images. We characterize the
cosmography-readiness of our models using the stability of differences in
Fermat potential (proportional to time delay) w.r.t. modeling choices. We find
that for 10/30 lenses our models are cosmography or nearly cosmography grade
(<3% and 3-5% variations). For 6/30 lenses the models are close to cosmography
grade (5-10%). These results are based on informative priors and will need to
be confirmed by further analysis. However, they are also likely to improve by
extending the pipeline modeling sequence and options. In conclusion, we show
that uniform cosmography grade modeling of large strong lens samples is within
reach.

sublinear correlation between radio and X-ray brightness for both the clusters
($F_{\mathrm{radio}} \propto F_{\rm X}^{0.7}$). Finally, we correlate the
Compton-$y$ and X-ray data, finding that an isothermal model is consistent with
the cluster profiles, $y \propto F_{\rm X}^{0.5}$. By adopting an

radio, X-ray, and Compton-$y$ data to estimate the scaling index for the
magnetic field profile, $B(r) \propto n_{\mathrm{e}}(r)^{\eta}$ in the

combined radio and Compton-$y$ signal exhibits a significantly tighter
correlation with the X-ray across the clusters than when the datasets are
independently correlated. We find $\eta \sim 0.6{-}0.8$. These results are
consistent with the upper limit we derive for the scaling index of the magnetic

explicitly that mass transfer in QPE systems is always highly stable, despite
recent claims to the contrary in the literature. This stability may explain the
alternating long--short eruptions seen in some QPE sources. As the WD orbit
decays, the eruptions occupy larger fractions of the orbit and become brighter,
making searches for quasi--periodicities in bright low--mass galaxy nuclei
potentially fruitful.

inverse-Compton processes. This spectral break has been employed to: (1)
constrain the age of pulsars that contribute to the excess, (2) argue that a
large number of pulsars must significantly contribute to the positron flux, and
(3) argue that spectral cutoffs cannot distinguish between dark matter and
pulsar models. We prove that this spectral feature does not exist -- it appears
due to approximations that treat inverse-Compton scattering as a continuous,
instead of as a discrete and catastrophic, energy-loss process. Astrophysical
sources do not produce sharp spectral features via cooling, reopening the
possibility that such a feature would provide incontrovertible evidence for
dark matter.

we measure the 350~GHz dust continuum emission towards the center of NGC\,253
at 47~milliarcsecond (0.8 pc) resolution using data from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We report the detection of 350~GHz

the prominent South-West streamer. In this feature, the dust emission has a
width of $\approx$~8~pc, is located at the outer edge of the CO emission, and
corresponds to a molecular gas mass of $\sim~(8-17)\times10^6$~M$_\odot$. In
the starburst nucleus, we measure the resolved radial profiles, sizes, and
molecular gas masses of the SSCs. Compared to previous work at somewhat lower
spatial resolution, the SSCs here break apart into smaller substructures with
radii $0.4-0.7$~pc. In projection, the SSCs, dust, and dense molecular gas

constrain the stellar-mass growth history (SMGH) of the MW with two methods:
($i$) direct measurement of the MW's star formation history, and ($ii$)
assuming the MW is a typical star-forming galaxy that remains on the
star-forming main sequence. We select MW progenitors based on these two SMGHs
at $z=0.2-2.0$ from the CANDELS/3D-HST data. We estimate the structural
parameters (including half-mass radius $r_{50}$ and S\'ersic index) from the
stellar-mass profiles. Our key finding is that the progenitors of the MW galaxy
grow self-similarly on spatially resolved scales with roughly a constant
half-mass radius ($\sim2-3$ kpc) over the past 10 Gyr, while their stellar
masses increase by about 1 dex, implying little-to-no inside-out growth. We
discover that the radius containing $20\%$ of the stellar mass ($r_{20}$)
decreases by $60\%$ between redshifts of $z=2.0$ and $z=0.7$, while the central
stellar-mass density ($\Sigma_1$) increases by a factor of 1.3 dex over the
same time and the S\'ersic index changes as $n\propto(1+z)^{-1.41\pm0.19}$.
This is consistent with an early ($z>1$) formation of a thick disk, followed by
the formation of a bar that led to an increase in the mass in the core. The
formation and evolution of the thin disk had only little impact on the overall
half-mass size. We also show that the constant-size evolution of the MW
progenitors challenges semiempirical approaches and numerical simulations.

affect the resulting structure. Hence, kinematic models must be corrected for
these deceleration effects in order to adequately predict the precession
parameters. The synthetic spectral index map shows that the jet side and
leading edges possess relatively steeper spectral index values than the jet
ridge lines, whereas the hotspots show flat spectral index values. The jets are
also found to be highly linearly polarized (up to 76%) and the magnetic field
lines, in general, follow the jet locus which is formed due to the jet-ambient
medium interaction. Diffusive shocks, in this context, keep the structure
active during its course of evolution. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that
these galaxies deviate significantly from the equipartition approximation
leading to a discrepancy in their spectral and dynamical age.

Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Precipitation is potentially a mechanism through which the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) can regulate a galaxy's star formation. Here we present idealized
simulations of isolated Milky Way-like galaxies intended to examine the ability
of galaxies to self-regulate their star formation, particularly via
precipitation. Our simulations are the first CGM-focused idealized models to
include stellar feedback due to the explicit formation of stars. We also
examine the impact of rotation in the CGM. Using six simulations, we explore
variations in the initial CGM $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ ratio and rotation
profile. Those variations affect the amount of star formation and gas accretion
within the galactic disk. Our simulations are sensitive to their initial
conditions, requiring us to gradually increase the efficiency of stellar
feedback to avoid destroying the CGM before its gas can be accreted. Despite
this gradual increase, the resulting outflows still evacuate large, hot
cavities within the CGM and even beyond $r_{200}$. Some of the CGM gas avoids
interacting with the cavities and is able to feed the disk along its midplane,
but the cooling of feedback-heated gas far from the midplane is too slow to
supply the disk with additional gas. Our simulations illustrate the importance
of physical mechanisms in the outer CGM and IGM for star formation regulation
in Milky Way-scale halos.

GALEX NUV are fitted with ZPEG in order to estimate the stellar masses and

a continuous relationship between the present sSFR of galaxies and their
stellar mass, that spans all morphological types of the Hubble sequence.
Irregular galaxies to Sab spirals make up the Blue Cloud, the Green Plain
(formerly Valley) is made up of early-type spirals (S0a-Sa) while the Red
Sequence contains all lenticular and elliptical galaxies, with systematically
higher masses for the ellipticals. Galaxies across the Green Plain undergo a
marked growth by a factor 2 to 3 in their bulge-to-total mass ratio and a
systematic profile change from pseudo to classical bulges, as well as a
significant reddening interpreted as star formation fading in their disks.
Therefore, the Green Plain is a transition region, and we exclude a
predominantly quick transit due to rapid quenching. We suggest that tracers of
increased star formation (bright HII regions, spiral arms, flocculence)
determine the limited scatter of the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies.
The high frequency of bars for all spirals as well as the stronger spiral arms
and flocculence in the knee of the Green Plain suggest that internal dynamics,
likely triggered by flybys or mergers, may be the key to the bulge growth of
massive disk galaxies, marker of the aging of galaxies from star forming to
quiescence. The Hubble sequence can then be considered as an inverse sequence
of galaxy physical evolution.

inner velocity gradients and dispersions of the EMPGs with H$\alpha$ emission.
Carefully masking out sub-structures originated by inflow and/or outflow, we
fit 3-dimensional disk models to the observed H$\alpha$ flux, velocity, and
velocity-dispersion maps. All the EMPGs show rotational velocities ($v_{\rm
rot}$) of 5--23 km s$^{-1}$ smaller than the velocity dispersions
($\sigma_{0}$) of 17--31 km s$^{-1}$, indicating dispersion-dominated ($v_{\rm
rot}/\sigma_{0}=0.29-0.80<1$) systems affected by inflow and/or outflow. Except
for two EMPGs with large uncertainties, we find that the EMPGs have very large
gas-mass fractions of $f_{\rm gas}\simeq 0.9-1.0$. Comparing our results with
other H$\alpha$ kinematics studies, we find that $v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0}$
decreases and $f_{\rm gas}$ increases with decreasing metallicity, decreasing
stellar mass, and increasing specific star-formation rate. We also find that
simulated high-$z$ ($z\sim 7$) forming galaxies have gas fractions and dynamics
similar to the observed EMPGs. Our EMPG observations and the simulations
suggest that primordial galaxies are gas-rich dispersion-dominated systems,
which would be identified by the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)

electromagnetic response associated to anomaly due to the separation of the

a Weyl semimetal phase can give rise to an ordered phase, and spontaneously
break the chiral symmetry. This then leads to a Goldstone mode which can have

a simple model of this dynamical axion insulator and calculate the equations of

morphological patterns at different observing frequencies. We carry out a
systematic investigation of the structural complexity of the nebula using
publicly available imaging data at radio and infrared frequencies. For the
analysis, we use the well-known multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis
(MFDFA) in two dimensions. We study the Crab nebula at various length scales to
search for local scaling behaviors. We find that both radio and infra-red data
exhibit long-range correlations, as expected from the underlying physics of the
supernova explosion and evolution. The correlations follow a power-law scaling
with length scales. The structural complexity is found to be multifractal in
nature, as evidenced by the dependence of the generalized Hurst exponent on the
order of the moments of the detrended fluctuation function. The nature and
strength of the multifractality vary with the observing frequency. By repeating
the analysis on shuffled data, we further probe the origin of the
multifractality in both the imaging data. For the radio data, we find that the
probability density function (PDF) is close to a Gaussian form, and hence the
multifractal behaviour is due to the differing nature of long-range
correlations of the large and small detrended fluctuation field values. In
contrast, we find that the infra-red data has a broad non-Gaussian PDF.
Consequently, its multifractal properties originate from the broad PDF as well
as the different correlations of large and small fluctuation values. Our
analysis thus provides a fresh perspective on the morphology of the Crab nebula
from a statistical physics viewpoint.

$30^\circ$ for a spanwise periodic wing at a chord-based Reynolds number of
$400$ and a Mach number of $0.1$. Wing sweep affects the wake dynamics,
especially in terms of stability and spanwise fluctuations with implications on
the development of three-dimensional wakes. We observe that wing sweep
attenuates spanwise fluctuations. Even as the sweep angle influences the wake,
force and pressure coefficients can be collapsed for low angles of attack when
examined in wall-normal and wingspan-normal independent flow components. Some
small deviations at high sweep and incidence angles are attributed to vortical
wake structures that impose secondary aerodynamic loads, revealed through the

uncover oblique modes with high disturbance amplification. The resolvent
analysis also reveals the presence of wavemakers in the shear-dominated region
associated with the emergence of three-dimensional wakes at high angles of

  Heterogeneous Data",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing theory predicts that data heterogeneity will degrade the performance
of the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm in federated learning. However,
in practice, the simple FedAvg algorithm converges very well. This paper
explains the seemingly unreasonable effectiveness of FedAvg that contradicts
the previous theoretical predictions. We find that the key assumption of
bounded gradient dissimilarity in previous theoretical analyses is too
pessimistic to characterize data heterogeneity in practical applications. For a
simple quadratic problem, we demonstrate there exist regimes where large
gradient dissimilarity does not have any negative impact on the convergence of
FedAvg. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new quantity, average drift
at optimum, to measure the effects of data heterogeneity, and explicitly use it
to present a new theoretical analysis of FedAvg. We show that the average drift
at optimum is nearly zero across many real-world federated training tasks,
whereas the gradient dissimilarity can be large. And our new analysis suggests
FedAvg can have identical convergence rates in homogeneous and heterogeneous
data settings, and hence, leads to better understanding of its empirical
success.

science and machine learning, including epsilon-graphs that contain edges
between pairs of data points that are nearer than epsilon and kNN-graphs that
connect each point to its k-nearest neighbors. Recently, topological data
analysis has emerged as a family of mathematical and computational techniques
to investigate topological features of data using simplicial complexes. These
are a higher-order generalization of graphs and many techniques such as
Vietoris-Rips (VR) filtrations are also parameterized by a distance epsilon.
Here, we develop kNN complexes as a generalization of kNN graphs, leading to
kNN-based persistent homology techniques for which we develop stability and
convergence results. We apply this technique to characterize the convergence
properties PageRank, highlighting how the perspective of discrete topology
complements traditional geometrical-based analyses of convergence.
Specifically, we show that convergence of relative positions (i.e., ranks) is
captured by kNN persistent homology, whereas persistent homology with VR
filtrations coincides with vector-norm convergence. Beyond PageRank, kNN-based
persistent homology is expected to be useful to other data-science applications

highly packed regions of nonzero initial vorticity, we demonstrate using high

be very high when the number of grids is large. In order to reduce the
computational complexity, we further propose a low-complexity threshold-based
policy through the analysis of the first-order approximation of the value

we revisit the problem of the leading pairing instability of two-component
unconventional superconductors on the triangular lattice -- such as
$(p_{x},\,p_{y})$-wave and $(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}},\,d_{xy})$-wave. Such a system has
two possible superconducting states: the chiral state (e.g. $p+ip$ or $d+id$),
which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and the nematic state (e.g. $p+p$ or
$d+d$), which breaks the threefold rotational symmetry of the lattice.
Weak-coupling calculations generally favor the chiral over the nematic
superconducting state, raising the question of what mechanism can stabilize the
latter. Here, we show that the electromagnetic field fluctuations can play a
crucial role in selecting between these two states. Specifically, we derive and
analyze the effective free energy for the two-component superconducting order
parameter after integrating out the gauge-field fluctuations, which is formally
justified if the spatial order parameter fluctuations can be neglected. A
non-analytic cubic term arises, as in the case of a conventional $s$-wave
superconductor. However, unlike the latter, the cubic term depends on the
relative phase and on the relative amplitudes between the two order parameter
components, in such a way that it generally favors the nematic state. This
result is a direct consequence of the fact that the stiffness of the
superconducting order parameter is not isotropic. Competition with the quartic
term, which favors the chiral state, leads to a renormalized phase diagram in
which the nematic state displaces the chiral state over a wide region in the
parameter space. We analyze the stability of the fluctuation-induced nematic
phase, generalize our results to tetragonal lattices, and discuss their
applicability to candidate nematic superconductors, including twisted bilayer
graphene.

$\tilde\Omega\left(d\kappa \cdot \frac{\kappa}{N}\right)$.
  Bounds of the form $\Omega(d\kappa)$ were known for learning parity and other
problems defined over finite fields. Bounds that apply in a narrow range of

prototypes usually in the form of software, aiming to specific challenges
proposed by the organizers. These events became a widespread practice in the IT
industry, universities and many other scenarios, as a result of a growing
open-innovation trend in the last decade. Since the main deliverable of these
events is a demonstrable version of an idea, such as early hardware or software
prototypes, the short time frame requires participants to quickly understand
the proposed challenge or even identify issues related to a given domain. To
create solutions, teams follow an ad-hoc but effective design approach, that
many times seems informal since the background of the participants is rather
centered on technical aspects (e.g., web and mobile programming) and does not
involve any training in Design Thinking.
  To understand this creative process, we conducted 37 interviews (32
hackathons winners and 5 hackathon organizers) with people from 16 countries.
We aimed to identify the design processes and recurring design methods applied
by winners in these events. Also, we conducted a focus group with 8 people
experienced in hackathons (participants and organizers) to discuss our
findings. Our analysis revealed that although hackathon winners with IT
background have no formal training on Design Thinking, they are aware of many
design methods, typically following a sequence of phases that involve divergent
and convergent thinking to explore the problem space and propose alternatives
in a solution space, which is the rationale behind Design Thinking. We derived
a set of recommendations based on design strategies that seem to lead to
successful hackathon participation. These recommendations can also be useful to
organizers who intend to enhance the experience of newcomers in hackathons.

static logged dataset without continually interacting with the environment. The
distribution shift between the learned policy and the behavior policy makes it
necessary for the value function to stay conservative such that
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will not be severely overestimated. However,
existing approaches, penalizing the unseen actions or regularizing with the
behavior policy, are too pessimistic, which suppresses the generalization of
the value function and hinders the performance improvement. This paper explores
mild but enough conservatism for offline learning while not harming
generalization. We propose Mildly Conservative Q-learning (MCQ), where OOD
actions are actively trained by assigning them proper pseudo Q values. We
theoretically show that MCQ induces a policy that behaves at least as well as
the behavior policy and no erroneous overestimation will occur for OOD actions.
Experimental results on the D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that MCQ achieves
remarkable performance compared with prior work. Furthermore, MCQ shows
superior generalization ability when transferring from offline to online, and
significantly outperforms baselines. Our code is publicly available at

stories with an underlying theme of combinatorics emerging from scattering
amplitudes in quantum field theories.
  The first part tells the tale of the $c_2$-invariant, an arithmetic invariant
related to the Feynman integral in $\phi^4$-theory, which studies the zeros of
the Kirchoff polynomial and related graph polynomials. Through reformulating
the $c_2$-invariant as a purely combinatorial problem, we show how enumerating
certain edge bipartitions through fixed-point free involutions can complete a
special case of the long sought after $c_2$ completion conjecture.
  The second part tells the tale of the positive Grassmannian and a
combinatorial T-duality map on its cells, as related to scattering amplitudes
in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM theory. In particular, T-duality is a bridge
between triangulations of the hypersimplex and triangulations of the
amplituhedron, two objects that appear as images of the positive Grassmannian.
We give an algorithm for viewing T-duality as a map on Le diagrams and
characterize a nice structure to the Le diagrams (which can then be used in
lieu of the algorithm). Through this Le diagram perspective on T-duality, we
show how the dimensional relationship between the positroid cells on either
side of the map can be directly explained.

raised severe concerns about the piracy of Intellectual Properties and illegal
overproduction. Logic locking has emerged as an obfuscation technique to
protect outsourced chip designs, where the circuit netlist is locked and can
only be functional once a secure key is programmed. However, Boolean
Satisfiability-based attacks have shown to break logic locking, simultaneously
motivating researchers to develop more secure countermeasures. In this paper,
we present a novel fault injection attack to break any locking technique that
relies on a stored secret key, and denote this attack as AFIA, ATPG-guided
Fault Injection Attack. The proposed attack is based on sensitizing a key bit
to the primary output while injecting faults at a few other key lines that
block the propagation of the targeted key bit. AIFA is very effective in
determining a key bit as there exists a stuck-at fault pattern that detects a
stuck-at 1 (or stuck-at 0) fault at any key line. The average complexity of
number of injected faults for AFIA is linear with the key size and requires
only |K| test patterns to determine a secret key, K. AFIA requires a fewer
number of injected faults to sensitize a bit to the primary output, compared to
2|K|-1 faults for the differential fault analysis attack [26].

refractive index sensors with multiple nearly perfect absorption peaks are
proposed. The geometric parameters of the metadevices are optimized using
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to obtain three strong
absorption peaks in the near-infrared (near-IR) regime with intensities of
99.72%, 99.18%, and 98.13%. Further calculations show that the sensitivities of
the three strong peaks reach 339.1 nm shift per refractive index units

merits (FOMs) reach up to 15.41/RIU, 14.65/RIU and 10.85/RIU, respectively,
exhibiting great potential for near-IR refractive index sensing. Moreover, the

variance with previous conjectures, we propose an analytic estimation for the
SA algorithmic threshold by comparing the spinodal point of the paramagnetic

between thermodynamical phase transitions and out of equilibrium behavior of
Glauber dynamics. We also study an improved version of SA, called replicated SA

numerical evidence that the algorithmic threshold for the RSA coincides with

on various downstream tasks. Recent investigations of lottery tickets
hypothesis (LTH) demonstrate such enormous pre-trained models can be replaced
by extremely sparse subnetworks (a.k.a. matching subnetworks) without
sacrificing transferability. However, practical security-crucial applications
usually pose more challenging requirements beyond standard transfer, which also
demand these subnetworks to overcome adversarial vulnerability. In this paper,
we formulate a more rigorous concept, Double-Win Lottery Tickets, in which a
located subnetwork from a pre-trained model can be independently transferred on
diverse downstream tasks, to reach BOTH the same standard and robust
generalization, under BOTH standard and adversarial training regimes, as the
full pre-trained model can do. We comprehensively examine various pre-training
mechanisms and find that robust pre-training tends to craft sparser double-win
lottery tickets with superior performance over the standard counterparts. For
example, on downstream CIFAR-10/100 datasets, we identify double-win matching
subnetworks with the standard, fast adversarial, and adversarial pre-training
from ImageNet, at 89.26%/73.79%, 89.26%/79.03%, and 91.41%/83.22% sparsity,
respectively. Furthermore, we observe the obtained double-win lottery tickets
can be more data-efficient to transfer, under practical data-limited (e.g., 1%
and 10%) downstream schemes. Our results show that the benefits from robust
pre-training are amplified by the lottery ticket scheme, as well as the
data-limited transfer setting. Codes are available at

retrieval, and visualization, are treated primarily as embedding tasks where
the ultimate metric is some variant of the Euclidean distance (e.g., cosine or
Mahalanobis), and the algorithm must learn to embed points into the pre-chosen
space. The study of non-Euclidean geometries or appropriateness is often not
explored, which we believe is due to a lack of tools for learning non-Euclidean
measures of distance. Under the belief that the use of asymmetric methods in
particular have lacked sufficient study, we propose a new approach to learning
arbitrary Bergman divergences in a differentiable manner via input convex
neural networks. Over a set of both new and previously studied tasks, including
asymmetric regression, ranking, and clustering, we demonstrate that our method
more faithfully learns divergences than prior Bregman learning approaches. In
doing so we obtain the first method for learning neural Bregman divergences and
with it inherit the many nice mathematical properties of Bregman divergences,
providing the foundation and tooling for better developing and studying
asymmetric distance learning.

recently been included in simulations of galaxy formation. However, significant
uncertainties remain in how these components affect galaxy evolution. To
understand their common observational tracers, we analyze the magnetic fields
in a set of high-resolution, magneto-hydrodynamic, cosmological simulations of
Milky-Way-like galaxies from the FIRE-2 project. We compare mock observables of
magnetic field tracers for simulations with and without CRs to observations of
Zeeman splitting and rotation/dispersion measures. We find reasonable agreement
between simulations and observations in both the neutral and the ionised
interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the simulated galaxies with CRs show
weaker ISM $|\textbf{B}|$ fields on average compared to their
magnetic-field-only counterparts. This is a manifestation of the effects of CRs
in the diffuse, low density inner circum-galactic medium (CGM). We find that
equipartition between magnetic and cosmic ray energy densities may be valid at
large ($>$ 1 kpc) scales for typical ISM densities of Milky-Way-like galaxies,
but not in their halos. Within the ISM, the magnetic fields in our simulated
galaxies follow a power-law scaling with gas density. The scaling extends down
to hydrogen number densities $<$ 300 cm$^{-3}$, in contrast to
observationally-derived models, but consistent with the observational
measurements. Finally, we generate synthetic rotation measure (RM) profiles for
projections of the simulated galaxies and compare to observational constraints
in the CGM. While consistent with upper limits, improved data are needed to
detect the predicted CGM RMs at 10-200 kpc and better constrain theoretical
predictions.

  Dependency? Evidence from Sweden",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Occasional social assistance prevents individuals from a range of social
ills, particularly unemployment and poverty. It remains unclear, however, how
and to what extent continued reliance on social assistance leads to individuals
becoming trapped in social assistance dependency. In this paper, we build on
the theory of cumulative disadvantage and examine whether the accumulated use
of social assistance over the life course is associated with an increased risk
of future social assistance recipiency. We also analyze the extent to which
living in disadvantaged neighborhoods constitutes an important mechanism in the
explanation of this association. Our analyses use Swedish population registers
for the full population of individuals born in 1981, and these individuals are
followed for approximately 17 years. While most studies are limited by a lack
of granular, life-history data, our granular individual-level data allow us to
apply causal-mediation analysis, and thereby quantify the extent to which the
likelihood of ending up in social assistance dependency is affected by residing
in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our findings show the accumulation of social
assistance over the studied period is associated with a more than four-fold
increase on a risk ratio scale for future social assistance recipiency,
compared to never having received social assistance during the period examined.
Then, we examine how social assistance dependency is mediated by prolonged
exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our results suggest that the indirect
effect of disadvantaged neighborhoods is weak to moderate. Therefore, social
assistance dependency may be a multilevel process. Future research is to
explore how the mediating effects of disadvantaged neighborhoods vary in
different contexts.

empirical studies of collective efficacy use large sample surveys to estimate
collective efficacy of different neighborhoods within an urban setting. Such
studies have demonstrated an association between collective efficacy and local

traditional collective efficacy measurement strategies, the Adolescent Health

we introduce a novel nonstationary spatial model for interpolation of the AHDC

administrative data on land use. Our constructive model specification strategy
involves dimension expansion of a latent spatial process and the use of a
filter defined by the land-use partition of the study region to connect the
latent multivariate spatial process to the observed ordinal ratings of
collective efficacy. Careful consideration is given to the issues of parameter

vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, many of the past attacks require
the adversary to solve an input-dependent optimization problem using gradient
descent which makes the attack impractical in real-time. These adversarial
examples are also tightly coupled to the attacked model and are not as
successful in transferring to different models. In this work, we propose
ReFace, a real-time, highly-transferable attack on face recognition models
based on Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATNs). ATNs model adversarial
example generation as a feed-forward neural network. We find that the white-box
attack success rate of a pure U-Net ATN falls substantially short of
gradient-based attacks like PGD on large face recognition datasets. We
therefore propose a new architecture for ATNs that closes this gap while
maintaining a 10000x speedup over PGD. Furthermore, we find that at a given
perturbation magnitude, our ATN adversarial perturbations are more effective in
transferring to new face recognition models than PGD. ReFace attacks can
successfully deceive commercial face recognition services in a transfer attack
setting and reduce face identification accuracy from 82% to 16.4% for AWS
SearchFaces API and Azure face verification accuracy from 91% to 50.1%.

movie recommendation task. We discover that the two methods behave very
differently depending on the sparsity of the data set. LIME does better than
SHAP in dense segments of the data set and SHAP does better in sparse segments.
We trace this difference to the differing bias-variance characteristics of the
underlying estimators of LIME and SHAP. We find that SHAP exhibits lower
variance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this
lower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and
missing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases
the bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a
favorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings.
With this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a
novel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME
(CLIMB) that is superior to LIME and much faster than SHAP.

meta-initialization parameters for all users and rapidly adapt them into local
parameters for each user respectively. They aim at deriving general knowledge
across preference learning of various users, so as to rapidly adapt to the

However, previous works have shown that recommender systems are generally

improving the recommendation performance with cold-start, the fairness issues

demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOVER on the representative meta-learned user

Unfortunately, existing approaches fall too short for these challenges; online
anomaly detection methods bear the burden of handling the complexity while
offline deep anomaly detection methods suffer from the evolving data
distribution. This paper presents a framework for online deep anomaly
detection, ARCUS, which can be instantiated with any autoencoder-based deep
anomaly detection methods. It handles the complex and evolving data streams
using an adaptive model pooling approach with two novel techniques:
concept-driven inference and drift-aware model pool update; the former detects
anomalies with a combination of models most appropriate for the complexity, and
the latter adapts the model pool dynamically to fit the evolving data streams.
In comprehensive experiments with ten data sets which are both high-dimensional
and concept-drifted, ARCUS improved the anomaly detection accuracy of the
streaming variants of state-of-the-art autoencoder-based methods and that of
the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods by up to 22% and 37%,

resonance (MMR), in which the planets' periods are related by integer ratios.
Recent observations indicate that planets in MMR can be either apsidally
aligned or anti-aligned. How these different configurations arise is unclear.
In this paper, we study the MMR capture process of migrating planets, focusing
on the property of the apsidal angles of the captured planets. We show that the
standard picture of MMR capture, in which the planets undergo convergent
migration and experience eccentricity damping due to planet-disc interactions,
always leads to apsidal anti-alignment of the captured planets. However, when
the planets experience eccentricity driving from the disc, apsidally aligned
configuration in MMR can be produced. In this configuration, both planets'
resonance angles circulate, but a ""mixed"" resonance angle librates and traps
the planets near the nominal resonance location. The MMR capture process in the
presence of disc eccentricity driving is generally complex and irregular, and
can lead to various outcomes, including apsidal alignment and anti-alignment,
as well as the disruption of the resonance. We suggest that the two resonant
planets in the K2-19 system, with their moderate eccentricities and aligned
apsides, have experienced eccentricity driving from their natal disc in the
past.

an erroneous estimate of the analysis state (initial condition for the next

dynamic characteristics similar to those observed in molecular systems, despite
temperature playing no role in their properties. This has led to an effort to
develop a statistical mechanics for granular materials that has focused on
establishing an equivalent to the microcanonical ensemble and a
temperature-like thermodynamic variable. Here, we expand on these ideas by
introducing a granular potential into the Edwards ensemble, as an analogue to
the chemical potential, and explore its properties using a simple model of a
granular system. A simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of the model shows the
effect of mass transport leading to equilibrium and how this is connected to
the redistribution of volume in the system. An exact analytical treatment of
the model shows that the compactivity and the ratio of the granular potential
to the compactivity determine the equilibrium between two open systems that are

differences.

Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, weakly vanishes. However, when the action
is expanded around a classical solution as in the case of a single scalar field
inflationary model, there appears a non-vanishing Hamiltonian and additional
first class constraints; but this time the theory becomes perturbative in the
number of fluctuation fields. We show that one can reorganize this expansion
and solve the Hamiltonian constraint exactly, which yield an explicit all order
action. On the other hand, the momentum constraint can be solved perturbatively
in the tensor modes $\gamma_{ij}$ by still keeping the curvature perturbation
$\zeta$ dependence exact. In this way, after gauge fixing, one can obtain a
semi-exact Hamiltonian for $\zeta$ which only gets corrections from the
interactions with the tensor modes (hence the Hamiltonian becomes exact when
the tensor perturbations set to zero). The equations of motion clearly exhibit
when the evolution of $\zeta$ involves a logarithmic time dependence, which is
a subtle point that has been debated in the literature. We discuss the long
wavelength and late time limits, and obtain some simple but non-trivial
classical solutions of the $\zeta$ zero-mode.

Regulation) grant individuals the right to be forgotten. In the context of
machine learning, this requires a model to forget about a training data sample
if requested by the data owner (i.e., machine unlearning). As an essential step
prior to machine unlearning, it is still a challenge for a data owner to tell
whether or not her data have been used by an unauthorized party to train a
machine learning model. Membership inference is a recently emerging technique
to identify whether a data sample was used to train a target model, and seems
to be a promising solution to this challenge. However, straightforward adoption
of existing membership inference approaches fails to address the challenge
effectively due to being originally designed for attacking membership privacy
and suffering from several severe limitations such as low inference accuracy on
well-generalized models. In this paper, we propose a novel membership inference
approach inspired by the backdoor technology to address the said challenge.
Specifically, our approach of Membership Inference via Backdooring (MIB)
leverages the key observation that a backdoored model behaves very differently
from a clean model when predicting on deliberately marked samples created by a
data owner. Appealingly, MIB requires data owners' marking a small number of
samples for membership inference and only black-box access to the target model,
with theoretical guarantees for inference results. We perform extensive
experiments on various datasets and deep neural network architectures, and the
results validate the efficacy of our approach, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the
training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference.

has been studied extensively in the past, but most existing approaches assume
that the complete set of historical data from the whole network is available.
This requirement presents a great challenge in applications, especially for
large, distributed networks in the real world, where data collection is
accomplished by many clients in a parallel fashion. Often, each client only has
the time series data from a partial set of nodes and the client has access to
only partial timestamps of the whole time series data and partial structure of
the network. Due to privacy concerns or license related issues, the data
collected by different clients cannot be shared. To accurately predict the
network dynamics while protecting the privacy of different parties is a
critical problem in the modern time. Here, we propose a solution based on
federated graph neural networks (FGNNs) that enables the training of a global
dynamic model for all parties without data sharing. We validate the working of
our FGNN framework through two types of simulations to predict a variety of
network dynamics (four discrete and three continuous dynamics). As a
significant real-world application, we demonstrate successful prediction of
State-wise influenza spreading in the USA. Our FGNN scheme represents a general

diffusion and entanglement throughout Hilbert space typically increase the
fidelity decay rate. Simulations of the gate-efficient quantum sawtooth map
support these predictions, and experiments performed on three qubits on the
IBM-Q quantum hardware platform at fixed gate count qualitatively confirm the
predictions. A pure depolarizing noise model, often used within randomized

Lindblad models can provide an explanation. They can also estimate the
effective Lindblad coherence times during gates, and find a consistent
$2\text{-}3\times$ shorter effective $T_2$ dephasing time than reported for
idle qubits. Additionally, the observed error per CNOT gate exceeds IBM-Q's

independent of the shell thickness. In the angular case, the lowest energy

the essence of Andreev reflection, only by lengthwise summation of the

labeling informative samples from an unlabeled dataset. In a real-world active
learning scenario, considering the diversity of the selected samples is crucial
because many redundant or highly similar samples exist. Core-set approach is
the promising diversity-based method selecting diverse samples based on the
distance between samples. However, the approach poorly performs compared to the
uncertainty-based approaches that select the most difficult samples where
neural models reveal low confidence. In this work, we analyze the feature space
through the lens of the density and, interestingly, observe that locally sparse
regions tend to have more informative samples than dense regions. Motivated by
our analysis, we empower the core-set approach with the density-awareness and
propose a density-aware core-set (DACS). The strategy is to estimate the
density of the unlabeled samples and select diverse samples mainly from sparse
regions. To reduce the computational bottlenecks in estimating the density, we
also introduce a new density approximation based on locality-sensitive hashing.
Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of DACS in both
classification and regression tasks and specifically show that DACS can produce
state-of-the-art performance in a practical scenario. Since DACS is weakly
dependent on neural architectures, we present a simple yet effective

transformation that transforms the effective theory in Lorenz gauge, which
represents perturbative or deconfined phase of QCD to massive gauge theory. The
exercise serves two purposes. First is of course that it is a distinct
connection where one of the theories is not gauge fixed and BRST invariant
therefore, it is expected to give newer insights into FFBRST technique itself.
Second is that a particular case of this transformation holds a novel physical

high-dimensional data is to first project the data into a space of reduced

a single, hierarchical model that we call a hierarchical mixture of Gaussians

theory, we show how to maximize the likelihood of HMoGs with
expectation-maximization. We apply HMoGs to synthetic data and RNA sequencing

Ultimately, HMoGs are a rigorous generalization of a common statistical
framework, and provide researchers with a method to improve model performance

report a type of UMR, termed as the anomalous UMR (AUMR), in a single CoFeB

typically are either limited to a special class of systems, or they require
carefully chosen input parameters, and significant expertise to interpret the
results. Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent
homology -- a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- that utilizes Betti

topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize
data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes.
The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to
chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter family of differential
equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical
systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum
Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein
distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows
that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to
provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our
approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor
than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison
to the Rosenstein algorithm for computing the Lyapunov exponent from time

is of fundamental interest with major implications for implementing quantum
computation. There are multiple degrees of freedom interacting with the
impurity in the system, including the Majorana zero mode (MZM), the Caroli de
Gennes Matricon (CdGM) states, and the electron bulk states that form Cooper
pairs, which makes the impurity pinned vortex state elusive to date in
topological superconductors. Here, we present an accurate solution of the
problem, based on a generalized mapping scheme and the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method. We identify in-gap states that are
distinct from the established Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. The newly found
in-gap physics is driven by three prominent mechanisms: (i) the coupling of
impurity and bulk states leading to competition between Kondo screening and
Cooper pairing, resulting in a singlet-doublet quantum phase transition, (ii)
the coupling of impurity and CdGM states introducing an effective Zeeman
splitting to the doublet state, and (iii) the coupling of impurity and MZM
turning the singlet-doublet transition into a crossover. These mechanisms
cooperatively produce a unique spin-resolved local density of states. Despite
the MZM, a robust nearly zero-energy peak is generated, with comparable height
but opposite spin polarization as that of the MZM. These results signify novel
emergent physics and offer insights to elucidate intriguing experimental
phenomena.

parametric fitting is misspecified in finite $m$ cases. The misspecification
comes from mainly the following two: the difference $m$ and the selected block
size $k$, and the poor approximation $f_{(m)}$ to the generalized extreme value
density which depends on the magnitude of $m$ and the extreme index $\gamma$.
The convergence rate of the approximation gets slower as $\gamma$ tends to

are free from the misspecification. The first is a plug-in type of kernel
density estimator and the second is a block-maxima-based kernel density
estimator. Theoretical study clarifies the asymptotic convergence rate of the
plug-in type estimator is faster than the block-maxima-based estimator when

the performances of a plug-in approach and cross-validation approach depend on

retrieve potential answers from the relevant evidence documents. Then, we
identify the most contradictory answer to the false claim by use of an

matched QA pair with three different counterfactual explanation forms.
Experiments are conducted on the FEVER dataset for both system and human

achieve universal quantum computation (UQC) in the MPQC protocol based on
triply-even CSS QECCs, in addition to the set of trivially implemented
transversal quantum gates, one needs to implement a non-transversal $H$ gate,
which can be accomplished by the gate teleportation technique with the logical
``plus'' state as an ancillary quantum state. In comparison, to achieve UQC in
the previously suggested MPQC protocol based on another sub-class of CSS QECCs,
i.e., self-dual CSS QECCs, instead of non-transversal $H$ gate one needs to
implement a non-transversal $T$ gate. It also can be realized by the gate
teleportation technique but requires additional verification of the logical
``magic'' state, which is used as an ancillary quantum state. Verification of
the logical ``magic'' state suggested in the previous study not only requires
extra workspace for the implementation but also employs a non-transversal
$\mathrm{C}\text{-}XP^\dag$ gate, which may lead to a failure of the entire
MPQC protocol. By replacing self-dual CSS QECCs with triply-even CSS QECCs, for
which $T$ gate becomes transversal, we avoid verification of the logical
``magic'' state. Consequently, our demand for workspace per quantum node is
reduced from $n^2 + 4n$ qubits in the previous suggestion to $n^2 + 3n$ qubits
in our current suggestion, where $n$ is the number of quantum nodes
participating in the MPQC protocol.

as a physics prior into its computational graph for policy learning. It unrolls
the dynamics by sampling actions from a parameterized policy, simply minimizing
the distance between the expert trajectory and the agent trajectory, and
back-propagating the gradient into the policy via temporal physics operators.
With the physics prior, ILD policies can not only be transferable to unseen
environment specifications but also yield higher final performance on a variety

significantly improves the stability and training speed. To simplify the
complex optimization landscape induced by temporal physics operations, ILD
dynamically selects the learning objectives for each state during optimization.
In our experiments, we show that ILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a

for various unconventional superconducting properties in a unified way. In
particular, the geometry of the correlated FS can naturally host topological
superconductivity in the presence of odd-parity pairings, which become the
leading instability due to strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Moreover,
two pairs of odd-parity channels appear as accidentally degenerate solutions,
which can naturally explain the multicomponent superconductivity with broken
time-reversal symmetry. Interestingly, the resulting time-reversal breaking
superconducting state is a Weyl superconductor in which Weyl points migrate

  Diffusion","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2022",,"10.1109/TIP.2022.3172208",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding foggy image sequence in the driving scenes is critical for
autonomous driving, but it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in
collecting and annotating real-world images of adverse weather. Recently, the
self-training strategy has been considered a powerful solution for unsupervised
domain adaptation, which iteratively adapts the model from the source domain to
the target domain by generating target pseudo labels and re-training the model.
However, the selection of confident pseudo labels inevitably suffers from the
conflict between sparsity and accuracy, both of which will lead to suboptimal
models. To tackle this problem, we exploit the characteristics of the foggy
image sequence of driving scenes to densify the confident pseudo labels.
Specifically, based on the two discoveries of local spatial similarity and
adjacent temporal correspondence of the sequential image data, we propose a
novel Target-Domain driven pseudo label Diffusion (TDo-Dif) scheme. It employs
superpixels and optical flows to identify the spatial similarity and temporal
correspondence, respectively and then diffuses the confident but sparse pseudo
labels within a superpixel or a temporal corresponding pair linked by the flow.
Moreover, to ensure the feature similarity of the diffused pixels, we introduce
local spatial similarity loss and temporal contrastive loss in the model
re-training stage. Experimental results show that our TDo-Dif scheme helps the
adaptive model achieve 51.92% and 53.84% mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on
two publicly available natural foggy datasets (Foggy Zurich and Foggy Driving),
which exceeds the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptive semantic
segmentation methods. Models and data can be found at

researchers propose clean-label backdoor attacks, which require the adversaries
not to alter the labels of the poisoned training datasets. Clean-label settings
make the attack more stealthy due to the correct image-label pairs, but some
problems still exist: first, traditional methods for poisoning training data
are ineffective; second, traditional triggers are not stealthy which are still
perceptible. To solve these problems, we propose a two-phase and image-specific
triggers generation method to enhance clean-label backdoor attacks. Our methods
are (1) powerful: our triggers can both promote the two phases (i.e., the
backdoor implantation and activation phase) in backdoor attacks simultaneously;
(2) stealthy: our triggers are generated from each image. They are
image-specific instead of fixed triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach can achieve a fantastic attack success rate~(98.98%) with low
poisoning rate~(5%), high stealthiness under many evaluation metrics and is
resistant to backdoor defense methods.

liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that is metastable with respect to
crystallization. In this case, the extended law of corresponding states (ELCS)
suggests that thermodynamic properties are insensitive to details of the
underlying interaction potential. Using lysozyme solutions, we investigate the
applicability of the ELCS to the static structure factor and in how far
effective colloidal interaction models can help to rationalize the phase
behavior and interactions of protein solutions in the vicinity of the LLPS
binodal. The (effective) structure factor has been determined by small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS). It can be described by Baxter's adhesive hard-sphere
model, which implies a single fit parameter from which the normalized second
virial coefficient $b_2$ is inferred and found to quantitatively agree with
previous results from static light scattering. The $b_2$ values are independent
of protein concentration, but systematically vary with temperature and solution
composition, i.e. salt and additive content. If plotted as a function of
temperature normalized by the critical temperature, the values of $b_2$ follow
a universal behaviour. These findings validate the applicability of the ELCS to
globular protein solutions and indicate that the ELCS can also be reflected in
the structure factor.

the large and complex dataset problem. Therewith, the security of distributed
learning has also drawn increasing attentions from both academia and industry.
In this context, federated learning (FL) was developed as a ""secure""
distributed learning by maintaining private training data locally and only
public model gradients are communicated between. However, to date, a variety of
gradient leakage attacks have been proposed for this procedure and prove that
it is insecure. For instance, a common drawback of these attacks is shared:
they require too much auxiliary information such as model weights, optimizers,
and some hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate), which are difficult to obtain
in real situations. Moreover, many existing algorithms avoid transmitting model
gradients in FL and turn to sending model weights, such as FedAvg, but few
people consider its security breach. In this paper, we present two novel
frameworks to demonstrate that transmitting model weights is also likely to
leak private local data of clients, i.e., (DLM and DLM+), under the FL
scenario. In addition, a number of experiments are performed to illustrate the
effect and generality of our attack frameworks. At the end of this paper, we
also introduce two defenses to the proposed attacks and evaluate their
protection effects. Comprehensively, the proposed attack and defense schemes
can be applied to the general distributed learning scenario as well, just with
some appropriate customization.

efficacy: a system must possess at least as much complexity as any set of

However, the complexity of a system depends on the level of detail, or scale,
at which it is described. Thus, the complexity of a system can be better
characterized by a complexity profile (complexity as a function of scale) than
by a single number. It would therefore be useful to have a multi-scale
generalization of Ashby's law that requires that a system possess at least as
much complexity as the relevant set of environmental behaviors *at each scale*.
We construct a formalism for a class of complexity profiles that is the first,

formalism not only provides a characterization of multi-scale complexity but
also generalizes the single constraint on system behaviors provided by Ashby's
law to an entire class of multi-scale constraints. We show that these
complexity profiles satisfy a sum rule, which reflects the important tradeoff

training. The user first draws a free-form mask to specify a region containing
unwanted objects over a rendered view from the pre-trained NeRF. Our framework
first transfers the user-provided mask to other rendered views and estimates
guiding color and depth images within these transferred masked regions. Next,
we formulate an optimization problem that jointly inpaints the image content in
all masked regions across multiple views by updating the NeRF model's
parameters. We demonstrate our framework on diverse scenes and show it obtained
visual plausible and structurally consistent results across multiple views
using shorter time and less user manual efforts.

a semi-global framework, in which we replace the traditional global shrinkage

stars of the open cluster within 1-2 kpc. We obtain the member stars of 256
open clusters, especially those located in the outer halo region of open

in the outer region deviates from the King's profile. To better describe the
internal and external structural characteristics of open clusters, we propose a
double components model for description: core components with King model
distribution and outer halo components with logarithmic Gaussian distribution,
and then suggest using four radii ( $r_c$, $r_t$, $r_o$, $r_e$) for describing
the structure and distribution profile of star clusters, where $r_t$ and $r_e$
represent the boundaries of core components and outer halo components
respectively. Finally, we provide a catalog of 256 clusters with structural

statistically linear related, which indicates that the inner and outer regions

among the given source image features, which is one of the informative cues for
the estimation procedure. To this end, most of the previous methods utilize
equally-weighted aggregation features. However, this could make it hard to
check the consensus existence when some outliers, which frequently occur by
occlusions, are included in the source image feature set. In this paper, we
propose a novel source-view-wise feature aggregation method, which facilitates
us to find out the consensus in a robust way by leveraging local structures in
the feature set. We first calculate the source-view-wise distance distribution
for each source feature for the proposed aggregation. After that, the distance
distribution is converted to several similarity distributions with the proposed
learnable similarity mapping functions. Finally, for each element in the
feature set, the aggregation features are extracted by calculating the weighted
means and variances, where the weights are derived from the similarity
distributions. In experiments, we validate the proposed method on various
benchmark datasets, including synthetic and real image scenes. The experimental
results demonstrate that incorporating the proposed features improves the
performance by a large margin, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance.

the HTEs in one experiment for one metric, precision can be improved greatly by
analyzing all of the data together to take advantage of cross-experiment and
cross-outcome metric correlations. We formalize this idea in a tensor

performance on various graph mining tasks. In this work, we observe that
existing graph Transformers treat nodes as independent tokens and construct a
single long sequence composed of all node tokens so as to train the Transformer
model, causing it hard to scale to large graphs due to the quadratic complexity
on the number of nodes for the self-attention computation. To this end, we
propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats
each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our
proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood
features from different hops into different representations and thereby
produces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer
could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs.
Moreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network,
NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop
neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large
are conducted to demonstrate that NAGphormer consistently outperforms existing
graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs. Code is available at

the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms,
but they sacrifice users' privacy. What's more, the digital identities (static
strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a
third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve
identity reading, storing and proving, users' self-sovereignty are weakened. To
solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to
strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the
dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only
individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each
human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in
which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over
their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based
on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is
designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users'
privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed
experiments in term of the cost of computation, storage and blockchain gas. The
analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and
fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art

which relies on cross-correlating with the large scale structure (LSS) and
suffers from uncertainties in galaxy bias and matter clustering. In combination
with lensing-LSS cross-correlation, $DR$ can be isolated in a way free of
uncertainties in galaxy bias and matter clustering. We applied this proposal to
the combination of the DR8 galaxy catalogue of DESI imaging surveys and Planck
cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. We achieved the first $DR$ measurement,
with a total significance of $3.2\sigma$. We verified the measurements at three
redshift bins ($[0.2,0.4)$, $[0.4, 0.6)$, $[0.6,0.8]$), with two LSS tracers
(the ""low-density points"" and the conventional galaxy positions). Despite its
relatively low S/N, the addition of $DR$ significantly improves dark energy
constraints, over SDSS baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data alone or Pantheon
supernovae (SN) compilation alone. For flat $w$CDM cosmology, the improvement
in the precision of $\Omega_m$ is a factor of 1.8 over BAO and 1.5 over SN. For

the author has done in recent years on the foundation of quantum theory. It is
shown that quantum mechanics as a model follows under certain specific
conditions from a quite different, much simpler model. This model is connected
to the mind of an observer, or to the joint minds of a group of communicating
observers. The model is based upon conceptual variables, and an important
aspect is that an observer (a group of observers) must decide on which variable
to measure. The model is then linked more generally to a theory of decisions.

flow parameters in addition to the previous studies, we confirm quasi-periodic
flares with periods of $\sim$ 5 and 10 days which are compatible with
observations by Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton monitoring of Sgr A*. Using a
simplified two-temperature model of ions and electrons, we find that the flare
due to synchrotron emission lags that of bremsstrahlung emission by 1 -- 2
hours which are qualitatively comparable to the time-lags of 1 -- 5 hours
reported in several simultaneous observations of radio and X-ray variability in
Sgr A*. The synchrotron emission is confined in a core region of 3 $R_{\rm g}$
size with the strong magnetic field, while the bremsstrahlung emission mainly
originates in a distant region of 10 -- 20 $R_{\rm g}$ behind the oscillating
shock, where $R_{\rm g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. The time lag is estimated
as the transit time of the acoustic wave between the above two regions. The
time-averaged distribution of radiation shows a strong anisotropic nature along
the rotational axis but isotropic distribution in the radial direction. A
high-velocity jet with $\sim 0.6c$ along the rotational axis is intermittently
found in a narrow funnel region with a collimation angle $\sim 15^\circ$. The
shock oscillating model explains well the flaring rate and the time lag between
radio and X-ray emissions for the long-term flares of Sgr A*.

is beneficial for better generalisation with improved robustness. SAM
essentially modifies the loss function by reporting the maximum loss value
within the small neighborhood around the current iterate. However, it uses the
Euclidean ball to define the neighborhood, which can be inaccurate since loss
functions for neural networks are typically defined over probability
distributions (e.g., class predictive probabilities), rendering the parameter
space non Euclidean. In this paper we consider the information geometry of the
model parameter space when defining the neighborhood, namely replacing SAM's
Euclidean balls with ellipsoids induced by the Fisher information. Our
approach, dubbed Fisher SAM, defines more accurate neighborhood structures that
conform to the intrinsic metric of the underlying statistical manifold. For
instance, SAM may probe the worst-case loss value at either a too nearby or
inappropriately distant point due to the ignorance of the parameter space
geometry, which is avoided by our Fisher SAM. Another recent Adaptive SAM
approach stretches/shrinks the Euclidean ball in accordance with the scale of
the parameter magnitudes. This might be dangerous, potentially destroying the
neighborhood structure. We demonstrate improved performance of the proposed
Fisher SAM on several benchmark datasets/tasks.

thermal conductivity of WSe2 increases dramatically with size below a
characteristic with of ~ 5 nm and levels off for broader samples and reaches a
constant value of ~2 W/mK. By introducing atomic vacancies, we discovered that
the thermal conductivity of WSe2 is significantly reduced. In particular, the W
vacancy has a greater impact on thermal conductivity reduction than Se
vacancies: the thermal conductivity of pristine WSe2 reduced by ~60% and ~70%
with the adding of ~1% of Se and W vacancies, respectively. The reduction of
thermal conductivity is found to be related with the decrease of mean free path
(MFP) of phonons in the defective WSe2. The MFP of WSe2 decreases from ~4.2 nm
for prefect WSe2 to ~2.2 nm with the adding of 0.9% Se vacancies. More
sophisticated types of point defects, such as vacancy clusters and anti-site
defects, are explored in addition to single vacancies, and are found to
dramatically renormalize the phonons. The reconstruction of the bonds leads to
localized phonons in the forbidden gap in the phonon density of states which
leads to the drop of thermal conduction. This work demonstrates the influence
of different defects on thermal conductivity of single-layer WSe2, providing
insight into the process of defect-induced phonon transport as well as ways to

Gamma-GeSe). Results of climbing image-nudged elastic band show the diffusion
barrier of Li is 0.21 eV in the monolayer limit, which can activate a
relatively fast diffusion even at room temperature on the Gamma-GeSe surface.
The calculated theoretical average voltages range from 0.071 to 0.015 V at
different stoichiometry of LixGeSe with minor volume variation, suggesting its
potential application as anode of LIBs. The predicted moderate binding energy,
a low open circuit voltage (comparable to graphite) and a fast motion of Li
suggests that Gamma-GeSe nanosheet can be chemically exfoliated via Li
intercalation and a promising candidate as the anode material for LIBs.

microwave background formation can significantly impact the measurement of the
effective relativistic neutrino degrees of freedom or ${\rm \Delta N_{eff}}$
which is very precisely measured by the Planck collaboration. Here, we propose
a scenario where a long lived inert scalar, which is very weakly coupled to
dark sector, decays to a fermion dark matter via freeze-in mechanism plus
standard model neutrinos at very low temperature $(T< T_{\rm BBN})$. We explore
this model in the fast expanding universe, where it is assumed that the early
epoch $(T > T_{\rm BBN})$ of the universe is dominated by a non-standard
species $\Phi$ instead of the standard radiation. In this non-standard
cosmological picture, such late time decay of the inert scalar can inject some
entropy to the neutrino sector after it decouples from the thermal bath and
this will make substantial contribution to ${\rm \Delta{N_{eff}}}$. Besides, in
this scenario, the new contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is highly
correlated with the dark matter sector. Thus, one can explore such feebly
interacting dark matter particles (FIMP) by the precise measurement of $\Delta
N_{\rm eff}$ using the current (Planck2018) and forthcoming (CMB-S4 \& SPT3G)

we learn a topology-aware neural template specific to each input then deform

two sub-tasks: topology formulation and shape deformation. Thanks to the
decoupling, DT-Net implicitly learns a disentangled representation for the
topology and shape in the latent space. Hence, it can enable novel disentangled
controls for supporting various shape generation applications, e.g., remix the
topologies of 3D objects, that are not achievable by previous reconstruction

of years. Researchers have speculated on several possible mechanisms.
Electrokinetic energy conversion is the least hypothetical one. The basics of
pressure-driven electrokinetic phenomena of streaming current and streaming
potential have long been established. The regularities of evaporation from
porous media are also well known. However, coupling of these two classes of
phenomena has not, yet, been seriously explored. In this critical review, we
will recapitalize and combine the available knowledge from these two fields to
produce a coherent picture of electrokinetic electricity generation during
evaporation from (nano)porous materials. For illustration, we will consider
several configurations, namely, single nanopores, arrays of nanopores, systems
with reduced area of electrokinetic-conversion elements and devices with side
evaporation from thin nanoporous films. For the latter (practically the only
one studied experimentally), we will formulate a simple model describing
correlations of system performance with such principal parameters as the
nanoporous-layer length, width and thickness as well as the pore size,
pore-surface hydrophilicity, effective zeta-potential and electric conductivity
in nanopores. These correlations will be qualitatively compared with
experimental data available in the literature. We will see that experimental
data not always are in agreement with the model predictions, which may be due
to simplifying model assumptions but also because the mechanisms are different
from the classical electrokinetic energy conversion. In particular, this
concerns the mechanisms of conversion of evaporation-driven ion streaming
currents into electron currents in external circuits. We will also formulate
directions of future experimental and theoretical studies that could help
clarify these issues.

duality relation (CDDR) using the combination of the largest SNe Ia (Pantheon)
and compact radio quasar (QSO) samples through two model-independent
approaches. The deviation of CDDR is written as
$D_L(z)/D_A(z)(1+z)^{-2}=\eta(z)$ and $\eta(z)=e^{\tau(z)/2}$, with the
parameterizations of $F_1$ ($\tau(z) = 2\epsilon_1 z$) and $F_2$ ($\tau(z) =
(1+z)^{2\epsilon_2}-1$). Furthermore, in order to compare the two resulting
distances, two cosmological-model-independent methods, i.e., the nearby SNe Ia
method and the GP method are employed to match the two distinct data at the
same redshift. Our findings indicate that, compared with the results obtained
in the literature, there is an improvement in precision when the latest SNe Ia
and QSO samples are used. Specially, in the framework of nearby SNe Ia method,
the CDDR would be constrained at the precision of $\Delta\epsilon_{1} = 0.013$
in Model $F_1$ and $\Delta\epsilon_{2}=0.018$ in Model $F_2$. Regarding the GP
method, one observes that a larger data size would produce more stringent
constraints on the CDDR parameters. Therefore, accompanied by further
developments in cosmological observations and the analysis methods, our
analysis provides an insight into the evidence for unaccounted opacity sources
at an earlier stage of the universe, or at the very least the new physics

vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delay and the sudden appearance of
obstacles will trigger the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) issues
for autonomous platooning. This research proposes a holistic robust motion
controller framework (MCF) for an intelligent and connected vehicle platoon
system. The MCF utilizes a hierarchical structure to resolve the longitudinal
string stability and the lateral control problem under the complex driving
environment and time-varying communication delay. Firstly, the H-infinity
feedback controller is developed to ensure the robustness of the platoon under
time-varying communication delay in the upper-level coordination layer (UCL).
The output from UCL will be delivered to the lower-level motion-planning layer
(LML) as reference signals. Secondly, the model predictive control (MPC)
algorithm is implemented in the LML to achieve multi-objective control, which
comprehensively considers the reference signals, the artificial potential
field, and multiple vehicle dynamics constraints. Furthermore, three critical
scenarios are co-simulated for case studies, including platooning under
time-varying communication delay, merging, and obstacle avoidance scenarios.
The simulation results indicate that, compared with single-structure MPC, the
proposed MCF can offer a better suppression on position error propagation, and
get improvements on maximum position error in the three scenarios by $19.2\%$,
$59.8\%$, and $15.3\%$, respectively. Last, the practicability and
effectiveness of the proposed MCF are verified via hardware-in-the-loop
experiment. The average conducting time of the proposed method on Speedgoat
real-time target machine is 1.1 milliseconds, which meets the real-time
requirements.

multi-source information integration. Although numerous advanced methods have
been proposed in past decades, most of them generally overlook the significance
of weakly-supervised information and fail to preserve the feature properties of
multiple views, thus resulting in unsatisfactory clustering performance. To
address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-view
Semi-supervised Clustering (DMSC) method, which jointly optimizes three kinds
of losses during networks finetuning, including multi-view clustering loss,
semi-supervised pairwise constraint loss and multiple autoencoders
reconstruction loss. Specifically, a KL divergence based multi-view clustering
loss is imposed on the common representation of multi-view data to perform
heterogeneous feature optimization, multi-view weighting and clustering
prediction simultaneously. Then, we innovatively propose to integrate pairwise
constraints into the process of multi-view clustering by enforcing the learned
multi-view representation of must-link samples (cannot-link samples) to be
similar (dissimilar), such that the formed clustering architecture can be more
credible. Moreover, unlike existing rivals that only preserve the encoders for
each heterogeneous branch during networks finetuning, we further propose to
tune the intact autoencoders frame that contains both encoders and decoders. In
this way, the issue of serious corruption of view-specific and view-shared
feature space could be alleviated, making the whole training procedure more
stable. Through comprehensive experiments on eight popular image datasets, we
demonstrate that our proposed approach performs better than the
state-of-the-art multi-view and single-view competitors.

ESN and its variations have recently received significant attention due to
their remarkable success in the modeling of non-linear dynamical systems. The
reservoir is randomly connected with fixed weights that don't change in the

the reservoir is fixed during the training procedure, we may wonder if the
computational power of the recurrent structure is fully harnessed. In this
article, we propose a new computational model of the ESN type, that represents
the reservoir weights in the Fourier space and performs a fine-tuning of these
weights applying genetic algorithms in the frequency domain. The main interest
is that this procedure will work in a much smaller space compared to the
classical ESN, thus providing a dimensionality reduction transformation of the

Pretraining a foundation model is always time-consumed due to the large scale
of both the model parameter and training dataset. Besides being
computing-intensive, the training process is extremely memory-intensive and
communication-intensive. These features make it necessary to apply 3D
parallelism, which integrates data parallelism, pipeline model parallelism and
tensor model parallelism, to achieve high training efficiency.
  To achieve this goal, some custom software frameworks such as Megatron-LM and
DeepSpeed are developed. However, current 3D parallelism frameworks still meet
two issues: i) they are not transparent to model developers, which need to
manually modify the model to parallelize training. ii) their utilization of
computation, GPU memory and network bandwidth are not sufficient. We propose
Merak, an automated 3D parallelism deep learning training framework with high
resource utilization. Merak automatically deploys with an automatic model
partitioner, which uses a graph sharding algorithm on a proxy representation of
the model. Merak also presents the non-intrusive API for scaling out foundation
model training with minimal code modification. In addition, we design a
high-performance 3D parallel runtime engine in Merak. It uses several
techniques to exploit available training resources, including shifted critical
path pipeline schedule that brings a higher computation utilization,
stage-aware recomputation that makes use of idle worker memory, and
sub-pipelined tensor model parallelism that overlaps communication and
computation. Experiments on 64 GPUs show Merak can speedup the training
performance over the state-of-the-art 3D parallelism frameworks of models with
1.5, 2.5, 8.3, and 20 billion parameters by up to 1.42X, 1.39X, 1.43X, and
1.61X, respectively.

while fields perpendicular to the helix of a few V/mm are already sufficient to
produce multiple bands in the NF* phase. On the other hand, the pitch of the

extrasolar planets is an exciting prospect, but one that faces many practical
challenges when deployed on telescopes. The largest limitation is the extreme
sensitivity of nullers to any residual optical path differences between the
incoming telescope beams even after adaptive optics or fringe-tracker
correction. The recently proposed kernel-nulling architecture attempts to
alleviate this by producing the destructive interference required for nulling,
in a scheme whereby self-calibrated observables can be created efficiently, in
effect canceling out residual atmospheric piston terms. Here we experimentally
demonstrate for the first time a successful creation of self-calibrated
kernel-null observables for nulling interferometry in the laboratory. We
achieved this through the use of a purpose-built photonic integrated device,
containing a multimode interference coupler that creates one bright, and two
nulled outputs when injected with three co-phased telescope beams. The device
produces the nulled outputs in a way that, by the subtraction of the measured
output flux, create a single self-calibrated kernel-null. We experimentally

misconception about convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are made up of
convolutional layers which are shift equivariant due to weight sharing.
However, convolutional layers are not translation equivariant, even when
boundary effects are ignored and when pooling and subsampling are absent. This
is because shift equivariance is a discrete symmetry while translation
equivariance is a continuous symmetry. This fact is well known among
researchers in equivariant machine learning, but is usually overlooked among
non-experts. To minimize confusion, we suggest using the term `shift
equivariance' to refer to discrete shifts in pixels and `translation

syntax [Tenney et al., 2019, Jawahar et al., 2019, Hewitt and Manning, 2019].
In this article, we propose UPOA, an Unsupervised constituent Parsing model
that calculates an Out Association score solely based on the self-attention
weight matrix learned in a pretrained language model as the syntactic distance
for span segmentation. We further propose an enhanced version, UPIO, which
exploits both inside association and outside association scores for estimating
the likelihood of a span. Experiments with UPOA and UPIO disclose that the
linear projection matrices for the query and key in the self-attention
mechanism play an important role in parsing. We therefore extend the
unsupervised models to few-shot parsing models (FPOA, FPIO) that use a few
annotated trees to learn better linear projection matrices for parsing.
Experiments on the Penn Treebank demonstrate that our unsupervised parsing
model UPIO achieves results comparable to the state of the art on short
sentences (length <= 10). Our few-shot parsing model FPIO trained with only 20
annotated trees outperforms a previous few-shot parsing method trained with 50
annotated trees. Experiments on cross-lingual parsing show that both
unsupervised and few-shot parsing methods are better than previous methods on
most languages of SPMRL [Seddah et al., 2013].

growth dynamics. In this article, we present a mathematical model that
describes these \emph{in vitro} experiments. We use the model to understand how
tumour growth generates mechanical deformations in the hydrogel and how these
deformations in turn influence the tumour's growth. The hydrogel is viewed as a
nonlinear hyperelastic material and the tumour is modelled as a two-phase
mixture, comprising a viscous tumour cell phase and an isotropic, inviscid
interstitial fluid phase. Using a combination of numerical and analytical
techniques, we show how the tumour's growth dynamics change as the mechanical
properties of the hydrogel vary. When the hydrogel is soft, nutrient
availability dominates the dynamics: the tumour evolves to a large equilibrium
configuration where the proliferation rate of nutrient-rich cells on the tumour
boundary balances the death rate of nutrient-starved cells in the central,
necrotic core. As the hydrogel stiffness increases, mechanical resistance to
growth increases and the tumour's equilibrium size decreases. Indeed, for small
tumours embedded in stiff hydrogels, the inhibitory force experienced by the
tumour cells may be so large that the tumour is eliminated. Analysis of the
model identifies parameter regimes in which the presence of the hydrogel drives
tumour elimination.

radiation field, polaritons exhibit light-induced conical intersections (LICIs)
which dramatically influence the nuclear dynamics of molecular polaritons. We
show that ultrafast radiative emission from the lower polariton is controlled
by the geometric phase imposed by the LICI. This finding provides insight into
the process of emission and, furthermore, allows one to compute these signals
by augmenting the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for polaritons with a
geometric phase term.

suppresses the formation of lower mass objects more effectively as the surface

mass in denser environments. Similarly, we find that protostellar outflows are
more effective at suppressing the formation of massive stars in higher surface

against the backdrop of the critical collapse driven by the cubic
self-attraction with strength g. The TEM scheme may be implemented, as
spatially or temporally periodic modulations, in optics or BEC, respectively.
The consideration is carried out by dint of numerical simulations and
variational approximation (VA). In terms of the VA, the dynamics amounts to a
nonlinear Ermakov equation, which, in turn, is tantamount to a linear Mathieu
equation. Stability boundaries are found as functions of g and parameters of
the periodic modulation of the trapping potential. Below the usual collapse
threshold, which is known, in the numerical form, as g < 5.85 (in the standard
notation), the stability is limited by the onset of the parametric resonance.
This stability limit, including the setup with the self-repulsive sign of the
cubic term (g < 0), is accurately predicted by the VA. At g > 5.85, the
collapse threshold is found with the help of full numerical simulations. The
relative increase of the critical value of g above 5.85 is ~ 1.5%, which is a
meaningful result, even if its size is small, because the collapse threshold is
a universal constant, which is difficult to change.

commonly reached through doping, strain, or static electric field. The
associated spatial inhomogeneity leads to a photoinduced phase transition that
remains confined near the illuminated region. Here we report optical
spectroscopy experiments at the first-order IMT in the 4d-electron compound

transitions excited by light with a threshold fluence corresponding to the

propagation of phase interfaces across the full extent of a macroscopic sample,
in the absence of assisting external stimuli. Based on detailed comparison of
spectroscopic data to density functional calculations, we attribute the
extraordinary photo-sensitivity of the IMT to an exceptionally shallow

Ca$_3$(Ru$_{0.99}$Ti$_{0.01}$)$_2$O$_7$ as an ideal model system for building

is difficult to discern experimentally and competes with several other
mechanisms. To shed light on these aspects, here, we model from first
principles hot-carrier generation across the interface between plasmonic
nanoparticles and a CO molecule. The hot-electron transfer probability depends
non-monotonically on the nanoparticle-molecule distance and can be effective at
long distances, well outside the region of chemisorption; hot-hole transfer on
the other hand is limited to shorter distances. These observations can be
explained by the energetic alignment between molecular and nanoparticle states
as well as the excitation frequency. The hybridization of the molecular
orbitals is the key predictor for hot-carrier transfer in these systems,
emphasizing the need to include the effects of ground state hybridization for
accurate predictions. Finally, we show a non-trivial dependence of the
hot-carrier distribution on the excitation energy, which could be exploited
when optimizing photo-catalytic systems.

with a set of items that correspond to tasks having fixed CPU and memory
requirements. However, applications running in clouds are much more flexible:
modern frameworks allow to (horizontally) scale a single application to dozens,
even hundreds of instances; and then the load balancer can precisely divide the
workload between them.
  We analyze a model that captures this (semi)-flexibility of cloud resource
management. Each cloud application is characterized by its memory footprint and
its momentary CPU load. Combining the scheduler and the load balancer, the
resource manager decides how many instances of each application will be created
and how the CPU load will be balanced between them. In contrast to the
divisible load model, each instance of the application requires a certain
amount of memory, independent of the number of instances. Thus, the resource
manager effectively trades additional memory for more evenly balanced load.
  We study two objectives: the bin-packing-like minimization of the number of
machines used; and the makespan-like minimization of the maximum load among all
the machines. We prove NP-hardness of the general problems, but also propose
polynomial-time exact algorithms for boundary special cases. Notably, we show
that (semi)-flexibility may result in reducing the required number of machines

that hierarchical innovation is more robustly achieved by dynamic social
network structures. In dynamic settings, humans oscillate between innovating
individually or in small clusters, and then sharing outcomes with others. To
our knowledge, the role of social network structure on innovation has not been
systematically studied in RL. Here, we use a multi-level problem setting
(WordCraft), with three different innovation tasks to test the hypothesis that
the social network structure affects the performance of distributed RL
algorithms. We systematically design networks of DQNs sharing experiences from
their replay buffers in varying structures (fully-connected, small world,
dynamic, ring) and introduce a set of behavioral and mnemonic metrics that
extend the classical reward-focused evaluation framework of RL. Comparing the
level of innovation achieved by different social network structures across
different tasks shows that, first, consistent with human findings, experience
sharing within a dynamic structure achieves the highest level of innovation in
tasks with a deceptive nature and large search spaces. Second, experience
sharing is not as helpful when there is a single clear path to innovation.
Third, the metrics we propose, can help understand the success of different
social network structures on different tasks, with the diversity of experiences

modelling into the nonlinear regime. In order to probe the robustness of the
growth rate inferred from redshift-space distortions, we divide galaxies by
colour, and divide groups according to their total stellar mass, calibrated to
total mass via gravitational lensing. We fit our model to correlation data, to

  Robotics",,"10.1002/rob.22099",,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The farming industry constantly seeks the automation of different processes
involved in agricultural production, such as sowing, harvesting and weed
control. The use of mobile autonomous robots to perform those tasks is of great
interest. Arable lands present hard challenges for Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) systems, key for mobile robotics, given the visual
difficulty due to the highly repetitive scene and the crop leaves movement
caused by the wind.
  In recent years, several Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and SLAM systems have
been developed. They have proved to be robust and capable of achieving high
accuracy in indoor and outdoor urban environments. However, they were not
properly assessed in agricultural fields. In this work we assess the most
relevant state-of-the-art VIO systems in terms of accuracy and processing time
on arable lands in order to better understand how they behave on these
environments. In particular, the evaluation is carried out on a collection of
sensor data recorded by our wheeled robot in a soybean field, which was
publicly released as the Rosario Dataset. The evaluation shows that the highly
repetitive appearance of the environment, the strong vibration produced by the
rough terrain and the movement of the leaves caused by the wind, expose the
limitations of the current state-of-the-art VIO and SLAM systems. We analyze
the systems failures and highlight the observed drawbacks, including
initialization failures, tracking loss and sensitivity to IMU saturation.
Finally, we conclude that even though certain systems like ORB-SLAM3 and
S-MSCKF show good results with respect to others, more improvements should be
done to make them reliable in agricultural fields for certain applications such
as soil tillage of crop rows and pesticide spraying.

extremely lossy: more than 99.9% of the gas is discarded. Such final particle
number limitations constrain imaging resolution, gas lifetime, and applications
leveraging macroscopic quantum coherence. Here we show that atomic Bose gases
can be cooled to quantum degeneracy using real-time feedback, an entirely new
method that does not suffer the same limitations as evaporative cooling.
Through novel quantum-field simulations and scaling arguments, we demonstrate
that an initial low-condensate-fraction thermal Bose gas can be cooled to a
high-purity Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by feedback control, with
substantially lower atomic loss than evaporative cooling. Advantages of
feedback cooling are found to be robust to imperfect detection, finite
resolution of the control and measurement, time delay in the control loop, and
spontaneous emission. Using feedback cooling to create degenerate sources with
high coherence and low entropy enables new capabilities in precision
measurement, atomtronics, and few- and many-body quantum physics.

optimization variables is approximated using the Tensor Train model which
enables efficient conditioning and sampling. Unlike existing methods, we treat
the task parameters as random variables and for a given task we generate
samples for decision variables from the conditional distribution to initialize
the optimization solver. Our method can produce multiple solutions for a given
task from different modes when they exist. We first evaluate the approach on
benchmark functions for numerical optimization that are hard to solve using
gradient-based optimization solvers with a naive initialization. The results
show that the proposed method can generate samples close to global optima and

constitutes a new potential approach towards better understanding the limits of

existing results are typically limited to Local Differential Privacy (LDP)
guarantees that overlook the advantages of decentralization. In this work, we
introduce pairwise network differential privacy, a relaxation of LDP that
captures the fact that the privacy leakage from a node $u$ to a node $v$ may
depend on their relative position in the graph. We then analyze the combination
of local noise injection with (simple or randomized) gossip averaging protocols
on fixed and random communication graphs. We also derive a differentially
private decentralized optimization algorithm that alternates between local
gradient descent steps and gossip averaging. Our results show that our
algorithms amplify privacy guarantees as a function of the distance between
nodes in the graph, matching the privacy-utility trade-off of the trusted

spectrum from a radially-pulsating star. It combines a Christy-type non-linear
pulsation code with classical stellar atmosphere codes. The principal aim is to
interpret the dynamical spectrum of the radially pulsating extreme helium star
V652 Her, which shows a strong shock at minimum radius. The components are
general enough to treat other classes of radial pulsation. The theoretical
spectrum from a shocked pulsation model shows line doubling, with the blue
component emerging at standstill velocity and accelerating blueward. The
doubling phase depends on line depth and parent ion. The behaviour of line
cores post-shock points to a drop in the ionization temperature, although the
gas temperature in the model remains high. Shock compression leads to
phase-dependent strengthening of Stark-broadened line wings, with the far wings
responding first. With velocity, temperature and pressure-sensitive
diagnostics, detailed tomography of the pulsation-driven shock in V652 Her
seems possible. Even when no shock is present, the dynamical spectrum is
significantly different from a model in hydrostatic equilibrium. Using the
quasi-static approximation (e.g. at maximum radius) may lead to a considerable
underestimate of the star's mean effective temperature and surface gravity.

shows that in some specific cases, fibrillation occurs for a given molecular
conformation and the sol-to-gel transition depends on the relative energetic
stability of one conformation over the other, and not on the rate of change of
the stimuli. We observe such a phenomenon on a class of bolaform glycolipids,
sophorosides, similar to the well-known sophorolipid biosurfactants, but
composed of two symmetric sophorose units. A combination of oscillatory
rheology, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) cryogenic transmission electron

strong hydrogel forms, the sol-to-gel transition being readily reversible in

require linear front-ends, and more specifically linear power amplifiers (PAs),
to avoid distortion. This reduces the energy efficiency since PAs are most
efficient close to saturation, where they generate most nonlinear distortion.
Moreover, the use of conventional precoders can induce a coherent combining of
distortion at the user locations, degrading the signal quality. In this work,
novel linear precoders, simple to compute and to implement, are proposed that
allow working close to saturation, while cancelling the third-order
nonlinearity of the PA without prior knowledge of the signal statistics and PA
model. Their design consists in saturating a single or a few antennas on
purpose together with an negative gain with respect to all other antennas to
compensate for the overall nonlinear distortion at the user location. The
performance gains of the designs are significant for PAs working close to

$\|\nabla(\sigma-1,u,M)\|_{H^1}$ being $(1+t)^{-\frac{5}{4}}$ in [24].
Therefore, we are committed to improving that of $\|\nabla^2
(\sigma-1,u,M)\|_{L^2}$ in this paper. Thanks to the method adopted in [25]
(Wang and Wen, 2021), we get the optimal time decay estimation to the
highest-order derivative for space of solution, which means that time decay
estimation of $\|\nabla^2 (\sigma-1,u,M)\|_{L^2}$ is $(1+t)^{-\frac{7}{4}}$.

active information. Prevalence among tested individuals has an upward bias
under the assumption that individuals' willingness to be tested for the disease

testing bias quantifies the degree at which the willingness to be tested
correlates with infection status. Interpreting incomplete testing as a missing
data problem, the missingness mechanism impacts the degree at which the bias of
the original prevalence estimate can be removed. The reduction in prevalence,
when testing bias is adjusted for, translates into an active information due to
bias correction, with opposite sign to active information due to testing bias.
Prevalence and active information estimates are asymptotically normal, a
behavior also illustrated through simulations.

that the spiral order in SmAlSi results from the nesting between topologically
non-trivial Fermi pockets and weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy, unlike
related materials (Ce,Pr,Nd)AlSi, where a strong anisotropy prevents the spins
from freely rotating. We map the magnetic phase diagram of SmAlSi and reveal an
A-phase where topological magnetic excitations may exist. This is corroborated

transforms and apply it to seismic wavefield modeling. The objective function
of the proposed model employs the Moreau envelope of the $\ell_0$ norm under a
tight framelet system as a regularization to promote sparsity. This model leads
to a non-smooth, non-convex optimization problem for which traditional
iteration schemes are inefficient or even divergent. By exploiting special
structures of the $\ell_0$ norm, we identify a local minimizer of the proposed
non-convex optimization problem with a global minimizer of a convex
optimization problem, which provides us insights for the development of
efficient and convergence guaranteed algorithms to solve it. We characterize
the solution of the regularization model in terms of a fixed-point of a map
defined by the proximity operator of the $\ell_0$ norm and develop a
fixed-point iteration algorithm to solve it. By connecting the map with an
$\alpha$-averaged nonexpansive operator, we prove that the sequence generated
by the proposed fixed-point proximity algorithm converges to a local minimizer
of the proposed model. Our numerical examples confirm that the proposed model
outperforms significantly the existing model based on the $\ell_1$-norm. The
seismic wavefield modeling in the frequency domain requires solving a series of
the Helmholtz equation with large wave numbers, which is a computationally
intensive task. Applying the proposed sparse regularization model to the
seismic wavefield modeling requires data of only a few low frequencies,
avoiding solving the Helmholtz equation with large wave numbers. Numerical
results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing method
based on the $\ell_1$ norm in terms of the SNR values and visual quality of the

rearrangements. This is relevant for non-crystalline materials like polymers
and inorganic glasses, both in production and during subsequent use. The
Narayanaswamy theory from 1971 describes physical aging - an inherently
nonlinear phenomenon - in terms of a linear convolution integral over the
so-called material time $\xi$. The resulting ""Tool-Narayanaswamy (TN)
formalism"" is generally recognized to provide an excellent description of
physical aging for small, but still highly nonlinear temperature variations.
The simplest version of the TN formalism is single-parameter aging according to
which the clock rate $d\xi/dt$ is an exponential function of the property
monitored [T. Hecksher et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 241103 (2015)]. For
temperature jumps starting from thermal equilibrium, this leads to a
first-order differential equation for property monitored, involving a
system-specific function. The present paper shows analytically that the
solution to this equation to first order in the temperature variation has a
universal expression in terms of the zeroth-order solution, $R_0(t)$. Numerical
data for a binary Lennard-Jones glass former probing the potential energy
confirm that, in the weakly nonlinear limit, the theory predicts aging
correctly from $R_0(t)$ (which by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is the
normalized equilibrium potential-energy time-autocorrelation function).

whose number of draws and initial number of balls tend to infinity together.
This is motivated by recent work of Borovkov [5], where they prove a functional
limit theorem for this model when the urn has identity replacement rule. We
generalize this result to arbitrary balanced replacement rules (the total
number of balls added to the urn is deterministic). Three asymptotic regimes
are possible depending on how one lets the number of initial balls scale with
the number of draws of the urn. In each regime, we show a first order
deterministic limit and Gaussian second order fluctuations, where the behaviour
of these limit processes depend on the regime, the initial composition of the
urn, and the urns replacement rule.
  To prove our main results, we embed the process in continuous-time and use
martingale theory. Although these methods are classical since the works of
Athreya & Karlin [1] and Janson [11], our setting with initial growing
composition necessitates many new ideas. The main difference in proving
limiting results for the continuous time embedding in our setting is that, when
the initial composition is large compared to the number of draws, the branching
process does not have time to reach equilibrium. Because of this, translating
the results back to discrete-time is also much harder than in Janson [11].
Interestingly, our continuous-time results hold under weaker assumptions on the
replacement structure than classical results for multi-type branching
processes; in particular, we do not need any ""irreducibility"" assumption.

nuclear transients. In early 2018, this well-known AGN underwent a
changing-look event, in which broad optical emission lines appeared and the
optical flux increased. Yet, by July 2018, the X-ray flux had dropped by over
two orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic change to the inner accretion
flow. With three years of observations with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, we
present the X-ray evolution of 1ES 1927+654, which can be broken into three
phases-(1) an early super-Eddington phase with rapid variability in X-ray
luminosity and spectral parameters, (2) a stable super-Eddington phase at the
peak X-ray luminosity, and (3) a steady decline back to the pre-outburst
luminosity and spectral parameters. For the first time, we witnessed the
formation of the X-ray corona, as the X-ray spectrum transitioned from
thermally-dominated to primarily Comptonized. We also track the evolution of
the prominent, broad 1 keV feature in the early X-ray spectra and show that
this feature can be modeled with blueshifted reflection (z = -0.33) from a
single-temperature blackbody irradiating spectrum using xillverTDE, a new
flavor of the xillver models. Thus, we propose that the 1 keV feature could
arise from reflected emission off the base of an optically thick outflow from a
geometrically thick, super-Eddington inner accretion flow, connecting the inner
accretion flow with outflows launched during extreme accretion events (e.g.
tidal disruption events). Lastly, we compare 1ES 1927+654 to other nuclear
transients and discuss applications of xillverTDE to super-Eddington accretors.

investigate, by simulation, the estimation bias and the coverage of the
proposed point and interval estimation methods for the Gompertz and the Weibull
baseline hazards. In applications with low frailty variance and a large number
of clusters, the marginal likelihood estimation is almost unbiased and the
profile likelihood-based confidence intervals provide good coverage for all
model parameters. We also compare the results from the over-fitted double-Cox

However, most of the models are opaque and difficult to trust due to their
complex reasoning - commonly known as the black-box problem. Some fields, such
as medicine, require a high degree of transparency to accept and adopt such
technologies. Consequently, creating explainable/interpretable models or
applying post-hoc methods on classifiers to build trust in deep learning models
are required. Moreover, deep learning methods can be used for segmentation
tasks, which typically require hard-to-obtain, time-consuming
manually-annotated segmentation labels for training. This paper introduces
three inherently-explainable classifiers to tackle both of these problems as
one. The localisation heatmaps provided by the networks -- representing the
models' focus areas and being used in classification decision-making -- can be
directly interpreted, without requiring any post-hoc methods to derive
information for model explanation. The models are trained by using the input
image and only the classification labels as ground-truth in a supervised
fashion - without using any information about the location of the region of
interest (i.e. the segmentation labels), making the segmentation training of
the models weakly-supervised through classification labels. The final
segmentation is obtained by thresholding these heatmaps. The models were
employed for the task of multi-class brain tumour classification using two
different datasets, resulting in the best F1-score of 0.93 for the supervised
classification task while securing a median Dice score of 0.67$\pm$0.08 for the
weakly-supervised segmentation task. Furthermore, the obtained accuracy on a

EOS-ESTM, a fast and flexible model aimed at exploring the impact on
habitability of multiple climate factors, including those unconstrained by

model featuring an advanced treatment of the meridional and vertical transport.
The novel features of EOS-ESTM include: (1) parameterizations for simulating
the climate impact of oceans, land, ice, and clouds as a function of
temperature and stellar zenith distance; (2) a procedure (EOS) for calculating
the radiative transfer in atmospheres with terrestrial and non-terrestrial
compositions illuminated by solar- and non-solar-type stars. By feeding
EOS-ESTM with Earth's stellar, orbital and planetary parameters we derive a
reference model that satisfies a large number of observational constraints of
the Earth's climate system. Validation tests of non-terrestrial conditions
yield predictions that are in line with comparable results obtained with a
hierarchy of climate models. The application of EOS-ESTM to planetary
atmospheres in maximum greenhouse conditions demonstrates the possibility of
tracking the snowball transition at the outer edge of the HZ for a variety of

variational wave function, which he claimed described a ``new state of matter''
-- a homogeneous incompressible liquid with fractionally charged
quasi-particles. Here I develop an exact diagonalization theory that makes it
possible to calculate the energy and other physical properties of the ground
and excited states of a system of $N$ two-dimensional Coulomb interacting
electrons in a strong magnetic field and in the field of a compensating
positively charged background. The only assumption of the theory is that all
electrons are assumed to be in the lowest Landau level. I present results for
$N\le 7$ and show that the true ground state resembles a sliding Wigner
crystal. I also calculate the physical properties of the $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin
state for $N\le 8$ and show that properties of the ``Laughlin liquid'' are
quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of the true ground state.
In addition, I show that the variational principle that was used for the
estimate of the Laughlin state energy in the thermodynamic limit does not work
in this limit, since one can specify an infinitely large number of different
trial wave functions giving the same variational energy at $N\to\infty$. I also

cheap to evaluate for different $\mu$, and the preconditioner is applied only
approximately. This novel approach leads to increased freedom to carry out the

the method infinite GMRES, without a loss of accuracy in general. We show that
the error of our method is estimated based on the magnitude of the parameter

are such experts, describing all the intricacies of a language is
time-consuming and prone to omission. In this article, we present an automatic

we track the state of each individual within a susceptible population.
Inference for individual-based models is challenging due to the
high-dimensional state-space of such models, which increases exponentially with
population size. We consider sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for inference
for individual-based epidemic models where we make direct observations of the
state of a sample of individuals. Standard implementations, such as the
bootstrap filter or the auxiliary particle filter are inefficient due to
mismatch between the proposal distribution of the state and future
observations. We develop new efficient proposal distributions that take account
of future observations, leveraging the properties that (i) we can analytically
calculate the optimal proposal distribution for a single individual given
future observations and the future infection rate of that individual; and (ii)
the dynamics of individuals are independent if we condition on their infection
rates. Thus we construct estimates of the future infection rate for each
individual, and then use an independent proposal for the state of each
individual given this estimate. Empirical results show order of magnitude
improvement in efficiency of the sequential Monte Carlo sampler for both SIS
and SEIR models.

research. However, the studies on dynamic diversity and its associated cost
still need further investigation. Based on a framework comprising 2-dimensional
spatial evolutionary PDG, this work examines the change in a player's
neighborhood by enabling each player to pay for an upgrade of their
neighborhood to switch from the von Neumann to Moore neighborhood. The upgrade
cost (i.e., the cost of the advanced neighborhood) plays a vital role in
cooperation promotion and serves as an entry-level to screen players. The
results show that a reasonable price (entry-level) supports the cooperators'
survival in an environment with high dilemma strength since it allows the
formation of ""normal-edge-advantage-core"" clusters. On the low entry-level
side, the privilege of having a larger neighborhood supports cooperation if it
is accessible to all the players. On the high entry-level side, encirclements
of advantage defectors appear out of the cooperative clusters. To break the
encirclement and enable the expansion of the advantage clusters, the
entry-level should be increased to interrupt the advantage defectors. The
encirclement can be observed only in the deterministic models. Stochastic

study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in the presence of multiple
environments with different levels of fidelity for a given control task. We
focus on improving the RL agent's performance with multifidelity data.
Specifically, a multifidelity estimator that exploits the cross-correlations
between the low- and high-fidelity returns is proposed to reduce the variance
in the estimation of the state-action value function. The proposed estimator,
which is based on the method of control variates, is used to design a
multifidelity Monte Carlo RL (MFMCRL) algorithm that improves the learning of
the agent in the high-fidelity environment. The impacts of variance reduction
on policy evaluation and policy improvement are theoretically analyzed by using

demonstrate that for a finite budget of high-fidelity data samples, our
proposed MFMCRL agent attains superior performance compared with that of a
standard RL agent that uses only the high-fidelity environment data for

conditions, the objective of this work is to design Monte Carlo algorithms
estimating the specific intensity spatial and angular derivatives as well as
its geometric sensitivity. The present document is structured in three parts,
each of them dedicated to a specific derivative of the intensity. Although they
are all assembled here in one document each derivative is of interest
independently whether it be for radiative transfers analysis or engineering
conception. Therefore, they are thought to be written as three different papers
and are presented here as such. Estimating derivatives of the specific
intensity when solving radiative transfers using a Monte-Carlo algorithm is
challenging. Finite differences are often not sufficiently accurate and
directly estimating the derivative from a specific Monte-Carlo algorithm can
lead to arduous formal or numerical developments. The proposition here is to
work from the radiative transfer equation and its boundary conditions to design
a physical model for each derivatives. Only then Monte-Carlo algorithms are
built from the derivatives differential equations using the usual equivalent
path integral. Since the same methodology is applied to the specific intensity
spatial derivative, angular derivative and geometric sensitivity we chose to
keep the same writing structure for all three parts so that all common ideas
and developments appears exactly the same. We believe this choice to be
coherent to facilitate the reader's understanding. Finally, these are
preliminary versions of the final papers: for each parts the theory is fully
described, but, although they have been implemented, the examples and

models related to observed data of the modeled process to find model parameters

We present a Bayesian calibration approach for surface coupled problems in
computational mechanics based on measured deformation of an interface when no
displacement data of material points is available. The interpretation of such a
calibration problem as a statistical inference problem, in contrast to
deterministic model calibration, is computationally more robust and allows the
analyst to find a posterior distribution over possible solutions rather than a
single point estimate. The proposed framework also enables the consideration of
unavoidable uncertainties that are present in every experiment and are expected
to play an important role in the model calibration process. To mitigate the
computational costs of expensive forward model evaluations, we propose to learn
the log-likelihood function from a controllable amount of parallel simulation
runs using Gaussian process regression. We introduce and specifically study the
effect of three different discrepancy measures for deformed interfaces between
reference data and simulation. We show that a statistically based discrepancy
measure results in the most expressive posterior distribution. We further apply
the approach to numerical examples in higher model parameter dimensions and
interpret the resulting posterior under uncertainty. In the examples, we
investigate coupled multi-physics models of fluid-structure interaction effects
in biofilms and find that the model parameters affect the results in a coupled

is described by stochastic differential equations that map noise into data.
While recent works have started to lay down a theoretical foundation for these

still lacking. Current best practice advocates for a large T to ensure that the
forward dynamics brings the diffusion sufficiently close to a known and simple
noise distribution; however, a smaller value of T should be preferred for a
better approximation of the score-matching objective and higher computational
efficiency. Starting from a variational interpretation of diffusion models, in
this work we quantify this trade-off, and suggest a new method to improve
quality and efficiency of both training and sampling, by adopting smaller
diffusion times. Indeed, we show how an auxiliary model can be used to bridge
the gap between the ideal and the simulated forward dynamics, followed by a
standard reverse diffusion process. Empirical results support our analysis; for

distribution evolves over time due to magnetic braking. Since tidally stripped
stars originally formed within the cluster, they should follow the same period

central limit theorem (CLT) of the probability theory. This essentially uses
the idea that repeated intermolecular collisions introduce randomness in the
velocity change in the individual components of the velocity vector, leading
to, by the CLT, a Gaussian distribution. To complete the derivation, we next
show that the mean-square velocity or the standard deviation follows exactly
from Boltzmann's formula relating entropy to the density of states, thus
avoiding the use of the ideal gas equation of state explicitly. We furthermore
prove the Maxwell velocity distribution for a system of harmonic oscillators.
This derivation provides a further insight into the origin of Boltzmann's
constant in the Maxwell velocity distribution and also in the equipartition
theorem. We propose that this derivation provides an approach that explains the
universality of Maxwell Gaussian distribution.

data, inspired by the recent success of meta-learning. The main idea is not to
attempt to learn a single classifier that would have to work well across all
occurring data distributions, nor many separate classifiers, but to exploit a
hybrid strategy: we learn a single set of model parameters from which a
specific classifier for any specific data distribution is derived via
classifier adaptation. Assuming a multi-class classification setting with
class-prior shift, the adaptation step can be performed analytically with only
the classifier's bias terms being affected. Another contribution of our work is
an extrapolation step that predicts suitable adaptation parameters for future
time steps based on the previous data. In combination, we obtain a lightweight
procedure for learning from streaming data with varying class distribution that
adds no trainable parameters and almost no memory or computational overhead
compared to training a single model. Experiments on a set of exemplary tasks
using Twitter data show that LIMES achieves higher accuracy than alternative
approaches, especially with respect to the relevant real-world metric of lowest
within-day accuracy.

appealing convergence behavior of FedProx is so far characterized under certain
non-standard and unrealistic dissimilarity assumptions of local functions, and
the results are limited to smooth optimization problems. In order to remedy
these deficiencies, we develop a novel local dissimilarity invariant

Covariance
matrices derived from numerical simulations often require a very large number
of realizations to be accurate. When a theoretical model for the covariance
matrix exists, the parameters of the model can often be fit with many fewer
simulations. We write a likelihood-based method for performing such a fit. We
demonstrate how a model covariance matrix can be tested by examining the
appropriate $\chi^2$ distributions from simulations. We show that if model
covariance has amplitude freedom, the expectation value of second moment of
$\chi^2$ distribution with a wrong covariance matrix will always be larger than
one using the true covariance matrix. By combining these steps together, we
provide a way of producing reliable covariances without ever requiring running
a large number of simulations. We demonstrate our method on two examples.
First, we measure the two-point correlation function of halos from a large set
of $10000$ mock halo catalogs. We build a model covariance with $2$ free
parameters, which we fit using our procedure. The resulting best-fit model
covariance obtained from just $100$ simulation realizations proves to be as
reliable as the numerical covariance matrix built from the full $10000$ set. We
also test our method on a setup where the covariance matrix is large by
measuring the halo bispectrum for thousands of triangles for the same set of
mocks. We build a block diagonal model covariance with $2$ free parameters as
an improvement over the diagonal Gaussian covariance. Our model covariance
passes the $\chi^2$ test only partially in this case, signaling that the model
is insufficient even using free parameters, but significantly improves over the
Gaussian one.

conformal bootstrap methods based on semi-definite programming put rigorous
exclusion bounds on CFTs, this method looks for approximate solutions, which
correspond to local minima of $S$, when present, and can be even far from the
extremality region. By this protocol we find that if no constraint on the
operator scaling dimensions is imposed, $S$ has a single minimum, corresponding
to the Free Theory. If we fix the external operator dimension, however, we
encounter minima that can be studied with our approach. Imposing a conserved
stress-tensor, a $\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry and one relevant scalar, we identify
two regions where local minima of $S$ are present. When projected in the
$(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_{\epsilon})$-plane, $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ being the
external and the lightest exchanged operators, one of these regions essentially
coincides with the extremality line found in previous bootstrap studies. The
other region is along the generalized free theories in $d = 2$ and below that

estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a
confidence interval for the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ spent on training a

confidence intervals for the false positive and false negative rates of
membership inference attacks. Unfortunately, obtaining narrow high-confidence
intervals for $\epsilon$ using this method requires an impractically large
sample size and training as many models as samples. We propose a novel Bayesian
method that greatly reduces sample size, and adapt and validate a heuristic to
draw more than one sample per trained model. Our Bayesian method exploits the

for $\varepsilon$ (not just a confidence interval) from the joint posterior of
the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks.
For the same sample size and confidence, we derive confidence intervals for

adapt from label-only DP, can be used to further reduce the number of trained

scientists to investigate individual differences in social behaviour and
pinpoint which individual characteristics (e.g., social roles, personality

fuse the cross-modality information. Besides, deep-learning-based rigid
registration of cardiac SPECT and CT-derived u-maps has not been investigated

DuSFE fuses the knowledge from multiple modalities to recalibrate both

reduces with increasing disorder, the ultimate limit of which is the near-zero
transmission due to Anderson localization. Under localizing conditions,
transport is arrested because the wave is trapped in the bulk of the sample
with decaying-exponential coupling to the boundaries. Any further increase in
disorder does not modify the overall transport properties. Here, we report the
experimental demonstration of a hitherto-unrealized anomalous transport of
hybrid particles under localizing disorder in a non-Hermitian setting. We
create hybrid polariton-photon states in a one-dimensional copper sample with a
comb-shaped periodic microstructure designed for microwave frequencies.
Metallic dissipation realizes the necessary non-Hermiticity. Disorder is
introduced by deliberate alterations of the periodic microstructure. Direct
measurement of wave-functions and phases was achieved by a near-field probe. At
a particular disorder, We observe the onset of Anderson localization of the
hybrid states endorsed by exponential tails of the wavefunction. However, at
stronger disorder and under conditions that support localization, an unexpected
enhancement in the transmission was facilitated by an emergent mini-band. The
transmission was traced to the hopping of the hybrid particle over multiple
co-existing localized resonances that exchange energy due to the
non-orthogonality. These emergent states are manifested in all configurations
under strong disorder, suggesting the formation of a novel transport regime.
This is verified by measuring the averaged conductance which endorses an
anomalous transport regime in the hybrid, non-Hermitian environment under
strong disorder. These experimental observations open up new unexplored avenues
in the ambit of disorder under non-Hermitian conditions.

this is hardly scalable considering pathology diversity not to mention that
labeling large datasets encumbers the medical staff additionally. We propose
using freely available domain knowledge as priors to learn more robust and

benefit representations by acting in proxy of labels, thereby significantly
reducing the labeling requirement while still enabling fully unsupervised yet

prior-guided views during pretraining, where the view choices inspire
sensitivity to pathological information. Extensive experiments on three

a brand-new strategy, linear correlation-ratio, is introduced in this paper to
build an accurate relationship between the models. Such a correlation-ratio can
be easily estimated by historical data or a part of sample. Then, a
correlation-ratio transfer learning likelihood is established based on the
correlation-ratio combination. On the practical side, the new framework is
applied to some application scenarios, especially the areas of data streams and
medical studies. Methodologically, some techniques are suggested for
transferring the information from simple source models to a relatively complex
target model. Theoretically, some favorable properties, including the global
convergence rate, are achieved, even for the case where the source models are
not similar to the target model. All in all, it can be seen from the theories

significantly improved by the information from similar or dissimilar source

accessible for computer scientists, AI researchers, roboticists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists, and (2) it gives the philosophers a mathematical
tool which can be used to clarify their notions and help with their debates.
Our main notion is that of a sensorimotor system which is a special case of a
well studied notion of a transition system. We also consider related notions
such as labeled transition systems and deterministic automata. We analyze a
notion called sufficiency and show that it is a very good candidate for a
foundational notion in the ""mathematics of cognition from an enactivist
perspective"". We demonstrate its importance by proving a uniqueness theorem
about the minimal sufficient refinements (which correspond in some sense to an
optimal attunement of an organism to its environment) and by showing that
sufficiency corresponds to known notions such as sufficient history information
spaces. We then develop other related notions such as degree of insufficiency,
universal covers, hierarchies, strategic sufficiency. In the end, we tie it all

  Networks","15 pages, 11 figures, 4 Tables, submitted for publication",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in
various intelligent scenarios. Most existing methods for training SNNs are
based on the concept of synaptic plasticity; however, learning in the realistic
brain also utilizes intrinsic non-synaptic mechanisms of neurons. The spike
threshold of biological neurons is a critical intrinsic neuronal feature that
exhibits rich dynamics on a millisecond timescale and has been proposed as an
underlying mechanism that facilitates neural information processing. In this
study, we develop a novel synergistic learning approach that involves
simultaneously training synaptic weights and spike thresholds in SNNs. SNNs
trained with synapse-threshold synergistic learning~(STL-SNNs) achieve
significantly superior performance on various static and neuromorphic datasets
than SNNs trained with two degenerated single-learning models. During training,
the synergistic learning approach optimizes neural thresholds, providing the
network with stable signal transmission via appropriate firing rates. Further
analysis indicates that STL-SNNs are robust to noisy data and exhibit low
energy consumption for deep network structures. Additionally, the performance
of STL-SNN can be further improved by introducing a generalized joint decision
framework. Overall, our findings indicate that biologically plausible synergies
between synaptic and intrinsic non-synaptic mechanisms may provide a promising
approach for developing highly efficient SNN learning methods.

exacerbated the deterioration of the global environment, which should be
controlled to achieve carbon neutrality. Central to the core goal of achieving
carbon neutrality is the utilization of CO$_2$ under economic and sustainable
conditions. Recently, the strong need for carbon neutrality has led to a
proliferation of studies on the direct conversion of CO$_2$ into carboxylic
acids, which could effectively alleviate CO$_2$ emissions and create high-value
chemicals. The purpose of this review is to present the application prospects
of carboxylic acids and the basic principles of CO$_2$ conversion into
carboxylic acids through photo-, electric-, and thermal catalysis. Special
attention is focused on the regulation strategy of the activity of abundant
catalysts at the molecular level, inspiring the preparation of high-performance
catalysts. In addition, theoretical calculation, advanced technologies, and
numerous typical examples are introduced to elaborate on the corresponding
process and influencing factors of catalytic activity. Finally, challenges and
prospects are provided for the future development of this field. It is hoped
that this review contributes to a deeper understanding of the conversion of
CO$_2$ into carboxylic acids and inspires more innovative breakthroughs

dynamics of individual components to build a model of the population-level
dynamics from the start. However, when building a population-level description,
it can be easy to lose sight of each individual and how they contribute to the
larger picture. In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture for
learning from time-varying data that builds descriptions of both the individual
as well as the collective population dynamics. Rather than combining all of our
data into our model at the onset, we develop a separable architecture that
operates on individual time-series first before passing them forward; this
induces a permutation-invariance property and can be used to transfer across
systems of different size and order. After demonstrating that our model can be
applied to successfully recover complex interactions and dynamics in many-body
systems, we apply our approach to populations of neurons in the nervous system.
On neural activity datasets, we show that our model not only yields robust
decoding performance, but also provides impressive performance in transfer
across recordings of different animals without any neuron-level correspondence.
By enabling flexible pre-training that can be transferred to neural recordings
of different size and order, our work provides a first step towards creating a
foundation model for neural decoding.

theory of gravity. We first describe the equations of stellar structure and
evolution for a spherically symmetric spacetime plus a perfect fluid at rest.
We then present numerical results for the structure of neutron stars using four
nucleonic dense matter equations of state and a series of gravity theories for
$\alpha$ ranging from zero, i.e., General Relativity, up to $\alpha \approx
10^{16}$ cm$^2$. We emphasize properties of these neutron star models that are
of relevance for their thermal evolution as the threshold masses for enhanced
neutrino emission by the direct Urca process, the proper volume of the stellar
cores where this neutrino emission is allowed, the crust thickness, and the
surface gravitational acceleration that directly impact the observable
effective temperature. Finally, we numerically solve the equations of thermal
evolution and explicitly analyze the effects of altering gravity. We find that
uncertainties in the dense matter microphysics, as the core chemical
composition and superfluidity/superconductivity properties, as well as the
astrophysical uncertainties on the chemical composition of the surface layers,
have a much stronger impact than possible modifications of gravity within the
studied family of $f(R)$ theories. We conclude that within this family of
gravity theories, conclusions from previous studies of neutron star thermal
evolution are not significantly altered by alteration of gravity. Conversely,
this implies that neutron star cooling modeling may not be a useful tool to
constrain deviations of gravity from Einstein theory unless these are much more
radical than in the $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$ framework.

high-utility itemset mining has emerged as a key research topic, where the aim
is to find a subset of patterns that meet a targeted pattern constraint instead
of all patterns. This is a challenging task because efficiently finding
tailored patterns in a very large search space requires a targeted mining
algorithm. A first algorithm called TargetUM has been proposed, which adopts an
approach similar to post-processing using a tree structure, but the running
time and memory consumption are unsatisfactory in many situations. In this
paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel list-based algorithm with
pattern matching mechanism, named THUIM (Targeted High-Utility Itemset Mining),
which can quickly match high-utility itemsets during the mining process to
select the targeted patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted on different

however, the link-currents along periodic or infinite spatial directions find
comparable roles as gauge invariant states. The subtleties related to the
extreme weak coupling of the transfer-matrix in the Fourier basis are

the limit $g\to 0$. By means of the very basic notions and tools of the lattice

scale-dependent. In many cases, it is crucial to consider a multitude of
interlinked variables and the strengths of their correlations to adequately
fathom the dynamics of a high-dimensional nonlinear system. We propose a
recurrence based dependence measure that quantifies the relationship between
multiple time series based on the predictability of their joint evolution. The
statistical analysis of recurrence plots (RPs) is a powerful framework in
nonlinear time series analysis that has proven to be effective in addressing
many fundamental problems, e.g., regime shift detection and identification of
couplings. The recurrence flow through an RP exploits artifacts in the
formation of diagonal lines, a structure in RPs that reflects periods of
predictable dynamics. By using time-delayed variables of a deterministic
uni-/multivariate system, lagged dependencies with potentially many time scales
can be captured by the recurrence flow measure. Given an RP, no parameters are
required for its computation. We showcase the scope of the method for
quantifying lagged nonlinear correlations and put a focus on the delay
selection problem in time-delay embedding which is often used for attractor
reconstruction. The recurrence flow measure of dependence helps to identify
non-uniform delays and appears as a promising foundation for a recurrence based
state space reconstruction algorithm.

techniques for building multimodal representations have been proven successful,

technique can be expected to yield the best results in a given scenario and
what factors should be considered while choosing such a technique. This paper
explores the most common techniques for building multimodal data
representations -- the late fusion, the early fusion, and the sketch, and
compares them in classification tasks. Experiments are conducted on three
datasets: Amazon Reviews, MovieLens25M, and MovieLens1M datasets. In general,
our results confirm that multimodal representations are able to boost the
performance of unimodal models from 0.919 to 0.969 of accuracy on Amazon

building multimodal representation is crucial to obtain the highest possible
model's performance, that comes with the proper modalities combination. Such
choice relies on: the influence that each modality has on the analyzed machine

intractable and exceedingly expensive for large grids, graph neural networks
(GNNs) are a promising method to reduce the computational effort of analyzing
dynamic stability of power grids. We provide new datasets of dynamic stability
of synthetic power grids and find that GNNs are surprisingly effective at
predicting the highly non-linear targets from topological information only.
Furthermore, we use GNNs to demonstrate the accurate identification of
particularly vulnerable nodes in power grids, so-called troublemakers. Lastly,
we find that GNNs trained on small grids generate accurate predictions on a

passivation performance of Lewis base molecules in tin-based perovskite is
tightly correlated with their molecular hardness. We reveal that the degree of
hardness of Lewis adsorbate governs the stabilization via dual effects: first,
changing the stubborn spatial distribution of tin vacancy (VSn) by triggering
charge redistribution; second, saturating the dangling states while
simultaneously reducing the amounts of deep band gap states. Specifically, the
hard Lewis base molecules like edamine (N-donor group) and Isatin-Cl (Cl-donor
group) would show a better healing effect than other candidates on the
defects-contained tin-based perovskite surface with a somehow hard Lewis acid

suited for visualization and are easily interpretable. In Blotto, PTA
identifies game symmetries, and specifies strategic trade-offs associated with
distinct win conditions. For Pokemon, PTA embeddings produce clusters in the

685,397 non-profit organizations. We identify nearly one million grants
supporting institutions involved in science and higher education, finding that
in volume and scope, philanthropic funding has grown to become comparable to
federal research funding. Yet, distinct from government support, philanthropic
funders tend to focus locally, indicating that criteria beyond research
excellence play an important role in funding decisions. We also show evidence
of persistence, i.e., once a grant-giving relationship begins, it tends to
continue in time. Finally, we leverage the bipartite network of supporters and
recipients to help us demonstrate the predictive power of the underlying
network in foreseeing future funder-recipient relationships. The developed
toolset could offer funding recommendations to organizations and help funders
diversify their portfolio. We discuss the policy implications of our findings
for philanthropic funders, individual researchers, and quantitative
understanding of philanthropy.

and easily understood. In this paper, we propose a simple yet novel
unsupervised sentence simplification system that harnesses parsing structures
together with sentence embeddings to produce linguistically effective
simplifications. This means our model is capable of introducing substantial
modifications to simplify a sentence while maintaining its original semantics
and adequate fluency. We establish the unsupervised state-of-the-art at 39.13
SARI on TurkCorpus set and perform competitively against supervised baselines
on various quality metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate our framework's
extensibility to other languages via a proof-of-concept on Vietnamese data.

  Microblog Comments",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Microblogs have become a social platform for people to express their emotions
in real-time, and it is a trend to analyze user emotional tendencies from the
information on Microblogs. The dynamic features of emojis can affect the
sentiment polarity of microblog texts. Since existing models seldom consider
the diversity of emoji sentiment polarity,the paper propose a microblog
sentiment classification model based on ALBERT-FAET. We obtain text embedding
via ALBERT pretraining model and learn the inter-emoji embedding with an
attention-based LSTM network. In addition, a fine-grained attention mechanism
is proposed to capture the word-level interactions between plain text and
emoji. Finally, we concatenate these features and feed them into a CNN
classifier to predict the sentiment labels of the microblogs. To verify the
effectiveness of the model and the fine-grained attention network, we conduct
comparison experiments and ablation experiments. The comparison experiments
show that the model outperforms previous methods in three evaluation indicators
(accuracy, precision, and recall) and the model can significantly improve
sentiment classification. The ablation experiments show that compared with
ALBERT-AET, the proposed model ALBERT-FAET is better in the metrics, indicating
that the fine-grained attention network can understand the diversified
information of emoticons.

  Communications","8 pages, 6 figures. Published on MedComNet 2022",,,,"cs.NI cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given the importance of line-of-sight in mmWave communications, a strategic
adversary can harm a transmission by obstructing the receiver, which in turn
can react by trying to move around this hurdle. To expand on this point, we
study one such scenario from the perspective of game theory, considering a
mobile mmWave receiver and an adversary interacting strategically as players in
a zero-sum game, where they want to maximize, or respectively minimize, the
spectral efficiency of the communication. To do so, the adversary attempts at
screening the receiver's line of sight as an obstacle, while the receiver can
move around so as to avoid the blockage. We consider preset distances and the
choices available to the players are to change their angular coordinates to go
around each other. This is framed as a static game of complete information, for
which we numerically find the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, drawing
some interesting conclusions such as connecting it with the beamforming pattern
of the transmitter.

(6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses
solely on high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the
intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a
revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application
requirements and meaning of information into the data processing and
transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is
expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles
need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart wireless Internet. In
this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons of SemCom
in 6G. Then, we outline the major 6G visions and key enabler techniques which
lay the foundation of SemCom. Meanwhile, we highlight some benefits of
SemCom-empowered 6G and present a SemCom-native 6G network architecture. Next,
we show the evolution of SemCom from its introduction to classical SemCom
related theory and modern AI-enabled SemCom. Following that, focusing on modern
SemCom, we classify SemCom into three categories, i.e., semantic-oriented
communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication,
and introduce three types of semantic metrics. We then discuss the
applications, the challenges and technologies related to semantics and
communication. Finally, we introduce future research opportunities. In a
nutshell, this paper investigates the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications
in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues for further
direction.

world to regulate Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems implemented into the
public and private sectors. Many of these regulations address the transparency
of AI systems, and related citizen-aware issues like allowing individuals to
have the right to an explanation about how an AI system makes a decision that
impacts them. Yet, almost all AI governance documents to date have a
significant drawback: they have focused on what to do (or what not to do) with
respect to making AI systems transparent, but have left the brunt of the work
to technologists to figure out how to build transparent systems. We fill this
gap by proposing a novel stakeholder-first approach that assists technologists
in designing transparent, regulatory compliant systems. We also describe a
real-world case-study that illustrates how this approach can be used in
practice.

not least due to new options for teleworking and new complex digital tools. The
acquisition of advanced competence profiles is to be addressed by formal
education. For example, the method of Building Information Modeling (BIM) aims
at digitizing the design, construction, and operation of structures and as such
requires advanced competence profiles. In this study, two educational scenarios
based on teleworking and complex digital tools are compared, each with one
cohort and consisting of two learning activities. The first cohort initially
completes as first learning activity a semester-long course that aims at BIM
domain competences. The semester-long course of the second cohort fosters meta
competences, such as communication, collaboration, and digital literacy. At the
end of the semester, both cohorts solve in a second learning activity a BIM
practice task. Research questions are: (1) Do the two educational scenarios
promote the competences to be addressed? And related: (2) What is the impact of
the initial course that fosters domain competences or meta competences?
Methodologically, the learning outcomes are assessed by measuring the domain
competences three times during the educational scenario using online tests in
the two cohorts (N=11). Further, students' perceptions are surveyed in parallel
using online questionnaires. In addition, semi-structured interviews are
conducted at the end of the educational scenarios. The quantitative and
qualitative results of the study designating the training of meta competencies
partly as a substitute for imparting domain competences are presented. Further,
the influence of both educational scenarios on competence development for the
workplace of the future characterized by telework and digital tools is
discussed.
