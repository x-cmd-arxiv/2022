corresponding e.g. to $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ spin isotropy, we numerically
investigate the emergence of Kac-Moody symmetry at low energies and long
distances. In that regime, one such critical quantum spin chain is described by
a conformal field theory where the usual Virasoro algebra associated to
conformal invariance is augmented with a Kac-Moody algebra associated to
conserved currents. Specifically, we first propose a method to construct
lattice operators corresponding to the Kac-Moody generators. We then
numerically show that, when projected onto low energy states of the quantum
spin chain, these operators indeed approximately fulfill the Kac-Moody algebra.
The lattice version of the Kac-Moody generators allow us to compute the
so-called level constant and to organize the low-energy eigenstates of the
lattice Hamiltonian into Kac-Moody towers. We illustrate the proposal with the
XXZ model and the Heisenberg model with a next-to-nearest-neighbor coupling.

this paper, a new approach is presented for identification via retinal images
using LBP and hog methods. In the proposed method, it will be tried to separate
the retinal vessels accurately via machine vision techniques which will have
good sustainability in rotation and size change. HOG-based or LBP-based methods

understand the benefit and risk profile of experimental treatments, but also to
help choose appropriate strategies to handle intercurrent events in defining
estimands. The current case report form (CRF) commonly in use mixes the
underlying reasons for treatment discontinuation and who makes the decision for
treatment discontinuation, often resulting in an inaccurate collection of
reasons for treatment discontinuation. Methods and results: We systematically
reviewed and analyzed treatment discontinuation data from nine phase 2 and
phase 3 studies for insulin peglispro. A total of 857 participants with
treatment discontinuation were included in the analysis. Our review suggested
that, due to the vague multiple-choice options for treatment discontinuation
present in the CRF, different reasons were sometimes recorded for the same
underlying reason for treatment discontinuation. Based on our review and
analysis, we suggest an intermediate solution and a more systematic way to
improve the current CRF for treatment discontinuations. Conclusion: This
research provides insight and directions on how to optimize the CRF for
recording treatment discontinuation. Further work needs to be done to build the
learning into Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium standards.

to favor well-localized or sparse distributions compared to L2-norm
(least-squares) fitted estimates. We present a linear programming approach
which performs L1-norm fitting and penalization of the current pattern (L1L1)
to control the number of non-zero currents. The optimizer filters a large set
of candidate solutions using a two-stage metaheuristic search in from a
pre-filtered set of candidates. The numerical simulation results, obtained with
both a 8- and 20-channel electrode montages, suggest that our hypothesis on the
benefits of L1-norm data fitting is valid. As compared to L1-norm regularized
L2-norm fitting (L1L2) via semidefinite programming and weighted Tikhonov
least-squares method, the L1L1 results were overall preferable with respect to
maximizing the focused current density at the target position and the ratio
between focused and nuisance current magnitudes. We propose the metaheuristic
L1L1 optimization approach as a potential technique to obtain a well-localized
stimulus with a controllable magnitude at a given target position. L1L1 finds a
current pattern with a steep contrast between the anodal and cathodal
electrodes meanwhile suppressing the nuisance currents in the brain, hence,
providing a potential alternative to modulate the effects of the stimulation,
e.g., the sensation experienced by the subject.

super-luminous supernova (SLSN-I), at a redshift of 0.032. The light curves of
SN 2020wnt are characterised by an early bump lasting $\sim5$ days, followed by
a bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of
M$_{r}^{max}=-20.52\pm0.03$ mag at $\sim77.5$ days from explosion. This
magnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of SLSNe-I, but
the rise-time is one of the longest reported to date. Unlike other SLSNe-I, the
spectra of SN 2020wnt do not show O II, but strong lines of C II and Si II are
detected. Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr, but
its evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the bolometric light curve to
hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2020wnt luminosity can be explained by
radioactive powering. The progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and
extended star with a pre-SN mass of 80 M$_\odot$ and a pre-SN radius of 15
R$_\odot$ that experiences a very energetic explosion of $45\times10^{51}$ erg,
producing 4 M$_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni. In this framework, the first peak results
from a post-shock cooling phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous
main peak is due to a large nickel production. These characteristics are
compatible with the pair-instability SN scenario. We note, however, that a
significant contribution of interaction with circumstellar material cannot be
ruled out.

certify the performance of the optimized LDRs with the bound on their
sub-optimality due to their linear functional form. Using this bound, we
guarantee that the preference of LDRs over less restrictive -- yet poorly
scalable -- scenario-based optimization does not lead to financial losses
exceeding this bound. We use a testbed of the U.S. Southeast power system to
reveal the trade-offs between the cost, stochasticity, and feasibility of
LDR-based investments. We also conclude that the LDR sub-optimality depends on
the amount of uncertainty and the tightness of chance constraints on
operational, investment and policy variables.

many excellent uplink schemes have been developed for URA, these schemes do not
specify a mechanism for providing feedback regarding whether a user's message
was successfully decoded. While this may be acceptable in some MTC scenarios,
the lack of feedback is inadequate for applications that demand a high level of
reliability. However, the problem of providing feedback to active users is
complicated by the fact that the base station does not know the identities of
the active users. In this paper, a novel downlink beamforming scheme called
HashBeam is presented that enables the base station to provide feedback to the
active users within URA, despite not knowing their identities. The key idea of
this scheme is that the users' channels and hashes of their messages may be
used as proxies for their true identities. The proposed scheme may be adapted
to any number of antennas at the base station and it is shown that the required
number of channel uses is linear in the number of users to acknowledge. The
idea of using channel gains in conjunction with user hashes as discriminating
attributes of active users is novel and expands the design space of URA
schemes.

self-supervised architecture, Wav2Vec 2.0, to the brain activity of 412
English, French, and Mandarin individuals recorded with functional Magnetic

results are four-fold. First, we show that this algorithm learns brain-like

comparable to what infants can be exposed to during language acquisition.
Second, its functional hierarchy aligns with the cortical hierarchy of speech
processing. Third, different training regimes reveal a functional
specialization akin to the cortex: Wav2Vec 2.0 learns sound-generic,
speech-specific and language-specific representations similar to those of the
prefrontal and temporal cortices. Fourth, we confirm the similarity of this
specialization with the behavior of 386 additional participants. These

present MetaDOCK, a task-specific dynamic kernel selection strategy for
designing compressed CNN models that generalize well on unseen tasks in
meta-learning. Our method is based on the hypothesis that for a given set of
similar tasks, not all kernels of the network are needed by each individual
task. Rather, each task uses only a fraction of the kernels, and the selection
of the kernels per task can be learnt dynamically as a part of the inner update
steps. MetaDOCK compresses the meta-model as well as the task-specific inner
models, thus providing significant reduction in model size for each task, and
through constraining the number of active kernels for every task, it implicitly
mitigates the issue of meta-overfitting. We show that for the same inference

consistently outperform the conventional choices of CNN models. MetaDOCK
couples well with popular meta-learning approaches such as iMAML. The efficacy
of our method is validated on CIFAR-fs and mini-ImageNet datasets, and we have

adaptation scheme for dynamical systems comprising time-varying uncertain
parameters. While majority of the adaptive control schemes in literature
address the case of constant parameters, recent research has conceptualized
improved adaptive control techniques for time-varying systems with rigorous
stability proofs. The proposed work is an effort towards a similar direction,
where a novel dual adaptation mechanism is introduced to efficiently tackle the
time-varying nature of the parameters. Projection and $\sigma$-modification
algorithms are strategically combined using congelation of variables to claim a
global result for the tracking error space. While the classical adaptive
systems demand a restrictive condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for
accurate parameter estimation, the proposed work relies on a milder condition,
called initial excitation (IE) for the same. A rigorous Lyapunov stability
analysis is carried out to establish uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB)
stability of the closed-loop system. Further it is analytically shown that the
proposed work can recover the performance of previously designed IE-based
adaptive controller in case of time invariant systems.

argue that these limitations are not intrinsic, but merely a byproduct of

little information about the classifier, and are in particular blind to the
local curvature of the decision boundary. This leads to severely sub-optimal
robustness guarantees as the dimension of the problem increases. We then show
that it is theoretically possible to bypass this issue by collecting more
information about the classifier. More precisely, we show that it is possible
to approximate the optimal certificate with arbitrary precision, by probing the
decision boundary with several noise distributions. Since this process is
executed at certification time rather than at test time, it entails no loss in
natural accuracy while enhancing the quality of the certificates. This result
fosters further research on classifier-specific certification and demonstrates
that randomized smoothing is still worth investigating. Although

better understand the source and benefit of feature learning in neural
networks, we consider learning problems motivated by practical data, where the
labels are determined by a set of class relevant patterns and the inputs are

networks trained by gradient descent can succeed on these problems. The success
relies on the emergence and improvement of effective features, which are
learned among exponentially many candidates efficiently by exploiting the data
(in particular, the structure of the input distribution). In contrast, no
linear models on data-independent features of polynomial sizes can learn to as
good errors. Furthermore, if the specific input structure is removed, then no
polynomial algorithm in the Statistical Query model can learn even weakly.
These results provide theoretical evidence showing that feature learning in

  optical response of chiral molecules on ultrafast timescales",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Distinguishing between the left- and right-handed versions of a chiral
molecule (enantiomers) is vital, but also inherently difficult. Traditional
optical methods using elliptically or circularly polarized light rely on weak
linear effects which arise beyond the electric-dipole approximation, posing
major limitations for time resolving ultrafast chiral molecular dynamics. Here
we show how, by tilting the plane of polarization of an ultrashort burst of
intense elliptically polarized light, towards its propagation direction, we can
turn the light field into a highly efficient chiro-optical tool. This ""forward
tilting"" can be achieved by focusing the beam tightly, creating structured
light which exhibits a nontrivial polarization pattern in space. We demonstrate
that our structured field allows us to realize an interferometer for efficient
chiral recognition that separates the nonlinear optical response of left- and
right-handed molecules in space. Our work provides a simple, yet highly
efficient, way of spatially structuring the polarization of light to image
molecular chirality, with extreme enantio-sensitivity and on ultrafast time
scales.

video-language analysis which provides a stronger bound on the baseline
accuracy of multimodal models constrained by image-level understanding. By
applying this model to standard discriminative video and language tasks, such
as video question answering and text-to-video retrieval, we characterize the
limitations and potential of current video-language benchmarks. We find that
understanding of event temporality is often not necessary to achieve strong or
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with recent large-scale
video-language models and in contexts intended to benchmark deeper video-level
understanding. We also demonstrate how ATP can improve both video-language
dataset and model design. We describe a technique for leveraging ATP to better
disentangle dataset subsets with a higher concentration of temporally
challenging data, improving benchmarking efficacy for causal and temporal
understanding. Further, we show that effectively integrating ATP into full
video-level temporal models can improve efficiency and state-of-the-art

uncertainty estimation. On the other hand, it is shown that in machine learning
the model complexity and severe nonlinearity become serious obstacles to
uncertainty evaluation. Furthermore, the process of machine model training
demands high computing power, not available at the level of personal computers.
This is why so-called pre-trained models are widely used in such areas of
machine learning as natural language processing. The latest example of a
pre-trained model is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 with hundreds of
billions of parameters and a half-terabyte training dataset. Similarly,
mathematical models built from real data are growing in complexity which is
accompanied by the growing amount of training data. However, when machine

uncertainty and evaluate accompanying risks. This problem could be resolved
with non-parametric techniques at the expense of greater demand for computing

While star formation predominantly occurs in young massive clusters, the

signposts of active star formation with emission from molecular outflows. These
outflows are bright in water emission, providing a direct observational link
between nearby and distant galaxies. We propose to utilize the knowledge of
local star formation as seen with molecular tracers to explore the nature of
star formation in the Universe. We present a large-scale statistical galactic
model of emission from galactic active star-forming regions. Our model is built
on observations of well-resolved nearby clusters. By simulating emission from
molecular outflows, which is known to scale with mass, we create a proxy that
can be used to predict the emission from clustered star formation at galactic
scales. We evaluated the impact of the most important global-star formation
parameters (i.e., initial stellar mass function (IMF), molecular cloud mass
distribution, star formation efficiency (SFE), and free-fall time efficiency)
on simulation results. We observe that for emission from the para-H2O 202 - 111
line, the IMF and molecular cloud mass distribution have a negligible impact on
the emission, both locally and globally, whereas the opposite holds for the SFE
and free-fall time efficiency. Moreover, this water transition proves to be a
low-contrast tracer of star formation. The fine-tuning of the model and
adaptation to morphologies of distant galaxies should result in realistic
predictions of observed molecular emission and make the galaxy-in-a-box model a

instability if the spacings between the planets are too small. Such instability
can be tempered by the frictional forces acting on the planets from gaseous
discs. A similar situation applies to stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN
discs around supermassive black holes. In this paper, we use $N$-body
integrations to evaluate how the frictional damping of orbital eccentricity
affects the growth of dynamical instability for a wide range of planetary
spacing and planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that the stability of a system
depends on the damping timescale $\tau$ relative to the zero-friction
instability growth timescale $t_{\rm inst}$. In a two-planet system, the
frictional damping can stabilise the dynamical evolution if $t_{\rm
inst}\gtrsim\tau$. With three planets, $t_{\rm inst} \gtrsim 10\tau - 100\tau$
is needed for stabilisation. When the separations between the planetary orbits
are sufficiently small, $t_{\rm inst}$ can be less than the synodic period
between the planets, which makes frictional stabilisation unlikely to occur. As
the orbital spacing increases, the instability timescale tends to grow
exponentially on average, but it can vary by a few orders of magnitude
depending on the initial orbital phases of the planets. In general, the stable
region (at large orbital spacings) and unstable region (at small orbital
spacings) are separated by a transition zone, in which the (in)stability of the
system is not guaranteed. We also devise a linear map to analyse the dynamical

hierarchical new physics, extending the scope of the tracking system of the
detector. Additionally, the reach of the proposed CODEX-b experiment is studied
as well. By exploiting the use of tracks only reconstructed in subsystems of
the detector at the high-level LHCb trigger, ${\mathcal{B}(B_s^0\to a_1 a_2) <
10^{-8}}$ and ${\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+ a_1 a_2) < 10^{-9}}$ could be reached in
the muon channel across seven orders of magnitude in the lifetime of the
Goldstone bosons. Correspondingly, heavy-light particle couplings of order
$\lesssim 1$ could be tested, potentially ruling out composite Higgs scenarios
where the heavy and light sectors couple strongly.

Alan Turing proposed an elegant mechanism for pattern formation based on
spontaneous breaking of the spatial translational symmetry in the underlying
reaction-diffusion system. Much is understood about dynamics and structure of
Turing patterns. However, little is known about the energetic cost of Turing
pattern. Here, we study nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a small spatially
extended biochemical reaction-diffusion system by using analytical and
numerical methods. We find that the onset of Turing pattern requires a minimum
energy dissipation to drive the nonequilibrium chemical reactions. Above onset,
only a small fraction of the total energy expenditure is used to overcome
diffusion for maintaining the spatial pattern. We show that the positioning
error decreases as energy dissipation increases following the same tradeoff
relationship between timing error and energy cost in biochemical oscillatory
systems. In a finite system, we find that a specific Turing pattern exists only
within a finite range of total molecule number, and energy dissipation broadens
the range, which enhances the robustness of the Turing pattern against molecule
number fluctuations in living cells. These results are verified in a realistic
model of the Muk system underlying DNA segregation in E. coli, and testable
predictions are made for the dependence of the accuracy and robustness of the
spatial pattern on the ATP/ADP ratio. In general, the theoretical framework
developed here can be applied to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics of
spatially extended biochemical systems.

inhomogeneities for ultracool objects including M dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs),

These inhomogeneities can be caused by star spots, clouds, and vortices. Star
spots and associated stellar flares play a significant role in habitability,
either stifling life or catalyzing abiogenesis depending on the emission
frequency, magnitude, and orientation. Clouds and vortices may be the source of
spectral and photometric variability observed at the L/T transition of BDs and
are expected in gas giant exoplanets. We develop a versatile analytical
framework to model and infer surface inhomogeneities which can be applied to
both spectroscopic and photometric data. This model is validated against a slew
of numerical simulations. Using archival spectroscopic and photometric data, we
infer star spot parameters (location, size, and contrast) and generate global
surface maps for Luhman 16B (an early T dwarf and one of our solar system's
nearest neighbors at a distance of approximately 2 pc). We confirm previous
findings that Luhman 16B's atmosphere is inhomogeneous with time-varying
features. In addition, we provide tentative evidence of longer timescale
atmospheric structures such as dark equatorial and bright mid-latitude to polar
spots. These findings are discussed in the context of atmospheric circulation
and dynamics for ultracool dwarfs. Our analytical model will be valuable in
assessing the feasibility of using ELTs to study surface inhomogeneities of gas

In particular, our method improves the perception of small and long range
objects, which are often not detected by the object detectors in RGB mode. The
proposed method consists of two RGB object detectors, namely the Primary
detector and a lightweight Secondary detector. The primary detector takes a
full RGB image and generates primary detections. Next, the radar proposal
framework creates regions of interest (ROIs) for object proposals by projecting
the radar point cloud onto the 2D RGB image. These ROIs are cropped and fed to
the secondary detector to generate secondary detections which are then fused
with the primary detections via non-maximum suppression. This method helps in
recovering the small objects by preserving the object's spatial features
through an increase in their receptive field. We evaluate our fusion method on

intensive to be deployed on edge devices, since most of the recent approaches
are deep learning-based. Besides, these methods always fail in real-world
scenes, since most of them adopt a simple fixed ""ideal"" bicubic downsampling
kernel from high-quality images to construct LR/HR training pairs which may
lose track of frequency-related details. In this work, an approach for
real-time ISR on mobile devices is presented, which is able to deal with a wide
range of degradations in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on
traditional super-resolution datasets (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Manga109,
DIV2K) and real-world images with a variety of degradations demonstrate that
our method outperforms the state-of-art methods, resulting in higher PSNR and
SSIM, lower noise and better visual quality. Most importantly, our method
achieves real-time performance on mobile or edge devices.

show that a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the synthetic control weights

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed for synthesizing
controllers that guarantee collision avoidance and goal stabilization for
multiple robots. However, it has been noted that reactive control synthesis
methods (such as CBFs) are prone to \textit{deadlock}, an equilibrium of system
dynamics that causes the robots to stall before reaching their goals. In this
paper, we analyze the closed-loop dynamics of robots using CBFs, to
characterize controller parameters, initial conditions, and goal locations that
invariably lead the system to deadlock. Using tools from duality theory, we
derive geometric properties of robot configurations of an $N$ robot system once
it is in deadlock and we justify them using the mechanics interpretation of KKT
conditions. Our key deductions are that 1) system deadlock is characterized by
a force-equilibrium on robots and 2) deadlock occurs to ensure safety when
safety is on the brink of being violated. These deductions allow us to
interpret deadlock as a subset of the state space, and we show that this set is
non-empty and located on the boundary of the safe set. By exploiting these
properties, we analyze the number of admissible robot configurations in
deadlock and develop a provably-correct decentralized algorithm for deadlock
resolution to safely deliver the robots to their goals. This algorithm is
validated in simulations as well as experimentally on Khepera-IV robots.

in understanding Galactic dynamics, but there are many observational
challenges. One useful probe for studying the magnetic field component parallel
to the line of sight (LoS) is Faraday rotation of linearly polarized radio
synchrotron emission, combined with H$\alpha$ observations. HII regions are the
perfect laboratories to probe such magnetic fields as they are localized in
space, and are well-defined sources often with known distances and measurable
electron densities. We chose the HII region Sharpless 2-27 (Sh 2-27). By using
a map of the magnetic field strength along the LoS ($B_{\parallel}$) for the
first time, we investigate the basic statistical properties of the turbulent
magnetic field inside Sh 2-27. We study the scaling of the magnetic field
fluctuations, compare it to the Kolmogorov scaling, and attempt to find an
outer scale of the turbulent magnetic field fluctuations. We estimate the
median value of $n_e$ as $7.3\pm0.1$ cm$^{-3}$, and the median value of
$B_{\parallel}$ as $-4.5\pm0.1$ $\mu$G, which is comparable to the magnetic
field strength in diffuse ISM. The slope of the structure function of the
estimated $B_{\parallel}$-map is found to be slightly steeper than Kolmogorov,
consistent with our Gaussian-random-field $B_{\parallel}$ simulations revealing
that an input Kolmogorov slope in the magnetic field results in a somewhat
steeper slope in $B_{\parallel}$. These results suggest that the lower limit to
the outer scale of turbulence is 10 pc in the HII region, which is comparable
to the size of the computation domain. This may indicate that the turbulence
probed here could actually be cascading from the larger scales in the ambient
medium, associated with the interstellar turbulence in the general ISM, which
is illuminated by the presence of Sh 2-27.

  In this work, we show how the M series chips can be leveraged using the Metal

importantly, we show how the usage of MSL avoids the typical complexity of CUDA
or OpenACC memory management, by allowing the central processing unit (CPU) and

also allows us to accelerate an existing elastic wave equation solver
(originally based on OpenMP accelerated C++) using MSL, with minimal effort,
while retaining all CPU and OpenMP functionality.
  The resulting performance gain of simulating the wave equation is near an
order of magnitude for specific settings. This gain attained from using MSL is
similar to other GPU-accelerated wave-propagation codes with respect to their
CPU variants, but does not come at much increased programming complexity that
prohibits the typical scientific programmer to leverage these accelerators.
This result shows how unified processing units can be a valuable tool to

dynamical systems characterized by gradient fields such as (port-)Hamiltonian
systems and gradient flows. The gradient structure is associated with
conservation of invariants or with dissipation and hence plays a crucial role
in the description of the physical properties of the system. Traditional
hyper-reduction of nonlinear gradient fields yields efficient approximations
that, however, lack the gradient structure. We focus on Hamiltonian gradients
and we propose to first decompose the nonlinear part of the Hamiltonian, mapped
into a suitable reduced space, into the sum of d terms, each characterized by a
sparse dependence on the system state. Then, the hyper-reduced approximation is
obtained via discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) of the Jacobian of the
derived d-valued nonlinear function. The resulting hyper-reduced model retains
the gradient structure and its computationally complexity is independent of the
size of the full model. Moreover, a priori error estimates show that the
hyper-reduced model converges to the reduced model and the Hamiltonian is
asymptotically preserved. Whenever the nonlinear Hamiltonian gradient is not
globally reducible, i.e. its evolution requires high-dimensional DEIM
approximation spaces, an adaptive strategy is performed. This consists in
updating the hyper-reduced Hamiltonian via a low-rank correction of the DEIM
basis. Numerical tests demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach
to general nonlinear operators and runtime speedups compared to the full and

its performance suffers on complicated datasets. The problem can be ascribed to
its simple feature extracting blocks: encoder/decoder, and the semantic gap
between encoder and decoder. Variants of U-Net (such as R2U-Net) have been
proposed to address the problem of simple feature extracting blocks by making
the network deeper, but it does not deal with the semantic gap problem. On the
other hand, another variant UNET++ deals with the semantic gap problem by
introducing dense skip connections but has simple feature extraction blocks. To
overcome these issues, we propose a new U-Net based medical image segmentation
architecture R2U++. In the proposed architecture, the adapted changes from
vanilla U-Net are: (1) the plain convolutional backbone is replaced by a deeper
recurrent residual convolution block. The increased field of view with these
blocks aids in extracting crucial features for segmentation which is proven by
improvement in the overall performance of the network. (2) The semantic gap
between encoder and decoder is reduced by dense skip pathways. These pathways
accumulate features coming from multiple scales and apply concatenation
accordingly. The modified architecture has embedded multi-depth models, and an
ensemble of outputs taken from varying depths improves the performance on
foreground objects appearing at various scales in the images. The performance
of R2U++ is evaluated on four distinct medical imaging modalities: electron
microscopy (EM), X-rays, fundus, and computed tomography (CT). The average gain
achieved in IoU score is 1.5+-0.37% and in dice score is 0.9+-0.33% over

statistical properties. In particular, we show that, even in the presence of
outliers, the sublevel filtrations and weighted filtrations induced by
$\textsf{MoM Dist}$ are both consistent estimators of the true underlying
population counterpart, and their rates of convergence in the bottleneck metric
are controlled by the fraction of outliers in the data. Finally, we demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed methodology through simulations and

using 6D phase space information to directly integrate orbits. We define a
pseudo-length for the Galactic bar, named $R_{Freq}$, based on the maximal
extent of trapped bar orbits. We find the $R_{Freq}$ measured from orbits is
consistent with the $R_{Freq}$ of the assumed potential only when the length of
the bar and pattern speed of said potential is similar to the model from which
the initial phase-space coordinates of the orbits are derived. Therefore, one
can measure the model's or the Milky Way's bar length from 6D phase-space
coordinates by determining which assumed potential leads to a self-consistent
measured $R_{Freq}$. When we apply this method to $\approx$210,000 stars in
APOGEE DR17 and $Gaia$ eDR3 data, we find a consistent result only for
potential models with a dynamical bar length of $\approx$3.5 kpc. We find the
Milky Way's trapped bar orbits extend out to only $\approx$3.5 kpc, but there
is also an overdensity of stars at the end of the bar out to 4.8 kpc which
could be related to an attached spiral arm. We also find that the measured
orbital structure of the bar is strongly dependent on the properties of the

SARS-CoV-2 infection, both reinfection and breakthrough infection are possible
events whose occurrence would increase with time after first exposure to the
antigen and with the emergence of new variants of the virus. Periodic
vaccination could counteract this decline in protection. In the present work,
our aim was to develop and explore a model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with
vaccination, reinfection and breakthrough infection. A modified deterministic
SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model represented by a system of
differential equations was designed. As in any SIS model, the population was
divided into susceptible and infected individuals. But in our design,
susceptible individuals were, in turn, grouped into three consecutive
categories whose susceptibility increases with time after infection or
vaccination. The model was studied by means of computer simulations, which were
analysed qualitatively. The results obtained show that the prevalence, after
oscillating between peaks and valleys, reaches a plateau phase. Moreover, as
might be expected, the magnitude of the peaks and plateaus increases as the
infection rate rises, the vaccination rate decreases and the rate of decay of
protection conferred by vaccination or previous infection increases. Therefore,
the present study suggests that, at least under certain conditions, the spread
of SARS-CoV-2, although it could experience fluctuations, would finally evolve
into an endemic form, with a more or less stable prevalence that would depend
on the levels of infection and vaccination, and on the kinetics of
post-infection and post-vaccination protection. However, it should be kept in
mind that our development is a theoretical scheme with many limitations. For
this reason, its predictions should be considered with great care.

be considered. In this article, we use the class of generalized linear models
(GLMs) to build statistical models in mixture experiments. The GLMs class is
general and very flexible, generalizing some of the most important probability
distributions, and allows modeling the variability through the methodology of
the joint modeling of mean and dispersion (JMMD). This paper shows how the JMMD
can be used to obtain models for mean and variance in mixture experiments. We
give a comprehensive understanding of the procedures for estimating parameters
and selecting variables in the JMMD. The variable selection procedure was
adapted for the case of mixture experiments, where the verification of constant
dispersion is ensured by the existence of only the constant term in the
dispersion model; the absence of the constant term or the existence of any
other term in the dispersion model implies non-constant dispersion. A
simulation study, considering the most common case of Normal distribution, was
used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed variable selection procedure.
A practical example from the Food Industry was used to illustrate the proposed

astrometric microlensing event. Leveraging astrometry from \Gaia{} and followup
data from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} we measure the astrometric
deflection of the background source and obtain a gravitational mass for
LAWD~37. The main challenge of this analysis is in extracting the lensing
signal of the faint background source whilst it is buried in the wings of
LAWD~37's point spread function. Removal of LAWD 37's point spread function
induces a significant amount of correlated noise which we find can mimic the
astrometric lensing signal. We find a deflection model including correlated
noise caused by the removal of LAWD~37's point spread function best explains
the data and yields a mass for LAWD 37 of $0.56\pm0.08 M_{\odot}$. This mass is
in agreement with the theoretical mass-radius relationship and cooling tracks
expected for CO core white dwarfs. Furthermore, the mass is consistent with no
or trace amounts of hydrogen that is expected for objects with helium-rich
atmospheres like LAWD 37. We conclude that further astrometric followup data on
the source is likely to improve the inference on LAWD 37's mass at the
$\approx3$ percent level and definitively rule out purely correlated noise
explanations of the data. This work provides the first semi-empirical test of

visualizing high-dimensional datasets. Motivated from entirely different
viewpoints, their loss functions appear to be unrelated. In practice, they
yield strongly differing embeddings and can suggest conflicting interpretations
of the same data. The fundamental reasons for this and, more generally, the
exact relationship between $t$-SNE and UMAP have remained unclear. In this
work, we uncover their conceptual connection via a new insight into contrastive
learning methods. Noise-contrastive estimation can be used to optimize $t$-SNE,
while UMAP relies on negative sampling, another contrastive method. We find the
precise relationship between these two contrastive methods and provide a
mathematical characterization of the distortion introduced by negative
sampling. Visually, this distortion results in UMAP generating more compact
embeddings with tighter clusters compared to $t$-SNE. We exploit this new
conceptual connection to propose and implement a generalization of negative
sampling, allowing us to interpolate between (and even extrapolate beyond)
$t$-SNE and UMAP and their respective embeddings. Moving along this spectrum of
embeddings leads to a trade-off between discrete / local and continuous /
global structures, mitigating the risk of over-interpreting ostensible features
of any single embedding. We provide a PyTorch implementation.

Euler's equations about the small-amplitude Stokes waves. These unstable
elements form a figure-eight curve centered at the origin of the complex
spectral plane, which is parameterized by a Floquet exponent. Our asymptotic
expansions of this figure-eight are in excellent agreement with numerical

From our expansions, we derive high-order estimates for the growth rates of the

compare the Benjamin-Feir and high-frequency instability spectra analytically

Reasoning-based methods with complex reasoning mechanisms, such as

the default pathway for this task. However, these mechanisms are difficult to
implement and train, which hampers their reproducibility and transferability to
new domains. In this paper, we propose QAGCN - a simple but effective and novel

multi-step reasoning during the encoding of knowledge graphs. As a consequence,
complex reasoning mechanisms are avoided. In addition, to improve efficiency,
we retrieve answers using highly-efficient embedding computations and, for
better interpretability, we extract interpretable paths for returned answers.
On widely adopted benchmark datasets, the proposed model has been demonstrated
competitive against state-of-the-art methods that rely on complex reasoning
mechanisms. We also conducted extensive experiments to scrutinize the

terms of stability. We found that configurational entropy resembles a stability
line, independent from nuclear spin, for symmetric light nuclides when
considering softwall and Wood-Saxon-like models. For the hardwall case,
configurational entropy, despite increasing with the constituent number,
depends on the nuclear spin. Thus, the Woods-Saxon-like model emerges as the

(ETAs) in the MEGASIM data set (Yeager & Golovich 2022). Trojan asteroids
co-orbit the Sun with a planet but remain bound to the Lagrange points, L4
(60{\deg} leading the planet) or L5 (60{\deg} trailing). In the circular
three-body approximation, the stability of a Trojan asteroid depends on the
ratio of the host planet mass and the central mass. For the inner planets, the
range of stability becomes increasingly small, so perturbations from the
planets have made primordial Trojans rare. To date there have been just two
ETAs (2010 TK7 and 2020 XL5), several Mars Trojans, and a Venus Trojan
discovered. The estimated lifetimes of the known inner system Trojans are less
than a million years, suggesting they are interlopers rather than members of a
stable and long-lasting population. With the largest ETA n-body simulation to
date, we are able to track their survival across a wide initialized parameter
space. We find the remaining fraction of ETAs over time is well fit with a
stretched exponential function that when extrapolated beyond our simulation run
time predicts zero ETAs by 2.33 Gyr. We also show correlations between ETA
ejections and the periods of the Milankovitch cycles. Though Earth's orbital
dynamics dominate the instabilities of ETAs, we provide evidence that ETA
ejections are linked to resonances found in the variation of the orbital
elements of many, if not all of the planets.

is observed in various situations, such as the cleaning of a surface or during
the landing of a spacecraft. The presence of inter-particle cohesive forces
modifies the erosion threshold, beyond which grains are transported. The
cohesion also influences the resulting formation and shape of the crater. In
this paper, we characterize the role of the cohesive forces on the erosion of a
flat granular bed by an impinging normal turbulent jet in air. We perform
experiments using a cohesion-controlled granular material to finely tune the
cohesion between particles while keeping the other properties constant. We
investigate the effects of the cohesion on the erosion threshold and show that
the results can be rationalized by a cohesive Shields number that accounts for
the inter-particles cohesion force. Despite the complex nature of a turbulent
jet, we can provide a scaling law to correlate the jet erosion threshold, based
on the outlet velocity at the nozzle, to a local cohesive Shields number. The
presence of cohesion between the grains also modifies the shape of the
resulting crater, the transport of grains, and the local erosion process.

instruments to address the potential endogeneity in the relationship between ED

instrumental variables for ED. We find that dealing with the potential
endogeneity problem brings about a positive and statistically significant
effect of ED on GHG emissions: a 1 percentage point (pp.) rise in ED causes, on
average, a 0.7% increase in GHG emissions. Moreover, when disaggregating ED
between public and private indebtedness, instrumental variable estimates allow
us to find a positive and statistically significant effect of external public
debt on GHG emissions. Finally, disaggregation by type of creditor reveals that
the external public debt from bilateral (private) creditors causes, on average,
a 1.8% (1.2%) increase in GHG emissions. On the contrary, the instrument used

multi-group multicast beamforming in large-scale systems. For the
quality-of-service (QoS) problem, by utilizing the optimal multicast
beamforming structure obtained recently in [2], we convert the original problem
into a non-convex weight optimization problem of a lower dimension and propose
two fast first-order algorithms to solve it. Both algorithms are based on
successive convex approximation (SCA) and provide fast iterative updates to
solve each SCA subproblem. The first algorithm uses a saddle point
reformulation in the dual domain and applies the extragradient method with an
adaptive step-size procedure to find the saddle point with simple closed-form
updates. The second algorithm adopts the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) method by converting each SCA subproblem into a favorable
ADMM structure. The structure leads to simple closed-form ADMM updates, where
the problem in each update block can be further decomposed into parallel
subproblems of small sizes, for which closed-form solutions are obtained. We
also propose efficient initialization methods to obtain favorable initial
points that facilitate fast convergence. Furthermore, taking advantage of the
proposed fast algorithms, for the max-min fair (MMF) problem, we propose a
simple closed-form scaling scheme that directly uses the solution obtained from
the QoS problem, avoiding the conventional computationally expensive method
that iteratively solves the inverse QoS problem. We further develop lower and
upper bounds on the performance of this scaling scheme. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithms offer near-optimal performance with substantially
lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art algorithms for
large-scale systems.

programming problems are challenging in nature, and participants often fail to
solve the problem on their first attempt. Some online platforms for competitive
programming allow programmers to practice on competition-level problems as
well, and the standard feedback for an incorrect practice submission is the
first test case that the submission fails. Often, the failed test case does not
provide programmers with enough information to resolve the errors in their
code, and they abandon the problem after several more unsuccessful attempts.
  We present Clef, the first data-driven tool that can generate feedback on
competition-level code automatically by repairing programmers' incorrect
submissions. The key development is that Clef can learn how to generate repairs
for incorrect submissions by examining the repairs that other programmers made
to their own submissions over time. Since the differences between an incorrect
program and a correct program for the same task may be significant, we
introduce a new data structure, merge trees, to capture the changes between
submissions. Merge trees are versatile: they can encode both large
algorithm-level redesigns and small statement-level alterations. Clef applies
the patterns it learns from a database of submissions to generate repairs for
new submissions outside the database. We evaluated Clef on six real-world
problems from Codeforces, the world's largest platform for competitive

independent, and approximate the degradation model as zero-mean additive
Gaussian. However, this assumption does not hold for biomedical imaging systems
where sensor-based sources of noise are proportional to signal strengths, and
the noise is better represented as a Poisson process. In this work, we explore
a sparsity and dictionary learning-based approach and present a novel
self-supervised learning method for single-image denoising where the noise is
approximated as a Poisson process, requiring no clean ground-truth data.
Specifically, we approximate traditional iterative optimization algorithms for
image denoising with a recurrent neural network that enforces sparsity with
respect to the weights of the network. Since the sparse representations are
based on the underlying image, it is able to suppress the spurious components
(noise) in the image patches, thereby introducing implicit regularization for
denoising tasks through the network structure. Experiments on two bio-imaging
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Our qualitative results demonstrate that,
in addition to higher performance on standard quantitative metrics, we are able
to recover much more subtle details than other compared approaches. Our code is

effective on a small portion of the training data set, and it manages to find
an incumbent feasible solution for an instance that we could not solve with the

quantization, has been proposed to fit large NLP models on resource-constraint
devices. However, to preserve the accuracy for such aggressive compression
schemes, cutting-edge methods usually introduce complicated compression
pipelines, e.g., multi-stage expensive knowledge distillation with extensive
hyperparameter tuning. Also, they oftentimes focus less on smaller transformer
models that have already been heavily compressed via knowledge distillation and
lack a systematic study to show the effectiveness of their methods. In this
paper, we perform a very comprehensive systematic study to measure the impact
of many key hyperparameters and training strategies from previous works. As a
result, we find out that previous baselines for ultra-low bit precision
quantization are significantly under-trained. Based on our study, we propose a
simple yet effective compression pipeline for extreme compression, named XTC.
XTC demonstrates that (1) we can skip the pre-training knowledge distillation
to obtain a 5-layer BERT while achieving better performance than previous
state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT; (2) extreme quantization
plus layer reduction is able to reduce the model size by 50x, resulting in new

ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a
cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact,

INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x

another global pandemic due to the lack of proper precautious steps. Recently,
Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated huge potential in image-based diagnoses

Monkeypox-related disease as it infected the human skin, which image can be
acquired and further used in diagnosing the disease. Considering this
opportunity, in this work, we introduce a newly developed ""Monkeypox2022""

system. Although traditional optimization techniques, such as stochastic and
robust optimization approaches, could be used to address the OPF problem in the
face of renewable energy uncertainty, their effectiveness in dealing with
large-scale problems remains limited. As a result, deep learning techniques,

efficiency in solving large-scale OPF problems. However, the feasibility and
optimality of the solution may not be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose an
optimization model-informed generative adversarial network (MI-GAN) framework
to solve OPF under uncertainty. The main contributions are summarized into
three aspects: (1) to ensure feasibility and improve optimality of generated
solutions, three important layers are proposed: feasibility filter layer,
comparison layer, and gradient-guided layer; (2) in the GAN-based framework, an
efficient model-informed selector incorporating these three new layers is
established; and (3) a new recursive iteration algorithm is also proposed to
improve solution optimality. The numerical results on IEEE test systems show
that the proposed method is very effective and promising.

Instead of seeking a model and then performing control design, our method goes
directly from data to control. This allows us to robustify the control inputs

to calculate the optimal control sequence. We show that by incorporating a
proper uncertainty set, this min-max problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex

it with some existing nonlinear data-driven predictive control methods.

on four main elements, namely, 1) A multiple scattering strategy that
decomposes a given interior time-domain problem into a sequence of
limited-duration time-domain problems of scattering by overlapping open arcs,
each one of which is reduced (by means of the Fourier transform) to a sequence
of Helmholtz frequency-domain problems; 2) Boundary integral equations on
overlapping boundary patches for the solution of the frequency-domain problems
in point 1); 3) A smooth ""Time-windowing and recentering"" methodology that
enables both treatment of incident signals of long duration and long time
simulation; and, 4) A Fourier transform algorithm that delivers numerically
dispersionless, spectrally-accurate time evolution for given incident fields.
By recasting the interior time-domain problem in terms of a sequence of
open-arc multiple scattering events, the proposed approach regularizes the full
interior frequency domain problem-which, if obtained by either Fourier or
Laplace transformation of the corresponding interior time-domain problem, must
encapsulate infinitely many scattering events, giving rise to non-uniqueness
and eigenfunctions in the Fourier case, and ill conditioning in the Laplace
case. Numerical examples are included which demonstrate the accuracy and

agreement with experiments has not been achieved. For example, experimental
viscosity data exhibit qualitative differences in shear-thinning exponents,
shear rate for onset of shear-thinning and high-shear Newtonian plateaus
depending on polymer semiflexibility, contour length and solvent quality. While
polymer models are able to incorporate all of these effects through various
spring force laws, bending potentials, excluded volume (EV) potentials, and
hydrodynamic interaction (HI), the inclusion of each piece of physics has not
been systematically matched to experimentally observed behaviour. Furthermore,
attempts to develop multiscale models (in the sense of representing an
arbitrarily small or large polymer chain) which can make quantitative
predictions are hindered by the lack of ability to fully match the results of
bead-rod models, often used to represent a polymer chain at the Kuhn step
level, with bead-spring models, which take into account the entropic
elasticity.In light of these difficulties, this work aims to develop a general

Larson and coworkers [J. Chem. Phys. 124 (2006), 10.1063/1.2161210], which can
span the range from rigid rod to traditional entropic spring, as well as
include a bending potential, EV and HI. As we show, this model can reproduce,

yet, the effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. This is probably because
(1) we cannot obtain the batter's strategy and (2) it is difficult to estimate
the effect of the strategies. Here, we propose a new method for estimating the
effect using counterfactual batting simulation. To this end, we propose a deep
learning model that transforms batting ability when batting strategy is
changed. This method can estimate the effects of various strategies, which has
been traditionally difficult with actual game data. We found that, when the
switching cost of batting strategies can be ignored, the use of different

conditions for increasing runs were limited. Our validation results suggest
that our simulation could clarify the effect of using multiple batting

effective position-sensitive attention mechanism. In P2MAM, we also leverage
the estimate of users' prospective preferences to signify important items, and

P2MAM models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in six

run-time performance comparison demonstrates that during testing, P2MAM models
are much more efficient than the best baseline method, with a significant

systems. To this end, adaptive power allocation techniques can provide good
performance with low computational cost. This work presents novel robust and
adaptive power allocation technique for RS-based multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In particular, we develop a robust adaptive
power allocation based on stochastic gradient learning and the minimization of
the mean-square error between the transmitted symbols of the RS system and the
received signal. The proposed robust power allocation strategy incorporates
knowledge of the variance of the channel errors to deal with imperfect CSIT and
adjust power levels in the presence of uncertainty. An analysis of the
convexity and stability of the proposed power allocation algorithms is
provided, together with a study of their computational complexity and
theoretical bounds relating the power allocation strategies. Numerical results
show that the sum-rate of an RS system with adaptive power allocation
outperforms RS and conventional MU-MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT.

For general kernel functions, interpolation-based methods are widely used for

a fast hierarchical data reduction (HiDR) procedure with $O(n)$ complexity for
the memory-efficient construction of hierarchical matrices with nested bases
where $n$ is the number of data points. HiDR aims to reduce the given data in a
hierarchical way so as to obtain $O(1)$ representations for all nearfield and
farfield interactions. Based on HiDR, a linear complexity $\mathcal{H}^2$

enables {better efficiency than other general-purpose methods} and flexible
computation without accessing the kernel function. Experiments demonstrate
significantly improved memory efficiency of the proposed data-driven method
compared to interpolation-based methods over a wide range of kernels. Though
the method is not optimized for any special kernel, benchmark experiments for
the Coulomb kernel show that the proposed general-purpose algorithm offers
competitive performance for hierarchical matrix construction compared to
several state-of-the-art algorithms for the Coulomb kernel.

$\gtrsim2\times$ larger than the dust continuum and the rest-frame UV emission,
in agreement with recently reported measurements for $z\lesssim6$ galaxies.
Additionally, we compared the average [CII] size with $4<z<6$ galaxies observed
by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE). By
analysing [CII] sizes of $4<z<6$ galaxies in two redshift bins, we find an

initial perturbations that are not rotationally symmetric behaves
asymptotically like it does for rotationally-symmetric perturbations. In
particular, if we impose sinusoidal angular dependence on the initial

asymptotically lose their angular dependence -- becoming round -- and develop
Type-II bowl soliton singularities. As well, if we impose sinusoidal angular
dependence on the initial embeddings for perturbations sufficiently far from

interpolates between learning from expected backups and sampled backups. It has
been shown that intermediate values for the interpolation parameter $\sigma \in
[0,1]$ perform better in practice, and therefore it is commonly believed that
$\sigma$ functions as a bias-variance trade-off parameter to achieve these
improvements. In our work, we disprove this notion, showing that the choice of
$\sigma=0$ minimizes variance without increasing bias. This indicates that
$\sigma$ must have some other effect on learning that is not fully understood.
As an alternative, we hypothesize the existence of a new trade-off: larger
$\sigma$-values help overcome poor initializations of the value function, at
the expense of higher statistical variance. To automatically balance these
considerations, we propose Adaptive Tree Backup (ATB) methods, whose weighted
backups evolve as the agent gains experience. Our experiments demonstrate that
adaptive strategies can be more effective than relying on fixed or

this paper, we propose to restrict the perturbations to a small salient region

readily compatible with many existing black-box attacks and can significantly
improve their imperceptibility with little degradation in attack success rate.
Further, we propose the Saliency Attack, a new black-box attack aiming to

almost centralized based on one single machine, which are hard to address the
challenge due to the limited memory and computing resources. To address this
issue, we propose a distributed search solution for processing concurrent range
queries over moving objects in this work. Firstly, a Distributed Dynamic Index
(DDI) that consists of a global grid index and local dynamic M-ary tree indexes
was proposed to maintain the moving objects and support the search algorithm.
Next, a Distributed Range Query Algorithm (DRQA) was designed based on DDI,
which introduces an incremental search strategy to monitor the range queries as
objects evolve; during the process, it further designs a computation sharing
paradigm for processing multiple concurrent queries by making full use of their
common computation to decrease the search cost. Finally, three object datasets
with different distributions were simulated on a New York road network and
three baseline methods were introduced to more sufficiently evaluate the
performance of our proposal. Compared with state-of-the-art method, the initial
query cost of the DRQA algorithm reduces by $22.7\%$ and the incremental query

and a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. The first neural network is
responsible for learning the unknown dynamics. The second neural network aims
to identify a valid Lyapunov function and a provably stabilizing nonlinear
controller. The SMT solver then verifies that the candidate Lyapunov function
indeed satisfies the Lyapunov conditions. We provide theoretical guarantees of
the proposed learning framework in terms of the closed-loop stability for the

information from a 2D image can be used to provide location information of
auroras under study. The location modelling also suggests that the Earth's limb

observe faint auroras. Although imaging on a small satellite has some large
disadvantages compared with ground-based imaging (the camera cannot be

categories, is a fundamental computing problem of natural and artificial
information processing systems. Ideally, the performance of classifier models
would be evaluated using unambiguous data sets, where the 'correct' assignment
of category labels to the input data vectors is unequivocal. In real-world
problems, however, a significant fraction of actually occurring data vectors
will be located in a boundary zone between or outside of all categories, so
that perfect classification cannot even in principle be achieved. We derive the
theoretical limit for classification accuracy that arises from the overlap of
data categories. By using a surrogate data generation model with adjustable
statistical properties, we show that sufficiently powerful classifiers based on
completely different principles, such as perceptrons and Bayesian models, all
perform at this universal accuracy limit. Remarkably, the accuracy limit is not
affected by applying non-linear transformations to the data, even if these
transformations are non-reversible and drastically reduce the information
content of the input data. We compare emerging data embeddings produced by
supervised and unsupervised training, using MNIST and human EEG recordings
during sleep. We find that categories are not only well separated in the final
layers of classifiers trained with back-propagation, but to a smaller degree
also after unsupervised dimensionality reduction. This suggests that
human-defined categories, such as hand-written digits or sleep stages, can
indeed be considered as 'natural kinds'.

success by utilizing question to selectively target different visual areas that
are related to the answer. Existing visual attention models are generally
planar, i.e., different channels of the last conv-layer feature map of an image
share the same weight. This conflicts with the attention mechanism because CNN
features are naturally spatial and channel-wise. Also, visual attention models
are usually conducted on pixel-level, which may cause region discontinuous
problems. In this paper, we propose a Cubic Visual Attention (CVA) model by
successfully applying a novel channel and spatial attention on object regions
to improve VQA task. Specifically, instead of attending to pixels, we first
take advantage of the object proposal networks to generate a set of object
candidates and extract their associated conv features. Then, we utilize the
question to guide channel attention and spatial attention calculation based on
the con-layer feature map. Finally, the attended visual features and the
question are combined to infer the answer. We assess the performance of our
proposed CVA on three public image QA datasets, including COCO-QA, VQA and

rotational speed from 0 to 150 rpm, and y+ from 1.8 to 100. The relative
temperature difference is held constant at 0.1. Detailed velocity and

state, and a new criterion for boundary layer segmentation under rotation is
proposed. The applicability of boundary layer theory under the rotating state
is extended. The influence of Coriolis force and buoyancy on the velocity and
temperature distributions in the turbulent boundary layers are analyzed.
Coriolis force is found to play an important role in the behavior of the
boundary layer under rotation, as it shifts the velocity and temperature

according to the dominant force: viscous, Coriolis, or inertial. Under
non-isothermal conditions, buoyancy occurs. The buoyancy induced by the

effect increases with temperature difference. The variation of turbulent

prevent health risks and potential frauds in the food industry. Significant
improvements in sequencing technologies are pushing food profiling to become

too costly for food profiling.
  Our goal is to design a food profiler that solves the main limitations of
existing profilers, namely (1) working on massive data structures and (2)
incurring considerable data movement for a real-time monitoring system. To this
end, we propose Demeter, the first platform-independent framework for food
profiling. Demeter overcomes the first limitation through the use of
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and efficiently performs the accurate
few-species classification required in food profiling. We overcome the second
limitation by using an in-memory hardware accelerator for Demeter (named
Acc-Demeter) based on memristor devices. Acc-Demeter actualizes several
domain-specific optimizations and exploits the inherent characteristics of
memristors to improve the overall performance and energy consumption of
Acc-Demeter.

with many applications in probabilistic inference. Stein Variational Gradient
Descent (SVGD) has been shown to be a powerful method that iteratively updates
a set of particles to approximate the distribution of interest. Furthermore,
when analysing its asymptotic properties, SVGD reduces exactly to a
single-objective optimization problem and can be viewed as a probabilistic
version of this single-objective optimization problem. A natural question then
arises: ""Can we derive a probabilistic version of the multi-objective
optimization?"". To answer this question, we propose Stochastic Multiple Target
Sampling Gradient Descent (MT-SGD), enabling us to sample from multiple
unnormalized target distributions. Specifically, our MT-SGD conducts a flow of
intermediate distributions gradually orienting to multiple target
distributions, which allows the sampled particles to move to the joint
high-likelihood region of the target distributions. Interestingly, the
asymptotic analysis shows that our approach reduces exactly to the
multiple-gradient descent algorithm for multi-objective optimization, as
expected. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the
merit of our approach to multi-task learning.

frequency and voltage regulation of a solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel
generator(DG) based hybrid microgrid during islanding conditions. The DOBC is
integrated as a feed-forward control to the synchronous generator based DG,
which handles real-time power mismatches and regulates the microgrid frequency
and voltage under islanding. To substantiate the operational robustness of the
developed controller under real-time uncertainties arising due to variability
in PV output and load, the controller has been tested under worstcase
uncertainty conditions. The proposed controller has been developed as a
MATLAB/Simulink model and the results are validated on the real-time simulator
OPAL-RT. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has further been
validated in the presence of communication delays and noisy load conditions.
Results verify the dynamic performance of the controller in regulating the
system frequency and voltage for low-inertia microgrids. Finally, the proposed
control strategy has been implemented on laboratory scale microgrid setup in
which synchronous generator based diesel generator regulates system frequency
fast and efficiently under worst case uncertainty scenario.

appears ubiquitously in various stochastic dynamics of gene expression, both as
time-dependent distributions and the stationary distributions, underlying
independent events that give rise to such distributions have not been clear,
especially in the presence of the degradation of gene products, which is not a
Poisson process. I show that, in fact, the variable that follows the Poisson
distribution is the number of independent events where biomolecules are
created, which are destined to survive until the end of a given time duration.
This new viewpoint allows us to derive time-dependent Poisson distributions as
solutions of master equations for general class of protein production and
degradation dynamics, including models with time-dependent rates and a
non-Markovian model with delayed degradation. I then derive analytic forms of
general time-dependent probability distributions by combining the Poisson

high-precision method in computer vision for detecting individual animals of

existing deep-learning-based instance segmentation methods have been mostly
developed based on public datasets, which largely omit heavy occlusion

involving object occlusions, such as farrowing pen systems used on pig farms in
which the farrowing crates often impede the sow and piglets. In this paper, we
adapt a Center Clustering Network originally designed for counting to achieve
instance segmentation, dubbed as CClusnet-Inseg. Specifically, CClusnet-Inseg
uses each pixel to predict object centers and trace these centers to form masks
based on clustering results, which consists of a network for segmentation and
center offset vector map, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with

collected from three closed and three half-open farrowing crates to train and
validate our method. CClusnet-Inseg achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of
84.1 and outperforms all other methods compared in this study. We conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness
of core modules of our method. In addition, we apply CClusnet-Inseg to
multi-object tracking for animal monitoring, and the predicted object center

tackling the few-shot learning (FSL) problem. However, the meta-learner is
prone to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be
identified as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Moreover, when handling the
data with noisy labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label
noise on a corrupted dataset. To address these two challenges, we present
Eigen-Reptile (ER) that updates the meta-parameters with the main direction of
historical task-specific parameters to alleviate sampling and label noise.
Specifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of
the calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps instead of the
number of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main direction for
Eigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose
Introspective Self-paced Learning (ISPL). We have theoretically and
experimentally demonstrated the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed
Eigen-Reptile and ISPL. Particularly, our experiments on different tasks show
that the proposed method is able to outperform or achieve highly competitive

approximate MPE inference that is based on the incremental
build-infer-approximate (IBIA) framework. We use this framework to obtain an
ordered set of partitions of the Bayesian network and the corresponding
max-calibrated clique trees. We show that the maximum belief in the last
partition gives an estimate of the probability of the MPE assignment. We
propose an iterative algorithm for decoding, in which the subset of variables
for which an assignment is obtained is guaranteed to increase in every
iteration. There are no issues of convergence, and we do not perform a search
for solutions. Even though it is a single shot algorithm, we obtain valid
assignments in 100 out of the 117 benchmarks used for testing. The accuracy of
our solution is comparable to a branch and bound search in majority of the
benchmarks, with competitive run times.

apply this methodology to the case of the toggle switch, and by considering

noise-induced transitions. The system becomes bimodal in regions of the
parameter space where it would be deterministically monostable. We show that by
including higher order corrections our methodology allows one to obtain correct

between pretraining tasks and various downstream tasks. It freezes Pretrained
Language Models (PLMs) and only tunes a few task-related parameters (prompts)
for downstream tasks, greatly reducing the cost of tuning giant models. The key
enabler of this is the idea of querying PLMs with task-specific knowledge
implicated in prompts. This paper reveals a major limitation of existing
methods that the indiscriminate prompts for all input data in a task ignore the
intrinsic knowledge from input data, resulting in sub-optimal performance. We
introduce Instance-wise Prompt Tuning (IPT), the first prompt learning paradigm
that injects knowledge from the input data instances to the prompts, thereby
providing PLMs with richer and more concrete context information. We devise a
series of strategies to produce instance-wise prompts, addressing various
concerns like model quality and cost-efficiency. Across multiple tasks and
resource settings, IPT significantly outperforms task-based prompt learning
methods, and achieves comparable performance to conventional finetuning with
only 0.5% - 1.5% of tuned parameters.

Separately, recent findings have shown the importance of inertial effects for
particles of macroscopic size or in low-friction environments. We aim to
consolidate the previous findings into the general description of a
self-propelled asymmetric particle with inertia. We derive the Langevin

Numerical solutions of the Langevin equation show that, independently of the

inertial transition phase and converges to a circular helix. We discuss this
universal convergence with respect to the helical motion that many

development life cycle and different methods such as prototyping. Clinical
setting: This study designs an image exchange system in the private dental
sector of Urmia city using user-centered methods and prototyping. Methods:
Information was collected based on each stage's software development life
cycle. Interviews and observations were used to gather user-needs data, such as
object-oriented programming for developing a Prototype. Results: The users'
needs were determined to consider at the beginning. Ease of use, security, and
mobile apps were their most essential needs. Then, the prototype was designed
and evaluated in the focus group session. These steps continued until users
were satisfied in the focus group. Eventually, after the users' consent, the
prototype became the final system. Discussion: Instant access to Information,
volunteering, user interface design, and usefulness were the most critical
variables users considered. The advantage of this system also includes less
radiation to the patient due to not losing and missing the clips of the
patient's images. Conclusion: The success of such a system requires the
consideration of end-users needs and their application to the system. In
addition to this system, having an electronic health record can improve the

  via distributed or boundary actuation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2202.08801",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work concerns the exponential stabilization of underactuated linear
homogeneous systems of m parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) in
cascade (reaction diffusion systems), where only the first state is controlled
either internally or from the right boundary and when the diffusion
coefficients are distinct. For the distributed control case, a
proportional-type stabilizing control is given explicitly. After applying modal
decomposition, the stabilizing law is based on a transformation for the ODE
system corresponding to the comparatively unstable modes into a target one,
where calculation of the stabilization law is independent of the arbitrarily
large number of them. This is achieved by solving generalized Sylvester
equations recursively. For the boundary control case, under appropriate
sufficient condition on the coupling matrix (reaction term), the proposed
controller is dynamic. A dynamic extension technique via trigonometric change
of variables that places the control internally is first performed. Then, modal
decomposition is applied followed by a state transformation of the ODE system
to be stabilized in order to write it in a form where we can choose a dynamic
law. For both distributed and boundary control systems, a constructive and
scalable stabilization algorithm is proposed, as the choice of the controller
gains is independent of the number of unstable modes and it only relies on the
stabilization of the reaction term. The present approach solves the problem of
stabilization of underactuated systems, when in the presence of distinct
diffusion coefficients this is not directly solvable similarly to the scalar
PDE case.

generation communication also demands OFDM, since it is more spectrally
efficient and suitable for high data transmission. The drawback of the OFDM
includes peak to average power ratio and sensitivity to carrier offsets and
drifts. The usage of a non-linear power amplifier causes the signal spreading
and leads to inter-modulation and signal constellation distortion. These two
distortions have an impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and hence reduce the
efficiency. The methods used to reduce PAPR are clipping and filtering,
selective mapping, partial transmit sequence, tone reservation, and injection
and non-linear commanding. The drawbacks of the above methods are computational
complexity, spectrum inefficiency, increase in bit error rate and PAPR rate. In
this work, three effective methods are discussed and compared to improve the
performance parameters. These are adaptive peak window method based on
harmonize clipping, harmonics kernel adaptive filter and Slepian-based flat-top
window techniques are presented to reduce the BER, PAPR, and CCDF to improve
the signal-to-noise of the system. This window technique averages out the noise
spread out in the spectrum and thus reduces the signal loss by minimizing peak

has great potential in clinical practice. When writing a report,
ophthalmologists make inferences with prior clinical knowledge. This knowledge
has been neglected in prior medical report generation methods. To endow models
with the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal
clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in
which clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior
knowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge
Noise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general
biomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the
specific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for
knowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual
features from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design
an automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing
to obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training
reports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph
from the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features.
Then visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the
impact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal
features via a Transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
FFA-IR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CGT is able to outperform
previous benchmark methods and achieve state-of-the-art performances.

parameters that characterize aquifer properties and aquifer recharge. Aquifer
properties such as hydraulic conductivity can have an uncertainty spanning
orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, parameters used to configure model boundary
conditions can introduce additional uncertainty. In this study, the Morris
Method sensitivity analysis is performed on multiple quantities of interest to
assess the sensitivity of a steady-state groundwater flow model to uncertain
input parameters. The Morris Method determines which of these parameters are
less influential on model outputs. Uninfluential parameters can be set constant
during subsequent parameter optimization to reduce computational expense.
Combining multiple quantities of interest (e.g., RMSE, groundwater fluxes) when
performing both the Morris Method and parameter optimization offers a more
complete assessment of groundwater models, providing a more reliable and
physically consistent estimate of uncertain parameters. The parameter
optimization procedure also provides us an estimate of the residual uncertainty
in the parameter values, resulting in a more complete estimate of the remaining
uncertainty. By employing such techniques, the current study was able to
estimate the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate due to rice field
irrigation in a groundwater basin in Northern Italy, revealing that a
significant proportion of surficial aquifer recharge (approximately 81-94%)
during the later summer is due to the flood irrigation practices applied to
these fields.

contrasting different augmented views of images. Compared with supervised
learning, more aggressive augmentations have been introduced to further improve
the diversity of training pairs. However, aggressive augmentations may distort
images' structures leading to a severe semantic shift problem that augmented
views of the same image may not share the same semantics, thus degrading the
transfer performance. To address this problem, we propose a new SSL paradigm,
which counteracts the impact of semantic shift by balancing the role of weak
and aggressively augmented pairs. Specifically, semantically inconsistent pairs
are of minority and we treat them as noisy pairs. Note that deep neural
networks (DNNs) have a crucial memorization effect that DNNs tend to first
memorize clean (majority) examples before overfitting to noisy (minority)
examples. Therefore, we set a relatively large weight for aggressively
augmented data pairs at the early learning stage. With the training going on,
the model begins to overfit noisy pairs. Accordingly, we gradually reduce the
weights of aggressively augmented pairs. In doing so, our method can better
embrace the aggressive augmentations and neutralize the semantic shift problem.
Experiments show that our model achieves 73.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
with ResNet-50 for 200 epochs, which is a 2.5% improvement over BYOL. Moreover,

instabilities of the optimization dynamics that are restrained, i.e., localized
over iterations and regions of the weight tensor space. We do this by
presenting a theoretical framework using numerical analysis of partial

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that it is stable only under
certain conditions on the learning rate and weight decay. We show that rather
than blowing up when the conditions are violated, the instability can be
restrained. We show this is a consequence of the non-linear PDE associated with
the gradient descent of the CNN, whose local linearization changes when
over-driving the step size of the discretization, resulting in a stabilizing
effect. We link restrained instabilities to the recently discovered Edge of
Stability (EoS) phenomena, in which the stable step size predicted by classical
theory is exceeded while continuing to optimize the loss and still converging.
Because restrained instabilities occur at the EoS, our theory provides new
predictions about the EoS, in particular, the role of regularization and the

distinguishing inherent biological variability from instrument artifacts and
operating conditions. As a result, it is challenging to quantify uncertainty in

estimate uncertainty in measurement values on a per-event basis; and (IV)
extract the singlets that make up a multiplet. The key idea behind this

is almost always violated due to distribution shifts between environments.
Although valuable learning signals can be provided by heterogeneous data from
changing distributions, it is also known that learning under arbitrary
(adversarial) changes is impossible. Causality provides a useful framework for
modeling distribution shifts, since causal models encode both observational and
interventional distributions. In this work, we explore the sparse mechanism
shift hypothesis, which posits that distribution shifts occur due to a small
number of changing causal conditionals. Motivated by this idea, we apply it to
learning causal structure from heterogeneous environments, where i.i.d. data
only allows for learning an equivalence class of graphs without restrictive
assumptions. We propose the Mechanism Shift Score (MSS), a score-based approach
amenable to various empirical estimators, which provably identifies the entire
causal structure with high probability if the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis
holds. Empirically, we verify behavior predicted by the theory and compare
multiple estimators and score functions to identify the best approaches in
practice. Compared to other methods, we show how MSS bridges a gap by both
being nonparametric as well as explicitly leveraging sparse changes.

  likelihood",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper proposes a new feature screening method for the multi-response
ultrahigh dimensional linear model by empirical likelihood. Through a
multivariate moment condition, the empirical likelihood induced ranking
statistics can exploit the joint effect among responses, and thus result in a
much better performance than the methods considering responses individually.
More importantly, by the use of empirical likelihood, the new method adapts to
the heterogeneity in the conditional variance of random error. The sure
screening property of the newly proposed method is proved with the model size
controlled within a reasonable scale. Additionally, the new screening method is
also extended to a conditional version so that it can recover the hidden
predictors which are easily missed by the unconditional method. The
corresponding theoretical properties are also provided. Finally, both numerical
studies and real data analysis are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods.

Nezha bridges the gap between protocols such as Multi-Paxos and Raft, which can
be readily deployed and protocols such as NOPaxos and Speculative Paxos, that
provide better performance, but require access to technologies such as
programmable switches and in-network prioritization, which cloud tenants do not
have. Nezha uses a new multicast primitive called deadline-ordered multicast
(DOM). DOM uses high-accuracy software clock synchronization to synchronize
sender and receiver clocks. Senders tag messages with deadlines in synchronized
time; receivers process messages in deadline order, on or after their deadline.
  We compare Nezha with Multi-Paxos, Fast Paxos, Raft, a NOPaxos version we
optimized for the cloud, and 2 recent protocols, Domino and TOQ-EPaxos, that
use synchronized clocks. In throughput, Nezha outperforms all baselines by a
median of 5.4x (range: 1.9-20.9x). In latency, Nezha outperforms five baselines
by a median of 2.3x (range: 1.3-4.0x), with one exception: it sacrifices 33%
latency compared with our optimized NOPaxos in one test. We also prototype two
applications, a key-value store and a fair-access stock exchange, on top of
Nezha to show that Nezha only modestly reduces their performance relative to an
unreplicated system. Nezha is available at https://github.com/Steamgjk/Nezha.

shift in conversations surrounding the burden of diseases worldwide, welcoming
insights from multidisciplinary fields including digital health and artificial
intelligence. Africa faces a heavy disease burden that exacerbates the current
COVID-19 pandemic and limits the scope of public health preparedness, response,
containment, and case management. Herein, we examined the potential impact of
transformative digital health technologies in mitigating the global health
crisis with reference to African countries. Furthermore, we proposed
recommendations for scaling up digital health technologies and artificial
intelligence-based platforms to tackle the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and
enable equitable vaccine access. Challenges related to the pandemic are
numerous. Rapid response and management strategies - that is, contract tracing,
case surveillance, diagnostic testing intensity, and most recently vaccine
distribution mapping - can overwhelm the health care delivery system that is
fragile. Although challenges are vast, digital health technologies can play an
essential role in achieving sustainable resilient recovery and building back
better. It is plausible that African nations are better equipped to rapidly
identify, diagnose, and manage infected individuals for COVID-19, other
