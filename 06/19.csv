variant surveillance and the use of multi method approach to detect public
health preparedness. We are increasingly seeing a delay and disconnect of the
transmission of locally situated information to the hierarchical system for
making the overall preparedness and response more proactive than reactive for
dealing with emergencies such as 2014 Ebola. For our COVID-19, it is timely to
consider whether digital surveillance networks and support systems can be used
to bring the formal and community based ad hoc networks required for
facilitating the transmission of both strong (i.e., infections, confirmed
cases, deaths in hospital or clinic settings) and weak alters from the
community. This will allow timely detection of symptoms of isolated suspected
cases for making the overall surveillance and intervention strategy far more
effective. The use of digital surveillance networks can further contribute to
the development of global awareness of complex emergencies such as Ebola for
constructing information infrastructure required to develop, monitor and
analysis of community based global emergency surveillance in developed and
developing countries. In this study, a systematic analysis of the spread during
the months of March to October 2014 was performed using data from the Program
for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and the Factiva database. Using
digital surveillance networks, we aim to draw network connections of
individuals/groups from a localized to a globalized transmission of Ebola using
reported suspected/probable/confirmed cases at different locations around the
world. We argue that public health preparedness and response can be
strengthened by understanding the social network connections between responders
(such as local health authorities) and spreaders (infected individuals and
groups).

using the data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) is proposed and its
characteristics are investigated through numerical experiments. The data-driven
ROM is generated from the dataset of the wavefield using the singular value
decomposition. The spatially continuous seismic wavefield is reconstructed from
the sparse and discrete observation and the data-driven ROM. The observation
sites used for reconstruction are effectively selected by the sensor
optimization method for linear inverse problems based on a greedy algorithm.
The proposed framework was applied to simulation data of theoretical waveform
with the subsurface structure of the horizontally-stratified three layers. The
validity of the proposed method was confirmed by the reconstruction based on
the noise-free observation. Since the ROM of the wavefield is used as prior
information, the reconstruction error is reduced to an approximately lower
error bound of the present framework, even though the number of sensors used
for reconstruction is limited and randomly selected. In addition, the
reconstruction error obtained by the proposed framework is much smaller than
that obtained by the Gaussian process regression. For the numerical experiment
with noise-contaminated observation, the reconstructed wavefield is degraded
due to the observation noise, but the reconstruction error obtained by the
present framework with all available observation sites is close to a lower
error bound, even though the reconstructed wavefield using the Gaussian process
regression is fully collapsed. Although the reconstruction error is larger than
that obtained using all observation sites, the number of observation sites used
for reconstruction can be reduced while minimizing the deterioration and
scatter of the reconstructed data by combining it with the sensor optimization
method.

to demonstrate the role of the generalization properties of the substitute

the attack scheme to unobserved NN classifiers. To do this, we apply the
max-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the
generalization properties of the substitute NN in the success of the black-box
attack scheme in application to different NN classifiers. We prove theoretical
generalization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability
rates on training and test samples. Our bounds suggest that a substitute NN
with better generalization behavior could result in more transferable
adversarial examples. In addition, we show that standard operator norm-based
regularization methods could improve the transferability of the designed
adversarial examples. We support our theoretical results by performing several
numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute network's
generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples. Our empirical
results indicate the power of Lipschitz regularization methods in improving the

Kraken-like merger ($z=1.6$, $M_{\rm Tot} = 8\times10^{10}\,$M$_{\odot}$) is
gas-rich, deposits most of its mass in the inner $10\,$kpc, and is largely
isotropic. The Sausage-like merger ($z=1.14$, $M_{\rm Tot} =

higher energies, and has a radially anisotropic distribution. For the higher
redshift merger, the stellar mass ratio of the satellite to host galaxy is 1:3.
As a result, the chemistry of the remnant is indistinguishable from
contemporaneous in-situ populations, making it challenging to identify this
component through chemical abundances. This naturally explains why all
abundance patterns attributed so far to Kraken are in fact fully consistent
with the metal-poor in-situ so-called Aurora population and thick disc.
However, our model makes a falsifiable prediction: if the Milky Way underwent a
gas-rich double merger at high redshift, then this should be imprinted on its
star formation history with bursts about $\sim2\,$Gyrs apart. This may offer
constraining power on the highest-redshift major mergers.

texts. Starting from the prompt, these models generate a narrative that can
develop unpredictably. The existing methods of controllable text generation,
which guide the narrative in the text in the user-specified direction, require
creating a training corpus and an additional time-consuming training procedure.
The paper proposes and investigates Collocation2Text, a plug-and-play method
for automatic controllable text generation in Russian, which does not require
fine-tuning. The method is based on two interacting models: the autoregressive
language ruGPT-3 model and the autoencoding language ruRoBERTa model. The idea
of the method is to shift the output distribution of the autoregressive model
according to the output distribution of the autoencoding model in order to
ensure a coherent transition of the narrative in the text towards the guide
phrase, which can contain single words or collocations. The autoencoding model,
which is able to take into account the left and right contexts of the token,
""tells"" the autoregressive model which tokens are the most and least logical at
the current generation step, increasing or decreasing the probabilities of the
corresponding tokens. The experiments on generating news articles using the
proposed method showed its effectiveness for automatically generated fluent
texts which contain coherent transitions between user-specified phrases.

""target,"" which is called a first passage time (FPT). In some biological
systems involving multiple searchers, an important timescale is the time it
takes the slowest searcher(s) to find a target. For example, of the hundreds of
thousands of primordial follicles in a woman's ovarian reserve, it is the
slowest to leave that trigger the onset of menopause. Such slowest FPTs may
also contribute to the reliability of cell signaling pathways and influence the
ability of a cell to locate an external stimulus. In this paper, we use extreme
value theory and asymptotic analysis to obtain rigorous approximations to the
full probability distribution and moments of slowest FPTs. Though the results
are proven in the limit of many searchers, numerical simulations reveal that
the approximations are accurate for any number of searchers in typical
scenarios of interest. We apply these general mathematical results to models of
ovarian aging and menopause timing, which reveals the role of slowest FPTs for
understanding redundancy in biological systems. We also apply the theory to
several popular models of stochastic search, including search by diffusive,
subdiffusive, and mortal searchers.

representations by taking advantage of the eye anatomy information through a
multistream framework. Our proposed solution comprises two components, first a
network for isolating anatomical eye regions, and a second network for
multistream gaze estimation. The eye region isolation is performed with a U-Net
style network which we train using a synthetic dataset that contains eye region
masks for the visible eyeball and the iris region. The synthetic dataset used
in this stage is a new dataset consisting of 60,000 eye images, which we create
using an eye-gaze simulator, UnityEyes. Successive to training, the eye region
isolation network is then transferred to the real domain for generating masks
for the real-world eye images. In order to successfully make the transfer, we
exploit domain randomization in the training process, which allows for the
synthetic images to benefit from a larger variance with the help of
augmentations that resemble artifacts. The generated eye region masks along
with the raw eye images are then used together as a multistream input to our
gaze estimation network. We evaluate our framework on three benchmark gaze
estimation datasets, MPIIGaze, Eyediap, and UTMultiview, where we set a new
state-of-the-art on Eyediap and UTMultiview datasets by obtaining a performance
gain of 7.57% and 1.85% respectively, while achieving competitive performance
on MPIIGaze. We also study the robustness of our method with respect to the
noise in the data and demonstrate that our model is less sensitive to noisy
data. Lastly, we perform a variety of experiments including ablation studies to
evaluate the contribution of different components and design choices in our

professional sports events. However, apart from getting highly accurate
predictions on these sports events outcomes, it is necessary to answer
questions such as ""Why did the model predict that Team A would win Match X

required to provide high-quality interpretable, and understandable explanations

Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) approach to predict outcomes of
matches in the Brazilian volleyball League (SuperLiga). In the first phase, we
directly use the interpretable rule-based ML models that provide a global
understanding of the model's behaviors based on Boolean Rule Column Generation
(BRCG; extracts simple AND-OR classification rules) and Logistic Regression
(LogReg; allows to estimate the feature importance scores). In the second
phase, we construct non-linear models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
Deep Neural Network (DNN) to obtain predictive performance on the volleyball
matches' outcomes. We construct the ""post-hoc"" explanations for each data
instance using ProtoDash, a method that finds prototypes in the training
dataset that are most similar to the test instance, and SHAP, a method that
estimates the contribution of each feature on the model's prediction. We
evaluate the SHAP explanations using the faithfulness metric. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the explanations for the model's predictions.

challenges to Volt/VAr control problems in distribution networks. To this end,
this paper proposes an automatic self-adaptive local voltage control (ASALVC)
by locally controlling VAr outputs of distributed energy resources. In this
ASALVC strategy, each bus agent can locally and dynamically adjust its voltage
droop function in accordance with time-varying system changes. The voltage
droop function is associated with the bus-specific time-varying slope and
intercept, which can be locally updated, merely based on local voltage
measurements, without requiring communication. Stability, convergence, and
optimality properties of this local voltage control are analytically
established. In addition, the online implementation of ASALVC is further
proposed to address the real-time system changes by adjusting VAr outputs of
DERs online. Numerical test cases are performed to validate and demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of ASALVC.

moving away from the $\beta$-stability valley towards the proton dripline,
phenomena like very exotic decay modes such as $\beta$-delayed (multi-)
particle emission, and proton-, or two-proton radioactivity are encountered.
Landmark nuclei are here two isotopes with magic proton and neutron numbers,
$^{48}$Ni and $^{100}$Sn. Moreover, proton-rich nuclei ($N < Z$) display other
interesting features, like breaking of isospin symmetry with consequent
asymmetry in the energy spectra between mirror nuclei, the so-called
Thomas-Ehrmann shift, or the phenomenon of proton-halo. Last but not least,
nuclei close to the proton dripline play a very important role in

perturbations. They can be intentionally injected by attackers or naturally
exist in normally trained models. They have a different nature from the
traditional static and localized backdoors that can be triggered by perturbing
a small input area with some fixed pattern, e.g., a patch with solid color.
Existing defense techniques are highly effective for traditional backdoors.
However, they may not work well for pervasive backdoors, especially regarding
backdoor removal and model hardening. In this paper, we propose a novel model
hardening technique against pervasive backdoors, including both natural and
injected backdoors. We develop a general pervasive attack based on an
encoder-decoder architecture enhanced with a special transformation layer. The
attack can model a wide range of existing pervasive backdoor attacks and
quantify them by class distances. As such, using the samples derived from our
attack in adversarial training can harden a model against these backdoor
vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on 9 datasets with 15 model structures shows
that our technique can enlarge class distances by 59.65% on average with less
than 1% accuracy degradation and no robustness loss, outperforming five
hardening techniques such as adversarial training, universal adversarial
training, MOTH, etc. It can reduce the attack success rate of six pervasive
backdoor attacks from 99.06% to 1.94%, surpassing seven state-of-the-art
backdoor removal techniques.

through occlusions like smoke, fog, and dust. Unfortunately, current mmWave

constructs lidar-like point clouds from low resolution radar input. Enhancing

techniques due to the signal's sinc-like spreading pattern. We overcome these
challenges by training RadarHD on a large volume of raw I/Q radar data paired
with lidar point clouds across diverse indoor settings. Our experiments show
the ability to generate rich point clouds even in scenes unobserved during

However, speed and data reduction in many applications is equally important,
especially when the data scale and storage requirements increase rapidly.
Current MTSC algorithms need hundreds of compute hours to complete training and
prediction. This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data, which
grows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels.
In many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification
task; hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and
thus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for
channel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a
prototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype
distance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable
better separation between classes; hence, channels with the higher distance
between class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA Multivariate Time Series
Classification (MTSC) benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve
significant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of
classification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step
before training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70\% of
computation time and data storage, with preserved accuracy. Furthermore, our
methods enable even efficient classifiers, such as ROCKET, to achieve better
accuracy than using no channel selection or forward channel selection. To
further study the impact of our techniques, we present experiments on
classifying synthetic multivariate time series datasets with more than 100
channels, as well as a real-world case study on a dataset with 50 channels. Our
channel selection methods lead to significant data reduction with preserved or

structural characteristics of a graph. Then we design a meta-graph that
represents the relations among models and graphs, and develop a graph
meta-learner operating on the meta-graph, which estimates the relevance of each
model to different graphs. Through extensive experiments, we show that using
AutoGML to select a method for the new graph significantly outperforms
consistently applying popular methods as well as several existing

large peculiar velocities. We measured peculiar velocities of SBN central stars
to assess their kinematics relative to the general O star population using
$Gaia$ EDR3 data for 267 SBN central stars and a sample of 455 Galactic O stars
to derive projected velocities $v_{\rm 2D}$. For a subset of each sample we
obtained new optical spectroscopy to measure radial velocities and identify
multiple-star systems. We find a minimum multiplicity fraction of 36$\pm$6%
among SBN central stars, consistent with $>$28% among runaway Galactic O stars.
The large multiplicity fraction among runaways implicates very efficient
dynamical ejection rather than binary-supernova origins. The median $v_{\rm
2D}$ of SBN central stars is $v_{\rm 2D}$=14.6 km s$^{-1}$, larger than the
median $v_{\rm 2D}$=11.4 km s$^{-1}$ for non-bowshock O stars. Central stars of
SBNe have a runaway ($v_{\rm 2D}$$>$25 km s$^{-1}$) fraction of
24$^{+9}_{-7}$%, consistent with the 22$^{+3}_{-3}$% for control-sample O
stars. Most (76%) of SBNe central stars are not runaways. Our analysis of
alignment ($\Delta_{\rm PA}$) between the nebular morphological and $v_{\rm

($\sigma_{PA}$=25$^\circ$) population that includes stars with the largest
$v_{\rm 2D}$ (31% of the sample) and a random (non-aligned) population (69% of
the sample). SBNe that lie within or near HII regions comprise a larger

with application in disease mapping using the interaction types 1,2,3, and 4.
When we account for the spatiotemporal interactions in disease-mapping models,
inference becomes more useful in revealing unknown patterns in the data.
However, when the number of locations and/or the number of time points is
large, the inference gets computationally challenging due to the high number of
required constraints necessary for inference, and this holds for various
inference architectures including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA). We re-formulate INLA approach
based on dense matrices to fit the intrinsic spatiotemporal models with the
four interaction types and account for the sum-to-zero constraints, and discuss
how the new approach can be implemented in a high-performance computing
framework. The computing time using the new approach does not depend on the
number of constraints and can reach a 40-fold faster speed compared to INLA in
realistic scenarios. This approach is verified by a simulation study and a real
data application, and it is implemented in the R package INLAPLUS and the
Python header function: inla1234().

time given exact knowledge of an initial state, they are also in many cases
rapidly mixing, meaning that smooth probabilistic information (quantified by
measures) on the system's state has negligible value for predicting the
long-term future. However, an understanding of the long-term predictive value
of intermediate kinds of probabilistic information is necessary in various
physical problems, and largely remains lacking.
  Of particular interest in data assimilation and linear response theory are
the conditional measures of the SRB measure on zero sets of general smooth
functions of the phase space. In this paper we give rigorous and numerical
evidence that such measures generically converge back under the dynamics to the
full SRB measures, exponentially quickly. We call this property conditional
mixing. We will prove that conditional mixing holds in a class of generalised
baker's maps, and demonstrate it numerically in some non-Markovian piecewise
hyperbolic maps. Conditional mixing provides a natural limit on the
effectiveness of long-term forecasting of chaotic systems via partial

model non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, we consider a family of the

  https://github.com/Jianf-Wang/GBDL",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, several Bayesian deep learning methods have been proposed for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Although they have achieved
promising results on medical benchmarks, some problems are still existing.
Firstly, their overall architectures belong to the discriminative models, and
hence, in the early stage of training, they only use labeled data for training,
which might make them overfit to the labeled data. Secondly, in fact, they are
only partially based on Bayesian deep learning, as their overall architectures
are not designed under the Bayesian framework. However, unifying the overall
architecture under the Bayesian perspective can make the architecture have a
rigorous theoretical basis, so that each part of the architecture can have a
clear probabilistic interpretation. Therefore, to solve the problems, we
propose a new generative Bayesian deep learning (GBDL) architecture. GBDL
belongs to the generative models, whose target is to estimate the joint
distribution of input medical volumes and their corresponding labels.
Estimating the joint distribution implicitly involves the distribution of data,
so both labeled and unlabeled data can be utilized in the early stage of
training, which alleviates the potential overfitting problem. Besides, GBDL is
completely designed under the Bayesian framework, and thus we give its full
Bayesian formulation, which lays a theoretical probabilistic foundation for our
architecture. Extensive experiments show that our GBDL outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in terms of four commonly used evaluation indicators
on three public medical datasets.

Tur\'an type extremal problem aims to study the Tur\'an number of fixed graphs.
In 2010, Nikiforov \cite{Nik2} proposed analogously a spectral Tur\'an type
problem which asks to determine the maximum spectral radius of an
$\mathcal{F}$-free graph with $n$ vertices. It attracts much attention and many
such problems remained elusive open even after serious attempts, and so they
are considered as one of the most intriguing problems in spectral extremal
graph theory. It is interesting to consider another spectral Tur\'an type
problem which asks to determine the maximum spectral radius of an
$\mathcal{F}$-free graph with $m$ edges. Denote by $\mathcal{G}(m,\mathcal{F})$
the set of $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs with $m$ edges having no isolated
vertices. Each of the graphs among $\mathcal{G}(m,\mathcal{F})$ having the
largest spectral radius is called a maximal graph. Let $\theta_{p,q,r}$ be a
theta graph formed by connecting two distinct vertices with three independent
paths of length $p,q$ and $r,$ respectively (length refers to the number of

Terminology is carefully described and is polarity independent; thus the review
applies to both field electron and field ion emitters. It also applies more
generally to charged, pointed electron-conductors that exhibit the
""electrostatic lightning-rod effect"", but are poorly discussed in general
electricity and magnetism literature. Modern electron-conductor electrostatics
is an application of the chemical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of
electrons. The review focuses chiefly on the electrostatics of two common basic
emitter forms: the needle-shaped emitters used in traditional projection
technologies; and the post-shaped emitters often used in modelling large-area
multi-emitter electron sources. In the post-on-plane context, we consider in
detail both the electrostatics of the single post and the interaction between
two identical posts that occurs as a result of electrostatic depolarization
(often called ""screening"" or ""shielding""). Core to the review are discussions
of the ""minimum domain dimensions"" method for implementing effective
finite-element-method electrostatic simulations, and of the variant that leads
to very precise estimates of dimensionless field enhancement factors (error
typically less than 0.001 % in situations where analytical comparisons exist).
Brief outline discussions, and core references, are given for each of many
""related considerations"" that are relevant to the electrostatic situations,
methods and results described. Many areas of field emitter electrostatics are

communication scenarios, namely the transmit power limited case and the
transmit energy limited case are considered, where the device's rearranged
order, time and power allocation, as well as dynamic IRS beamforming patterns
over time are jointly optimized to minimize the sum transmission delay. To shed
light on the superiority of the proposed IRS-aided hybrid MA (I-HMA) protocol
over conventional protocols, the conditions under which I-HMA outperforms
I-TDMA and I-NOMA are revealed by characterizing their corresponding optimal
solution. Then, a computationally efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the
high-quality solution to the corresponding optimization problems. Simulation
results validate our theoretical findings, demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed design, and draw some useful insights. Specifically, it is found that
the proposed protocol can significantly reduce the sum delay by combining the
additional gain of dynamic IRS beamforming with the high spectral efficiency of
NOMA, which thus reveals that integrating IRS into the proposed HMA protocol is
an effective solution for delay-aware optimization. Furthermore, it reveals
that the proposed design reduces the time consumption not only from the
system-centric view, but also from the device-centric view.

convict and incarcerate people. In a large number of cases each year, the
government makes these consequential decisions based on evidence from
statistical software -- such as probabilistic genotyping, environmental audio

criminal legal system, which relies on the defense's ability to probe and test
the prosecution's case to safeguard individual rights.
  Responding to this need to adversarially scrutinize output from such

examine the validity of evidentiary statistical software. We define and
operationalize this notion of robust adversarial testing for defense use by
drawing on a large body of recent work in robust machine learning and

process for scrutinizing such tools and empowers defense lawyers to examine
their validity for instances most relevant to the case at hand. We further
discuss existing structural and institutional challenges within the U.S.

such audit frameworks and close with a discussion on policy changes that could

Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Using resume data of over
ten million Chinese online job seekers in 2015, we study the current gender pay
gap in China. The results show that on average women only earned 71.57\% of
what men earned in China. The gender pay gap exists across all age groups and
educational levels. Contrary to the commonly held view that developments in
education, economy, and a more open culture would reduce the gender pay gap,
the fusion analysis of resume data and socio-economic data presents that they
have not helped reach the gender pay equality in China. China seems to be stuck
in a place where traditional methods cannot make further progress. Our analysis
further shows that 81.47\% of the variance in the gender pay gap can be
potentially attributed to discrimination. In particular, compared with the
unmarried, both the gender pay gap itself and proportion potentially attributed
to discrimination of the married are larger, indicating that married women
suffer greater inequality and more discrimination than unmarried ones. Taken
together, we suggest that more research attention should be paid to the effect
of discrimination in understanding gender pay gap based on the family
constraint theory. We also suggest the Chinese government to increase
investment in family-supportive policies and grants in addition to female

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods are widely used to estimate the

the performance of MLE solvers is significantly affected by the initialization
(i.e., initial guess of the solution or solution search space). To address
this, a previous study proposed the semidefinite programming (SDP)-based MLE
initialization. However, the performance of the SDP-based initialization
technique is largely affected by the shadowing variance and geometric diversity
between the target and receivers. In this study, a radio frequency (RF)
fingerprinting-based MLE initialization is proposed. Further, a maximum
likelihood problem for target localization combining RF fingerprinting is
formulated. In the three test environments of open space, urban, and indoor,
the proposed RF fingerprinting-aided target localization method showed a
performance improvement of up to 63.31% and an average of 39.13%, compared to

\emph{barren plateau} in quantum machine learning created by quantum physicists
in \cite{mcclean2018barren} for the flatness of the loss function landscape
during gradient descent. We address a novel theoretical understanding of those
two phenomena in light of the theory of neural tangent kernels. For noiseless
quantum circuits, without the measurement noise, the loss function landscape is
complicated in the overparametrized regime with a large number of trainable
variational angles. Instead, around a random starting point in optimization,
there are large numbers of local minima that are good enough and could minimize
the mean square loss function, where we still have quantum laziness, but we do
not have barren plateaus. However, the complicated landscape is not visible
within a limited number of iterations, and low precision in quantum control and
quantum sensing. Moreover, we look at the effect of noises during optimization
by assuming intuitive noise models, and show that variational quantum
algorithms are noise-resilient in the overparametrization regime. Our work
precisely reformulates the quantum barren plateau statement towards a precision
statement and justifies the statement in certain noise models, injects new hope

Ground state ab-initio study demonstrated an increase in the number and radius
of indents, raising the number of stretched bonds. Consequently, the volume
covered by the HOMO iso-surface increases, and that of LUMO decreases. That
makes higher area/volume available to lose/share electrons, resulting in
stronger interlocking between layers and tip. And TD-DFT calculation proves the
existence of interfacial excitons, resulting in stronger interlocking between
the layer's surface and tip despite a contraction in the LUMO iso-surfaces'
area/volume. We believe these interlayer excitons result in higher average
Z-axis(hence frictional force) reaction forces for the indents number subcases

equations (PDEs) on arbitrary domains without requiring a computational mesh.
Common approaches integrate differential operators in training neural networks
using a structured loss function. The most common training algorithm for neural
networks is backpropagation which relies on the gradient of the loss function
with respect to the parameters of the network. In this work, we characterize
the difficulty of training neural networks on physics by investigating the
impact of differential operators in corrupting the back propagated gradients.
Particularly, we show that perturbations present in the output of a neural
network model during early stages of training lead to higher levels of noise in
a structured loss function that is composed of high-order differential
operators. These perturbations consequently corrupt the back-propagated
gradients and impede convergence. We mitigate this issue by introducing
auxiliary flux parameters to obtain a system of first-order differential
equations. We formulate a non-linear unconstrained optimization problem using
the augmented Lagrangian method that properly constrains the boundary
conditions and adaptively focus on regions of higher gradients that are
difficult to learn. We apply our approach to learn the solution of various
benchmark PDE problems and demonstrate orders of magnitude improvement over
existing approaches.

exports, and job creation, which ultimately contribute to improving the quality
of life. The presence of manufacturing defects is, however, inevitable leading
to products being discarded, i.e. scrapped. In some cases, defective products
can be repaired through rework. Scrap and rework cause a longer completion
time, which can contribute to orders being shipped late. Moreover, the presence
of uncertainties and combinatorial complexity significantly increases the
difficulty of complex manufacturing scheduling. This paper tackles this
challenge, exemplified by a case study on stochastic job-shop scheduling in
low-volume, high-variety manufacturing contexts. To ensure on-time delivery,
high-quality solutions are required, and near-optimal solutions must be
obtained within strict time constraints to ensure smooth operations on the
job-shop floor. To efficiently solve the stochastic job-shop scheduling (JSS)
problem, a recently-developed Surrogate ""Level-Based"" Lagrangian Relaxation is
used to reduce computational effort while efficiently exploiting the geometric
convergence potential inherent to Polyak's stepsizing formula thereby leading
to fast convergence. Numerical testing demonstrates that the new method is two
orders of magnitude faster as compared to commercial solvers.

outstanding success in playing complex video games that allow huge

improve the sample efficiency and thus reduce the errors, model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL) is believed to be a promising direction, which
builds environment models in which the trial-and-errors can take place without
real costs. In this survey, we take a review of MBRL with a focus on the recent
progress in deep RL. For non-tabular environments, there is always a
generalization error between the learned environment model and the real
environment. As such, it is of great importance to analyze the discrepancy
between policy training in the environment model and that in the real
environment, which in turn guides the algorithm design for better model
learning, model usage, and policy training. Besides, we also discuss the recent
advances of model-based techniques in other forms of RL, including offline RL,
goal-conditioned RL, multi-agent RL, and meta-RL. Moreover, we discuss the
applicability and advantages of MBRL in real-world tasks. Finally, we end this
survey by discussing the promising prospects for the future development of
MBRL. We think that MBRL has great potential and advantages in real-world
applications that were overlooked, and we hope this survey could attract more

functionality for business process management. Over the years, the problem has
been addressed for different types of process data, i.e., process models,
process event data at runtime, and event logs representing historical
execution. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle compliance checking
over process logs. These approaches have been based on different data models
and storage technologies including relational databases, graph databases, and
proprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising
direction that turns several process analytics tasks into queries on the
underlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In
this paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to
guarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important
due to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, compliance checking
would benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are
added, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly
to optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two
encoding methods using graph representation, realized in Neo4J, and show the
benefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed order
compliance rules. Compared to a baseline encoding, our experiments show up to
5x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3x reduction in the graph size.

the large amount of existing work on fairness-aware machine learning in the
(semi-)supervised and unsupervised settings, the fairness issue is largely
under-explored in the aforementioned Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL)
context, where it is usually more severe. In this paper, to alleviate this
tension, we propose a fairness-aware PUL method named FairPUL. In particular,
for binary classification over individuals from two populations, we aim to
achieve similar true positive rates and false positive rates in both
populations as our fairness metric. Based on the analysis of the optimal fair
classifier for PUL, we design a model-agnostic post-processing framework,
leveraging both the positive examples and unlabeled ones. Our framework is
proven to be statistically consistent in terms of both the classification error
and the fairness metric. Experiments on the synthetic and real-world data sets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art in both PUL and
fair classification.

orbital hybridization between conduction $s$ electron and localized $d$

these similarities imply closely correlated losses that may confound standard

context of nested bandits, a class of adversarial multi-armed bandit problems
where the learner seeks to minimize their regret in the presence of a large
number of distinct alternatives with a hierarchy of embedded
(non-combinatorial) similarities. In this setting, optimal algorithms based on
the exponential weights blueprint (like Hedge, EXP3, and their variants) may
incur significant regret because they tend to spend excessive amounts of time
exploring irrelevant alternatives with similar, suboptimal costs. To account
for this, we propose a nested exponential weights (NEW) algorithm that performs
a layered exploration of the learner's set of alternatives based on a nested,
step-by-step selection method. In so doing, we obtain a series of tight bounds
for the learner's regret showing that online learning problems with a high
degree of similarity between alternatives can be resolved efficiently, without
a red bus / blue bus paradox occurring.

Cycles 19-24 has only one peak in its power spectrum at the period 10.95 years,

We show that the PC2 of the CR is essential in explaining the differences in
the intensities of the even and odd cycles of the CR. The odd cycles have
positive phase in the first half and negative phase in the second half of their
PC2. This leads to slow decrease of the intensity in the beginning of the cycle
and at minimum for the odd cycles. On the contrary, for the even cycles the
phases are vice versa and this leads to faster decrease and more rapid recovery
in the CR intensity of the cycle. As a consequence the even cycles have more
peak-like structure. The only exceptions of this rule are Cycles 23 and 24 such
the former has almost zero line PC2, and the latter has similar PC2 than the
earlier odd cycles. These results are confirmed with skewness-kurtosis (S-K)

attention due to its powerful adaptation capability in the unseen data domain.
However, existing solutions often neglect either crossing cameras (e.g.,
illumination and resolution differences) or pedestrian misalignments (e.g.,
viewpoint and pose discrepancies), which easily leads to poor generalization
capability when adapted to the new domain. In this paper, we formulate these
difficulties as: 1) Camera-Camera (CC) problem, which denotes the various human
appearance changes caused by different cameras; 2) Camera-Person (CP) problem,
which indicates the pedestrian misalignments caused by the same identity person
under different camera viewpoints or changing pose. To solve the above issues,
we propose a Bi-stream Generative Model (BGM) to learn the fine-grained
representations fused with camera-invariant global feature and
pedestrian-aligned local feature, which contains an encoding network and two
stream decoding sub-networks. Guided by original pedestrian images, one stream
is employed to learn a camera-invariant global feature for the CC problem via
filtering cross-camera interference factors. For the CP problem, another stream
learns a pedestrian-aligned local feature for pedestrian alignment using
information-complete densely semantically aligned part maps. Moreover, a
part-weighted loss function is presented to reduce the influence of missing
parts on pedestrian alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale

variation is accompanied by the clear spectral variation, which is
characterized as a soft log-parabola spectrum in the low-flux state and a hard
power-law spectrum in the bright flares. The variability amplitude of X-rays is
lower than that of gamma-rays, and no correlation of variability between
gamma-rays and X-rays is observed. Fitting the broadband spectral energy
distribution during a GeV outburst with a multi-zone leptonic model, we show
that the GeV gamma-rays are attributed to the external Compton process while
the X-rays are hybrid of several components. The predicted TeV gamma-ray flux

the scene and tracking them across a sequence of frames. Computing
detection-based measures like the F-measure on a frame-by-frame basis is not
sufficient to assess the overall performance, as it does not interpret
performance in the temporal domain. The main evaluation metric available comes
from Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods to benchmark performance on datasets
such as KITTI with the recently proposed higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA)
metric, which is capable of providing a better description of the performance
over metrics such as MOTA, DetA, and IDF1. While the HOTA metric takes into
account temporal associations, it does not provide a tailored means to analyse
the spatial associations of a dataset in a multi-camera setup. Moreover, there
are differences in evaluating the detection task for points when compared to
objects (point distances vs. bounding box overlap). Therefore in this work, we
propose a multi-view higher order tracking metric (mvHOTA) to determine the
accuracy of multi-point (multi-instance and multi-class) tracking methods,
while taking into account temporal and spatial associations.mvHOTA can be
interpreted as the geometric mean of detection, temporal, and spatial
associations, thereby providing equal weighting to each of the factors. We
demonstrate the use of this metric to evaluate the tracking performance on an
endoscopic point detection dataset from a previously organised surgical data
science challenge. Furthermore, we compare with other adjusted MOT metrics for
this use-case, discuss the properties of mvHOTA, and show how the proposed

To improve the OOD sensitivity of deep networks, several state-of-the-art
methods introduce samples from other real-world datasets as OOD samples to the
training process and assign manually-determined labels to these OOD samples.
However, they sacrifice the classification accuracy because the unreliable
labeling of OOD samples would disrupt ID classification. To balance ID
generalization and OOD detection, a major challenge to tackle is to make OOD
samples compatible with ID ones, which is addressed by our proposed
\textit{supervision adaptation} method in this paper to define adaptive
supervision information for OOD samples. First, by measuring the dependency
between ID samples and their labels through mutual information, we reveal the
form of the supervision information in terms of the negative probabilities of
all classes. Second, after exploring the data correlations between ID and OOD
samples by solving multiple binary regression problems, we estimate the
supervision information to make ID classes more separable. We perform

consider the problem of sampling from the log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta)

from its applications to Bayesian inference and differentially private
learning. Our main result is a generalization of the Dikin walk Markov chain to
this setting that requires at most $O((md + d L^2 R^2) \times md^{\omega-1})
\log(\frac{w}{\delta}))$ arithmetic operations to sample from $\pi$ within
error $\delta>0$ in the total variation distance from a $w$-warm start. Here
$L$ is the Lipschitz-constant of $f$, $K$ is contained in a ball of radius $R$
and contains a ball of smaller radius $r$, and $\omega$ is the
matrix-multiplication constant. Our algorithm improves on the running time of
prior works for a range of parameter settings important for the aforementioned
learning applications. Technically, we depart from previous Dikin walks by
adding a ""soft-threshold"" regularizer derived from the Lipschitz or smoothness
properties of $f$ to the log-barrier function for $K$ that allows our version
of the Dikin walk to propose updates that have a high Metropolis acceptance
ratio for $f$, while at the same time remaining inside the polytope $K$.

corresponding ground truth labels in the training phase without differentiating
out-of-distribution samples from in-distribution ones. This results from the
assumption that all samples are independent and identically distributed without
distributional distinction. Therefore, a pretrained network learned from the
in-distribution samples treats out-of-distribution samples as in-distribution
and makes high-confidence predictions on them in the test phase. To address
this issue, we draw out-of-distribution samples from the vicinity distribution
of training in-distribution samples for learning to reject the prediction on
out-of-distribution inputs. A \textit{Cross-class Vicinity Distribution} is
introduced by assuming that an out-of-distribution sample generated by mixing
multiple in-distribution samples does not share the same classes of its
constituents. We thus improve the discriminability of a pretrained network by
finetuning it with out-of-distribution samples drawn from the cross-class
vicinity distribution, where each out-of-distribution input corresponds to a
complementary label. Experiments on various in-/out-of-distribution datasets
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in

learning is a popular strategy for leveraging additional data to improve the

be challenging. Neural Data Server (NDS), a search engine that recommends
relevant data for a given downstream task, has been previously proposed to
address this problem. NDS uses a mixture of experts trained on data sources to
estimate similarity between each source and the downstream task. Thus, the
computational cost to each user grows with the number of sources. To address
these issues, we propose Scalable Neural Data Server (SNDS), a large-scale

relevant ML data to end users. SNDS trains the mixture of experts on
intermediary datasets during initialization, and represents both data sources

computational cost incurred by SNDS users remains fixed as new datasets are
added to the server. We validate SNDS on a plethora of real world tasks and
find that data recommended by SNDS improves downstream task performance over
baselines. We also demonstrate the scalability of SNDS by showing its ability
to select relevant data for transfer outside of the natural image setting.

minimum label-sensitive information as in-distribution samples. According to
the different informativeness properties of in- and out-of-distribution

distribution-discriminative representations that are weakly related to the
labeling of in-distribution samples and combines label- and

graphs raises critical privacy concerns, as they encode private information
about the social interactions among individuals. In this paper, we design,
implement, and evaluate PrivGED, a new system aimed at privacy-preserving
analytics over decentralized social graphs. PrivGED focuses on the support for
eigendecomposition, one popular and fundamental graph analytics task producing
eigenvalues/eigenvectors over the adjacency matrix of a social graph and
benefits various practical applications. PrivGED is built from a delicate
synergy of insights on graph analytics, lightweight cryptography, and
differential privacy, allowing users to securely contribute their local views
on a decentralized social graph for a cloud-based eigendecomposition analytics
service while gaining strong privacy protection. Extensive experiments over
real-world social graph datasets demonstrate that PrivGED achieves accuracy

The condensation of monopole can trigger a direct Neel $\leftrightarrow$ VBS

a generalization of the deconfined quantum critical point in (2+1)-D. In this
theory, there exist two deconfined phases where the Neel/VBS hedgehogs are
massive but cost finite energy. This leads to two fractionalized phases with

formal verification and synthesis over symbolic models and then carry the
results back over unknown original systems. In our data-driven setting, we
first cast the required conditions for constructing ABF as a robust

the existence of unknown models in the constraints of ROP. To tackle this
difficulty, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of unknown
systems and propose a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the

of SOP and ROP, we formally construct ABF between unknown systems and their
symbolic models based on the number of data and a required confidence level. We
verify the effectiveness of our data-driven results over two physical case

  Evaluating Open-Domain Dialogue","7 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation is a crucial component of dialogue
systems. Recently, learning-based evaluation metrics have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in open-domain dialogue evaluation. However, these
metrics, which only focus on a few qualities, are hard to evaluate dialogue
comprehensively. Furthermore, these metrics lack an effective score composition
approach for diverse evaluation qualities. To address the above problems, we
propose a Multi-Metric Evaluation based on Correlation Re-Scaling (MME-CRS) for
evaluating open-domain dialogue. Firstly, we build an evaluation metric
composed of 5 groups of parallel sub-metrics called Multi-Metric Evaluation
(MME) to evaluate the quality of dialogue comprehensively. Furthermore, we
propose a novel score composition method called Correlation Re-Scaling (CRS) to
model the relationship between sub-metrics and diverse qualities. Our approach
MME-CRS ranks first on the final test data of DSTC10 track5 subtask1 Automatic
Open-domain Dialogue Evaluation Challenge with a large margin, which proved the
effectiveness of our proposed approach.

the universal covering of a Cauchy surface of a nonsingular universe with a

the affine size of a nonsingular universe, defined through the affine length of
null geodesics, is bounded above. In the case where a part of the nonsingular

find that this upper bound can be understood as the affine size of the

the use of differential-geometric methods arising from K\""ahler metrics on
$\mathcal H \times \mathbb C$ invariant under the action of the semi-direct
product ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb R) \ltimes \mathbb R^2$. To a properly chosen
geometric model $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ of ${\bf E}$ as an elliptic surface and
a non-torsion holomorphic section $\sigma: B \to \mathcal E$ there is an
associated ``verticality'' $\eta_\sigma$ of $\sigma$ related to the locally
defined Betti map. The first-order linear differential equation satisfied by
$\eta_\sigma$, expressed in terms of invariant metrics, is made use of to count
the zeros of $\eta_\sigma$, in the case when the regular locus $B^0\subset B$
of $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ admits a classifying map $f_0$ into a modular curve
for elliptic curves with level-$k$ structure, $k \ge 3$, explicitly and
linearly in terms of the degree of the ramification divisor $R_{f_0}$ of the
classifying map, and the degree of the log-canonical line bundle of $B^0$ in
$B$. Our method highlights ${\rm deg}(R_{f_0})$ in the estimates, and recovers
the effective estimate obtained by a different method of Ulmer-Urz\'ua on the
multiplicities of the Betti map associated to a non-torsion section, noting
that the finiteness of zeros of $\eta_\sigma$ was due to
Corvaja-Demeio-Masser-Zannier. The role of $R_{f_0}$ is natural in the subject
given that in the case of an elliptic modular surface there is no non-torsion
section by a theorem of Shioda, for which a differential-geometric proof had
been given by the first author. Our approach sheds light on the study of

sequential decision problem is solved by dueling double deep Q-learning
(dueling DDQL). Then, federated learning is applied to learn the relatively

which alleviates over-consumption of bandwidth resources and avoids direct

complex fluids by large shear flows has been studied extensively, the effects
of applied strains on the dielectric properties of macromolecular aggregates
has received far less attention. Simultaneous rheology and dielectric
experiments can be employed to study the dynamics of sheared colloidal
suspensions over spatiotemporal scales spanning several decades.
  Experiments: Using a precision impedance analyzer, we study the dielectric
behavior of strongly sheared aqueous suspensions of thermoreversible hydrogel
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) particles at different temperatures. We
also perform stress relaxation experiments to uncover the influence of large
deformations on the bulk mechanical moduli of these suspensions.
  Findings: The real parts of the complex dielectric permittivities of all the
sheared PNIPAM suspensions exhibit distinct relaxation processes in the low and
high frequency regimes. At a temperature below the lower consolute solution
temperature (LCST), both real and imaginary parts of the permittivities of
highly dense PNIPAM suspensions decrease with increase in applied oscillatory
strain amplitudes. Simultaneously, we note a counter-intuitive slowdown of the
dielectric relaxation dynamics. Contrary to our rheo-dielectric findings, our
bulk rheology experiments, performed under identical conditions, reveal
shear-thinning dynamics with increasing strain amplitudes. We propose the
shear-induced rupture of fragile clusters of swollen PNIPAM particles to
explain our observations.

random permutations of $n$ integers is deeply related to random matrix theory.
In a seminal work, Baik, Deift and Johansson provided an asymptotics in terms
of the distribution of the scaled largest level of the large matrix limit of
GUE. As a numerical approximation, however, this asymptotics is inaccurate for
small $n$ and has a slow convergence rate, conjectured to be just of order
$n^{-1/3}$. Here, we suggest a different type of approximation, based on
Hayman's generalization of Stirling's formula. Such a formula gives already a
couple of correct digits of the length distribution for $n$ as small as $20$
but allows numerical evaluations, with a uniform error of apparent order
$n^{-2/3}$, for $n$ as large as $10^{12}$; thus closing the gap between a table
of exact values (compiled for up to $n=1000$) and the random matrix limit.
Being much more efficient and accurate than Monte-Carlo simulations, the
Stirling-type formula allows for a precise numerical understanding of the first
few finite size correction terms to the random matrix limit. From this we
derive expansions of the expected value and variance of the length, exhibiting
several more terms than previously put forward.

AA'AA'... stacking is energetically preferred among all interlayer sliding
geometries for progressively added layers up to N=6. Lattice relaxations
enhance electron-hole asymmetry, and reduce the magic angles with respect to
calculations with fixed tunneling strengths that we quantify from few layers to
bulk AT-graphite. Without a perpendicular electric field, the largest magic
angle flat-band states locate around the middle following the largest
eigenvalue eigenstate in a 1D-chain model of layers, while the density
redistributes to outer layers for smaller magic twist angles corresponding to
higher order effective bilayers in the 1D chain. A perpendicular electric field
decouples the electronic structure into $N$ Dirac bands with renormalized Fermi
velocities with distinct even-odd band splitting behaviors, showing a gap for
N=4 while for odd layers a Dirac cone remains between the flat band gaps. The
magic angle error tolerance estimated from density of states maxima expand
progressively from $0.05^{\circ}$ in t2G to up to $0.2^{\circ}$ in AT-graphite,
hence allowing a greater flexibility in multilayers. Decoupling of tNG into t2G
with different interlayer tunneling proportional to the eigenvalues of a 1D
layers chain allows to map tNG-multilayers bands onto those of periodic bulk
AT-graphite's at different $k_z$ values. We also obtain the Landau level
density of states in the quantum Hall regime for magnetic fields of up to 50~T
and confirm the presence of nearly flat bands around which we can develop
suppressed density of states gap regions by applying an electric field in N > 3

using the method of transfer learning. The hyperspectral dataset is
preprocessed to a lower dimension using PCA, then deep learning models are
applied to it for the purpose of classification. The features learned by this
model are then used by the transfer learning model to solve a new
classification problem on an unseen dataset. A detailed comparison of CNN and
multiple MLP architectural models is performed, to determine an optimum
architecture that suits best the objective. The results show that the scaling
of layers not always leads to increase in accuracy but often leads to
overfitting, and also an increase in the training time.The training time is
reduced to greater extent by applying the transfer learning approach rather
than just approaching the problem by directly training a new model on large

requires a large amount of simulated data which can be costly to collect,
resulting in a chicken-egg dilemma and limiting its usage in solving PDEs. To
jump out of the dilemma, we propose a general data-free paradigm where the
neural network directly learns physics from the mean squared residual (MSR)
loss constructed by the discretized PDE. We investigate the physical
information in the MSR loss and identify the challenge that the neural network
must have the capacity to model the long range entanglements in the spatial
domain of the PDE, whose patterns vary in different PDEs. Therefore, we propose
the low-rank decomposition network (LordNet) which is tunable and also
efficient to model various entanglements. Specifically, LordNet learns a
low-rank approximation to the global entanglements with simple fully connected
layers, which extracts the dominant pattern with reduced computational cost.
The experiments on solving Poisson's equation and Navier-Stokes equation
demonstrate that the physical constraints by the MSR loss can lead to better
accuracy and generalization ability of the neural network. In addition, LordNet
outperforms other modern neural network architectures in both PDEs with the
fewest parameters and the fastest inference speed. For Navier-Stokes equation,
the learned operator is over 50 times faster than the finite difference

  based on CNN",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyper-spectral images are images captured from a satellite that gives spatial
and spectral information of specific region.A Hyper-spectral image contains
much more number of channels as compared to a RGB image, hence containing more
information about entities within the image. It makes them well suited for the
classification of objects in a snap. In the past years, the efficiency of
hyper-spectral image recognition has increased significantly with deep
learning. The Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP)
has demonstrated to be an excellent process of classifying images. However,
they suffer from the issues of long training time and requirement of large
amounts of the labeled data, to achieve the expected outcome. These issues
become more complex while dealing with hyper-spectral images. To decrease the
training time and reduce the dependence on large labeled data-set, we propose
using the method of transfer learning.The features learned by CNN and MLP
models are then used by the transfer learning model to solve a new
classification problem on an unseen dataset. A detailed comparison of CNN and
multiple MLP architectural models is performed, to determine an optimum
architecture that suits best the objective. The results show that the scaling
of layers not always leads to increase in accuracy but often leads to
over-fitting, and also an increase in the training time.The training time is
reduced to greater extent by applying the transfer learning approach rather
than just approaching the problem by directly training a new model on large
data-sets, without much affecting the accuracy.

noise fail to explore efficiently in some reinforcement learning tasks and yet,
they perform well in many others. In fact, in practice, they are often selected
as the top choices, due to their simplicity. But, for what tasks do such
policies succeed? Can we give theoretical guarantees for their favorable
performance? These crucial questions have been scarcely investigated, despite
the prominent practical importance of these policies. This paper presents a
theoretical analysis of such policies and provides the first regret and
sample-complexity bounds for reinforcement learning with myopic exploration.
Our results apply to value-function-based algorithms in episodic MDPs with
bounded Bellman Eluder dimension. We propose a new complexity measure called
myopic exploration gap, denoted by alpha, that captures a structural property
of the MDP, the exploration policy and the given value function class. We show
that the sample-complexity of myopic exploration scales quadratically with the
inverse of this quantity, 1 / alpha^2. We further demonstrate through concrete
examples that myopic exploration gap is indeed favorable in several tasks where
myopic exploration succeeds, due to the corresponding dynamics and reward
structure.

dependencies, developers have to regularly pull in new third-party code through
frequent updates. However, without a proper review of every incoming change,
vulnerable and malicious code can sneak into the codebase through these
dependencies. The goal of this study is to aid developers in securely accepting
dependency updates by measuring if the code changes in an update have passed
through a code review process. We implement Depdive, an update audit tool for
packages in Crates.io, npm, PyPI, and RubyGems registry. Depdive first (i)
identifies the files and the code changes in an update that cannot be traced
back to the package's source repository, i.e., \textit{phantom artifacts}; and
then (ii) measures what portion of changes in the update, excluding the phantom
artifacts, has passed through a code review process, i.e., \textit{code review
coverage}.
  Using Depdive, we present an empirical study across the latest ten updates of
the most downloaded 1000 packages in each of the four registries. We further
evaluated our results through a maintainer agreement survey. We find the
updates are typically only partially code-reviewed (52.5\% of the time).
Further, only 9.0\% of the packages had all their updates in our data set fully
code-reviewed, indicating that even the most used packages can introduce
non-reviewed code in the software supply chain. We also observe that updates
either tend to have high \textit{CRC} or low \textit{CRC}, suggesting that
packages at the opposite end of the spectrum may require a separate set of

control is utilized as a common technique which can choose the proper bitrate

method, QuDASH is proposed by taking advantage of the emerging quantum
technology. In QuDASH, the adaptive control model is developed using the
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which aims at increasing
the average bitrate and decreasing the video rebuffering events to maximize the
user quality of experience (QoE). Then, the control model is solved by Digital
Annealer, which is a quantum-Inspired computing technology. The evaluation of
the proposed method is carried out by simulation with the measured throughput
traces in real world. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed QuDASH
method has better performance in terms of QoE compared with other advanced ABR
methods. In 68.2% of the examined cases, QuDASH achieves the highest QoE
results, which shows the superiority of the QuDASH over conventional methods.

  We determine the structure of the right nucleus of $S_f$ when the polynomial

study compares Millennials with their previous generation (Gen Xers) in terms
of their automobile travel across different neighborhood patterns. At the age
of 16 to 28 years old, Millennials have lower daily personal vehicle miles
traveled and car trips than Gen Xers in urban (higher-density) and suburban
(lower-density) neighborhoods. Such differences remain unchanged after
adjusting for the socio-economic, vehicle ownership, life cycle, year-specific
and regional-specific factors. In addition, the associations between
residential density and automobile travel for the 16- to 28-year-old
Millennials are flatter than that for Gen Xers, controlling for the
aforementioned covariates. These generational differences remain for the 24- to
36-year-old Millennials, during the period when the U.S. economy was recovering
from the recession. These findings show that, in both urban and suburban
neighborhoods, Millennials in the U.S. are less auto-centric than the previous
generation during early life stages, regardless of economic conditions. Whether
such difference persists over later life stages remains an open question and is
worth continuous attention.

gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). Using U.S. nationwide travel surveys
for 2001 and 2017, this study examines the non-linear dose-response effects of
lifecycle, socio-demographic and residential factors on daily driving distances
of Millennial and Gen-X young adults. Holding all other factors constant,
Millennial young adults had shorter predicted daily driving distances than
their Gen-X counterparts. Besides, residential and economic factors explain
around 50% of young adults' daily driving distances, while the collective
contributions for life course events and demographics are about 33%. This study
also identifies the density ranges for formulating effective land use policies

crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost,
and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection
solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the
domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework,
namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can
efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic
control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with
twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can
quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A
well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for
evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes
layout with 18.7\% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151
probes and 49.2\% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also
apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS
achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided
solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and
optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems. Our source codes

was reported almost a century ago (Fraser 1924). The multi-generational,
transoceanic migration circuit spanning from India to Africa is an astonishing
feat for an inches-long insect. Wind, precipitation, fuel, breeding, and life
cycle affect the migration, yet understanding of their collective role in the
migration remains elusive. We identify the transoceanic migration route by
imposing a time constraint emerging from energetics on Djikstra's path-planning
algorithm. Energetics calculations reveal a Pantala flavescens can endure 90
hours of steady flight at 4.5m/s. We incorporate active wind compensation in
Djikstra's algorithm to compute the migration route from years 2002 to 2007.
The prevailing winds play a pivotal role; a direct crossing of the Indian Ocean
from Africa to India is feasible with the Somali Jet, whereas the return
requires stopovers in Maldives and Seychelles. The migration timing, identified
using monthly-successful trajectories, life cycle, and precipitation data,
corroborates reported observations. Finally, our timely sighting in
Cherrapunji, India (25.2N 91.7E) and a branched network hypothesis connect the
likely origin of the migration in North-Eastern India with Pantala flavescens's
arrival in South-Eastern India with the retreating monsoons; a clue to their
extensive global dispersal.

a straight line, but this leads to systematic errors such as an underestimation

traveller, as these have been used before successfully in ecological research.
We find an explicit expression for the distance travelled in terms of some

feedback control to enable single-molecule spectroscopy of freely diffusing
particles in native or near-native environments. A number of different
RT-FD-SPT approaches exist, and comparisons between methods based on
experimental results are of limited use due to differences in samples and
setups. In this study, we used statistical calculations and dynamical
simulations to directly compare the performance of different methods. The
methods considered were the orbital method, the Knight`s Tour (grid scan)
method and MINFLUX, and we considered both fluorescence-based and
interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approaches. There is a fundamental trade-off
between precision and speed, with the Knight`s Tour method being able to track
the fastest diffusion but with low precision, and MINFLUX being the most
precise but only tracking slow diffusion. To compare iSCAT and fluorescence,
different biological samples were considered, including labeled and
intrinsically fluorescent samples. The success of iSCAT as compared to
fluorescence is strongly dependent on the particle size and the density and
photophysical properties of the fluorescent particles. Using a wavelength for
iSCAT that is negligibly absorbed by the tracked particle allows an increased
illumination intensity, which results in iSCAT providing better tracking for
most samples. This work highlights the fundamental aspects of performance in
RT-FD-SPT and should assist with the selection of an appropriate method for a
particular application. The approach used can easily be extended to other
RT-FD-SPT methods.

of quaternions to describe the physical quantities of electromagnetic fields.
The contemporary scholars utilize the quaternions and octonions to research the
physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The
application of octonions is able to study the physical quantities of
electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the octonion field
strength, field source, linear moment, angular moment, torque and force. When
the octonion force is equal to zero, it is capable of achieving eight
independent equations, including the force equilibrium equation, fluid
continuity equation, current continuity equation, and second-precession
equilibrium equation and others. One of inferences derived from the
second-precession equilibrium equation is that the electric current and
derivative of electric moments are able to excite each other. The external
derivative of electric moments can induce the electric currents. Meanwhile the
external electric currents are capable of inducing the derivative of electric
moments. The research states that this inference can be considered as the
underlying mechanism for the direct and inverse piezoelectric effects. Further
the second-precession equilibrium equation is able to predict several new
influencing factors of direct and inverse piezoelectric effects.
