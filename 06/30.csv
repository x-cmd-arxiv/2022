features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by
finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light
cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies
have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most
experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in
the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in
nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study
reveals an optimal light cone to limit the information propagation in
interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the
spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump
together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson
number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a
provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The
results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide
the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.

executes the same decision-making process. This form of decentralization does
not scale well because the same data are stored on each network node, and
because all nodes must validate each transaction prior to their confirmation.
One solution approach decomposes the nodes of a blockchain network into subsets
called ""shards"", each shard processing and storing disjoint sets of
transactions in parallel. To fully benefit from the parallelism of sharded
blockchains, the processing load of shards must be evenly distributed. However,
the problem of computing balanced workloads is theoretically hard and further
complicated in practice as transaction processing times are unknown prior to be
assigned to shards. In this paper we introduce a dynamic workload-balancing
algorithm where the allocation strategy of transactions to shards is
periodically adapted based on the recent workload history of shards. Our
algorithm is an adaptation to sharded blockchains of a consensus-based
load-balancing algorithm. It is a fully distributed algorithm inline with
network based applications such as blockchains. Some preliminary results are
reported based on simulations that shard transactions of three well-known

clouds and moisture around the mean state in a minimal-physics, large-eddy
simulation of the undisturbed period during BOMEX on a large ($O(100)$ km)
domain. Small, spatial anomalies in latent heating in cumulus clouds, which
form on top of small moisture fluctuations, give rise to circulations that
transport moisture, but not heat, from dry to moist regions, and thus reinforce
the latent heating anomaly. We frame this positive feedback as a linear
instability in mesoscale moisture fluctuations, whose time-scale depends only
on i) a vertical velocity scale and ii) the mean environment's vertical
structure. In our minimal-physics setting, we show both ingredients are
provided by the shallow cumulus convection itself: It is intrinsically unstable
to length scale growth. The upshot is that energy released by clouds at
kilometre scales may play a more profound and direct role in shaping the
mesoscale trade-wind environment than is generally appreciated, motivating
further research into the mechanism's relevance.

deuteron charge and Friar radii, which can help one to judge how well a form
factor parametrisation describes the low-virtuality properties of the deuteron.
We also evaluate the higher-order $2\gamma$-exchange contributions in $\mu$D,
generated by the single-nucleon structure and expected to be the most important
terms beyond N3LO. The uncertainty of the theoretical result is dominated by
the truncation of the pionless EFT series and is quantified using a Bayesian
approach. The resulting extractions of the deuteron charge radius from the
$\mu$D Lamb shift, the $2S-1S$ transition in D, and the $2S-1S$
hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift, with the respective $2\gamma$-exchange
effects evaluated in a unified pionless EFT approach, are in perfect agreement.

optimizer (LLSO) for solving large-scale portfolio optimization problems. Our
goal is to maximize a modified formulation of the Sharpe ratio subject to
cardinality, box and budget constraints. The algorithm involves a projection
operator to deal with these three constraints simultaneously and we implicitly
control transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint. We also introduce
a suitable exact penalty function to manage the turnover constraint. In
addition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars
in the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three
large-scale data sets, show that the inclusion of this procedure improves the
accuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO
algorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding
performance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and
solution quality. Finally, we assess the profitability of the portfolio
allocation strategy in the last five years using an investible pool of 1119

code review, such sub-optimal implementations have chances to be timely
resolved during the review process before the code is merged. Therefore, we
could consider them as Potential Technical Debt (PTD) since PTD will evolve
into TD when it is injected into software systems without being resolved. To
date, little is known about the extent to which PTD is identified in code
reviews. To this end, we conducted an exploratory study in an attempt to
understand the nature of PTD in code reviews and track down the resolution of
PTD after being identified. We randomly collected 2,030 review comments from
the Nova project of OpenStack and the Qt Base project of Qt. We then manually
checked these review comments, and obtained 163 PTD-related review comments for
further analysis. Our results show that: (1) PTD can be identified in code
reviews but is not prevalent. (2) Design, defect, documentation, requirement,
test, and code PTD are identified in code reviews, in which code and
documentation PTD are the dominant. (3) 81.0% of the PTD identified in code
reviews has been resolved by developers, and 78.0% of the resolved TD was
resolved by developers within a week. (4) Code refactoring is the main practice
used by developers to resolve the PTD identified in code reviews. Our findings
indicate that: (1) review-based detection of PTD is seen as one of the
trustworthy mechanisms in development, and (2) there is still a significant
proportion of PTD (19.0%) remaining unresolved when injected into the software

developed and validated a force field that reliably models the modes of
coordination bonds via a Morse potential functional form and employs cationic

set of physically relevant collective variables and carefully selected an
appropriate subset for our problem at hand. After a rapid increase of the Zn-N
connectivity, we observe the evaporation of small clusters in favor of a few
large clusters, that lead to the formation of an amorphous highly-connected
aggregate. Zn(MIm)42- and Zn(MIm)3- complexes are observed, with lifetimes in
the order of a few picoseconds, while larger structures, such as 4-, 5- and
6-membered rings, have substantially longer lifetimes of a few nanoseconds. The
free ligands act as ``templating agents'' for the formation of the sodalite
cages. ZIF-8 crystal decomposition results in the formation of a vitreous

synthesis that paves the way to controlling synthesis products. Furthermore,
our developed force field and methodology can be applied to model solution

functions of constellations on surfaces in which two full sets of degrees

  We give the spectral curve (the ""disk"" function $W_{0,1}$, and the ""cylinder""

2-matrix model which corresponds to $G(z)=1+z$, by the addition of arbitrarily

combinatorial proof of Eynard's result by slice decompositions, which is strong
enough to handle the polynomial case, and on algebraic arguments.
  Building on this, we establish the topological recursion (TR) for the model.
Our proof relies on the fact that TR is already known at time zero (or,
combinatorially, when the underlying graphs have only boundaries, and no
internal faces) by work of Bychkov-Dunin-Barkowski-Kazarian-Shadrin (or
Alexandrov-Chapuy-Eynard-Harnad for the polynomial case), and on the general

readily understood as a quasi-periodic oscillation. The X-ray light curve
instead shows clear behavior of a highly asynchronous polar (AP) or stream-fed

one-pole and two-pole accretion, and another in which accretion alternates
fully between two poles. The spin periods in these two models are 0.0455 days

beat period between spin and orbit is 0.231 days or 0.462 days. Brief
absorption events seen in light curve are spaced in a way that may favor the
longer spin and beat periods. These periods are confirmed and refined using

accompanied by the presence of high-order diabolic points (DPs). Interestingly,

Using this connection, we obtain upper and lower bounds on risk in terms of the

polynomially, the bounds converge to within a constant factor of two. As an
application, we analyze the population risk of the one-inclusion graph

detections analyzed in previous work represents a small minority (<10%) of
possible z ~ 2 MOSDEF targets. It is therefore crucial to understand how
representative this high S/N subsample is, while also more fully exploiting the
MOSDEF spectroscopic sample. Using spectral-energy-distribution (SED) models
and rest-optical spectral stacking, we compare the MOSDEF z ~ 2 high S/N
subsample with the full MOSDEF sample of z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies with
redshifts, the latter representing an increase in sample size of more than a
factor of three. We find that both samples have similar emission-line

local star-forming sequence on the [N II] BPT diagram. There are small
differences in median host galaxy properties, including the stellar mass (M_*),
star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR), and UVJ colors; however,
these offsets are minor considering the wide spread of the distributions. Using
SED modeling, we also demonstrate that the sample of z ~ 2 star-forming

of available such targets. We conclude that previous MOSDEF results on the
evolution of star-forming galaxy emission-line properties were unbiased
relative to the parent z ~ 2 galaxy population.

gravity and turbulent pressure. We find that the hydrostatic prediction using
the total turbulent velocity dispersion (as one would measure from kpc-scale

The hydrostatic prediction using the velocity dispersion between the centroids

existence of non-relativistic outflows accompanying TDEs. The interaction of

quasi-perpendicular shocks in the presence of toroidal magnetic fields. Because
of the large shock obliquity and large outflow velocity, we find that the shock
acceleration induced by TDE outflows generally leads to a steep particle energy

APEC and APEC+APEC models, by alternatively excluding the L and K bands, and
derive the fractional difference of the metal abundances, $\Delta Z/Z$, as
indication of the consistency between K- and L-shell-derived measurements. The
$\Delta Z/Z$ distribution is then studied as a function of the cluster radius,
ring temperature and X-ray flux. The L-induced systematics, measured through an
individual fit of each MOS and pn spectrum, remain constant at a 5 - 6% value

endowed with an additional attractive long-range clump-matter fifth force
significantly stronger than gravity (but evading known fifth-force

that, for example, a clump-matter fifth-force $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than

differ in normalization. The normalization is given by the ratio of hadronic

can be hidden by unknown branching rates. This holds for Drell-Yan,
$\gamma\gamma$ fusion, and $gg$ fusion, as well as observables at LO and NLO in

In this work, we perform numerical evolutions of a binary neutron star merger
with the SFHo finite-temperature EoS, as well as with the M*-approximation of
this same EoS, where the approximation uses the zero-temperature,
beta-equilibrium slice of SFHo and replaces the finite-temperature and
composition-dependent parts with the M*-model. We find that the approximate
version of the EoS is able to accurately recreate the temperature and thermal
pressure profiles of the binary neutron star remnant, when compared to the
results found using the full version of SFHo. We additionally find that the
merger dynamics and gravitational wave signals agree well between both cases,
with differences of ~1-2% introduced into the post-merger gravitational wave
peak frequencies by the approximations of the EoS. We conclude the M*-framework
can be reliably used to probe neutron star merger properties in numerical
simulations.

selected using effective temperatures and surface gravities from the GSP-Spec
module, and are expected to trace stellar populations of different typical age.
The cool (old) giants exhibit a relatively smooth radial metallicity gradient
with an azimuthal dependence. Binning in Galactic azimuth $\phi$, the slope
gradually varies from $d$[M/H]$/dR \sim -0.054$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $\phi \sim
-20^{\circ}$ to $\sim -0.035$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $\phi \sim 20^{\circ}$. On the
other hand, the relatively hotter (and younger) stars present remarkable
inhomogeneities, apparent as three (possibly four) metal-rich elongated
features in correspondence of the spiral arms' locations in the Galactic disc.
When projected onto Galactic radius, those features manifest themselves as
statistically significant bumps on top of the observed radial metallicity
gradients with amplitudes up to $ \sim 0.05-0.1$ dex, making the assumption of
a linear radial decrease not applicable to this sample. The strong correlation
between the spiral structure of the Galaxy and the observed chemical pattern in
the young sample indicates that the spiral arms might be at the origin for the
detected chemical inhomogeneities. In this scenario, the spiral arms would
leave in the younger stars a strong signature, which progressively disappears
when cooler (and older) giants are considered.

us to collect an increasing amount of omics data. Classification based on omics

usually has a limited sample size but high feature dimensions, and it is
assumed that only a few features (biomarkers) are active, i.e. informative to
discriminate between different categories (cancer subtypes,
responder/non-responder to treatment, for example). Identifying active
biomarkers for classification has therefore become fundamental for omics data
analysis. Focusing on binary classification, we propose an innovative feature
selection method aiming at dealing with the high correlations between the
biomarkers. Various research has shown the notorious influence of correlated
biomarkers and the difficulty of accurately identifying active ones. Our
method, WLogit, consists in whitening the design matrix to remove the
correlations between biomarkers, then using a penalized criterion adapted to
the logistic regression model to select features. The performance of WLogit is
assessed using synthetic data in several scenarios and compared with other
approaches. The results suggest that WLogit can identify almost all active
biomarkers even in the cases where the biomarkers are highly correlated, while
the other methods fail, which consequently leads to higher classification
accuracy. The performance is also evaluated on the classification of two
Lymphoma subtypes, and the obtained classifier also outperformed other methods.
Our method is implemented in the \texttt{WLogit} R package available from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

Similar to previous studies, we find that the bulge exhibits a strong vertical

distribution functions appear at b < -5. We can discern a metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~
-0.3) and metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ +0.2) abundance distribution that each show
clear systematic trends with latitude, and may be best understood by changes in
the bulge's star formation/enrichment processes. Both groups exhibit asymmetric
tails, and as a result we argue that the proximity of a star to either peak in
[Fe/H] space is not necessarily an affirmation of group membership. The
metal-poor peak shifts to lower [Fe/H] values at larger distances from the
plane while the metal-rich tail truncates. Close to the plane, the metal-rich
tail appears broader along the minor axis than in off-axis fields. We also
posit that the bulge has two metal-poor populations -- one that belongs to the
metal-poor tail of the low latitude and predominantly metal-rich group, and
another belonging to the metal-poor group that dominates in the outer bulge. We
detect the X-shape structure in fields with |Z| > 0.7 kpc and for stars with
[Fe/H] > -0.5. Stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 may form a spheroidal or ""thick bar""

  Cautionary Tale",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The success of DNNs is driven by the counter-intuitive ability of
over-parameterized networks to generalize, even when they perfectly fit the
training data. In practice, test error often continues to decrease with
increasing over-parameterization, referred to as double descent. This allows
practitioners to instantiate large models without having to worry about
over-fitting. Despite its benefits, however, prior work has shown that
over-parameterization can exacerbate bias against minority subgroups. Several
fairness-constrained DNN training methods have been proposed to address this
concern. Here, we critically examine MinDiff, a fairness-constrained training
procedure implemented within TensorFlow's Responsible AI Toolkit, that aims to
achieve Equality of Opportunity. We show that although MinDiff improves
fairness for under-parameterized models, it is likely to be ineffective in the
over-parameterized regime. This is because an overfit model with zero training
loss is trivially group-wise fair on training data, creating an ""illusion of
fairness,"" thus turning off the MinDiff optimization (this will apply to any
disparity-based measures which care about errors or accuracy. It won't apply to
demographic parity). Within specified fairness constraints, under-parameterized
MinDiff models can even have lower error compared to their over-parameterized
counterparts (despite baseline over-parameterized models having lower error).
We further show that MinDiff optimization is very sensitive to choice of batch
size in the under-parameterized regime. Thus, fair model training using MinDiff
requires time-consuming hyper-parameter searches. Finally, we suggest using
previously proposed regularization techniques, viz. L2, early stopping and
flooding in conjunction with MinDiff to train fair over-parameterized models.

of expressing a Feynman diagram is Fourier transformed into momentum space, the
momentum associated with each function $\Delta^+(x-y)$ is on-shell, and is only
conserved at each vertex if an energy is attributed to the contributions of the
time-ordering functions. The resulting expression is analogous to what
Kadyshevsky had obtained by deriving an alternate expansion for the
$S$--matrix. A detailed explanation of how this alternate expansion is derived
is given, and it is shown how it provides a straightforward way of determining
the imaginary part of a Feynman diagram, which makes it useful when using
unitarity methods for computing a Feynman diagram. By considering a number of
specific Feynman diagrams in self-interacting scalar models and in QED, we show

And what about the Hessian of a convex function? These questions have clear
answers in terms of (co)vector/matrix valued measures if the manifold is the
Euclidean space. In more general curved contexts, the same objects can be
perfectly understood via charts. However, charts are often unavailable in the
less regular setting of metric geometry, where still the questions make sense.
  In this paper we propose a way to deal with this sort of problems and, more
generally, to give a meaning to a concept of `measure acting in duality with
sections of a given bundle', loosely speaking. Despite the generality, several
classical results in measure theory like Riesz's and Alexandrov's theorems have
a natural counterpart in this setting. Moreover, as we are going to discuss,
the notions introduced here provide a unified framework for several key
concepts in nonsmooth analysis that have been introduced more than two decades
ago, such as: Ambrosio-Kirchheim's metric currents, Cheeger's Sobolev functions
and Miranda's BV functions.
  Not surprisingly, the understanding of the structure of these objects
improves with the regularity of the underlying space. We are particularly
interested in the case of $\RCD$ spaces where, as we will argue, the regularity
of several key measures of the type we study nicely matches the known
regularity theory for vector fields, resulting in a very effective theory.
  We expect that the notions developed here will help creating stronger links
between differential calculus in Alexandrov spaces (based on Perelman's DC
charts) and in $\RCD$ ones (based on intrinsic tensor calculus).

  Speech Synthesis based on Disentanglement between Prosody and Timbre","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language
  Processing",,,,"eess.AS cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The capability of generating speech with specific type of emotion is desired
for many applications of human-computer interaction. Cross-speaker emotion
transfer is a common approach to generating emotional speech when speech with
emotion labels from target speakers is not available for model training. This
paper presents a novel cross-speaker emotion transfer system, named iEmoTTS.
The system is composed of an emotion encoder, a prosody predictor, and a timbre
encoder. The emotion encoder extracts the identity of emotion type as well as
the respective emotion intensity from the mel-spectrogram of input speech. The
emotion intensity is measured by the posterior probability that the input
utterance carries that emotion. The prosody predictor is used to provide
prosodic features for emotion transfer. The timber encoder provides
timbre-related information for the system. Unlike many other studies which
focus on disentangling speaker and style factors of speech, the iEmoTTS is
designed to achieve cross-speaker emotion transfer via disentanglement between
prosody and timbre. Prosody is considered as the main carrier of
emotion-related speech characteristics and timbre accounts for the essential
characteristics for speaker identification. Zero-shot emotion transfer, meaning
that speech of target speakers are not seen in model training, is also realized
with iEmoTTS. Extensive experiments of subjective evaluation have been carried
out. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of iEmoTTS as compared with
other recently proposed systems of cross-speaker emotion transfer. It is shown
that iEmoTTS can produce speech with designated emotion type and controllable
emotion intensity. With appropriate information bottleneck capacity, iEmoTTS is
able to effectively transfer emotion information to a new speaker. Audio

as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM). Yet, its extensions
focus on the definition of interpolation and the space where it takes place,
while the augmentation itself is less studied: For a mini-batch of size $m$,
most methods interpolate between $m$ pairs with a single scalar interpolation
factor $\lambda$.
  In this work, we make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix,
which interpolates an arbitrary number $n$ of tuples, each of length $m$, with
one vector $\lambda$ per tuple. On sequence data, we further extend to dense
interpolation and loss computation over all spatial positions. Overall, we
increase the number of tuples per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little
additional cost. This is possible by interpolating at the very last layer
before the classifier. Finally, to address inconsistencies due to linear target
interpolation, we introduce a self-distillation approach to generate and
interpolate synthetic targets.
  We empirically show that our contributions result in significant improvement
over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four benchmarks. By analyzing the
embedding space, we observe that the classes are more tightly clustered and
uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved
behavior.

cosmic history of star formation, especially at high redshift where
conventional methods are known to suffer from intrinsic biases. Previous
studies of GRB host galaxies at low redshift showed that high surface densities
of stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) can potentially enhance the GRB
production. We assess how the size, the stellar mass and SFR surface densities
of distant galaxies affect their probability to host a long GRB, using a sample
of GRB hosts at $z > 1$ and a control sample of star-forming sources from the
field. We gather a sample of 45 GRB host galaxies at $1 < z < 3.1$ observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 camera in the near-infrared. Using the
GALFIT parametric approach, we model the GRB host light profile and derive the
half-light radius for 35 GRB hosts, which we use to estimate the SFR and
stellar mass surface densities of each object. We compare the distribution of
these physical quantities to the SFR-weighted properties of a complete sample
of star-forming galaxies from the 3D-HST deep survey at comparable redshift and
stellar mass. We show that, similarly to $z < 1$, GRB hosts are smaller in size
and they have higher stellar mass and SFR surface densities than field galaxies
at $1 < z < 2$. Interestingly, this result is robust even when considering
separately the hosts of GRBs with optically-bright afterglows and the hosts of
dark GRBs. At $z > 2$ though, GRB hosts appear to have sizes and stellar mass
surface densities more consistent with those characterizing the field galaxies.
In addition to a possible trend toward low metallicity environment, other
environmental properties such as stellar density appears to play a role in the
formation of long GRBs, at least up to $z \sim 2$. This might suggest that GRBs
require special environments to be produced.

dynamics starts sufficiently in the far past, the kinetic energy will come to
dominate at the bounce, uniquely determining the amplitude of the inflaton at
this moment. This will be the initial condition for the further evolution that

accelerated expansion. A first analysis is performed considering the standard

Barbero-Immirzi parameter can be considered a free parameter of the underlying

understood within the celebrated Rouse model, the effect of an external
magnetic field on the dynamics of a charged chain is much less understood. Here
we generalize the Rouse model for a charged dimer to include the effect of an
external magnetic field. Our analytically solvable model allows a fundamental
insight into the magneto-generated dynamics of the dimer in the overdamped
limit as induced by the Lorentz-force. Surprisingly, for a dimer of oppositely
charged particles, we find an enormous enhancement of the dynamics of the dimer
center which exhibits even a transient superballistic behavior. This is highly
unusual in an overdamped system for there is neither inertia nor any internal
or external driving. We attribute this to a significant translation and
rotation coupling due to the Lorentz force. We also find that magnetic field
reduces the mobility of a dimer along its orientation and its effective
rotational diffusion coefficient. In principle, our predictions can be tested
by experiments with colloidal particles and complex plasmas.

attention due to their strong field confinement, high-quality factors, and
potential to enhance the photonic density of states at mid-infrared (IR)

that not only exhibit these extraordinary properties but also incorporate a new
degree of freedom $-$ twist tuning, i.e. the possibility to be spectrally
controlled by a simple rotation. To that end, we both take advantage of the
low-loss in-plane hyperbolic propagation of PhPs in the van der Waals crystal
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$, and realize dielectric engineering of a pristine
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$ slab placed on top of metal ribbon grating, which preserves
the high-quality of the polaritonic resonances. By simple rotating the
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$ slab in the plane (from 0 to 45$^{\circ}$), we demonstrate via
far- and near-field measurements that the narrow polaritonic resonances (with
quality factors Q up to 200) can be tuned in a broad range (up to 32 cm$^{-1}$,
i.e up 6 ~ times its full width at half maximum, FWHM ~ 5 cm$^{-1}$). Our

present evidence for three such outbursts occurring in 2021 June and September.

heat source when illuminated by a laser. Furthermore, the temperature of such a
local heater is tracked by the spectral shift of the zero-phonon line of SiV

qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multi-agent
systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often
need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which
the performance or even the survival of the group are at stake. Breaking
indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state agents are not
biased toward any specific option and therefore the agent group is maximally
sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we
develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of
indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network
bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in
influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an
option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely,
deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of
synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in
influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value
patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the
influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many `exotic' dissensus
value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture, but not
by network symmetries, through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This
is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical
simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical
results.

form suitable for effective numerical simulations. To demonstrate the
advantages of the AAEP, we performed a number of Monte--Carlo simulations for
an OCP with up to a million particles in a wide range of the coupling

effective than those with a traditional Ewald potential. A unified approach is
offered for the determination of the thermodynamic limit in the whole

Clinically-Interpretable Radiomics Dataset, CIRDataset, containing 956
radiologist QA/QC'ed spiculation/lobulation annotations on segmented lung
nodules from two public datasets, LIDC-IDRI (N=883) and LUNGx (N=73). We also
present an end-to-end deep learning model based on multi-class Voxel2Mesh
extension to segment nodules (while preserving spikes), classify spikes
(sharp/spiculation and curved/lobulation), and perform malignancy prediction.
Previous methods have performed malignancy prediction for LIDC and LUNGx
datasets but without robust attribution to any clinically reported/actionable
features (due to known hyperparameter sensitivity issues with general
attribution schemes). With the release of this comprehensively-annotated
CIRDataset and end-to-end deep learning baseline, we hope that malignancy
prediction methods can validate their explanations, benchmark against our

$(1+\varepsilon)\|pq\|$. We show that the minimum weight of a Euclidean
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for $n$ points in the unit square $[0,1]^2$ is
$O(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\,\sqrt{n})$, and this bound is the best possible. The
upper bound is based on a new spanner algorithm that sparsifies Yao-graphs. It
improves upon the baseline $O(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n})$, obtained by combining
a tight bound for the weight of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (MST) on $n$
points in $[0,1]^2$, and a tight bound for the lightness of Euclidean
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners, which is the ratio of the spanner weight to the
weight of the MST. The result generalizes to Euclidean $d$-space for every

$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for $n$ points in the unit cube $[0,1]^d$ is
$O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d^2)/d}n^{(d-1)/d})$, and this bound is the best possible.

weight of a Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner is between

$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(\varepsilon^{-1})\cdot n^2)$. These bounds become
$\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3/4}\cdot \sqrt{n})$ and
$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(\varepsilon^{-1})\cdot \sqrt{n})$ when scaled to a grid

down when applied to real world mechanics problems with unknown test

OOD generalization of ML methods. However, because of the lack of benchmark
datasets for OOD regression problems, the efficiency of these OOD methods on
regression problems, which dominate the mechanics field, remains unknown. To
address this, we investigate the performance of OOD generalization methods for

covariate shift, mechanism shift, and sampling bias. For each problem, we
create two benchmark examples that extend the Mechanical MNIST dataset

experiments show that in most cases, while the OOD generalization algorithms
perform better compared to traditional ML methods on these OOD problems, there
is a compelling need to develop more robust OOD generalization methods that are
effective across multiple OOD scenarios. Overall, we expect that this study, as

range of stellar masses M$_\ast$ from $10^8$ to $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, and SFRs
from 1 to 500 M$_\odot$/yr, in the redshift range between 2 and 5. We find that
the bulk ISM velocity v$_{ism}$ is globally in outflow, with v$_{ism}$ of -60
$\pm$ 10 km/s for low ionization gas traced by SiII 1260 Angstrom, CII 1334,
SiII 1526, and AlII 1670, and v$_{ism}$ of -160 $\pm$ 30 and -170 $\pm$ 30 km/s

1393-1402. Interestingly, BPASS models are able to better reproduce the stellar
continuum around the SiIV doublet than other stellar population templates. For
individual galaxies, $34\%$ of the sample has a positive ISM velocity shift,
almost double the fraction reported at lower redshifts. Comparing v$_{ism}$ to
the host galaxies properties, we find no significant correlations with M$_\ast$
or SFR, and only a marginally significant dependence (at $\sim 2\sigma$) on
morphology-related parameters, with slightly higher velocities in galaxies of
smaller size (probed by the equivalent radius), higher concentration, and
higher SFR surface density. The outflows are consistent with models of
accelerating, momentum-driven winds, with densities decreasing towards the
outskirts. Our moderately lower ISM velocities compared to those found in
similar studies at lower redshifts suggest that inflows and internal turbulence
might play an increased role at $z>2$. We estimate mass outflow rates
comparable to the SFRs of the galaxies, and an average escape velocity of 625
km/s, suggesting that most of the ISM will remain bound to the galaxy halo.

  land lottery winners",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper investigates gender differences in entrepreneurship by exploiting a
large-scale land lottery in Oklahoma at the turn of the 20$^{\text{th}}$
century. Lottery winners claimed land in the order in which their names were
drawn, so the draw number is an approximate rank ordering of lottery wealth.
This mechanism allows for the estimation of a dose-response function, which
relates each draw number to the expected outcome under each draw. I estimate
dose-response functions on a linked dataset of lottery winners and land patent
records, and find the probability of purchasing land from the government to be
decreasing as a function of lottery wealth, which is evidence for the presence
of liquidity constraints. I find female winners were more effective in
leveraging lottery wealth to purchase additional land, as evidenced by
significantly higher median dose-responses compared to those of male winners.
For a sample of winners linked to the 1910 Census, I find that male winners
have higher median dose-responses compared to female winners in terms of farm
or home ownership. These results suggest that liquidity constraints may have
been more binding for female entrepreneurs in the market economy.

which the label Missing Not At Random (MNAR) problem is more realistic and
challenging, compared to the widely-adopted yet naive Missing Completely At
Random assumption where both labeled and unlabeled data share the same class
distribution. Different from existing SSL solutions that overlook the role of
""class"" in causing the non-randomness, e.g., users are more likely to label
popular classes, we explicitly incorporate ""class"" into SSL. Our method is
three-fold: 1) We propose Class-Aware Propensity (CAP) that exploits the
unlabeled data to train an improved classifier using the biased labeled data.
2) To encourage rare class training, whose model is low-recall but
high-precision that discards too many pseudo-labeled data, we propose
Class-Aware Imputation (CAI) that dynamically decreases (or increases) the
pseudo-label assignment threshold for rare (or frequent) classes. 3) Overall,
we integrate CAP and CAI into a Class-Aware Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator for
training an unbiased SSL model. Under various MNAR settings and ablations, our
method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines but also surpasses
other label bias removal SSL methods. Please check our code at:

we apply the common encoding function to all input embeddings. These encoding

  At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically

modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of
independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the

Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as
a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on
indistinguishability obfuscation.
  Finally, we compile the above protocol into a fully succinct argument using a
(sufficiently composable) succinct argument of knowledge for NP. Using our

  - Succinct arguments for QMA (given multiple copies of the witness),
  - Succinct non-interactive arguments for BQP (or QMA) in the quantum random

it is well formulated and tested in the case of mechanical equilibrium (where

describe homogeneous mixtures that flow with multiple independent velocities
that still possess some inertia (before mechanical equilibrium is reached) is
still open. Moreover, the mixtures can have several temperatures before they
relax to a common value. In this paper, we derive a theory of mixtures from
Hamiltonian mechanics in interaction with electromagnetic fields. The resulting
evolution equations are then reduced to the case with only one momentum
(classical irreversible thermodynamics), providing a generalization of the
Maxwell-Stefan diffusion equations. In a next step, we reduce that description
to the mechanical equilibrium (no momentum) and derive a non-isothermal variant
of the dusty gas model. These reduced equations are solved numerically, and we
illustrate the results on efficiency analysis, showing where in a concentration
cell efficiency is lost. Finally, the theory of mixtures identifies the
temperature difference between constituents as a possible new source of the
Soret coefficient. For the sake of clarity, we restrict the presentation to the

demonstrate the emergence of multi-band oscillations in a simple network
consisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory neuronal population driven by
constant input. First, we construct a data-driven, Poincar\'e section theory
for robust numerical observations of single-frequency oscillations bifurcating
into multiple bands. Then we develop model reductions of the stochastic,
nonlinear, high-dimensional neuronal network to capture the appearance of
multi-band dynamics and the underlying bifurcations theoretically. Furthermore,
when viewed within the reduced state space, our analysis reveals conserved
geometrical features of the bifurcations on low-dimensional dynamical
manifolds. These results suggest a simple geometric mechanism behind the
emergence of multi-band oscillations without appealing to oscillatory inputs or
multiple synaptic or neuronal timescales. Thus our work points to unexplored
regimes of stochastic competition between excitation and inhibition behind the
generation of dynamic, patterned neuronal activities.

most efficient tools to handle this enormous amount of data, because they are

well redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates (SFR) can be measured
with deep learning algorithms for observed galaxies within data mimicking the

Convolutional Neutral Networks (CNN), which are dependent on the parameter
space of the training sample, perform well in measuring the properties of these
galaxies and have a better accuracy than methods based on spectral energy
distribution fitting. CNNs allow the processing of multi-band magnitudes
together with $H_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$-band images. We find that the
estimates of stellar masses improve with the use of an image, but those of
redshift and SFR do not. Our best results are deriving i) the redshift within a
normalised error of less than 0.15 for 99.9$\%$ of the galaxies with S/N>3 in
the $H_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$-band; ii) the stellar mass within a factor of
two ($\sim0.3 \rm dex$) for 99.5$\%$ of the considered galaxies; iii) the SFR
within a factor of two ($\sim0.3 \rm dex$) for $\sim$70$\%$ of the sample. We
discuss the implications of our work for application to surveys as well as how
measurements of these galaxy parameters can be improved with deep learning.

undergo structural transformations. These lattice transformations generate
misfit strains and volume changes that, in turn, contribute to the structural
decay of intercalation materials and limit their reversible cycling. In this
paper, we draw on insights from shape-memory alloys, another class of phase
transformation materials, that also undergo large lattice transformations but
do so with negligible macroscopic volume changes and internal stresses. We
develop a theoretical framework to predict structural transformations in
intercalation compounds and establish crystallographic design rules necessary
for forming shape-memory-like microstructures in intercalation materials. We
use our framework to systematically screen open-source structural databases
comprising n > 5000 pairs of intercalation compounds. We identify candidate
compounds, such as Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ (Spinel), Li$_x$Ti$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$
(NASICON), that approximately satisfy the crystallographic design rules and can
be precisely doped to form shape-memory-like microstructures. Throughout, we
compare our analytical results with experimental measurements of intercalation

microstructures, and increased capacity retention in these materials. These
results, more generally, show that crystallographic designing of intercalation

motion from the identity on $U(N)$ allows the moments of the spectral density,
and the spectral form factor $S_N(k;t)$, to be evaluated explicitly in terms of
a certain hypergeometric polynomial. Upon transformation, this can be
identified in terms of a Jacobi polynomial with parameters $(N(\mu - 1),1)$,
where $\mu = k/N$ and $k$ is the integer labelling the Fourier coefficients.
From existing results in the literature for the asymptotics of the latter, the
asymptotic forms of the moments of the spectral density can be specified, as
can $\lim_{N \to \infty} {1 \over N} S_N(k;t) |_{\mu = k/N}$. These in turn

exact location of the GeV emission is less than a pc from the central engine,
such that it may receive sufficient amount of photons from the broad line
region (BLR) or farther out at 1-100 pc range. The former assumption has been
successfully used to model the spectral energy distribution of many blazars.
However, simultaneous detection of TeV $\gamma$-rays along with GeV outbursts
in some cases indicate that the emission region must be outside the BLR. In
addition, GeV outbursts have sometimes been observed to be simultaneous with
the passing of a disturbance through the so called ""VLBI core,"" which is
located tens of pc away from the central engine. Hence, the exact location of
$\gamma$-ray emission remains ambiguous. Here we present a method we have
developed to constrain the location of the emission region. We identify
simultaneous months-timescale GeV and optical outbursts in the light curves

emission models we show that the energy ratio of simultaneous optical and GeV

Comparing the energy dissipation of the observed multi-wavelength outbursts and

annealing under different atmospheres, including O2, N2, Ar, and H2, the latter
of which caused Ti4+ to Ti(4-x)+ multiple reductions and structural expansions
that stabilized piezoelectric tetragonal BTO domains. The resultant defect
equilibria combine ionic and electron effects, including Ti redox reactions,
charge-compensating surface oxygen vacancy formation, and color centre
alterations. Further, variety of experimental techniques revealed the effects
of reduction on the energy band structure. A strong piezoelectric effect and
the presence of self-polarization were confirmed by piezoresponse force
microscopy, while simulation work clarified the role of vibration on band
bending deriving from the former. The performance data contrasted H2 evolution
using deionized (DI) water, simulated seawater, and natural seawater subjected
to photocatalysis, piezocatalysis, and piezo-photocatalysis. An efficient H2
evolution rate of 132.4 micromol/g/h was achieved from DI water using

for solving nonsmooth convex and nonsmooth nonconvex (nonsmooth weakly convex)
optimization problems. RCS randomly selects one block coordinate to update at
each iteration, making it more practical than updating all coordinates. We
consider the linearly bounded subgradients assumption for the objective
function, which is more general than the traditional Lipschitz continuity
assumption, to account for practical scenarios. We then conduct thorough
convergence analysis for RCS in both convex and nonconvex cases based on this
generalized Lipschitz-type assumption. Specifically, we establish the
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate in expectation and the
$\tilde o(1/\sqrt{k})$ almost sure asymptotic convergence rate in terms of
suboptimality gap when $f$ is nonsmooth convex. If $f$ further satisfies the
global quadratic growth condition, the improved $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rate is
shown in terms of the squared distance to the optimal solution set. For the
case when $f$ is nonsmooth weakly convex and its subdifferential satisfies the
global metric subregularity property, we derive the $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/4})$
iteration complexity in expectation, where $T$ is the total number of
iterations. We also establish an asymptotic convergence result. To justify the
global metric subregularity property utilized in the analysis, we establish
this error bound condition for the concrete (real valued) robust phase
retrieval problem, which is of independent interest. We provide a convergence
lemma and the relationship between the global metric subregularity properties
of a weakly convex function and its Moreau envelope, which are also of
independent interest. Finally, we conduct several experiments to demonstrate
the possible superiority of RCS over the subgradient method.

determine how the synthesized speech is acoustically similar to the recorded

a hierarchical robust control strategy in a decentralized traffic coordination
framework where optimal control and tube-based robust model predictive control
methods are designed to hierarchically solve the optimal crossing order and the
velocity trajectories of a group of CAVs in terms of energy consumption and
throughput. To capture the energy consumption of each vehicle, their powertrain
system is modeled in line with an electric drive system. With a suitable
relaxation and spatial modeling approach, the optimization problems in the
proposed strategy can be formulated as convex second-order cone programs, which
provide a unique and computationally efficient solution. A rigorous proof of
the equivalence between the convexified and the original problems is also
provided. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed strategy and reveal the impact of traffic density on the control
solution. The study of the Pareto optimal solutions for the energy-time
objective shows that a minor reduction in journey time can considerably reduce

demonstrated the effectiveness of such GNNs in replacing the branching
(variable selection) heuristic in branch-and-bound (B&B) solvers. These GNNs
are trained, offline and on a collection of MILPs, to imitate a very good but
computationally expensive branching heuristic, strong branching. Given that B&B
results in a tree of sub-MILPs, we ask (a) whether there are strong
dependencies exhibited by the target heuristic among the neighboring nodes of
the B&B tree, and (b) if so, whether we can incorporate them in our training
procedure. Specifically, we find that with the strong branching heuristic, a
child node's best choice was often the parent's second-best choice. We call
this the ""lookback"" phenomenon. Surprisingly, the typical branching GNN of
Gasse et al. (2019) often misses this simple ""answer"". To imitate the target
behavior more closely by incorporating the lookback phenomenon in GNNs, we
propose two methods: (a) target smoothing for the standard cross-entropy loss
function, and (b) adding a Parent-as-Target (PAT) Lookback regularizer term.
Finally, we propose a model selection framework to incorporate
harder-to-formulate objectives such as solving time in the final models.
Through extensive experimentation on standard benchmark instances, we show that

external knowledge for robust answer prediction. Though significant it is, this
paper discovers several leading factors impeding the advancement of current
state-of-the-art methods. On the one hand, methods which exploit the explicit
knowledge take the knowledge as a complement for the coarsely trained VQA
model. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches often suffer from noise
incorporation and error propagation. On the other hand, pertaining to the
implicit knowledge, the multi-modal implicit knowledge for knowledge-based VQA
still remains largely unexplored. This work presents a unified end-to-end
retriever-reader framework towards knowledge-based VQA. In particular, we shed
light on the multi-modal implicit knowledge from vision-language pre-training
models to mine its potential in knowledge reasoning. As for the noise problem
encountered by the retrieval operation on explicit knowledge, we design a novel
scheme to create pseudo labels for effective knowledge supervision. This scheme
is able to not only provide guidance for knowledge retrieval, but also drop
these instances potentially error-prone towards question answering. To validate
the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on

game theory. Normalizing flows (NFs) are a family of deep generative models
that compute data likelihoods by using an invertible mapping, which is
typically parameterized by using neural networks. They are useful for density
modeling and data generation. While active research has been conducted on both
models, few noted the relationship between the two. In this work, we unravel
the connections between MFGs and NFs by contextualizing the training of an NF
as solving the MFG. This is achieved by reformulating the MFG problem in terms
of agent trajectories and parameterizing a discretization of the resulting MFG
with flow architectures. With this connection, we explore two research
directions. First, we employ expressive NF architectures to accurately solve
high-dimensional MFGs, sidestepping the curse of dimensionality in traditional
numerical methods. Compared with other deep learning approaches, our
trajectory-based formulation encodes the continuity equation in the neural
network, resulting in a better approximation of the population dynamics.
Second, we regularize the training of NFs with transport costs and show the
effectiveness on controlling the model's Lipschitz bound, resulting in better
generalization performance. We demonstrate numerical results through

shown that in the inner-trajectory sections their kinematic properties,

well model-simulated by using the scenario with a precession period of 7.30yr

the individual knot-trajectories at their corresponding precession phases.
Through the model-simulation of their kinematic behavior their bulk Lorentz

These anticipatively-determined Lorentz/Doppler factors were used to
investigate the knots' Doppler-boosting effect and interpret their flux
evolution. It was found that the light-curves of the five superluminal

techniques cannot take into account the learning of both the global knowledge

make up for this limitation, we propose a cross-domain federated object

first performs the federated training to obtain a public global aggregated
model through multi-teacher distillation, and sends the aggregated model back
to each client for finetuning its personalized local model. After very few
rounds of communication, on each client we can perform weighted ensemble
inference on the public global model and the personalized local model. With the
ensemble, the generalization performance of the client-side model can
outperform a single model with the same parameter scale. We establish a
federated object detection dataset which has significant background differences

the standalone networks shall tolerate unknown and out-of-network accesses,
specifically in the medium access. In this paper, for the first time in
literature, we review some of the critical and emerging security
vulnerabilities in the 5G/WiFi coexistence network environment which have not
been observed previously in standalone networks. Specifically, independent
medium access control (MAC) protocols and the resulting hidden node issues can
result in exploitation such as service blocking, deployment of rogue
base-stations, and eavesdropping attacks. We study potential vulnerabilities in
the perspective of physical layer authentication, network access security, and
cross-layer authentication mechanisms. This study opens a new direction of
research in the analysis and design of a security framework that can address
the unique challenges of coexistence networks.

applications, such as approximating difficult combinatorial problems. We
introduce a variational quantum algorithm for semidefinite programs that uses
only $n$ qubits, a constant number of circuit preparations, and $O(n^2)$
expectation values in order to solve semidefinite programs with up to $N=2^n$
variables and $M=2^n$ constraints. Efficient optimization is achieved by
encoding the objective matrix as a properly parameterized unitary conditioned
on an auxilary qubit, a technique known as the Hadamard Test. The Hadamard Test
enables us to optimize the objective function by estimating only a single
expectation value of the ancilla qubit, rather than separately estimating
exponentially many expectation values. Similarly, we illustrate that the
semidefinite programming constraints can be effectively enforced by
implementing a second Hadamard Test, as well as imposing $\sim n^2/2$ Pauli
string amplitude constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol
by devising an efficient quantum implementation of the Goemans-Williamson

a diverse subset of well-studied MaxCut problems from the GSet library.

development of an explosively driven light-gas gun that has demonstrated the
ability to launch 8 mm diameter, 0.36 g magnesium projectiles to 10.4 km/s. The
implosion-driven launcher (IDL) uses the linear implosion of a pressurized tube
to shock-compress helium gas to a pressure of \SI{5}{\giga\pascal}, which then
expands to propel a projectile to hypervelocity. The launch cycle of the IDL is
explored with the use of down-bore velocimetry experiments and a
quasi-one-dimensional internal ballistics solver. A detailed overview of the
design of the 8 mm launcher is presented, with an emphasis on the unique
considerations which arise from the explosively driven propellant compression
and the resulting extreme pressures and temperatures. The high average driving
pressure results in a launcher that is compact, with a total length typically
less than a meter. The possibility to scale the design to larger projectile
sizes (25 mm diameter) is demonstrated. Finally, concepts for a modified launch
cycle which may allow the IDL to reach significantly greater projectile

but also share messages and representations via cluster-level and area-level
virtual nodes. Lastly, a cross-level fusion module is designed to integrate
multi-level memories and generate comprehensive node representations for the

training recipes for visual recognition tasks. However, data augmentation for
video recognition has been rarely explored despite its effectiveness. Few
existing augmentation recipes for video recognition naively extend the image
augmentation methods by applying the same operations to the whole video frames.
Our main idea is that the magnitude of augmentation operations for each frame
needs to be changed over time to capture the real-world video's temporal
variations. These variations should be generated as diverse as possible using
fewer additional hyper-parameters during training. Through this motivation, we
propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation framework, DynaAugment.
The magnitude of augmentation operations on each frame is changed by an
effective mechanism, Fourier Sampling that parameterizes diverse, smooth, and
realistic temporal variations. DynaAugment also includes an extended search
space suitable for video for automatic data augmentation methods. DynaAugment
experimentally demonstrates that there are additional performance rooms to be
improved from static augmentations on diverse video models. Specifically, we
show the effectiveness of DynaAugment on various video datasets and tasks:
large-scale video recognition (Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2),

of layers, the number of neurons per layer, their connections or synapses, and
the activation function that they will execute. The training process tries to
optimize the weights assigned to those connections, together with the biases of
the neurons, to better fit the training data. However, the definition of the
activation functions is, in general, determined in the design process and not
modified during the training, meaning that their behavior is unrelated to the
training data set. In this paper we propose the definition and utilization of
an implicit, parametric, non-linear activation function that adapts its shape
during the training process. This fact increases the space of parameters to
optimize within the network, but it allows a greater flexibility and
generalizes the concept of neural networks. Furthermore, it simplifies the

series plays an important role in monitoring the behaviors of various

Previous anomaly detection approaches model the joint distribution without
considering the underlying mechanism of multivariate time series, making them
computationally hungry and hard to identify root causes. In this paper, we
formulate the anomaly detection problem from a causal perspective and view
anomalies as instances that do not follow the regular causal mechanism to
generate the multivariate data. We then propose a causality-based framework for
detecting anomalies and root causes. It first learns the causal structure from
data and then infers whether an instance is an anomaly relative to the local
causal mechanism whose conditional distribution can be directly estimated from
data. In light of the modularity property of causal systems (the causal
processes to generate different variables are irrelevant modules), the original
problem is divided into a series of separate, simpler, and low-dimensional
anomaly detection problems so that where an anomaly happens (root causes) can
be directly identified. We evaluate our approach with both simulated and public
datasets as well as a case study on real-world AIOps applications, showing its
efficacy, robustness, and practical feasibility.

fields, which can have an interesting phenomenology. Within the latter set, we
study in detail a vast class where the Holst invariant (the contraction of the

pseudoscalar. In the Einstein-Cartan case (where the connection is metric
compatible and fermions can be introduced) we also comment on the possible
phenomenological role of dynamical dark photons from torsion and compute

emerges at low energies without the need to postulate it.

be more productive, resistive, and reliable. Wheat is one of the most important
food resources in the world, mainly because of the variety of wheat-based
products. Wheat crops are threatened by three main types of diseases which
cause large amounts of annual damage in crop yield. These diseases can be
eliminated by using pesticides at the right time. While the task of manually
spraying pesticides is burdensome and expensive, agricultural robotics can aid
farmers by increasing the speed and decreasing the amount of chemicals. In this
work, a smart autonomous system has been implemented on an unmanned aerial
vehicle to automate the task of monitoring wheat fields. First, an image-based
deep learning approach is used to detect and classify disease-infected wheat
plants. To find the most optimal method, different approaches have been
studied. Because of the lack of a public wheat-disease dataset, a custom
dataset has been created and labeled. Second, an efficient mapping and
navigation system is presented using a simulation in the robot operating system
and Gazebo environments. A 2D simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm
is used for mapping the workspace autonomously with the help of a

recent studies. The different excitation signals used to quantify such effects
in these studies aimed at charging a device to the same voltage value and the
exact same accumulated charge level but in different manners. Having reached
the same unique voltage-charge point, it was observed that different yet
repeatable discharge patterns occur, proving the existence of memory. The aim
of this work is to provide further experimental evidence of the inherent memory
effect in EDLCs in response to time-varying stationary input excitations with
different statistical properties. In particular, different sets of charging
voltage waveforms composed of fixed dc values with superimposed
uniformly-distributed random fluctuations of different amplitudes were created
and used to charge the same EDLC device to a unique voltage-charge point. The
duration of these signals was the same but with different values of variance
around the mean value. We observed different time-charge responses depending on
the extent of the noise level in these charging waveforms. This is interpreted
and discussed in the context of inherent memory using fractional-order
voltage-charge equations of non-ideal capacitors.

consequence, the topological phase transition switches the anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) from zero to a giant value. Furthermore, we theoretically
demonstrate how the controlled manipulation of the chiral AFM order keeping
$\kappa$ unaltered favors unusual rotation of Weyl-points on the ring. This in
turn enables us to tune in-plane components of the AHC by a collective uniform

The scalar field is treated as the system whereas the fermions as the
environment. As the simplest realistic scenario, we assume that an observer
measures only the Gaussian 2-point correlator for the scalar field. The cause
of decoherence and the subsequent entropy generation is the ignorance of
information stored in higher-order correlators, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, of
the system and the surrounding. Using the 2-loop 2-particle irreducible
effective action, we construct the renormalised Kadanoff-Baym equations, i.e.,
the equation of motion satisfied by the 2-point correlators in the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. These equations contain the non-local self-energy
corrections. We then compute the statistical propagator in terms of the 2-point
functions. Using the relationship of the statistical propagator with the phase

obtained the variation of the entropy with respect to various relevant

Moreover, they can acquire new concepts by parsing and communicating symbolic

capability at inference time. In this work, we introduce Zero-shot Concept
Recognition and Acquisition (ZeroC), a neuro-symbolic architecture that can

algebraic theory of patterns, building from a core principle of future
equivalence. For topological patterns in fully-discrete one-dimensional
systems, future equivalence uniquely specifies a minimal semiautomaton. We
demonstrate how the latter and its semigroup algebra generalizes translation
symmetry to partial and hidden symmetries. This generalization is not as
straightforward as previously considered. Here, though, we clarify the
underlying challenges. A stochastic form of future equivalence, known as
predictive equivalence, captures distinct statistical patterns supported on
topological patterns. Finally, we show how local versions of future equivalence
can be used to capture patterns in spacetime. As common when moving to higher
dimensions, there is not a unique local approach, and we detail two local
representations that capture different aspects of spacetime patterns. A
previously-developed local spacetime variant of future equivalence captures
patterns as generalized symmetries in higher dimensions, but we show this
representation is not a faithful generator of its spacetime patterns. This
motivates us to introduce a local representation that is a faithful generator,
but we demonstrate that it no longer captures generalized spacetime symmetries.
Taken altogether, building on future equivalence, the theory defines and
quantifies patterns present in a wide range of classical field theories.

Massive star-formation leads to enrichment with heavy elements of
the interstellar medium. On the other hand, the abundance of heavy elements is
a key parameter to study the star-formation history of galaxies. Furthermore,
the total molecular hydrogen mass, usually determined by converting CO or [C
ii] 158 $\mu$m luminosities, depends on the metallicity as well. The excitation
of metallicity-sensitive emission lines, however, depends on the gas density of
H ii regions, where they arise. Aims. We used spectroscopic observations from
SOFIA, Herschel, and Spitzer of the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC
253, as well as photometric observations from GALEX, 2MASS, Spitzer, and
Herschel in order to derive physical properties such as the optical depth to
correct for extinction, as well as the gas density and metallicity of the
central region. Methods. Ratios of the integrated line fluxes of several
species were utilised to derive the gas density and metallicity. The [O iii]
along with the [S iii] and [N ii] line flux ratios for example, are sensitive
to the gas density but nearly independent of the local temperature. As these
line ratios trace different gas densities and ionisation states, we examined if
these lines may originate from different regions within the observing beam. The
([Ne ii] 13 $\mu$m + [Ne iii] 16 $\mu$m)/Hu $\alpha$ line flux ratio on the
other hand, is independent of the depletion onto dust grains but sensitive to
the Ne/H abundance ratio and will be used as a tracer for metallicity of the
gas. Results. We derived values for gas phase abundances of the most important
species, as well as estimates for the optical depth and the gas density of the
ionised gas in the nuclear region of NGC 253. We obtained densities of at least
two different ionised components $(< 84$ cm$^{-3}$ and $\sim 170 - 212$
cm$^{-3})$ and a metallicity of solar value.

an unrealistic assumption. A popular strategy to address this problem is
imputation, in which missing values are replaced by estimated values given the
observed data. In this paper we evaluate various approaches to answering
queries on an imputed dataset in a differentially private manner, as well as
discuss trade-offs as to where along the pipeline privacy is considered. We
show that if imputation is done without consideration to privacy, the
sensitivity of certain queries can increase linearly with the number of
incomplete records. On the other hand, for a general class of imputation
strategies, these worst case scenarios can be greatly reduced by ensuring
privacy already during the imputation stage. We use a simulated dataset to
demonstrate these results across a number of imputation schemes (both private

the cardinality of set union and set intersection. Our private set-cardinality
protocols (PSC) are designed for the setting in which a large set of parties in
a distributed system makes observations, and a small set of parties with more
resources and higher reliability aggregates the observations. PSC allows for
secure and useful statistics gathering in privacy-preserving distributed
systems. For example, it allows operators of anonymity networks such as Tor to
securely answer the questions: ""How many unique users are using the network?""
and ""How many hidden services are being accessed?"".
  We prove the correctness and security of PSC in the Universal Composability
framework against an active adversary that compromises all but one of the
aggregating parties. Although successful output cannot be guaranteed in this
setting, PSC either succeeds or terminates with an abort, and we furthermore
make the adversary accountable for causing an abort by blaming at least one
malicious party. We also show that PSC prevents adaptive corruption of the data
parties from revealing past observations, which prevents them from being
victims of targeted compromise, and we ensure safe measurements by making
outputs differentially private.
  We present a proof-of-concept implementation of PSC and use it to demonstrate
that PSC operates with low computational overhead and reasonable bandwidth. It
can count tens of thousands of unique observations from tens to hundreds of
data-collecting parties while completing within hours. PSC is thus suitable for
daily measurements in a distributed system.

detected, enabling predictions of future procrastination and other dilatory

outperform models with subjective predictors, and a combination of both
variable types perform slightly better. For each of these three options, a
different approach prevailed (Gradient Boosting Machines for the subjective,

``profoundly more effective'' than forward contact tracing, that contact
tracing effectiveness ``hinges on reaching the `source' of infection'', and
that contact tracing outperformed case isolation in terms of cost efficiency.
Here we show that these conclusions are not true in general. They were based in
part on simulations that vastly overestimated the effectiveness and efficiency
of contact tracing. Our results show that the efficiency of contact tracing
strategies is highly contextual; faced with a disease outbreak, the disease
dynamics determine whether tracing infection sources or new cases is more
impactful. Our results also demonstrate the importance of simulating disease
spread and mitigation measures in parallel rather than sequentially.

the existence of only partial forms for inference. To tackle this issue, we
present Adaptive Cross-Form Learning (ACFL), which empowers well-designed GCNs
to generate complementary representation from single-form skeletons without
changing model capacity. Specifically, each GCN model in ACFL not only learns
action representation from the single-form skeletons, but also adaptively
mimics useful representations derived from other forms of skeletons. In this
way, each GCN can learn how to strengthen what has been learned, thus
exploiting model potential and facilitating action recognition as well.

A first user study of 20 expert gastrointestinal endoscopists was carried out

on several assessment parameters, being more safer. Moreover, a second user

prediction scheme for HSR networks, which predicts the beam directions and the

using a group of observations. Concretely, we transform the problem of
high-dimensional beam prediction into a two-stage task, i.e., a low-dimensional
parameter estimation and a cascaded hybrid beamforming operation. In the first
stage, the location and speed of a certain terminal are estimated by maximum
likelihood criterion, and a data-driven data fusion module is designed to
improve the final estimation accuracy and robustness. Then, the probable future
beam directions and channel amplitudes are predicted, based on the HSR scenario
priors including deterministic trajectory, motion model, and channel model.
Furthermore, we incorporate a learnable non-linear mapping module into the
overall beam prediction to allow non-linear tracks. Both of the proposed
learnable modules are model-based and have a good interpretability. Compared to
the existing beam management scheme, the proposed beam prediction has (near)

repetitive text collections, such as pangenomic databases containing sequences
of many individuals from the same species. We combine two recent techniques
from this area: Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al., 2017) and prefix-free parsing
(PFP, Boucher et al., 2019). Wheeler graphs (WGs) are a general framework
encompassing several indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), such
as the FM-index. Wheeler graphs admit a succinct representation which can be
further compacted by employing the idea of tunnelling, which exploits
redundancies in the form of parallel, equally-labelled paths called blocks that
can be merged into a single path. The problem of finding the optimal set of
blocks for tunnelling, i.e. the one that minimizes the size of the resulting
WG, is known to be NP-complete and remains the most computationally challenging
part of the tunnelling process.
  To find an adequate set of blocks in less time, we propose a new method based
on the prefix-free parsing (PFP). The idea of PFP is to divide the input text
into phrases of roughly equal sizes that overlap by a fixed number of
characters. The original text is represented by a sequence of phrase ranks (the
parse) and a list of all used phrases (the dictionary). In repetitive texts,
the PFP of the text is generally much shorter than the original. To speed up
the block selection for tunnelling, we apply the PFP to obtain the parse and
the dictionary of the text, tunnel the WG of the parse using existing
heuristics and subsequently use this tunnelled parse to construct a compact WG
of the original text. Compared with constructing a WG from the original text
without PFP, our method is much faster and uses less memory on collections of
pangenomic sequences. Therefore, our method enables the use of WGs as a
pangenomic reference for real-world datasets.

relatively simple model with good agreement to experimental data. By expressing
the strain energy function in terms of its invariants or other parameters, it
is possible to interpret the resulting algebraic formulation in a physical

equation is possible. For the validation of the proposed approach, benchmark
tests on the basis of the generalized Mooney-Rivlin model are presented. In all
these tests, the chosen ansatz can find the predefined models. Additionally,
this method is applied for the multi-axial loading data set of vulcanized
rubber. Finally, a data set for a temperature-dependent thermoplastic polyester
elastomer is evaluated. In latter cases, good agreement with the experimental

  waves",,,,,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper we show that there are circumstances in which the damping of
gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through a viscous fluid can be highly
significant; in particular, this applies to Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe).
In previous work, we used linearized perturbations on a fixed background within
the Bondi-Sachs formalism, to determine the effect of a dust shell on GW
propagation. Here, we start with the (previously found) velocity field of the
matter, and use it to determine the shear tensor of the fluid flow. Then, for a
viscous fluid, the energy dissipated is calculated, leading to an equation for
GW damping. It is found that the damping effect agrees with previous results
when the wavelength $\lambda$ is much smaller than the radius $r_i$ of the
matter shell; but if $\lambda\gg r_i$, then the damping effect is greatly
increased.
  Next, the paper discusses an astrophysical application, CCSNe. There are
several different physical processes that generate GWs, and many models have
been presented in the literature. The damping effect thus needs to be evaluated
with each of the parameters $\lambda,r_i$ and the coefficient of shear
viscosity $\eta$, having a range of values. It is found that in most cases
there will be significant damping, and in some cases that it is almost
complete.
  We also consider the effect of viscous damping on primordial gravitational
waves (pGWs) generated during inflation in the early Universe. Two cases are
investigated where the wavelength is either much shorter than the shell radii
or much longer; we find that there are conditions that will produce significant
damping, to the extent that the waves would not be detectable.

points to be clustered lie in a metric space, and no candidate centers are
specified. We call such problems ""continuous"", to distinguish from ""discrete""
clustering where candidate centers are specified. For many objectives, one can
reduce the continuous case to the discrete case, and use an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for the discrete case to get a
$\beta\alpha$-approximation for the continuous case, where $\beta$ depends on
the objective: e.g. for $k$-median, $\beta = 2$, and for $k$-means, $\beta =
4$. Our motivating question is whether this gap of $\beta$ is inherent, or are
there better algorithms for continuous clustering than simply reducing to the
discrete case? In a recent SODA 2021 paper, Cohen-Addad, Karthik, and Lee prove
a factor-$2$ and a factor-$4$ hardness, respectively, for continuous $k$-median
and $k$-means, even when the number of centers $k$ is a constant. The discrete
case for a constant $k$ is exactly solvable in polytime, so the $\beta$ loss
seems unavoidable in some regimes.
  In this paper, we approach continuous clustering via the round-or-cut
framework. For four continuous clustering problems, we outperform the reduction
to the discrete case. Notably, for the problem $\lambda$-UFL, where $\beta = 2$
and the discrete case has a hardness of $1.27$, we obtain an approximation
ratio of $2.32 < 2 \times 1.27$ for the continuous case. Also, for continuous
$k$-means, where the best known approximation ratio for the discrete case is
$9$, we obtain an approximation ratio of $32 < 4 \times 9$. The key challenge
is that most algorithms for discrete clustering, including the state of the
art, depend on linear programs that become infinite-sized in the continuous
case. To overcome this, we design new linear programs for the continuous case
which are amenable to the round-or-cut framework.

However, regression-based methods often suffer from boundary problems and the

boundary problems, we convert the oriented bounding box to Gaussian
distribution, then use the Kalman filter to approximate the intersection area.
However, there exists significant difference between the calculated and actual

sensitivity of angle deviation and width-height offset to loss variation,
making the loss more consistent with the evaluation metric. Furthermore, the
Gaussian modeling method avoids the boundary problem but causes the angle
confusion of square objects simultaneously. Thus, the Gaussian Angle Loss (GA
Loss) is presented to solve this problem by adding a corrected loss for square
targets. The proposed GA Loss can be easily extended to other Gaussian-based

a one-form symmetry $\Gamma$. In a theory with one-form symmetry, the action of
$G$ on charged line operators is not completely determined, and additional
data, a fractionalization class, needs to be specified. Distinct choices of a
fractionalization class can result in different values for the anomalies of $G$
if the theory has an anomaly involving $\Gamma$. Therefore, the computation of
the 't Hooft anomaly for an ordinary symmetry $G$ generally requires first
discovering the one-form symmetry $\Gamma$ of the physical system. We show that
the multiple values of the anomaly for $G$ can be realized by twisted gauge
transformations, since twisted gauge transformations shift fractionalization
classes. We illustrate these ideas in QCD theories in diverse dimensions. We
successfully match the anomalies of time-reversal symmetries in $2+1d$ gauge
theories, across the different fractionalization classes, with previous
conjectures for the infrared phases of such strongly coupled theories, and also
provide new checks of these proposals. We perform consistency checks of recent
proposals about two-dimensional adjoint QCD and present new results about the
anomaly of the axial $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ symmetry in $3+1d$ ${\cal N}=1$

complexity theory. In the quantum case, every elementary gate must be unitary.
This restriction makes it unclear whether the power of space-bounded

in the adversarial example belongs to the high-dimension feature which is
highly predictive and non-robust. DNNs learn more details from high-dimension

adversarial perturbation from AEs as high-dimension feature, then the trained
AEs discriminator determines whether the input is an AE. Experimental results
show that the proposed method can not only detect the adversarial examples with
high accuracy, but also detect the specific category of the AEs. Meanwhile, the

biases occupying a central role that inflicts fairness, accountability,

different direction for bias detection, we offer a principled approach along
with Machine Learning to detect these two cognitive biases from Web logs of
users' actions. Our individual user level detection makes it truly
personalized, and does not rely on annotated data. Instead, we start with two
basic principles established in cognitive psychology, use modified training of
an attention network, and interpret attention weights in a novel way according
to those principles, to infer and distinguish between these two biases. The
personalized approach allows detection for specific users who are susceptible
to these biases when performing their tasks, and can help build awareness among
them so as to undertake bias mitigation.

fully exploit the pixel redundancy of the background and improve the model's

shuffles the background patches without disordering the original nuclei
distribution. To achieve contextual consistency between original and template
instances, a smooth-GAN is designed with a foreground similarity encoder (FSE)

re-authentication when feature values widely differ from previously observed
ones. It is recommended by various national security organizations, and users
perceive it more usable and equally secure than equivalent two-factor
authentication. Despite that, RBA is still only used by very few online
services. Reasons for this include a lack of validated open resources on RBA
properties, implementation, and configuration. This effectively hinders the RBA
research, development, and adoption progress.
  To close this gap, we provide the first long-term RBA analysis on a
real-world large-scale online service. We collected feature data of 3.3 million
users and 31.3 million login attempts over more than one year. Based on the
data, we provide (i) studies on RBA's real-world characteristics, and its
configurations and enhancements to balance usability, security, and privacy,
(ii) a machine learning based RBA parameter optimization method to support
administrators finding an optimal configuration for their own use case
scenario, (iii) an evaluation of the round-trip time feature's potential to
replace the IP address for enhanced user privacy, and (iv) a synthesized RBA
data set to reproduce this research and to foster future RBA research. Our
results provide insights on selecting an optimized RBA configuration so that
users profit from RBA after just a few logins. The open data set enables
researchers to study, test, and improve RBA for widespread deployment in the

Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature) algorithms, have gained traction on
accelerating deep neural network (DNN) training on GPU clusters. However,
existing D-KFAC algorithms require to compute and communicate a large volume of
second-order information, i.e., Kronecker factors (KFs), before preconditioning
gradients, resulting in large computation and communication overheads as well
as a high memory footprint. In this paper, we propose DP-KFAC, a novel
distributed preconditioning scheme that distributes the KF constructing tasks
at different DNN layers to different workers. DP-KFAC not only retains the
convergence property of the existing D-KFAC algorithms but also enables three
benefits: reduced computation overhead in constructing KFs, no communication of
KFs, and low memory footprint. Extensive experiments on a 64-GPU cluster show
that DP-KFAC reduces the computation overhead by 1.55x-1.65x, the communication
cost by 2.79x-3.15x, and the memory footprint by 1.14x-1.47x in each

networks trained by gradient descent behave like kernel methods. However, in
practice, it is known that neural networks strongly outperform their associated
kernels. In this work, we explain this gap by demonstrating that there is a
large class of functions which cannot be efficiently learned by kernel methods
but can be easily learned with gradient descent on a two layer neural network
outside the kernel regime by learning representations that are relevant to the
target task. We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient
transfer learning, which is impossible in the kernel regime.
  Specifically, we consider the problem of learning polynomials which depend on
only a few relevant directions, i.e. of the form $f^\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U:
\R^d \to \R^r$ with $d \gg r$. When the degree of $f^\star$ is $p$, it is known
that $n \asymp d^p$ samples are necessary to learn $f^\star$ in the kernel
regime. Our primary result is that gradient descent learns a representation of
the data which depends only on the directions relevant to $f^\star$. This
results in an improved sample complexity of $n\asymp d^2 r + dr^p$.
Furthermore, in a transfer learning setup where the data distributions in the
source and target domain share the same representation $U$ but have different
polynomial heads we show that a popular heuristic for transfer learning has a
target sample complexity independent of $d$.

do not use pre-recorded data is they are constrained to specific actions or
appear unnatural and out of place (compared to real-life movements). Character
movements are very subjective to human perception (easily identify underlying
unnatural or strange patterns with simple actions, such as walking or
climbing). We present an approach that leverage's crowdsourcing to reduce these
uncanny artifacts within generated character animations. Crowdsourcing
animations is an uncommon practice due to the complexities of having multiple

integrated into a web-based solution (JavaScript/HTML5). Since Web browser are
commonly available on computers, the presented application is easy to use on
any platform from any location (easy to maintain and share). Our system

types of radiation quanta to achieve good discrimination. However, such
techniques are efficient only when the total light-emission is sufficient to
get a proper pulse profile. This is only possible when there is significant
recoil energy due to the incident particle in the detector. But, rare-event
search experiments like neutrino or dark-matter direct search experiments don't
always satisfy these conditions. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a method
that can deliver very efficient discrimination in these scenarios. Neural
network-based machine-learning algorithms have been used for classification
problems in many areas of physics, especially in high-energy experiments, and
have given better results compared to conventional techniques. We present the
results of our investigations of two network-based methods viz. Dense Neural
Network and Recurrent Neural Network, for pulse shape discrimination and
compare the same with conventional methods.

This complexity allows neural mass models to describe the itinerant features of

difficult to fit to empirical data without additional simplifying assumptions:
e.g., that the system can be modelled as linear perturbations around a fixed
point. In this study we offer a mathematical analysis of neural mass models,
specifically the canonical microcircuit model, providing analytical solutions
describing dynamical itinerancy. We derive a perturbation analysis up to second
order of the phase flow, together with adiabatic approximations. This allows us
to describe amplitude modulations as gradient flows on a potential function of
intrinsic connectivity. These results provide analytic proof-of-principle for
the existence of semi-stable states of cortical dynamics at the scale of a
cortical column. Crucially, this work allows for model inversion of neural mass
models, not only around fixed points, but over regions of phase space that
encompass transitions among semi or multi-stable states of oscillatory
activity. In principle, this formulation of cortical dynamics may improve our
understanding of the itinerancy that underwrites measures of cortical activity

inversion in the context of multiple semi-stable brain states, such as onset of

bi-beams can be controlled with the applied strain rate. The proposed approach,
however, suffers from a major limitation: 3D printing of such bi-beams with
such a 'strong' differential strain rate-dependent response is very
challenging. Here, we propose an alternative approach that only requires a
'weak' differential response and a rationally designed geometric artifact to
control the buckling direction of bi-beams. We present an analytical model that
describes the landscape of all possible combinations of geometric designs and
hyperelastic as well as viscoelastic properties that lead to the desired strain
rate-dependent switching of the buckling direction. We also demonstrate how
multi- and single-material 3D printing techniques can be used to fabricate the
proposed bi-beams with microscale and submicron resolutions. More importantly,
we show how the requirement for a weak differential response eliminates the
need for multi-material 3D printing, as the change in the laser processing
parameters is sufficient to achieve effective differential responses. Finally,
we use the same 3D printing techniques to produce strain rate-dependent gripper

convolution operation offers a principled approach to aggregate multiresolution

respective analysis to the spatiotemporal domain is challenging because
spatiotemporal data have more intrinsic dependencies. Hence, a higher
flexibility to capture jointly the spatial and the temporal dependencies is
required to learn meaningful higher-order representations. Here, we leverage
product graphs to represent the spatiotemporal dependencies in the data and
introduce Graph-Time Convolutional Neural Networks (GTCNNs) as a principled

absorption spectra toward nearby stars. The shift of the interstellar hydrogen
bulk velocity was the first observational evidence of the global heliosphere

reduce the cold start latency without the consumption of extra resources. In
this paper, we use SARIMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average),
one of the classical time series forecasting models to predict the time at

roughly constant or slightly weakening function of the sliding velocity $U$, at
low $U$, with a non-zero quasistatic limit as $U\to 0$, and (ii) that the
static friction coefficient (ratio of frictional to normal force needed to
initiate sliding) increases (""ages"") as a function of the time that surfaces
are pressed together in stationary contact, before sliding commences. To remedy

earliest extrasolar laboratories for gravity tests. They, in possession of
strongly self-gravitating bodies, i.e. neutron stars, are playing a unique role

very precise measurements of system parameters, and the pulsar timing

tasks incrementally. Incremental learning has been proposed to retain the
knowledge of old classes while learning to identify new classes. A typical
approach is to use a few exemplars to avoid forgetting old knowledge. In such a
scenario, data imbalance between old and new classes is a key issue that leads
to performance degradation of the model. Several strategies have been designed
to rectify the bias towards the new classes due to data imbalance. However,
they heavily rely on the assumptions of the bias relation between old and new
classes. Therefore, they are not suitable for complex real-world applications.
In this study, we propose an assumption-agnostic method, Multi-Granularity
Regularized re-Balancing (MGRB), to address this problem. Re-balancing methods
are used to alleviate the influence of data imbalance; however, we empirically
discover that they would under-fit new classes. To this end, we further design
a novel multi-granularity regularization term that enables the model to
consider the correlations of classes in addition to re-balancing the data. A
class hierarchy is first constructed by grouping the semantically or visually
similar classes. The multi-granularity regularization then transforms the
one-hot label vector into a continuous label distribution, which reflects the
relations between the target class and other classes based on the constructed
class hierarchy. Thus, the model can learn the inter-class relational
information, which helps enhance the learning of both old and new classes.
Experimental results on both public datasets and a real-world fault diagnosis
dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

based on federated deep learning and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). For
all we know, this is the first research on federated learning (FL) in household
load forecasting based on NILM. In this method, the integrated power is
decomposed into individual device power by non-intrusive load monitoring, and
the power of individual appliances is predicted separately using a federated
deep learning model. Finally, the predicted power values of individual
appliances are aggregated to form the total power prediction. Specifically, by
separately predicting the electrical equipment to obtain the predicted power,
it avoids the error caused by the strong time dependence in the power signal of
a single device. And in the federated deep learning prediction model, the
household owners with the power data share the parameters of the local model
instead of the local power data, guaranteeing the privacy of the household user
data. The case results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better
prediction effect than the traditional methodology that directly predicts the
aggregated signal as a whole. In addition, experiments in various federated

this methodology.

involving strange quarks. Appropriate combinations of conserved net strange and
net charm fluctuations and their correlations with other conserved charges
provide evidence that in the hadronic phase so far unobserved hadrons
contribute to the thermodynamics and need to be included in hadron resonance
gas models. In the strange sector this leads to significant reductions of the
chemical freeze-out temperature of strange hadrons. In this context, a
discussion of data from heavy-ion collisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC on the
chemical freeze-out of hadronic species is presented. It can be observed that a
description of the thermodynamics of open strange and open charm degrees of
freedom in terms of an uncorrelated hadron gas is valid only up to temperatures
close to the chiral crossover temperature. This suggests that in addition to
light and strange hadrons also open charm hadrons start to dissolve already
close to the chiral crossover. Further indications that open charm mesons start
to melt in the vicinity of $T_c$ is obtained from an analysis of screening
masses, while in the charmonium sector these screening masses show a behavior
compatible with a sequential melting pattern. At the end of this chapter we

  Language Processing",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG math.AT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In recent years, the introduction of the Transformer models sparked a
revolution in natural language processing (NLP). BERT was one of the first text
encoders using only the attention mechanism without any recurrent parts to
achieve state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks.
  This paper introduces a text classifier using topological data analysis. We
use BERT's attention maps transformed into attention graphs as the only input
to that classifier. The model can solve tasks such as distinguishing spam from
ham messages, recognizing whether a sentence is grammatically correct, or
evaluating a movie review as negative or positive. It performs comparably to
the BERT baseline and outperforms it on some tasks.
  Additionally, we propose a new method to reduce the number of BERT's
attention heads considered by the topological classifier, which allows us to
prune the number of heads from 144 down to as few as ten with no reduction in
performance. Our work also shows that the topological model displays higher
robustness against adversarial attacks than the original BERT model, which is
maintained during the pruning process. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to confront topological-based models with adversarial attacks in
the context of NLP.

one-dimensional spin-chain impurity, e.g. Bloch-type, in-plane and out-of-plane
N\'eel-type spin-chains etc. In our proposal, the chain of magnetic impurities
is placed on a spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductor where we obtain numerically
as well as analytically an effective $s$-wave like pairing due to spin
rotation, resulting in gradual destruction of the Majorana zero modes present
in the topological superconducting phase. In particular, when the impurity
spins are antiferromagnetically aligned i.e. spiral wave vector $G_{s}=\pi$,
the system becomes an effective $s$-wave superconductor without Majorana zero
modes in the local density of states. The Shiba bands, on the other hand,
formed due to the overlapping of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states play a crucial role in
this topological to trivial superconductor phase transition, confirmed by the
sign change in the minigap within the Shiba bands. We also characterize this
topological phase transition via gap closing and winding number analysis.
Moreover, interference of the Shiba bands exhibiting oscillatory behavior
within the superconducting gap, $-\Delta_{p}$ to $\Delta_{p}$, as a function of
$G_{s}$, also reflects an important evidence for the formation of an effective
$s$-wave pairing. Such oscillation is absent in the $p$-wave regime.

resonating valence bond state of the partons. The second variant, the spinless
fermion QCM on a square lattice, is of interest in context of cold-atom
lattices with higher-angular momentum states on each atom. We explore
finite-temperature orbital order-disorder transitions in the itinerant and
localized limits using complementary methods. In the itinerant limit, we
uncover an intricate temperature($T$)-dependent dimensional crossover from a
high-$T$ ``insulator''-like state, via an incoherent bad-metal-like state at
intermediate $T$, to a two-dimensional insulator at low $T$, well below the
``orbital'' ordering scale. Finally, we discuss how engineering specific,
tunable and realistic perturbations in both these variants can act as a
playground for simulating a variety of exotic QPTs between topologically
ordered and trivial phases. In the cold-atom context, we propose a novel way to
engineer a possible realisation of the exotic exciton Bose liquid phase at a
QPT between a Bose superfluid and a charge density wave insulator. We argue

words, the existence of the 1D helical conducting state on the opposite surface

independent blocks of 3D higher-order topological insulators. On the other
hand, when the electron hopping in the direction perpendicular to the step is
strong, the location of the emergent 1D helical conducting state moves from the
opposite surface of a step edge to the dip ($270^{\circ}$ edge) just below the
step edge. In this case, the existence at the dip below the step edge can be
understood by assigning each surface with a sign ($+$ or $-$) of the mass of
the surface Dirac fermions. Namely, the 1D helical conducting states at the
step edge and at the dip below the step edge emerge where the mass changes its
sign, as well as the ordinary 1D topological hinge states. Thus, in the both
strong and weak coupling regimes, the emergent 1D helical conducting states
have a topological origin: they originates from the ordinary 1D topological
hinge states. Our finding paves the way for on-demand creation of 1D helical

that below TS about 15 K the anomalous odd Ranxy(T) and even Ranxx(T) parts of
the resistivity tensor may be interpreted in terms of formation of a large size
clusters in the filamentary structure of fluctuating charges (stripes). We
assume that these Ranxy(001) and Ranxy(110) components represent the intrinsic

respectively. An additional ferromagnetic contribution to anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) for both ordinary and anisotropic components in Hall signal was
registered and attributed to the effect of magnetic polarization of 5d states

the wavelength range 4700 - 5400 \r{A} and characterise them as a function of
age, metallicity and alpha element abundance ratios. We analyse eight dEs and
interpret the line strengths, measured in our new high resolution system of

resolution. We obtain abundance ratio proxies for a number of elements that
have never been studied before for dwarf ellipticals outside the Local Group.
These proxies represent relative deviations from predicted index-strengths of
base stellar population models built-up following the abundance pattern of The
Galaxy. The abundance proxy trend results are compared to abundance ratios from
resolved stars in the Local Group, and indices from integrated light of larger
early-type galaxies. We find that all our dwarfs show a pattern of abundance
ratios consistent with the disk of the Milky Way, indicative of slow formation

collective radiative excitations forming nearly flat bands. We drive degenerate
pairs of collective excitations to be equally populated in both cases of the
atomic polarization in the lattice plane and perpendicular to it. At higher
intensities, above specific threshold values, this symmetry in the populations
is spontaneously broken. We also develop an effective few-mode model that
provides semianalytic descriptions of the symmetry-breaking threshold and
infinite-lattice limit phase transition. Surprisingly, we find how excitations
due to dipolar interactions correspond to optical analogs of those found in
frustrated magnets and superfluids, with closely related symmetry-breaking
mechanisms despite the significant physical differences between these systems,
opening potential for simulating even quantum magnetism. Transmitted light
through the array conveys information about symmetry breaking in the hysteresis
behavior of the spectrum. Moreover, in a Mott-insulator state, the atomic
positions are subject to zero-point quantum fluctuations. Interpreting each
stochastic realization as a light-induced quantum measurement of the atomic
position configuration, we find how strong nonlinearities and even weak

breaking, while ensemble-averaging over many realizations restores the original

procedure involved the conceptual replication of two previous studies. We
investigated physics plausibility with 40 participants under two conditions. In
our synchronous condition, we used visuo-tactile stimuli to elicit a body

reclining on an exam table. Our asynchronous condition was otherwise similar,

that movie physics did appear more realistic to participants under the body

exploratory analyses revealed that movie physics were perceived as plausible

various currents. We present the first study of long weakly-nonlinear internal
ring waves in a three-layer fluid in the presence of a background linear shear
current. The leading order of this theory leads to the angular adjustment
equation - a nonlinear first-order differential equation describing the
dependence of the linear long wave speed on the angle to the direction of the
current. Ring waves correspond to singular solution (envelope of the general
solution) of this equation, and they can exist only under certain conditions.
The constructed solutions reveal qualitative differences in the shapes of the
wavefronts of the two baroclinic modes: the wavefront of the faster mode is
elongated in the direction of the current, while the wavefront of the slower
mode is squeezed. Moreover, different regimes are identified according to the
vorticity strength. When the vorticity is weak, part of the wavefront is able
to propagate upstream. However, when the vorticity is strong enough, the whole
wavefront propagates downstream. A richer behaviour can be observed for the
slower mode. As the vorticity increases, singularities of the swallowtail-type
may arise and, eventually, solutions with compact wavefronts crossing the
downstream axis cease to exist. We show that the latter is related to the
long-wave instability of the base flow. We obtain analytical expressions for
the coefficients of the cKdV-type amplitude equation, and numerically model the
evolution of the waves for both modes. The initial evolution is in agreement
with the leading-order predictions for the deformations of the wavefronts.
Then, as the wavefronts expand, strong dispersive effects in the upstream
direction are revealed. Moreover, when nonlinearity is enhanced, fission of
waves can occur in the upstream part of the ring waves.

CNF formulas. Not only is their satisfiability decidable in polynomial time,
but even their models can be counted in closed form. This stands in stark
contrast with other polynomial-time decidable classes, which usually have
algorithms based on backtracking and resolution and for which model counting
remains hard, like 2-SAT and Horn-SAT. However, those resolution-based
algorithms usually easily imply an upper bound on resolution complexity, which
is missing for hitting formulas. Are hitting formulas hard for resolution?
  In this paper we take the first steps towards answering this question. We
show that the resolution complexity of hitting formulas is dominated by
so-called irreducible hitting formulas, first studied by Kullmann and Zhao,
that cannot be composed of smaller hitting formulas. However, by definition,
large irreducible unsatisfiable hitting formulas are difficult to construct; it
is not even known whether infinitely many exist. Building upon our theoretical
results, we implement an efficient algorithm on top of the Nauty software
package to enumerate all irreducible unsatisfiable hitting formulas with up to
14 clauses. We also determine the exact resolution complexity of the generated
hitting formulas with up to 13 clauses by extending a known SAT encoding for
our purposes. Our experimental results suggest that hitting formulas are indeed
hard for resolution.

has been found almost ubiquitously in social networks, both offline and online.
The ENM gauges the tie strength between peers in terms of interaction
frequency, which is easy to measure and provides a good proxy for the time
spent nurturing the relationship. However, advances in signed network analysis
have shown that positive and negative relations play very different roles in
network dynamics. For this reason, this work sets out to investigate the ENM
when including signed relations. The main contributions of this paper are
twofold: firstly, a novel method of signing relationships between individuals
using sentiment analysis and, secondly, an investigation of the properties of
Signed Ego Networks (Ego Networks with signed connections). Signed Ego Networks
are then extracted for the users of eight different Twitter datasets composed
of both specialised users (e.g. journalists) and generic users. We find that
negative links are over-represented in the active part of the Ego Networks of
all types of users, suggesting that Twitter users tend to engage regularly with
negative connections. Further, we observe that negative relationships are
overwhelmingly predominant in the Ego Network circles of specialised users,
hinting at very polarised online interactions for this category of users. In
addition, negative relationships are found disproportionately more at the more
intimate levels of the ENM for journalists, while their percentages are stable
across the circles of the other Twitter users

that aging emerges generically when random interactions are taken between

absorbing values for extended periods of time, with rapid transitions between
these two values. The mechanism for aging is different from the one at play in
usual glassy systems: at long times, the system evolves in the vicinity of
unstable fixed points rather than marginal ones.

phases, namely the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) phase with alternating hopping
only, and the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase with alternating energies only.
The chiral symmetry of the SSH phase is robust in position space, so that it is
preserved in the presence of the ends of a finite system and of textures in the
alternating hopping. However, the chiral symmetry of the CDW wave phase is
nonsymmorphic, resulting in a breaking of the bulk topology by an end or a
texture in the alternating energies. We consider the presence of solitons
(textures in position space separating two degenerate ground states) in finite
systems with open boundary conditions. We identify the parameter range under
which an atomically-sharp soliton in the CDW phase supports a localized state
which lies within the band gap, and we calculate the expectation value $p_y$ of
the nonsymmorphic chiral operator for this state, and the soliton electric
charge. As the spatial extent of the soliton increases beyond the atomic limit,
the energy level approaches zero exponentially quickly or inversely
proportionally to the width, depending on microscopic details of the soliton
texture. In both cases, the difference of $p_y$ from one is inversely
proportional to the soliton width, while the charge is independent of the
width. We investigate the robustness of the soliton level in the presence of
disorder and sample-to-sample parameter variations, comparing with a single
soliton level in the SSH phase with an odd number of sites.

information depends on more than just accuracy. This could happen because the
messages contained within different pieces of information may either be
well-liked or repulsive. Whereas factual information must often convey
uncomfortable truths, misinformation can have little regard for veracity and
leverage psychological processes which increase its attractiveness and
proliferation on social media. In this review, we argue that when
misinformation proliferates, this happens because the social media environment
enables adherence to misinformation by reducing, rather than increasing, the
psychological cost of doing so. We cover how attention may often be shifted
away from accuracy and towards other goals, how social and individual cognition
is affected by misinformation and the cases under which debunking it is most
effective, and how the formation of online groups affects information
consumption patterns, often leading to more polarization and radicalization.
Throughout, we make the case that polarization and misinformation adherence are
closely tied. We identify ways in which the psychological cost of adhering to
misinformation can be increased when designing anti-misinformation
interventions or resilient affordances, and we outline open research questions
that the CSCW community can take up in further understanding this cost.

  This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for

in-the-wild. In contrast to motion transfer, the objective here is not to
imitate the source's motions by the target, but rather to replace the walking
source with the target, while transferring the target's typical gait. Our
approach can be trained only once with multiple sources and is able to transfer
the gait of the target from unseen sources, eliminating the need for retraining
for each new source independently. Furthermore, we propose a novel metrics for
gait transfer based on gait recognition models that enable to quantify the
quality of the transferred gait, and show that existing techniques yield a
discrepancy that can be easily detected.
  We introduce Cycle Transformers GAN (CTrGAN), that consist of a decoder and
encoder, both Transformers, where the attention is on the temporal domain
between complete images rather than the spatial domain between patches. Using a
widely-used gait recognition dataset, we demonstrate that our approach is
capable of producing over an order of magnitude more realistic personalized
gaits than existing methods, even when used with sources that were not

only at specific times during its lifetime $\tau$. Walks are sequences of
adjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or
non-strictly increasingly (i.e., non-decreasing) depending on the scenario.
Paths are temporal walks where each vertex is not traversed twice. A temporal
vertex is a pair $(u,i)$ where $u$ is a vertex and $i\in[\tau]$ a timestep. In
this paper we focus on the questions: (i) are there at least $k$ paths from a
single source $s$ to a single target $t$, no two of which internally intersect
on a temporal vertex? (ii) are there at most $h$ temporal vertices whose
removal disconnects $s$ from $t$? Let $k^*$ be the maximum value $k$ for which
the answer to (i) is YES, and let $h^*$ be the minimum value $h$ for which the
answer to (ii) is YES. In static graphs, $k^*$ and $h^*$ are equal by Menger's
Theorem and this is a crucial property to solve efficiently both (i) and (ii).
In temporal graphs such equality has been investigated only focusing on
disjoint walks rather than disjoint paths. We prove that, when dealing with
non-strictly increasing temporal paths, $k^*$ is equal to $h^*$ if and only if
$k^*$ is 1. We show that this implies a dichotomy for (i), which turns out to
be polynomial-time solvable when $k\le 2$, and NP-complete for $k\ge 3$. In
contrast, we also prove that Menger's version does not hold in the strictly
increasing model and give hardness results also for this case. Finally, we give
hardness results and an XP algorithm for (ii).

the tininess of the RLN, with a diameter typically less than 3mm, poses
significant challenges to the accurate localization of the RLN. In this work,
we propose a knowledge-driven framework for RLN localization, mimicking the
standard approach surgeons take to identify the RLN according to its
surrounding organs. We construct a prior anatomical model based on the inherent
relative spatial relationships between organs. Through Bayesian shape alignment

results indicate that the proposed method achieves superior hit rates and
substantially smaller distance errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.

relaxation time collision operator are employed to approximate the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and a conservative phase field equation
for interface-capturing. In the framework of DUGKS, the first moment of the
distribution function for the hydrodynamic equations is defined as velocity
instead of momentum. Meanwhile, the zeroth moments of the distribution function
and external force are also suitably defined such that a artificial pressure
evolution equation can be recovered. Moreover, the Strang splitting technique
for time integration is employed to avoid the calculation of spatial
derivatives in the force term at cell faces. For the interface-capturing
equation, two equivalent DUGKS methods that deal with the diffusion term
differently using a source term as well as a modified equilibrium distribution
function are presented. Several benchmark tests that cover a wide a range of
density ratios (up to 1000) and Reynolds numbers (up to $10^5$) are
subsequently carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed
scheme. Numerical results are in good agreement with the reference and

using the so-called quantum-classical transition differential equation through

two sources of decoherence of different nature are going to be considered.
Several examples will be presented and discussed in order to illustrate the

developments will be carried out in one dimension throughout all this wok. One
of the main goals is to analyze the gradual decoherence process existing in

self-attention heads and have exhibited enormous potential in natural language
processing tasks. Meanwhile, there have been efforts to adapt transformers to
visual tasks of machine learning, including Vision Transformers and Swin
Transformers. Although some researchers use Vision Transformers for
reinforcement learning tasks, their experiments remain at a small scale due to
the high computational cost. Experiments conducted at a large scale, on the
other hand, have to rely on techniques to cut the costs of Vision Transformers,
which also yield inferior results.
  To address this challenge, this article presents the first online
reinforcement learning scheme that is based on Swin Transformers: Swin DQN.
Swin Transformers are promising as a backbone in neural networks by splitting
groups of image pixels into small patches and applying local self-attention
operations inside the (shifted) windows of fixed sizes. They have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performances in benchmarks. In contrast to existing research,
our novel approach is reducing the computational costs, as well as
significantly improving the performance. We demonstrate the superior
performance with experiments on 49 games in the Arcade Learning Environment.
The results show that our approach, using Swin Transformers with Double DQN,
achieves significantly higher maximal evaluation scores than the baseline
method in 45 of all the 49 games ~92%, and higher mean evaluation scores than
the baseline method in 40 of all the 49 games ~82%.

collective behavior. Examples include coexistence of vapor and liquid-like

known as motility induced phase transition. Similarly to motile unicellular
organisms, active colloids tend to accumulate at confining surfaces forming
dense adsorbed films. In this work, we study the structure and dynamics of
aggregates of self-propelled particle near confining solid surfaces, focusing
on the effects of the particle anisotropic interactions. We performed Langevin
dynamics simulations of two complementary models for active particles:
ellipsoidal particles interacting through Gay-Berne potential, and rod-like
particles composed of several repulsive Lennard-Jones beads. We observe a
non-monotonic behavior of the structure of clusters formed along the confining
surface as a function of the particle aspect ratio, with a film spreading when
particles are near spherical, compact clusters with hedgehog-like particle
orientation for more elongated active particles, and a complex dynamical
behavior for intermediate aspect ratio. The stabilization time of cluster
formation along the confining surface also displays a non-monotonic dependence
on the aspect ratio, with a local minimum at intermediate values. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the hedgehog-like aggregates formed by Gay-Berne ellipsoids
exhibit higher structural stability as compared to the ones formed by purely
repulsive active rods, which are stable due to the particle activity only.

important for defining treatment outcomes and response to therapy, as well as

Quantitative measures of seizure severity would complement existing approaches,
for EEG monitoring, outcome monitoring, and seizure prediction. Therefore, we
developed a library of quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) markers that
assess the spread and intensity of abnormal electrical activity during and
after seizures. Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 1056
seizures from 63 patients. For each seizure, we computed 16 markers of seizure
severity that capture the signal magnitude, spread, duration, and post-ictal
suppression of seizures. Results: Quantitative EEG markers of seizure severity
distinguished focal vs. subclinical and focal vs. FTBTC seizures across
patients. In individual patients, 71% had a moderate to large difference
(ranksum r > 0.3) between focal and subclinical seizures in three or more
markers. Circadian and longer-term changes in severity were found for 67% and
53% of patients, respectively. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of
using quantitative iEEG markers to measure seizure severity. Our quantitative
markers distinguish between seizure types and are therefore sensitive to
established qualitative differences in seizure severity. Our results also
suggest that seizure severity is modulated over different timescales. We
envisage that our proposed seizure severity library will be expanded and
updated in collaboration with the epilepsy research community to include more
measures and modalities.

steps are required for direct comparison to experimental spectra. On modern
spectrometers this is a computationally expensive task due to the large data
volumes collected. In addition, workflows are frequently cumbersome as the
simulation software and experimental data analysis software often do not easily
interface to each other. Here a new package, Euphonic, is presented. Euphonic
is a robust, easy to use and computationally efficient tool designed to be
integrated into experimental software and able to interface directly with the
force constant matrix output of ab-initio codes.

proposed sonification method with visual navigation, which is currently
considered the state of the art. We conducted a phantom study in which 17
surgeons executed the pedicle screw placement task in the lumbar spine, guided
by either the proposed sonification-based or the traditional visual navigation

state of the art while decreasing the surgeon's need to focus on visual
navigation displays instead of the natural focus on surgical tools and targeted

air pocket. A large scale impact typically has a rapidly evolving and disturbed
liquid-gas interface, such that several bubbles are entrapped upon impact.
While it is largely understood how the peak pressure is created by liquid
coming into contact with the solid structure, it is more challenging to
ascertain how an isolated air pocket is pressurised by an impulsive impact, and
how the maximum impact pressure inside this bubble evolves. We study such a
Bagnold-type impulsive compression of an air bubble by performing
well-controlled experiments, where we use an inverted, hollow cone as an
impactor. The cone is kept immersed throughout in a water bath, such that it
encloses an air bubble of known and controlled volume. A high-sensitivity
sensor measures pressures at the vertex of the cone. Using high-speed imaging
we show how incoming liquid deforms the air bubble enclosed in such a geometry,
and how an impact peak is registered inside the bubble, which can be traced
back to the impact of a liquid jet onto the pressure sensor. We compare the
measured pressures to a Bagnold model, and discuss the dominant resonances in
the bubble. From visualisations of the deforming bubble, we also discuss the
air-pocket's deformations, resulting from the presence of surrounding rigid
geometry (such as corrugations in an LNG containment membrane).

  Reproducible Tutorial",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Approximate statistical inference via determination of the asymptotic
distribution of a statistic is routinely used for inference in applied medical
statistics (e.g. to estimate the standard error of the marginal or conditional
risk ratio). One method for variance estimation is the classical Delta-method
but there is a knowledge gap as this method is not routinely included in
training for applied medical statistics and its uses are not widely understood.
Given that a smooth function of an asymptotically normal estimator is also
asymptotically normally distributed, the Delta-method allows approximating the
large-sample variance of a function of an estimator with known large-sample
properties. In a more general setting, it is a technique for approximating the
variance of a functional (i.e., an estimand) that takes a function as an input
and applies another function to it (e.g. the expectation function).
Specifically, we may approximate the variance of the function using the
functional Delta-method based on the influence function (IF). The IF explores
how a functional $\phi(\theta)$ changes in response to small perturbations in
the sample distribution of the estimator and allows computing the empirical
standard error of the distribution of the functional. The ongoing development
of new methods and techniques may pose a challenge for applied statisticians
who are interested in mastering the application of these methods. In this
tutorial, we review the use of the classical and functional Delta-method and
their links to the IF from a practical perspective. We illustrate the methods
using a cancer epidemiology example and we provide reproducible and commented

This paper presents two optimized VVC software decoders, named OpenVVC and
Versatile Video deCoder (VVdeC), designed for low resources platforms. They
exploit optimization techniques such as data level parallelism using Single

using frame, tile and slice-based parallelisms. Furthermore, a comparison in
terms of decoding run time, energy and memory consumption between the two
decoders is presented while targeting two different resource-constraint

decoding of Full High definition (FHD) resolution over the first platform using
8 cores and High-definition (HD) real-time decoding for the second platform
using only 4 cores with comparable results in terms of average consumed energy:
around 26 J and 15 J for the 8 cores and 4 cores embedded platforms,

less average maximum memory consumed during run time compared to VVdeC.

we focus on layer tuning for feed-forward network in the Transformer, namely
FL-tuning. It introduces additional units into the hidden layer of each
feed-forward network. We conduct extensive experiments on the public CLUE

methods under both full-data and few-shot settings in almost all cases. In
particular, it improves accuracy by 17.93% (full-data setting) on WSC 1.0 and

precision unitary test of the PMNS matrix. In this work, we discuss the
possibility of such a measurement with reactor antineutrinos. We find that a
single liquid scintillator detector on a reasonable scale could achieve the
goal. We propose to install a detector of $\sim10$\% energy resolution at about
2.0~km from the reactors with a JUNO-like overburden. The integrated luminosity
requirement is about 150~${\rm kton}\cdot {\rm GW}\cdot {\rm year}$,
corresponding to 4 years' operation of a 4~kton detector near a reactor complex
of 9.2 GW thermal power like Taishan reactor. Unlike the previous $\theta_{13}$
experiments with identical near and far detectors, which can suppress the
systematics especially the rate uncertainty by the near-far relative
measurement and the optimal baseline is at the first oscillation maximum of
about 1.8~km, a single-detector measurement prefers to offset the baseline from
the oscillation maximum. At low statistics $\lesssim 10$~${\rm kton}\cdot {\rm
GW}\cdot {\rm year}$, the rate uncertainty dominates the systematics, and the
optimal baseline is about 1.3~km. At higher statistics, the spectral shape
uncertainty becomes dominant, and the optimal baseline shifts to about 2.0~km.
The optimal baseline keeps being $\sim 2.0$~km for an integrated luminosity up
to $10^6$~${\rm kton}\cdot {\rm GW}\cdot {\rm year}$. We have assumed that the
TAO experiment will improve our understanding of the spectral shape
uncertainty, which gives the highest precision measurement of reactor
antineutrino spectrum for neutrino energy in the range of 3--6~MeV. We find
that the optimal baseline is $\sim 2.9$~km with a flat input spectral shape
uncertainty provided by the future summation or conversion methods' prediction.

from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly
understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that
are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To
constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation
periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using TESS and
MEarth. Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age,
as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can
estimate ages using techniques like white dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology,
and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent
on mass. Fully-convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the
population of 0.2--0.3M$_\odot$ rapid rotators evolving from $P_{\rm rot} < 2$
days at 600 Myr to $2 < P_{\rm rot} < 10$ days at 1--3 Gyr before rapidly
spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify
some variability in the spindown of fully-convective M dwarfs, with a small
number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations
are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where
angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic
field allow spindown to progress rapidly.

anticipating their computing resources ahead of time, frequently leading to
severe resource over- and underprovisioning situations. Our main insight in
this article is, however, that the elasticity and ease of management of
serverless computing technology can be a key enabler for effectively running
these problematic workloads for the first time in the cloud. More concretely,
we demonstrate that with a simple serverless executor pool abstraction one can
achieve a better cost-performance trade-off than a Spark cluster of static size
built upon large EC2 virtual machines. To support this conclusion, we evaluate
three irregular algorithms: Unbalanced Tree Search (UTS), Mandelbrot Set using
the Mariani-Silver algorithm and Betweenness Centrality (BC) on a random graph.
For instance, our serverless implementation of UTS is able to outperform Spark
by up to 55% with the same cost. We also show that a serverless environment can
outperform a large EC2 in the BC algorithm by a 10% using the same amount of
virtual CPUs. This provides the first concrete evidence that highly-parallel,
irregular workloads can be efficiently executed using purely stateless
functions with almost zero burden on users i.e., no need for users to
understand non-obvious system-level parameters and optimizations. Furthermore,
we show that UTS can benefit from the FaaS pay-as-you-go billing model, which
makes it worth for the first time to enable certain application-level

heat and salinity flux from the ice shell induced by the ice thickness gradient

circulation shapes the ice shell. Therefore, understanding the dependence of
the efficiency of ocean heat transport (OHT) on orbital parameters may allow us
to predict the ice shell geometry before direct observation is possible,
providing useful information for mission design. Inspired by previous works on
baroclinic eddies, I first derive scaling laws for the OHT on icy moons, driven
by ice topography, and then verify them against high resolution 3D numerical
simulations. Using the scaling laws, I am then able to make predictions for the
equilibrium ice thickness variation knowing that the ice shell should be close
to heat balance. Ice shell on small icy moons (e.g., Enceladus) may develop
strong thickness variations between the equator and pole driven by the
polar-amplified tidal dissipation in the ice, to the contrary, ice shell on
large icy moons (e.g., Europa, Ganymede, Callisto etc.) tends to be flat due to
the smoothing effects of the efficient OHT. These predictions are manifested by

$\theta$-point character. The metric and topological properties of the ring
polymers depend on the phase, and may change abruptly at the critical point. In
this paper we examine the thermodynamics and linking of two ring polymers close

two polygons interacting with each other. Our results show that the probability
of linking is low in the segregated phase, but that it increases through the

Neural Annotation Refinement (NeAR). It is based on a learnable implicit

the appearance as an input of implicit functions, the appearance-aware NeAR
fixes the annotation artefacts. Our method is demonstrated on the application
of adrenal gland analysis. We first show that the NeAR can repair distorted

develop a new Adrenal gLand ANalysis (ALAN) dataset with the proposed NeAR,
where each case consists of a 3D shape of adrenal gland and its diagnosis label
(normal vs. abnormal) assigned by experts. We show that models trained on the
shapes repaired by the NeAR can diagnose adrenal glands better than the
original ones. The ALAN dataset will be open-source, with 1,584 shapes for
adrenal gland diagnosis, which serves as a new benchmark for medical shape

more empirical evaluations are necessary to understand how developers can
benefit from it effectively. In this paper, we study the capabilities of
Copilot in two different programming tasks: (i) generating (and reproducing)
correct and efficient solutions for fundamental algorithmic problems, and (ii)
comparing Copilot's proposed solutions with those of human programmers on a set
of programming tasks. For the former, we assess the performance and
functionality of Copilot in solving selected fundamental problems in computer
science, like sorting and implementing data structures. In the latter, a
dataset of programming problems with human-provided solutions is used. The
results show that Copilot is capable of providing solutions for almost all
fundamental algorithmic problems, however, some solutions are buggy and
non-reproducible. Moreover, Copilot has some difficulties in combining multiple
methods to generate a solution. Comparing Copilot to humans, our results show
that the correct ratio of humans' solutions is greater than Copilot's
suggestions, while the buggy solutions generated by Copilot require less effort

  Detection",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DS math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the mid-1980s it has been known that Byzantine Agreement can be solved
with probability 1 asynchronously, even against an omniscient, computationally
unbounded adversary that can adaptively \emph{corrupt} up to $f<n/3$ parties.
Moreover, the problem is insoluble with $f\geq n/3$ corruptions. However,
Bracha's 1984 protocol achieved $f<n/3$ resilience at the cost of exponential
expected latency $2^{\Theta(n)}$, a bound that has never been improved in this
model with $f=\lfloor (n-1)/3 \rfloor$ corruptions.
  In this paper we prove that Byzantine Agreement in the asynchronous, full
information model can be solved with probability 1 against an adaptive
adversary that can corrupt $f<n/3$ parties, while incurring only polynomial
latency with high probability. Our protocol follows earlier polynomial latency
protocols of King and Saia and Huang, Pettie, and Zhu, which had suboptimal
resilience, namely $f \approx n/10^9$ and $f<n/4$, respectively.
  Resilience $f=(n-1)/3$ is uniquely difficult as this is the point at which
the influence of the Byzantine and honest players are of roughly equal
strength. The core technical problem we solve is to design a collective
coin-flipping protocol that eventually lets us flip a coin with an unambiguous
outcome. In the beginning the influence of the Byzantine players is too
powerful to overcome and they can essentially fix the coin's behavior at will.
We guarantee that after just a polynomial number of executions of the
coin-flipping protocol, either (a) the Byzantine players fail to fix the
behavior of the coin (thereby ending the game) or (b) we can ``blacklist''
players such that the blacklisting rate for Byzantine players is at least as
large as the blacklisting rate for good players. The blacklisting criterion is
based on a simple statistical test of fraud detection.

vertex $s\in S$ is a server with individual capacity $b_s$. The vertices $r\in

eligible server. The goal is to maximize the size of the constructed matching.
We assume that $G$ is a $(k,d)$-graph~\cite{NW}, where $k$ specifies a lower
bound on the degree of each server and $d$ is an upper bound on the degree of
each request. This setting models matching problems in timely applications.
  We present tight upper and lower bounds on the performance of deterministic
online algorithms. In particular, we develop a new online algorithm via a
primal-dual analysis. The optimal competitive ratio tends to~1, for arbitrary
$k\geq d$, as the server capacities increase. Hence, nearly optimal solutions
can be computed online. Our results also hold for the vertex-weighted problem
extension, and thus for AdWords and auction problems in which each bidder
issues individual, equally valued bids.
  Our bounds improve the previous best competitive ratios. The asymptotic
competitiveness of~1 is a significant improvement over the previous factor of
$1-1/e^{k/d}$, for the interesting range where $k/d\geq 1$ is small. Recall
that $1-1/e\approx 0.63$. Matching problems that admit a competitive ratio
arbitrarily close to~1 are rare. Prior results rely on randomization or

evolution, critical to the formation of compact binaries including
gravitational-wave sources. In the ``classical'' isolated binary evolution
scenario for double compact objects, the CE is usually the second mass transfer
phase. Thus, the donor star of the CE is the product of a previous binary
interaction, often stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF). Because of the accretion
of mass during the first RLOF, the main-sequence core of the accretor star
grows and is ``rejuvenated''. This modifies the core-envelope boundary region
and decreases significantly the envelope binding energy for the remaining
evolution. Comparing accretor stars from self-consistent binary models to stars
evolved as single, we demonstrate that the rejuvenation can lower the energy
required to eject a CE by $\sim 42-96\%$ for both black hole and neutron star
progenitors, depending on the evolutionary stage and final orbital separation.
Therefore, binaries experiencing first stable mass transfer may more easily
survive subsequent CE events and result in possibly wider final separations
compared to current predictions. Despite their high mass, our accretors also
experience extended ``blue loops'', which may have observational consequences
for low-metallicity stellar populations and asteroseismology.

10$^{45.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a redshift of z = 0.128. The K-band spectra
provided by NIFS cover a range of 1.99-2.40 $\mu$m where low-ionization
(Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\delta$), high ionization ([S XI]$\lambda$1.920 $\mu$m and
[Si~VI]$\lambda$1.963 $\mu$m) and warm molecular lines (from H$_2$ 1-0S(5) to
1-0S(1)) are detected, allowing us to study the multi-phase gas kinematics. Our
analysis reveals gas in ordinary rotation in all the emission lines detected
and also outflowing gas in the case of the low- and high-ionization emission
lines. In the case of the nuclear spectrum, which corresponds to a circular
aperture of 0.3\arcsec~(686 pc) in diameter, the warm molecular lines can be
characterized using a single Gaussian component of full width at half maximum
(FWHM)= 350-400 km s$^{-1}$, while Pa$\alpha$, Br$\delta$, and [Si~VI] are best
fitted with two blue-shifted Gaussian components of FWHM$\sim$800 and 1700 km
s$^{-1}$, in addition to a narrow component of $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$. We
interpret the blue-shifted broad components as outflowing gas, which reaches
the highest velocities, of up to $-$840 km s$^{-1}$, in the south-east
direction (PA$\sim$125$^{\circ}$), extending up to a distance of $\sim$3.4 kpc
from the nucleus. The ionized outflow has a maximum mass outflow rate of
$\dot{\text{{M}}}_{\text{{out, max}}}$=42-51 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and its
kinetic power represents 0.1$\%$ of the quasar bolometric luminosity.

special functions for generating very popular polynomial families, such as the

a dust cloud will be be ejected from the body, potentially forming a transient
coma- or comet-like tail on the hours or days following the impact, which might
be observed using ground-based instrumentation. Based on the mass and speed of
the impactor, and using known scaling laws, the total mass ejected can be
roughly estimated. Then, with the aim to provide approximate expected
brightness levels of the coma and tail extent and morphology, we have
propagated the orbits of the particles ejected by integrating their equation of
motion, and have used a Monte Carlo approach to study the evolution of the coma
and tail brightness. For typical power-law particle size distribution of index
--3.5, with radii r$_{rmin}$=1 $\mu$m and r$_{max}$=1 cm, and ejection speeds
near 10 times the escape velocity of Dimorphos, we predict an increase of
brightness of $\sim$3 magnitudes right after the impact, and a decay to
pre-impact levels some 10 days after. That would be the case if the prevailing
ejection mechanism comes from the impact-induced seismic wave. However, if most
of the ejecta is released at speeds of the order of $\gtrsim$100 $\mathrm{m\;

research direction for alleviating data scarcity in the medical domain.
However, in contrast to large-scale fully labeled data commonly seen in general

annotation costs. In this paper, we consider a practical yet under-explored
problem, where underrepresented classes only have few labeled instances
available and only exist in a few clients of the federated system. We show that
standard federated learning approaches fail to learn robust multi-label
classifiers with extreme class imbalance and address it by proposing a novel
federated learning framework, FedFew. FedFew consists of three stages, where
the first stage leverages federated self-supervised learning to learn
class-agnostic representations. In the second stage, the decentralized
partially labeled data are exploited to learn an energy-based multi-label
classifier for the common classes. Finally, the underrepresented classes are
detected based on the energy and a prototype-based nearest-neighbor model is
proposed for few-shot matching. We evaluate FedFew on multi-label thoracic
disease classification tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms the federated
baselines by a large margin.

order to reduce skin friction drag in a fully developed turbulent channel flow
at a low Reynolds number. Motivated by the so-called opposition control (Choi
et al. 1993), in which a control input is applied so as to cancel the
wall-normal velocity fluctuation on a detection plane at a certain distance
from the wall, we consider wall blowing and suction as a control input, and its
spatial distribution is determined by the instantaneous streamwise and
wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the distance of 15 wall units above the
wall. Deep neural network is used to express the complex relationship between
the sensing information and the control input, and it is trained so as to
maximize the expected long-term reward, i.e., drag reduction. When only the
wall-normal velocity fluctuation is measured and a linear network is used, the
present framework successfully reproduces the optimal linear weight for the
opposition control reported in the previous study (Chung & Talha 2011). In
contrast, when a non-linear network is used, more complex control strategies
based on the instantaneous streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations are
obtained. Specifically, the obtained control strategies abruptly switch between
strong wall blowing and suction for downwelling of a high-speed fluid toward
the wall and upwelling of a low-speed fluid away from the wall, respectively.
The obtained control policies lead to drag reduction rates as high as 37 %,
which is higher than 23 % achieved by the conventional opposition control at
the same Reynolds number. The present results indicate that reinforcement
learning can be a novel framework for the development of effective control
strategies through systematic learning based on a large number of trials.

study an index analog of the microcanonical spectrum form factor in
four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. In the large $N$
limit and at large enough energy, the most dominant saddle corresponds to the
black hole in the AdS bulk. This gives rise to the slope that decreases
exponentially for a small imaginary chemical potential, which is a natural
analog of an early time. We find that the `late-time' behavior is governed by
the multi-cut saddles that arise in the index matrix model, which are
non-perturbatively sub-dominant at early times. These saddles become dominant
at late times, preventing the SFF from decaying. These multi-cut saddles
correspond to the orbifolded Euclidean black holes in the AdS bulk, therefore
giving the geometrical interpretation of the `ramp.' Our analysis is done in

features such as sigma holes. It has also been shown that off-center point
charges offer a compact alternative with similar accuracy. Here it is
demonstrated that allowing relocation of charges within a minimally distributed
charge model (MDCM) with respect to their reference atoms is a viable route to
capture changes in the molecular charge distribution depending on geometry. The
approach, referred to as ``flexible MDCM'' (fMDCM) is validated on a number of
small molecules and provides accuracies in the electrostatic potential (ESP) of
0.5 kcal/mol on average compared with reference data from electronic structure
calculations whereas MDCM and point charges have root mean squared errors of a
factor of 2 to 5 higher. In addition, MD simulations in the $NVE$ ensemble
using fMDCM for a box of flexible water molecules with periodic boundary
conditions show a width of 0.1 kcal/mol for the fluctuation around the mean at
300 K on the 10 ns time scale. The accuracy in capturing the geometry
dependence of the ESP together with the long-time stability in energy
conserving simulations makes fMDCM a promising tool to introduce advanced
electrostatics into atomistic simulations.

  An evaluation of antipsychotic drug treatment safety",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat serious mental illnesses, but
concerns remain about their metabolic risks. Randomized trials have focused on
the risk factors for diabetes rather than diabetes itself; observational
studies have examined diabetes, but have pooled antipsychotics to compare
classes or compared specific drugs to no drug. We estimate the causal effects
of six antipsychotics in the absence of randomization within a cohort of nearly
39,000 adults with serious mental illness. Doubly-robust estimators, such as
targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE), require correct specification of
either the treatment model or outcome model to ensure consistent estimation;
however, common TMLE implementations estimate treatment probabilities using
multiple binomial regressions rather than multinomial regression. We implement
a TMLE estimator that uses multinomial treatment assignment and ensemble
machine learning to estimate average treatment effects. Our implementation
achieves superior coverage probability relative to the binomial implementation
in simulation experiments with varying treatment propensity overlap and event
rates. We evaluate the causal effects of the antipsychotics on 3-year diabetes
risk or death. We find a safety benefit of moving from a second-generation drug
considered among the safest of the second-generation drugs to an infrequently
prescribed first-generation drug thought to pose a generally low
cardiometabolic risk.

handedness of the misalignment between the dust filaments and the sky-projected
magnetic field produces $TB$ signals. However, it remains unclear whether the

aims to make a quantitative statement about how confidently the

DUSTFILAMENTS code to simulate the dust emission from filaments whose magnetic
misalignment angles are symmetrically randomized, and construct the probability

Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
has not yet mastered. This popular game has an enormous game tree on the order
of $10^{535}$ nodes, i.e., $10^{175}$ times larger than that of Go. It has the
additional complexity of requiring decision-making under imperfect information,
similar to Texas hold'em poker, which has a significantly smaller game tree (on
the order of $10^{164}$ nodes). Decisions in Stratego are made over a large
number of discrete actions with no obvious link between action and outcome.
Episodes are long, with often hundreds of moves before a player wins, and
situations in Stratego can not easily be broken down into manageably-sized
sub-problems as in poker. For these reasons, Stratego has been a grand
challenge for the field of AI for decades, and existing AI methods barely reach
an amateur level of play. DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep
reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego
via self-play. The Regularised Nash Dynamics (R-NaD) algorithm, a key component
of DeepNash, converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium, instead of 'cycling'
around it, by directly modifying the underlying multi-agent learning dynamics.
DeepNash beats existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a
yearly (2022) and all-time top-3 rank on the Gravon games platform, competing
with human expert players.

To elucidate these problems, we investigate higher-order spectral clustering
from a statistical perspective. In particular, we theoretically study the
clustering performance of higher-order spectral clustering under a weighted
stochastic block model and compare the resulting bounds with the corresponding
results of edge-based spectral clustering. It turns out that when the network
is dense with weak signal of weights, higher-order spectral clustering can
really lead to the performance gain in clustering. We also use simulations and

with their corresponding visual representation without deteriorating the
knowledge captured by textual distributional information. We apply our model to
a behavioral experiment reported by G\""unther et al. (2020), which addresses
the plausibility of having visual mental representations for abstract words.
Our evaluation results show that: (1) It is possible to predict human behaviour

Effects (AMMI) model. However, as data frequently can be high-dimensional,
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches can be computationally infeasible.
In this article, we consider a variational inference approach for such a model.
We derive variational approximations for estimating the parameters and we
compare the approximations to MCMC using both simulated and real data. The new
inferential framework we propose is on average two times faster whilst
maintaining the same predictive performance as MCMC.

have been successful on flourish tasks over graph data. However, recent studies
have shown that attackers can catastrophically degrade the performance of GNNs
by maliciously modifying the graph structure. A straightforward solution to
remedy this issue is to model the edge weights by learning a metric function
between pairwise representations of two end nodes, which attempts to assign low
weights to adversarial edges. The existing methods use either raw features or
representations learned by supervised GNNs to model the edge weights. However,
both strategies are faced with some immediate problems: raw features cannot
represent various properties of nodes (e.g., structure information), and
representations learned by supervised GNN may suffer from the poor performance
of the classifier on the poisoned graph. We need representations that carry
both feature information and as mush correct structure information as possible
and are insensitive to structural perturbations. To this end, we propose an
unsupervised pipeline, named STABLE, to optimize the graph structure. Finally,
we input the well-refined graph into a downstream classifier. For this part, we
design an advanced GCN that significantly enhances the robustness of vanilla
GCN without increasing the time complexity. Extensive experiments on four
real-world graph benchmarks demonstrate that STABLE outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods and successfully defends against various attacks.

the way node activity is calculated and normal-izing scarce topics and large

within the framework of nonlinear elasticity. First, the 3D governing system
for a general multi-layered hyperelastic plate is established, which
incorporates the growth effect, and the material and geometrical parameters of
the different layers. Then, a series expansion-truncation approach is adopted
to eliminate the thickness variables in the 3D governing system. An elaborate
calculation scheme is applied to derive the iteration relations of the
coefficient functions in the series expansions. Through some further
manipulations, a 2D vector plate equation system with the associated boundary
conditions is established, which only contains the unknowns in the bottom layer
of the plate. To show the efficiency of the current plate theory, three typical
examples regarding the growth-induced deformations and instabilities of
multi-layered plate samples are studied. Some analytical and numerical
solutions to the plate equation are obtained, which can provide accurate
predictions on the growth behaviors of the plate samples. Furthermore, the
problem of `shape-programming' of multi-layered hyperelastic plates through
differential growth is studied. The explicit formulas of shape-programming for
some typical multi-layered plates are derived, which involve the fundamental
quantities of the 3D target shapes. By using these formulas, the shape
evolutions of the plates during the growing processes can be controlled
accurately. The results obtained in the current work are helpful for the design
of intelligent soft devices with multi-layered plate structures.

Following the electron flavor evolution of the neutrino system is essential for

elements they produce. Accurately accounting for flavor transformation in these
environments is challenging for a number of reasons, including the large number
of neutrinos involved, the small spatial scale of the oscillation, and the
nonlinearity of the system. We take a step in addressing these issues by
presenting a method which describes the neutrino fields in terms of angular
moments. Our moment method successfully describes the fast flavor neutrino
transformation phenomenon which is expected to occur in regions close to the
central object. We apply our moment method to neutron star merger conditions
and show that we are able to capture the three phases of growth, saturation,
and decoherence by comparing with particle-in-cell calculations. We also
determine the size of the growing fluctuations in the neutrino field.

how it is produced, depend on the type of chain used. For a chain made of rods
that are slightly tilted from horizontal, the impact-induced tension is readily
observable. Here are reported experimental observations on such a falling chain
for two different situations: when the chain strikes an inclined surface, and
when the chain's mass density decreases with height. It is found that both of
these arrangements can increase the downward acceleration. To quantitatively
describe these observations a theoretical model is developed. The model

special case with the vanishing electromagnetic charge, namely
Damour-Solodukhin (DS) wormhole). It was shown that the photon sphere for
Schwarzschild-like wormhole presents for both thin and thick accretion disks
and even for the vanishing tidal forces. Moreover, it was observed that
$r_{\mathrm{ph}}\to\infty$ as $\alpha\to\infty$, which constraints $\alpha$
parameter to be sufficiently small and positive in order to respect the EHT
observations. On the other hand, for the case of RS wormhole, photon sphere
radius shrinks as $\Lambda\to\infty$, as it was predicted by the effective
potential. In addition to the accretion disks, we as well probe the
relativistic jets around two wormhole solutions of our consideration. Finally,
with the help of star bulb microlensing, we approximate the radius of the
wormhole shadow and as we found out, for Schild WH, $R_{\mathrm{Sh}}\approx
r_0$ for ZTF and grows linearly with $\alpha$. On the contrary, shadow radius
for charged wormholes slowly decreases with the growing trend of DS parameter
$\Lambda$.

objective function is the maximum component function and the feasible region is
defined as a system of fuzzy relational equalities (FRE) defined by the Dombi
t-norm. Dombi family of t-norms includes a parametric family of continuous
strict t-norms, whose members are increasing functions of the parameter. This
family of t-norms covers the whole spectrum of t-norms when the parameter is
changed from zero to infinity. Since the feasible solutions set of FREs is
non-convex and the finding of all minimal solutions is an NP-hard problem,
designing an efficient solution procedure for solving such problems is not a
trivial job. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to determine
the feasibility of the problem. The feasible solution set is characterized in
terms of a finite number of closed convex cells. An algorithm is presented for
solving this nonlinear problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the
exact optimal solution and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed
algorithm.

The aim of the article is: to formulate criteria for the complexity (from the
above point of view) of these representations and to demonstrate their
application by examples of comparing Ree-Hoover representations of virial
coefficients and such representations of power series coefficients that are
based on the conception of the frame classification of labeled graphs.
  To solve these problems, mathematical notions were introduced (such as a base
product, a base integral, a base linear combination of integrals, a base linear
combination of integrals with coefficients of negligible complexity, a base set
of base linear combinations of integrals with coefficients of negligible
complexity); and a classification of representations of coefficients of power
series of classical statistical mechanics is proposed. In this classification
the class of base linear combinations of integrals with coefficients of
negligible complexity is the most important class. It includes the most
well-known representations of the coefficients of power series of classical
statistical mechanics.
  Three criteria are formulated to estimate the comparative complexity of base
linear combinations of integrals with coefficients of negligible complexity and
their extensions to the totality of base sets of base linear combinations of
integrals with coefficients of negligible complexity are constructed. The
application of all the constructed criteria is demonstrated by examples of
comparing with each other of the above power series coefficients
representations. The obtained results are presented in the tables and
commented.

propose a measure of the numerical error which detects numerical instabilities

Integrated Inference and Machine Learning (IIML), is presented to improve the
predictive accuracy of physical models. In contrast to parameter calibration,
this work seeks corrections to the structure of the model by a) inferring
augmentation fields that are consistent with the underlying model, and b)
transforming these fields into corrective model forms. The proposed approach
couples the inference and learning steps in a weak sense via an alternating
optimization approach. This coupling ensures that the augmentation fields
remain learnable and maintain consistent functional relationships with local
modeled quantities across the training dataset. An iterative solution procedure
is presented in this paper, removing the need to embed the augmentation
function during the inference process. This framework is used to infer an
augmentation introduced within a Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
model using a small amount of training data (from only 14 training cases.)
These training cases belong to a dataset consisting of high-fidelity simulation
data obtained from a high-fidelity model of a first generation Toyota Mirai.
All cases in this dataset are characterized by different inflow and outflow
conditions on the same geometry. When tested on 1224 different configurations,
the inferred augmentation significantly improves the predictive accuracy for a
wide range of physical conditions. Predictions and available data for the
current density distribution are also compared to demonstrate the predictive
capability of the model for quantities of interest which were not involved in
the inference process. The results demonstrate that the weakly-coupled IIML
framework offers sophisticated and robust model augmentation capabilities
without requiring extensive changes to the numerical solver.
