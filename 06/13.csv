wide spectrum of real applications such as image classification, face/speech
recognition, fraud detection, and so on. In addition to many important machine
learning tasks, as artificial networks emulating the way brain cells function,
DNNs also show the capability of storing non-linear relationships between input
and output data, which exhibits the potential of storing data via DNNs. We
envision a new paradigm of data storage, ""DNN-as-a-Database"", where data are
encoded in well-trained machine learning models. Compared with conventional
data storage that directly records data in raw formats, learning-based
structures (e.g., DNN) can implicitly encode data pairs of inputs and outputs
and compute/materialize actual output data of different resolutions only if
input data are provided. This new paradigm can greatly enhance the data
security by allowing flexible data privacy settings on different levels,
achieve low space consumption and fast computation with the acceleration of new
hardware (e.g., Diffractive Neural Network and AI chips), and can be
generalized to distributed DNN-based storage/computing. In this paper, we
propose this novel concept of learning-based data storage, which utilizes a
learning structure called learning-based memory unit (LMU), to store, organize,
and retrieve data. As a case study, we use DNNs as the engine in the LMU, and
study the data capacity and accuracy of the DNN-based data storage. Our
preliminary experimental results show the feasibility of the learning-based
data storage by achieving high (100%) accuracy of the DNN storage. We explore
and design effective solutions to utilize the DNN-based data storage to manage
and query relational tables. We discuss how to generalize our solutions to
other data types (e.g., graphs) and environments such as distributed DNN
storage/computing.

challenging task. To further enhance WSI visual representations, existing
methods have explored image pyramids, instead of single-resolution images, in
WSIs. In spite of this, they still face two major problems: high computational
cost and the unnoticed semantical gap in multi-resolution feature fusion. To
tackle these problems, this paper proposes to efficiently exploit WSI pyramids
from a new perspective, the dual-stream network with cross-attention (DSCA).
Our key idea is to utilize two sub-streams to process the WSI patches with two
resolutions, where a square pooling is devised in a high-resolution stream to
significantly reduce computational costs, and a cross-attention-based method is
proposed to properly handle the fusion of dual-stream features. We validate our
DSCA on three publicly-available datasets with a total number of 3,101 WSIs
from 1,911 patients. Our experiments and ablation studies verify that (i) the
proposed DSCA could outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in cancer
prognosis, by an average C-Index improvement of around 4.6%; (ii) our DSCA
network is more efficient in computation -- it has more learnable parameters
(6.31M vs. 860.18K) but less computational costs (2.51G vs. 4.94G), compared to
a typical existing multi-resolution network. (iii) the key components of DSCA,
dual-stream and cross-attention, indeed contribute to our model's performance,
gaining an average C-Index rise of around 2.0% while maintaining a
relatively-small computational load. Our DSCA could serve as an alternative and
effective tool for WSI-based cancer prognosis.

unitarity and microcausality are preserved. In this work, we study both
possible issues. We found that microcausality is preserved due to the
cancellation of residues occurring in pairs or conjugate pairs when they become

In this study, we show that such noise can be reduced in offline data analysis
by utilizing a method called Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Here the ICA
model is extended from the one studied in iKAGRA data analysis by incorporating
frequency dependence while linearity and stationarity of the couplings are
still assumed. By using optimal witness sensors, those two dominant

articles are significant steps in the correct direction. However, they do not
completely answer the nagging question of when serverless ML training can be

significance filter, to make indirect communication more effective, and on the
other hand, a scale-in auto-tuner, to reduce cost by benefiting from the FaaS
sub-second billing model (often per 100ms). Our results certify that MLLess can
be 15X faster than serverful ML systems at a lower cost for sparse ML models
that exhibit fast convergence such as sparse logistic regression and matrix
factorization. Furthermore, our results show that MLLess can easily scale out

Bayesian optimization (BO), a black-box optimization algorithm. Its core idea
is to automatically tune the internal parameter of FSS by solving an
optimization problem using BO. The tuning procedure only requires online
execution time measurement of the target loop. In order to apply BO, we model
the execution time using two Gaussian process (GP) probabilistic machine
learning models. Notably, we propose a locality-aware GP model, which assumes
that the temporal locality effect resembles an exponentially decreasing
function. By accurately modeling the temporal locality effect, our
locality-aware GP model accelerates the convergence of BO. We implemented BO
FSS on the GCC implementation of the OpenMP standard and evaluated its
performance against other scheduling algorithms. Also, to quantify our method's
performance variation on different workloads, or workload-robustness in our
terms, we measure the minimax regret. According to the minimax regret, BO FSS
shows more consistent performance than other algorithms. Within the considered
workloads, BO FSS improves the execution time of FSS by as much as 22% and 5%

interventions in populations defined by substantive priorities. Existing
methods to answer such questions typically require a measured covariate set
sufficient to control confounding, which can be questionable in observational
studies. Differences-in-differences relies instead on the parallel trends
assumption, allowing for some types of time-invariant unmeasured confounding.
However, most existing difference-in-differences implementations are limited to
point treatments in restricted subpopulations. We derive identification results
for population effects of sustained treatments under parallel trends
assumptions. In particular, in settings where all individuals begin follow-up
with exposure status consistent with the treatment plan of interest but may
deviate at later times, a version of Robins' g-formula identifies the
intervention-specific mean under SUTVA, positivity, and parallel trends. We
develop consistent asymptotically normal estimators based on
inverse-probability weighting, outcome regression, and a double robust
estimator based on targeted maximum likelihood. Simulation studies confirm
theoretical results and support the use of the proposed estimators at realistic
sample sizes. As an example, the methods are used to estimate the effect of a
hypothetical federal stay-at-home order on all-cause mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020 in the United States.

Mol, Pascal Gehring","Electronic measurements of entropy in meso- and nanoscale systems","13 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Entropy is one of the most fundamental quantities in physics. For systems
with few degrees of freedom, the value of entropy provides a powerful insight
into its microscopic dynamics, such as the number, degeneracy and relative
energies of electronic states, the value of spin, degree of localisation and
entanglement, and the emergence of exotic states such as non-Abelian anyons. As
the size of a system decreases, the conventional methods for measuring entropy,
based on heat capacity, quickly become infeasible due to the requirement of
increasingly accurate measurements of heat. Several methods to directly measure
entropy of mesoscopic quantum systems have recently been developed. These
methods use electronic measurements of charge, conductance and thermocurrent,
rather than heat, and have been successfully applied to a wide range of
systems, from quantum dots and molecules, to quantum Hall states and twisted
bilayer graphene. In this Review, we provide an overview of electronic direct
entropy measurement methods, discuss their theoretical background, compare
their ranges of applicability and look into the directions for their future
extensions and applications.

Numerous types of variable stars were classified using photometric data

class of YSOs showing brightness variability. We analysed 79 375 sources
classified as YSO candidates to validate their young nature and investigate the
completeness and purity of the sample. Methods. We cross-matched the Gaia DR3
YSO sample with numerous catalogues from the literature, including YSO
catalogues based on optical and infrared data, as well as catalogues of
extragalactic sources and Galactic variable stars. YSO catalogues were used to
quantify the completeness of the Gaia DR3 YSO sample, while others were
inspected to calculate the contamination. Results. Among the 79 375 potential
Young Stellar Object candidates published in the Gaia DR3 variable star
catalogue, the majority of these objects are distributed along the line of
sight of well-known Star Forming Regions and the Galactic mid-plane. We found
that the contamination level is well below 1%, while the completeness is also
at the percent level, taking into account that the Gaia DR3 YSO sample is based
on sources that showed significant variability during the data collection
period. The number of sources in our sample that were never catalogued before
as YSO candidates is in the order of $\sim$40 000 objects.

Erdos conjectured that the random 2-edge-coloring minimizes the number of

to all graphs. In the late 1980s, the conjectures were disproved by Thomason

monochromatic copies is minimized by the random 2-edge-coloring, which are
referred to as common graphs, remains a challenging open problem. If
Sidorenko's Conjecture, one of the most significant open problems in extremal
graph theory, is true, then every 2-chromatic graph is common, and in fact, no
2-chromatic common graph unsettled for Sidorenko's Conjecture is known. While

  A linear code is said to have locality $r$ if each of its code symbols can be
repaired by accessing at most $r$ other code symbols. For an LRC with length
$n$, dimension $k$ and locality $r$, its minimum distance $d$ was proved to

consisting of all chains of subspaces $(V_{k_1}\subset\cdots\subset V_{k_l})$
inside $\mathbb{R}^n$, where each $V_k$ has dimension $k$. Lusztig (1994, 1998)
introduced the totally positive part $\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{>0}$ as the
subset of partial flags which can be represented by a totally positive $n\times
n$ matrix, and defined the totally nonnegative part
$\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{\ge 0}$ as the closure of
$\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{>0}$. On the other hand, following Postnikov
(2007), we define $\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{\Delta>0}$ and
$\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{\Delta\ge 0}$ as the subsets of
$\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}$ where all Pl\""{u}cker coordinates are positive
and nonnegative, respectively. It follows from the definitions that Lusztig's
total positivity implies Pl\""{u}cker positivity, and it is natural to ask when
these two notions of positivity agree. Rietsch (2009) proved that they agree in
the case of the Grassmannian $\text{Fl}_{k;n}$, and Chevalier (2011) showed
that the two notions are distinct for $\text{Fl}_{1,3;4}$. We show that in
general, the two notions agree if and only if $k_1, \dots, k_l$ are consecutive
integers. We give an elementary proof of this result (including for the case of
Grassmannians) based on classical results in linear algebra and the theory of
total positivity. We also show that the cell decomposition of
$\text{Fl}_{k_1,\dots,k_l;n}^{\ge 0}$ coincides with its matroid decomposition
if and only if $k_1,\dots,k_l$ are consecutive integers, which was previously
only known for complete flag varieties, Grassmannians, and $\text{Fl}_{1,3;4}$.
Finally, we determine which notions of positivity are compatible with a natural
action of the cyclic group of order $n$ that rotates the index set.

phase to a final temperature below the critical point $T_F \ll T_c$, the
non-conserved order parameter dynamics of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic
Ising model on a square lattice (2dIM) initially approaches the critical
percolation state before entering the coarsening regime. This approach involves
two timescales associated with the first appearance (at time $t_{{\rm p}_1}>0$)
and stabilization (at time $t_{\rm p}>t_{{\rm p}_1}$) of a giant percolation
cluster, as previously reported. However, the microscopic mechanisms that
control such timescales are not yet fully understood. In this paper, in order
to study their role on each time regime after the quench ($T_F=0$), we
distinguish between spin flips that decrease the total energy of the system
from those that keep it constant, the latter being parametrized by the
probability $p$. We show that the cluster size heterogeneity $H(t,p)$ and the
typical domain size $\ell (t,p)$ have no dependence on $p$ in the first time
regime up to $t_{{\rm p}_1}$. On the other hand, the time for stabilizing a
percolating cluster is controlled by the acceptance probability of
constant-energy flips: $t_{\rm p}(p) \sim p^{-1}$ for $p\ll 1$ (at $p=0$, the
dynamics gets stuck in a metastable state). These flips are also the relevant
ones in the later coarsening regime where dynamical scaling takes place.
Because the phenomenology on the approach to the percolation point seems to be
shared by many 2d systems with a non-conserved order parameter dynamics (and
certain cases of conserved ones as well), our results may suggest a simple and
effective way to set, through the dynamics itself, $t_{{\rm p}_1}$ and $t_{\rm
p}$ in such systems.

new update rule aims at a faster value improvement without compromising

this tension can be ameliorated. Here, we investigate a Z3 symmetric effective
field theory incorporating a fermionic dark matter that semi-annihilates to
right-handed neutrinos (RHN). The dynamics of the RHN and the impact of its
late decays are also scrutinised while obtaining the correct DM relic. Finally,
indirect detection bounds on the semi-annihilation cross-sections are drawn
from the gamma-ray observations in the direction of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies
(Fermi-LAT), and including the projections obtained for the H.E.S.S. and the
CTA detectors.

damage to tooling, production downtimes and low quality products. Automatic,
fast and cheap strategies to estimate essential material properties for quality
control, risk mitigation and the prediction of faults are highly desirable. In
this work we analyse a high throughput production line of steel-based products.
Currently, the material quality is checked using manual destructive testing,
which is slow, wasteful and covers only a tiny fraction of the material. To
achieve complete testing coverage our industrial collaborator developed a
contactless, non-invasive, electromagnetic sensor to measure all material
during production in real-time. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We show in a
controlled experiment that the sensor can distinguish steel with deliberately
altered properties. 2) 48 steel coils were fully measured non-invasively and
additional destructive tests were conducted on samples to serve as ground
truth. A linear model is fitted to predict from the non-invasive measurements
two key material properties (yield strength and tensile strength) that normally
are obtained by destructive tests. The performance is evaluated in
leave-one-coil-out cross-validation. 3) The resulting model is used to analyse
the material properties and the relationship with logged product faults on real
production data of ~108 km of processed material measured with the non-invasive
sensor. The model achieves an excellent performance (F3-score of 0.95)
predicting material running out of specifications for the tensile strength. The
combination of model predictions and logged product faults shows that if a
significant percentage of estimated yield stress values is out of
specification, the risk of product faults is high. Our analysis demonstrates
promising directions for real-time quality control, risk monitoring and fault
detection.

on storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs) and demands a ransom to
restore data for users. To bypass existing defenses, ransomware would keep
evolving and performing new attack models. For instance, we identify and
validate three new attacks, including (1) garbage-collection (GC) attack that
exploits storage capacity and keeps writing data to trigger GC and force SSDs
to release the retained data; (2) timing attack that intentionally slows down
the pace of encrypting data and hides its I/O patterns to escape existing
defense; (3) trimming attack that utilizes the trim command available in SSDs
to physically erase data.
  To enhance the robustness of SSDs against these attacks, we propose RSSD, a
ransomware-aware SSD. It redesigns the flash management of SSDs for enabling
the hardware-assisted logging, which can conservatively retain older versions
of user data and received storage operations in time order with low overhead.
It also employs hardware-isolated NVMe over Ethernet to expand local storage
capacity by transparently offloading the logs to remote cloud/servers in a
secure manner. RSSD enables post-attack analysis by building a trusted evidence
chain of storage operations to assist the investigation of ransomware attacks.
We develop RSSD with a real-world SSD FPGA board. Our evaluation shows that
RSSD can defend against new and future ransomware attacks, while introducing
negligible performance overhead.

first identify a set of sufficient conditions under which an exact relationship
can be obtained. Then, we prove bounds (easily computable through marginal
fairness and other meaningful statistical quantities) in high-probability on
intersectional fairness in the general case. Beyond their descriptive value, we
show that these theoretical bounds can be leveraged to derive a heuristic
improving the approximation and bounds of intersectional fairness by choosing,

  without Full Data Shuffle"". https://doi.org/10.1145/3514221.3526150",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the cornerstone of modern machine
learning (ML) systems. Despite its computational efficiency, SGD requires
random data access that is inherently inefficient when implemented in systems
that rely on block-addressable secondary storage such as HDD and SSD, e.g.,
TensorFlow/PyTorch and in-DB ML systems over large files. To address this
impedance mismatch, various data shuffling strategies have been proposed to
balance the convergence rate of SGD (which favors randomness) and its I/O
performance (which favors sequential access).
  In this paper, we first conduct a systematic empirical study on existing data
shuffling strategies, which reveals that all existing strategies have room for
improvement -- they all suffer in terms of I/O performance or convergence rate.
With this in mind, we propose a simple but novel hierarchical data shuffling
strategy, CorgiPile. Compared with existing strategies, CorgiPile avoids a full
data shuffle while maintaining comparable convergence rate of SGD as if a full
shuffle were performed. We provide a non-trivial theoretical analysis of
CorgiPile on its convergence behavior. We further integrate CorgiPile into
PyTorch by designing new parallel/distributed shuffle operators inside a new
CorgiPileDataSet API. We also integrate CorgiPile into PostgreSQL by
introducing three new physical operators with optimizations. Our experimental
results show that CorgiPile can achieve comparable convergence rate with the
full shuffle based SGD for both deep learning and generalized linear models.
For deep learning models on ImageNet dataset, CorgiPile is 1.5X faster than

The
power of learning frameworks in solving hard inverse-problems provides an
appealing case for the development of `physical learning' in which physical
systems adopt desirable properties on their own without computational design.
It was recently realized that large classes of physical systems can physically
learn through local learning rules, autonomously adapting their parameters in
response to observed examples of use. We review recent work in the emerging
field of physical learning, describing theoretical and experimental advances in
areas ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical
materials. Physical learning machines provide multiple practical advantages
over computer designed ones, in particular by not requiring an accurate model
of the system, and their ability to autonomously adapt to changing needs over
time. As theoretical constructs, physical learning machines afford a novel
perspective on how physical constraints modify abstract learning theory.

with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is
applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves
through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically-driven in the
direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive
reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the
high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the
leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation
of the Berry connection, curvature and Chern number by analyzing the local
behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum.
Examples include honeycomb, Lieb and kagome lattices. In the nonlinear regime
novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the
honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small
nonlinear effects a striking spiral patterns occurs; as nonlinearity increases
localized structures emerge and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves
collapse.

uncertainty-aware audiovisual fusion approach that quantifies modality-wise
uncertainty towards emotion prediction. To this end, we propose a novel fusion
framework in which we first learn latent distributions over audiovisual
temporal context vectors separately, and then constrain the variance vectors of
unimodal latent distributions so that they represent the amount of information
each modality provides w.r.t. emotion recognition. In particular, we impose
Calibration and Ordinal Ranking constraints on the variance vectors of
audiovisual latent distributions. When well-calibrated, modality-wise
uncertainty scores indicate how much their corresponding predictions may differ
from the ground truth labels. Well-ranked uncertainty scores allow the ordinal
ranking of different frames across the modalities. To jointly impose both these
constraints, we propose a softmax distributional matching loss. In both
classification and regression settings, we compare our uncertainty-aware fusion
model with standard model-agnostic fusion baselines. Our evaluation on two
emotion recognition corpora, AVEC 2019 CES and IEMOCAP, shows that audiovisual
emotion recognition can considerably benefit from well-calibrated and

We propose Omnidirectional Distance Fields (ODFs), a new 3D shape

methods that are limited to representing closed surfaces, ODFs are unsigned and
can thus model open surfaces (e.g., garments). We demonstrate that ODFs can be
effectively learned with a neural network (NeuralODF) despite the inherent
discontinuities at occlusion boundaries. We also introduce efficient forward
mapping algorithms for transforming ODFs to and from common 3D representations.
Specifically, we introduce an efficient Jumping Cubes algorithm for generating
meshes from ODFs. Experiments demonstrate that NeuralODF can learn to capture
high-quality shape by overfitting to a single object, and also learn to
generalize on common shape categories.

Halliwell and Louko that creation from nothing corresponds in this model to
setting the initial volume to zero. We find that the only acceptable version of

the condition of smooth closure (absence of a conical singularity). The
resulting wave function predicts an inflating universe of high anisotropy,

this paper, we present a FisheyeEX method that extends the FoV of the fisheye

scenes. Compared with the rectangle and undistorted image, there are two
challenges for fisheye image outpainting: irregular painting regions and
distortion synthesis. Observing the radial symmetry of the fisheye image, we
first propose a polar outpainting strategy to extrapolate the coherent
semantics from the center to the outside region. Such an outpainting manner
considers the distribution pattern of radial distortion and the circle
boundary, boosting a more reasonable completion direction. For the distortion
synthesis, we propose a spiral distortion-aware perception module, in which the
learning path keeps consistent with the distortion prior of the fisheye image.
Subsequently, a scene revision module rearranges the generated pixels with the
estimated distortion to match the fisheye image, thus extending the FoV. In the

thousand have $\geq$2 pulsed photons. These rare pairs encode information about
the variability of pulse amplitude and shape. We have cataloged such pairs and
find the observed number to be in good agreement with simple Poisson
statistics, limiting any amplitude variations to $<$19% (Vela) and $<$22%
(Geminga) at 2$\sigma$ confidence. Using an array of basis functions to model
pulse shape variability, the observed pulse phase distribution of the pairs
limits the scale of pulse shape variations of Vela to $<$13% while for Geminga
we find a hint of $\sim$20% single-pulse shape variability most associated with
the pulse peaks. If variations last longer than a single rotation, more pairs
can be collected, and we have calculated upper limits on amplitude and shape
variations for assumed coherence times up to 100 rotations, finding limits of
$\sim$1% (amplitude) and $\sim$3% (shape) for both pulsars. Because a large

production, we conclude that the magnetospheres of these two energetic pulsars
are stable over one rotation and very stable on longer time scales. All other

replica-averaging, has been developed to study the influence of flow on
mechanical force-mediated polymer processes such as denaturation and breaking
of bonds. This method considerably mitigates the unphysical prediction of
force-mediated events inherent in Brownian dynamics (BD) polymer chain
simulations that employ instantaneous force profile-based criteria to identify
the occurrence of such events. This inaccuracy in predicting force-mediated
event kinetics is due to high fluctuations of the instantaneous force profile
around the average force. Replica-averaging reduces such high fluctuation
effects by computing a force profile that faithfully represents the average
force profile of the polymer chain conformation, which is then used to predict
reactive events. For transient conformation conditions, the replica-averaged
method more accurately predicts mechano-reactive kinetics than the
time-averaged method, typically employed to reduce the unphysical prediction of
force-mediated events in BD simulations. Further, the influence of the proposed
replica-averaging method parameters on the accuracy of predicting the true
average force profile along the polymer is discussed.

novel data augmentation random quality mixup (RQMixUp) is combined with
snapshot ensembling to train G-Specialist. During each training cycle of
G-Specialist, a model is fine-tuned on the synthetic images generated by
RQMixup, intermixing clean and distorted images of a particular distortion at a
randomly chosen level. Resultantly, each snapshot in the ensemble gained
expertise on several distortion levels, with shallow skills on other quality

higher accuracy. The learning process has no additional cost due to a single
training process to train experts, compatible with a wide range of supervised

Previous HST STIS coronagraphic imaging did not detect flux along the minor
axis of the disk which could suggest a face-on geometry with two 'clumps' of
dust. These ALMA observations reveal a disk with a strikingly different
structure. In order to fit models to the millimeter visibilities and constrain
the uncertainties on the disk parameters, we adopt an MCMC approach. This is
the most eccentric debris disk observed to date with a forced eccentricity of
$0.21\pm0.02$, nearly twice that of the Fomalhaut debris disk, and also
displays apocenter glow. Although this eccentric model fits the outer debris
disk well, there are significant interior residuals remaining that may suggest
a possible edge-on inner disk, which remains unresolved in these observations.
Combined with the observed structure difference between HST and ALMA, these
results suggest a potential previous scattering event or dynamical instability
in this system. We also note that the stellar flux changes considerably over
the course of our observations, suggesting flaring at millimeter wavelengths.
Using simultaneous TESS observations, we determine the stellar rotation period

neural networks, where the relevance of parameters to the network accuracy is
directly assessed and the parameters that produce the least effect on accuracy
when tentatively zeroed are indeed zeroed. DE method avoids a potentially
combinatorial explosion of all possible candidate sets of parameters to be
zeroed in large networks by mimicking evolution in the natural world. DE uses a
distillation context [5]. In this context, the original network is the teacher
and DE evolves the student neural network to the sparsification goal while
maintaining minimal divergence between teacher and student. After the desired
sparsification level is reached in each layer of the network by DE, a variety
of quantization alternatives are used on the surviving parameters to find the
lowest number of bits for their representation with acceptable loss of
accuracy. A procedure to find optimal distribution of quantization levels in
each sparsified layer is presented. Suitable final lossless encoding of the
surviving quantized parameters is used for the final parameter representation.
DE was used in sample of representative neural networks using MNIST,
FashionMNIST and COCO data sets with progressive larger networks. An 80 classes
YOLOv3 with more than 60 million parameters network trained on COCO dataset
reached 90% sparsification and correctly identifies and segments all objects
identified by the original network with more than 80% confidence using 4bit
parameter quantization. Compression between 40x and 80x. It has not escaped the
authors that techniques from different methods can be nested. Once the best
parameter set for sparsification is identified in a cycle of DE, a decision on
zeroing only a sub-set of those parameters can be made using a combination of
criteria like parameter magnitude and Hessian approximations.

poses based on the correspondences between input images, and thus the ambiguity
caused by duplicate structures (i.e., different structures with strong visual
resemblance) always results in incorrect camera poses and 3D structures. To
deal with the ambiguity, most existing studies resort to additional constraint
information or implicit inference by analyzing two-view geometries or feature
points. In this paper, we propose to exploit high-level information in the
scene, i.e., the spatial contextual information of local regions, to guide the
reconstruction. Specifically, a novel structure is proposed, namely,
{\textit{track-community}}, in which each community consists of a group of
tracks and represents a local segment in the scene. A community detection
algorithm is used to partition the scene into several segments. Then, the
potential ambiguous segments are detected by analyzing the neighborhood of
tracks and corrected by checking the pose consistency. Finally, we perform
partial reconstruction on each segment and align them with a novel
bidirectional consistency cost function which considers both 3D-3D
correspondences and pairwise relative camera poses. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach can robustly alleviate reconstruction failure
resulting from visually indistinguishable structures and accurately merge the
partial reconstructions.

the contributions to $\rho_{00}$ are all in squares of fields which are
nonvanishing even if the fields may strongly fluctuate in space-time. The
fluctuation of strong force fields can be extracted from $\rho_{00}$ of

half billion stars. In this work we demonstrate the high quality of these data
products and illustrate their use in different astrophysical contexts. We query
the astrophysical parameter tables along with other tables in Gaia DR3 to
derive the samples of the stars of interest. We validate our results by using
the Gaia catalogue itself and by comparison with external data. We have
produced six homogeneous samples of stars with high quality astrophysical
parameters across the HR diagram for the community to exploit. We first focus
on three samples that span a large parameter space: young massive disk stars
(~3M), FGKM spectral type stars (~3M), and UCDs (~20K). We provide these
sources along with additional information (either a flag or complementary
parameters) as tables that are made available in the Gaia archive. We
furthermore identify 15740 bone fide carbon stars, 5863 solar-analogues, and
provide the first homogeneous set of stellar parameters of the Spectro
Photometric Standard Stars. We use a subset of the OBA sample to illustrate its
usefulness to analyse the Milky Way rotation curve. We then use the properties
of the FGKM stars to analyse known exoplanet systems. We also analyse the ages
of some unseen UCD-companions to the FGKM stars. We additionally predict the
colours of the Sun in various passbands (Gaia, 2MASS, WISE) using the

rely on enormous monitoring data to detect and mitigate failures. Quickly
recognizing a small set of root cause indicators for the underlying fault can
save much time for failure mitigation. In this paper, we formulate the root
cause analysis problem as a new causal inference task named intervention
recognition. We proposed a novel unsupervised causal inference-based method
named Causal Inference-based Root Cause Analysis (CIRCA). The core idea is a
sufficient condition for a monitoring variable to be a root cause indicator,
i.e., the change of probability distribution conditioned on the parents in the
Causal Bayesian Network (CBN). Towards the application in online service
systems, CIRCA constructs a graph among monitoring metrics based on the
knowledge of system architecture and a set of causal assumptions. The
simulation study illustrates the theoretical reliability of CIRCA. The
performance on a real-world dataset further shows that CIRCA can improve the
recall of the top-1 recommendation by 25% over the best baseline method.

  IRS-Assisted UAV-NOMA Communications",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is introduced to
assist an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system based on
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for serving multiple ground users. We aim
to minimize the average total system energy consumption by jointly designing
the resource allocation strategy, the three dimensional (3D) trajectory of the
UAV, as well as the phase control at the IRS. The design is formulated as a
non-convex optimization problem taking into account the maximum tolerable
outage probability constraint and the individual minimum data rate requirement.
To circumvent the intractability of the design problem due to the
altitude-dependent Rician fading in UAV-to-user links, we adopt the deep neural
network (DNN) approach to accurately approximate the corresponding effective
channel gains, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal
iterative algorithm via dividing the formulated problem into two subproblems
and address them alternatingly. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm can converge to an effective solution within a small number of
iterations and illustrate some interesting insights: (1) IRS enables a highly
flexible UAV's 3D trajectory design via recycling the dissipated radio signal
for improving the achievable system data rate and reducing the flight power
consumption of the UAV; (2) IRS provides a rich array gain through passive
beamforming in the reflection link, which can substantially reduce the required
communication power for guaranteeing the required quality-of-service (QoS); (3)
Optimizing the altitude of UAV's trajectory can effectively exploit the
outage-guaranteed effective channel gain to save the total required
communication power enabling power-efficient UAV communications.

conformal-harmonic maps between two Riemannian manifolds $M$ and $N$ were

conformally invariant energy functional and reassemble the GJMS operators when
the target is the set of real or complex numbers. On a four dimensional

Domain shifts are a critical problem for the application of ASD systems.
Because domain shifts can change the acoustic characteristics of data, a model
trained in a source domain performs poorly for a target domain. In DCASE 2021
Challenge Task 2, we organized an ASD task for handling domain shifts. In this
task, it was assumed that the occurrences of domain shifts are known. However,
in practice, the domain of each sample may not be given, and the domain shifts
can occur implicitly. In 2022 Task 2, we focus on domain generalization
techniques that detects anomalies regardless of the domain shifts.
Specifically, the domain of each sample is not given in the test data and only
one threshold is allowed for all domains. Analysis of 81 submissions from 31
teams revealed two remarkable types of domain generalization techniques: 1)
domain-mixing-based approach that obtains generalized representations and 2)
domain-classification-based approach that explicitly or implicitly classifies
different domains to improve detection performance for each domain.

first is a conditional proof for the full main term of this correlation sum for
the case $h=1$, on assuming an averaged level of distribution for the
three-fold divisor function $\tau_3(n)$ in arithmetic progressions to level
two-thirds. The second is a derivation for the leading term asymptotics of this
correlation sum, valid for any composite shift $h$. The third result gives a
complete expansion of the polynomial for the full main term also for the case
$h=1$ but from the delta-method, showing that our answers match. We also refine
an unconditional result of Heath-Brown on the classical correlation of the
usual divisor function and numerically study the error terms, showing
square-root cancellation supporting our approach. Our method is essentially
elementary, especially for the $h=1$ case, uses congruences, and, as alluded to
earlier, gives the same answer as in prior prediction of Conrey and Gonek,
previously computed by Ng and Thom, and heuristic probabilistic arguments of

relativistic images of different rotating black holes. We argue that the
differences in image positions, separations between the rotating black hole in
modified gravity (MOG) theory and the Kerr black hole in general relativity
(GR) are more significant in SgrA* than those in M87*, however the differences
in time delays between rotating black holes in MOG and GR are shorter in SgrA*
than that in M87*. Our evaluations on lensing observables in the strong gravity
regime can help to distinguish the MOG from GR. Furthermore, we investigate the
shadow observables of different rotating black holes. Employing the EHT
observations on the angular shadow radius for supermassive M87* and SgrA* black
holes respectively, we estimate the ranges of MOG parameter and obtain its
upper limit constraint $0.350\lesssim\alpha_{\rm up}\lesssim 0.485$ and $0.162
\lesssim \alpha_{\rm up} \lesssim 0.285$ correspondingly, relating to black
hole spins. This is the first constraint on the MOG parameter for rotating
supermassive black holes from EHT observations on the angular shadow radius.
Our constraint on the MOG parameter is much tighter compared with the result
obtained from the orbital precession of the S2 star.

dependence on labeled data. It has been successfully applied to structured
data, such as images and natural language, by exploiting the inherent spatial
and semantic structure therein with pretrained models or data augmentation.
These methods are not applicable, however, when the data does not have the
appropriate structure, or invariances. Due to their simplicity, pseudo-labeling
(PL) methods can be widely used without any domain assumptions. However, PL is
sensitive to a threshold and can perform poorly if wrong assignments are made
due to overconfidence. This paper studies theoretically the role of uncertainty
to pseudo-labeling and proposes Confident Sinkhorn Allocation (CSA), which
identifies the best pseudo-label allocation via optimal transport to only
samples with high confidence scores. CSA outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in this practically important area of semi-supervised
learning. Additionally, we propose to use the Integral Probability Metrics to
extend and improve the existing PAC-Bayes bound which relies on the

user mobile devices (MDs) can offload computation tasks to the nearby fog

design an efficient task offloading scheme. In this paper, by considering
time-varying network environment, a dynamic computation offloading and resource
allocation problem in F-RANs is formulated to minimize the task execution delay
and energy consumption of MDs. To solve the problem, a federated deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is proposed, where the deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm performs computation offloading

the DDPG agents in order to decrease the computing complexity of training

temperatures, it often exhibits complex but reproducible patterns as a function
of external magnetic fields, called quantum fingerprints in electric
conductance. Such complex patterns are due to quantum-mechanical interference
of conduction electrons; when thermal disturbance is feeble and coherence of
the electrons extends all over the sample, the quantum interference pattern
reflects microscopic structures, such as crystalline defects and the shape of
the sample, giving rise to complicated interference. Although the interference
pattern carries such microscopic information, it looks so random that it has
not been analysed. Here we show that machine learning allows us to decipher
quantum fingerprints; fingerprint patterns in magneto-conductance are shown to
be transcribed into spatial images of electron wave function intensities (WIs)
in a sample by using generative machine learning. The output WIs reveal quantum
interference states of conduction electrons, as well as sample shapes. The
present result augments the human ability to identify quantum states, and it
should allow microscopy of quantum nanostructures in materials by making use of
quantum fingerprints.

purchase various data sets from feasible clients (smart devices, e.g.,
smartphones, smart vehicles), and model aggregation services from UAVs, to

facilitate the trading among three parties, i.e., FLSDs acting as buyers,
distributed located client groups acting as data-sellers, and UAVs acting as
UAV-sellers. The proposed auction is formalized as a 0-1 integer programming
problem, aiming to maximize the overall buyers' revenue via investigating
winner determination and payment rule design. Specifically, since two seller
types (data-sellers and UAV-sellers) are considered, an interesting idea
integrating seller pair and joint bid is introduced, which turns diverse
sellers into virtual seller pairs. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based, and
one-sided matching-based mechanisms are proposed, respectively, where the
former achieves the optimal solutions, which, however, is computationally
intractable. While the latter can obtain suboptimal solutions that approach to
the optimal ones, with low computational complexity, especially upon

Experimental results show that, for the challenging intra coding scenario, the

more practical scenario in federated learning, but it may amplify some
challenges in federated learning, such as data heterogeneity. The lack of
inactive clients' updates in partial client participation makes it more likely
for the model aggregation to deviate from the aggregation based on full client
participation. Training with large batches on individual clients is proposed to
address data heterogeneity in general, but their effectiveness under partial
client participation is not clear. Motivated by these challenges, we propose to
develop a novel federated learning framework, referred to as FedAMD, for
partial client participation. The core idea is anchor sampling, which separates
partial participants into anchor and miner groups. Each client in the anchor
group aims at the local bullseye with the gradient computation using a large
batch. Guided by the bullseyes, clients in the miner group steer multiple
near-optimal local updates using small batches and update the global model. By
integrating the results of the two groups, FedAMD is able to accelerate the
training process and improve the model performance. Measured by
$\epsilon$-approximation and compared to the state-of-the-art methods, FedAMD
achieves the convergence by up to $O(1/\epsilon)$ fewer communication rounds
under non-convex objectives. Empirical studies on real-world datasets validate
the effectiveness of FedAMD and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm: Not only does it considerably save computation and communication
costs, but also the test accuracy significantly improves.

develop a sample-efficient algorithm, and show that it finds a near-optimal
policy with the suboptimality gap bounded by the sum of the estimation error of
the learned representation in upstream and a vanishing term as the number of
downstream samples becomes large. Our downstream results of online and offline
RL further capture the benefit of employing the learned representation from
upstream as opposed to learning the representation of the low-rank model
directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study
that characterizes the benefit of representation learning in exploration-based
reward-free multitask RL for both upstream and downstream tasks.

radial velocities. It is based on the spectra collected during the first 34
months of the nominal mission. The longer time baseline and the improvements of
the pipeline made it possible to push the processing limit, from Grvs = 12 in
Gaia DR2, to Grvs = 14 mag. In this article, we describe the new
functionalities implemented for Gaia DR3, the quality filters applied during
processing and post-processing and the properties and performance of the
published velocities. For Gaia DR3, several functionalities were upgraded or
added. (Abridged) Gaia DR3 contains the combined radial velocities of 33 812
183 stars. With respect to Gaia DR2, the interval of temperature has been
expanded from Teff \in [3600, 6750] K to Teff \in [3100, 14500] K for the
bright stars ( Grvs \leq 12 mag) and [3100, 6750] K for the fainter stars. The
radial velocities sample a significant part of the Milky Way: they reach a few
kilo-parsecs beyond the Galactic centre in the disc and up to about 10-15 kpc
vertically into the inner halo. The median formal precision of the velocities
is of 1.3 km/s at Grvs = 12 and 6.4 km/s at Grvs = 14 mag. The velocity zero
point exhibits a small systematic trend with magnitude starting around Grvs =
11 mag and reaching about 400 m/s at Grvs = 14 mag. A correction formula is
provided, which can be applied to the published data. The Gaia DR3 velocity
scale is in satisfactory agreement with APOGEE, GALAH, GES and RAVE, with
systematic differences that mostly do not exceed a few hundreds m/s. The
properties of the radial velocities are also illustrated with specific objects:
open clusters, globular clusters as well as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
For example, the precision of the data allows to map the line-of-sight
rotational velocities of the globular cluster 47 Tuc and of the LMC.

that, the number of weights needed to $\epsilon$-approximate a bandlimited

For instance, the ground state energy of coupled electronic oscillators, under
second harmonic injection, can be directly mapped to the optimal solution of
the Maximum Cut problem. However, prior work has focused on a limited set of
such problems. Therefore, in this work, we formulate computing models based on
synchronized oscillator dynamics for a broad spectrum of combinatorial
optimization problems ranging from the Max-K-Cut (the general version of the
Maximum Cut problem) to the Traveling Salesman Problem. We show that
synchronized oscillator dynamics can be engineered to solve these different
combinatorial optimization problems by appropriately designing the coupling
function and the external injection to the oscillators. Our work marks a step
forward towards expanding the functionalities of oscillator-based analog
accelerators and furthers the scope of dynamical system solvers for

it is crucial to learn feature representations that are domain-agnostic and
capture the underlying semantics that makes up an object category. Recent
advances towards weakly supervised vision-language models that learn holistic
representations from cheap weakly supervised noisy text annotations have shown
their ability on semantic understanding by capturing object characteristics
that generalize under different domains. However, when multiple source domains
are involved, the cost of curating textual annotations for every image in the

process tedious and infeasible, hindering us from directly using these
supervised vision-language approaches to achieve the best generalization on an

comparing rotation curves in the 34 nearby galaxies, we found systematics
between the MaNGA and the CALIFA data using eight MaNGA-CALIFA overlapping
galaxies. We assume the rotation curves based on the MaNGA data are accurate
and made the corresponding correction to the CALIFA data. Our result shows that
$\sim$56% (19/34) of our galaxies present slower H$\alpha$ rotation curves
compared to the CO rotation curves, with a median value of 6.5 km/s. The
remaining galaxies (15/34) show consistent CO-H$\alpha$ rotation velocity
within uncertainties. As a result, the Ha rotation may underestimate the total
dynamical mass by ~6% for a circular velocity of 200 km/s (the median value in
our sample). Furthermore, the velocity difference between the CO and H$\alpha$
rotation velocity is found to correlate with the velocity dispersion difference
between CO and H$\alpha$, suggesting that the gas pressure plays a role in the
velocity discrepancy. After incorporating the effect of pressure support due to
the turbulent gas motion to our sample, the median value of the velocity
differences decreases to 1.9 km/s, which in turn reduces the underestimation of
dynamical mass to $\sim$2%. Finally, we also investigate the role that the
extra-planar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) plays in the CO-H$\alpha$ velocity

formalizes this interesting folklore. In this paper, we take the binary weights
in a neural network as random variables under stochastic rounding, and study
the distribution propagation over different layers in the neural network. We
propose a quasi neural network to approximate the distribution propagation,
which is a neural network with continuous parameters and smooth activation
function. We derive the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for this quasi neural
network, and show that the eigenvalue of NTK decays at approximately
exponential rate, which is comparable to that of Gaussian kernel with
randomized scale. This in turn indicates that the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Space (RKHS) of a binary weight neural network covers a strict subset of
functions compared with the one with real value weights. We use experiments to
verify that the quasi neural network we proposed can well approximate binary
weight neural network. Furthermore, binary weight neural network gives a lower
generalization gap compared with real value weight neural network, which is
similar to the difference between Gaussian kernel and Laplace kernel.

temperature data: the lack of large angular-scale correlations, the alignment
of the quadrupole and octupole (Q-O), the point-parity asymmetry, and the
hemispherical power asymmetry. We use CMB simulations with noise representative
of three experiments -- the Planck satellite, the Cosmology Large Angular Scale
Surveyor (CLASS), and the LiteBIRD satellite -- to test how current and future
data constrain the anomalies. We find the correlation coefficients $\rho$
between temperature and E-mode estimators to be less than $0.1$, except for the
point-parity asymmetry ($\rho=0.17$ for cosmic-variance-limited simulations),
confirming that E-modes provide a check on the anomalies that is largely
independent of temperature data. Compared to Planck component-separated CMB
data (SMICA), the putative LiteBIRD survey would reduce errors on E-mode
anomaly estimators by factors of $\sim 3$ for hemispherical power asymmetry and
point-parity asymmetry, and by $\sim 26$ for lack of large-scale correlation.
The improvement in Q-O alignment is not obvious due to large cosmic variance,
but we found the ability to pin down the estimator value will be improved by a
factor $\gtrsim100$. Improvements with CLASS are intermediate to these.

the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in vision tasks, due to the poor

considers the characteristics (such as sparsity, complexity of scenarios) of
LiDAR point cloud, and represents current keypoint with its robust neighbor
keypoints, which provide strong constraint on the description of current
keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on two public datasets (i.e.,
KITTI, Steven VLP16), and the experimental results show that our method greatly
outperforms the state-of-the-arts in matching performance. More importantly,
LinK3D shows excellent real-time performance (based on the frequence 10 Hz of
LiDAR). LinK3D only takes an average of 32 milliseconds to extract features
from the point cloud collected by a 64-ray laser beam, and takes merely about 8
milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed in a notebook with an Intel
Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. Moreover, our method can be widely extended to a
variety of 3D vision applications. In this paper, we has applied our LinK3D to

models the probability distribution of the embedding. Although the serial
method shows high performance due to the powerful feature extraction of OE and
the robustness of IM, OE still has a problem that doesn't work well when the
normal and pseudo-anomalous data are too similar or too different. To
explicitly distinguish these data, the proposed method uses multi-task learning
of two binary cross-entropies when training OE. The first is a loss that
classifies the sound of the target machine to which product it is emitted from,
which deals with the case where the normal data and the pseudo-anomalous data
are too similar. The second is a loss that identifies whether the sound is
emitted from the target machine or not, which deals with the case where the

simultaneous generation of multiple qubits using the 'gradient' concept

different surgeons exists. Our aim is to develop an artificial intelligence
algorithm to classify colonic tissue as 'perfused' or 'not perfused' based on
intraoperative fluorescence angiography data.
  Methods: A classification model with a Resnet architecture was trained on a
dataset of fluorescence angiography videos of colorectal resections at a
tertiary referral centre. Frames corresponding to fluorescent and
non-fluorescent segments of colon were used to train a classification
algorithm. Validation using frames from patients not used in the training set
was performed, including both data collected using the same equipment and data
collected using a different camera. Performance metrics were calculated, and
saliency maps used to further analyse the output. A decision boundary was
identified based on the tissue classification.
  Results: A convolutional neural network was successfully trained on 1790
frames from 7 patients and validated in 24 frames from 14 patients. The
accuracy on the training set was 100%, on the validation set was 80%. Recall
and precision were respectively 100% and 100% on the training set and 68.8% and
91.7% on the validation set.
  Conclusion: Automated classification of intraoperative fluorescence
angiography with a high degree of accuracy is possible and allows automated
decision boundary identification. This will enable surgeons to standardise the
technique of fluorescence angiography. A web based app was made available to
deploy the algorithm.

Using scanning tunneling microscope, we visualized and controlled intervalley

that it is inversely proportional to the energy, i.e., it is proportional to
the wavelength of massless Dirac Fermions. A giant electron-hole asymmetry of
the intervalley scattering is observed because that the monovacancy is charged.
By further charging the monovacancy, the bended electronic potential around the

the singularity theorems of General Relativity, as well as their recent
extension to Lorentzian metrics of low regularity. The latter is motivated by
the quest to explore the nature of the singularities predicted by the classical
theorems. Aiming at the more mathematically minded reader, we give a
pedagogical introduction to the classical theorems with an emphasis on the
analytical side of the arguments. We especially concentrate on focusing results
for causal geodesics under appropriate geometric and initial conditions, in the
smooth and in the low regularity case. The latter comprise the main technical
advance that leads to the proofs of $C^1$-singularity theorems via a
regularisation approach that allows to deal with the distributional curvature.
We close with an overview on related lines of research and a future outlook.

  attractive shared rides",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose Hyper-pool, an analytical, offline, utility-driven ride-pooling
algorithm to aggregate individual trip requests into attractive shared rides of
high-occupancy. We depart from our ride-pooling ExMAS algorithm where single
rides are pooled into attractive door-to-door rides and propose two novel
demand-side algorithms for further aggregating individual demand towards more
compact pooling. First, we generate stop-to-stop rides, with a single pick up
and drop off points optimal for all the travellers. Second, we bundle such
rides again, resulting with hyper-pooled rides compact enough to resemble
public transport operations. We propose a bottom-up framework where the pooling
degree of identified rides is gradually increased, thereby ensuring
attractiveness at subsequent aggregation levels. Our Hyper-pool method outputs
the set of attractive pooled rides per service variant for a given travel
demand. The algorithms are publicly available and reproducible. It is
applicable for real-size demand datasets and opens new opportunities for
exploiting the limits of ride-pooling potential. In our Amsterdam case-study we
managed to pool over 220 travellers into 40 hyper-pooled rides of average
occupancy 5.8 pax/veh.

  Systems","Accepted by KDD 2022 Research Track",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In order to develop effective sequential recommenders, a series of sequence
representation learning (SRL) methods are proposed to model historical user
behaviors. Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing
the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some
extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation
scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle
this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning
approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated
description text of items to learn transferable representations across
different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item
representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on
parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning
universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training
tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal
sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to
new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under
either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a
cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed
universal SRL method. The code and pre-trained model are available at:

hierarchical datasets in which individual data points are grouped together
(e.g., people within households). In particular, to measure the similarity
between the synthetic dataset and the underlying private one, we frame our
objective under the problem of private query release, generating a synthetic
dataset that preserves answers for some collection of queries (i.e., statistics
like mean aggregate counts). However, while the application of private
synthetic data to the problem of query release has been well studied, such
research is restricted to non-hierarchical data domains, raising the initial
question -- what queries are important when considering data of this form?
Moreover, it has not yet been established how one can generate synthetic data
at both the group and individual-level while capturing such statistics. In
light of these challenges, we first formalize the problem of hierarchical query
release, in which the goal is to release a collection of statistics for some
hierarchical dataset. Specifically, we provide a general set of statistical
queries that captures relationships between attributes at both the group and
individual-level. Subsequently, we introduce private synthetic data algorithms
for hierarchical query release and evaluate them on hierarchical datasets
derived from the American Community Survey and Allegheny Family Screening Tool
data. Finally, we look to the American Community Survey, whose inherent
hierarchical structure gives rise to another set of domain-specific queries
that we run experiments with.

in fundamental physics [1, 2, 3], nuclear and atomic structure [4, 5],
magnetometry and metrology [6] as well as chemistry and medicine [7, 8]. In
particular, $^3$He nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes have been proposed
as a new standard for absolute magnetometry [6, 9]. This requires a
high-accuracy value for the $^3$He nuclear magnetic moment, which, however, has
so far been determined only indirectly and with a relative precision of $12$
parts per billon (p.p.b.) [10,11]. Here we investigate the $^3$He$^+$
ground-state hyperfine structure in a Penning trap to directly measure the
nuclear $g$-factor of $^3$He$^+$ $g'_I=-4.255\, 099\, 606\,
9(30)_{stat}(17)_{sys}$, the zero-field hyperfine splitting $E_{\rm HFS}^{\rm
exp}=-8\, 665\, 649\, 865.77(26)_{stat}(1)_{sys}$ Hz and the bound electron
$g$-factor $g_e^\text{exp}=-2.002\, 177\, 415\, 79(34)_{stat}(30)_{sys}$. The
latter is consistent with our theoretical value $g_e^\text{theo}=-2.002\, 177\,
416\, 252\, 23(39)$ based on parameters and fundamental constants from [12].
Our measured value for the $^3$He$^+$ nuclear $g$-factor allows for the
determination of the $g$-factor of the bare nucleus $g_I=-4.255\, 250\, 699\,
7(30)_{stat}(17)_{sys}(1)_{theo}$ via our accurate calculation of the
diamagnetic shielding constant [13] $\sigma_{^3He^+}=0.000\,035\,507\,38(3)$.
This constitutes the first direct calibration for $^3$He NMR probes and an
improvement of the precision by one order of magnitude compared to previous
indirect results. The measured zero-field hyperfine splitting improves the
precision by two orders of magnitude compared to the previous most precise
value [14] and enables us to determine the Zemach radius [15] to
$r_Z=2.608(24)$ fm.

  Data","23 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a modelling framework which allows for the estimation of
abundances from trace counts. This indirect method of estimating abundance is
attractive due to the relative affordability with which it may be carried out,
and the reduction in possible risk posed to animals and humans when compared to
direct methods for estimating animal abundance. We assess these methods by
performing simulations which allow us to examine the accuracy of model
estimates. The models are then fitted to several case studies to obtain
abundance estimates for collared peccaries in Brazil, kit foxes in Arizona, red
foxes in Italy and sika deer in Scotland. Simulation results reveal that these
models produce accurate estimates of abundance at a range of sample sizes. In
particular, this modelling framework produces accurate estimates when data is
very scarce. The use of vestige counts in estimating abundance allows for the
monitoring of species which may otherwise go undetected due to their reclusive
nature. Additionally, the efficacy of these models when data is collected at
very few transects will allow for the use of small-scale data collection
programmes which may be carried out at reduced cost, when compared to
larger-scale data collection.

$e^+e^-$, using electron-positron collisions recorded at an energy at or near
the $\Upsilon(4S)$ mass and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $189$

at the SuperKEKB $e^{+}e^{-}$ asymmetric-energy collider. We reconstruct
$K^{\ast}(892)$ candidates in the $K^+\pi^-$, $K_{S}^{0}\pi^+$, and $K^+\pi^0$
final states. The signal yields with statistical uncertainties are $22\pm 6$,
$18 \pm 6$, and $38 \pm 9$ for the decays $B \to K^{\ast}(892)\mu^+\mu^-$, $B
\to K^{\ast}(892)e^+e^-$, and $B \to K^{\ast}(892)\ell^+\ell^-$, respectively.
We measure the branching fractions of these decays for the entire range of the
dilepton mass, excluding the very low mass region to suppress the $B \to
K^{\ast}(892)\gamma(\to e^+e^-)$ background and regions compatible with decays
of charmonium resonances, to be \begin{equation} {\cal B}(B \to

{\cal B}(B \to K^{\ast}(892)\ell^+\ell^-) = (1.25 \pm 0.30 ^{+0.08}_{-0.07})
\times 10^{-6}, \end{equation} where the first and second uncertainties are
statistical and systematic, respectively. These results, limited by sample
size, are the first measurements of $B \to K^{\ast}(892)\ell^+\ell^-$ branching

communication (SC$^{2}$) resource allocation for federated edge learning (FEEL)
via a concrete case study of human motion recognition based on wireless sensing
in ambient intelligence. First, by analyzing the wireless sensing process in
human motion recognition, we find that there exists a thresholding value for
the sensing transmit power, exceeding which yields sensing data samples with
approximately the same satisfactory quality. Then, the joint SC$^{2}$ resource
allocation problem is cast to maximize the convergence speed of FEEL, under the
constraints on training time, energy supply, and sensing quality of each edge
device. Solving this problem entails solving two subproblems in order: the
first one reduces to determine the joint sensing and communication resource
allocation that maximizes the total number of samples that can be sensed during
the entire training process; the second one concerns the partition of the
attained total number of sensed samples over all the communication rounds to
determine the batch size at each round for convergence speed maximization. The
first subproblem on joint sensing and communication resource allocation is
converted to a single-variable optimization problem by exploiting the derived
relation between different control variables (resources), which thus allows an
efficient solution via one-dimensional grid search. For the second subproblem,
it is found that the number of samples to be sensed (or batch size) at each
round is a decreasing function of the loss function value attained at the
round. Based on this relationship, the approximate optimal batch size at each
communication round is derived in closed-form as a function of the round index.
Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to validate the superiority
of the proposed joint SC$^{2}$ resource allocation scheme.

intensive tasks to an edge or cloud server to guarantee the quality of service

where tasks should be offloaded and processed, and how much network and
computation resources should be allocated to them, such that a system with
limited resources can obtain a maximum profit while meeting the deadlines. A
key challenge in this problem is that the network and computation resources
could be allocated on different servers, since the server to which a task is
offloaded (e.g., a server with an access point) may be different from the
server on which the task is eventually processed. To address this challenge, we
first formulate the task mapping and resource allocation problem as a
non-convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, known as
NP-hard. We then propose a zero-slack based greedy algorithm (ZSG) and a linear
discretization method (LDM) to solve this MINLP problem. Experiment results
with various synthetic tasksets show that ZSG has an average of $2.98\%$ worse
performance than LDM with a minimum unit of 5 but has an average of $6.88\%$
better performance than LDM with a minimum unit of 15.

generation with agriculture for preserving the terrestrial ecosystem and
enabling food-energy-water synergies. Here, we present a systematic approach to
model the economic performance of AV relative to standalone ground-mounted PV
(GMPV) and explore how the module design configuration can affect the dual
food-energy economic performance. A remarkably simple criterion for economic
feasibility is quantified that relates the land preservation cost to dual
food-energy profit. We explore case studies including both high and low value
crops under fixed tilt bifacial modules oriented either along the conventional
North/South (N/S) facings or vertical East/West (E/W) facings. For each module
configuration, the array density is varied to explore an economically feasible
design space relative to GMPV for a range of module to land cost ratio (M_L) -
a location-specific indicator relating the module technology (hardware and
installation) costs to the soft (land acquisition, tax, overheads, etc.) costs.
To offset a typically higher AV module cost needed to preserve the cropland,
both E/W and N/S orientated modules favor high value crops, reduced (<60%)
module density, and higher M_L (>25). In contrast, higher module density and an
increased feed-in-tariff (FIT) relative to GMPV are desirable at lower M_L. The
economic trends vary sharply for M_L< 10 but tend to saturate for M_L> 20. For
low value crops, ~15% additional FIT can enable economic equivalence to GMPV at
standard module density. The proposed modeling framework can provide a valuable
tool for AV stakeholders to assess, predict, and optimize the techno-economic

opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make
a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time.
Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat
pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended
flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction
in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel
defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next
step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest

or sufficient conditions under which they are entropic. We prove that weighted
rank functions are located on the boundary of the submodularity cone. For the
representable matroids over a characteristic 2 field, we show that the integer
valued weighted rank functions are entropic. We derive a necessary condition
for constant weight rank functions to be entropic and show that for the case of
graphic matroids, this condition is indeed sufficient. Since these functions
generalize the rank of a matroid, our findings generalize some of the results
of Abbe et. al. about entropic properties of the rank function of matroids.

directly on failure times, whose interpretation is intuitive. The
semiparametric AFT model that does not specify the error distribution is
flexible and robust to departures from the distributional assumption. Owing to
the desirable features, this class of models has been considered as a promising
alternative to the popular Cox model in the analysis of censored failure time
data. However, in these AFT models, a linear predictor for the mean is
typically assumed. Little research has addressed the nonlinearity of predictors
when modeling the mean. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received a focal
attention over the past decades and have achieved remarkable success in a
variety of fields. DNNs have a number of notable advantages and have been shown
to be particularly useful in addressing the nonlinearity. By taking advantage
of this, we propose to apply DNNs in fitting AFT models using a Gehan-type

the DF of distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use
by calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is
found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks'

pore widths and different densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a
maximum at the density N/L=1 and tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore
width. The results indicate a special role of this density when the pore length
L is equal exactly to N disk diameters. We introduce an orientational order
parameter that accounts for the local quality of the crystalline zigzag formed
by disks and is related to its structural element. This parameter is maximum in
the densely packed state and vanishes for a very low density. Due to specific

the semi-discretized PDE into a bilinear form. The ROM produced is then
integrated into an nonlinear Kalman Filtering-based observer design also

FOM, ROM, ROM-based observer variants, and the FOM-based observer are performed
using Monte-Carlo simulations as well as simulations based on experimental data

accurately with a relative mean square error below $0.3\,\%$ for the
experimental data simulation. This is while reaching a computational-time
reduction up to a factor of $40$. The ROM-based observer with algebraic states
correction is shown (using Monte-Carlo simulations) to be able to converge to

The
early part of the release, Gaia EDR3, already provided the astrometric and
photometric data for nearly two billion sources. The full release now adds
improved parameters compared to Gaia DR2 for radial velocities, astrophysical
parameters, variability information, light curves, and orbits for Solar System
objects. The improvements are in terms of the number of sources, the variety of
parameter information, precision, and accuracy. For the first time, Gaia DR3
also provides a sample of spectrophotometry and spectra obtained with the
Radial Velocity Spectrometer, binary star solutions, and a characterisation of
extragalactic object candidates. Before the publication of the catalogue, these
data have undergone a dedicated transversal validation process. The aim of this
paper is to highlight limitations of the data that were found during this
process and to provide recommendations for the usage of the catalogue. The
validation was obtained through a statistical analysis of the data, a
confirmation of the internal consistency of different products, and a
comparison of the values to external data or models. Gaia DR3 is a new major
step forward in terms of the number, diversity, precision, and accuracy of the
Gaia products. As always in such a large and complex catalogue, however, issues
and limitations have also been found. Detailed examples of the scientific
quality of the Gaia DR3 release can be found in the accompanying
data-processing papers as well as in the performance verification papers. Here
we focus only on the caveats that the user should be aware of to scientifically
exploit the data.

  of Costs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We interpret solving the multi-vehicle routing problem as a team Markov game
with partially observable costs. For a given set of customers to serve, the
playing agents (vehicles) have the common goal to determine the team-optimal
agent routes with minimal total cost. Each agent thereby observes only its own
cost. Our multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, the so-called
multi-agent Neural Rewriter, builds on the single-agent Neural Rewriter to
solve the problem by iteratively rewriting solutions. Parallel agent action
execution and partial observability require new rewriting rules for the game.
We propose the introduction of a so-called pool in the system which serves as a
collection point for unvisited nodes. It enables agents to act simultaneously
and exchange nodes in a conflict-free manner. We realize limited disclosure of
agent-specific costs by only sharing them during learning. During inference,
each agents acts decentrally, solely based on its own cost. First empirical
results on small problem sizes demonstrate that we reach a performance close to
the employed OR-Tools benchmark which operates in the perfect cost information
setting.

the chemo-dynamical properties of stars in our Galaxy, essential knowledge for
understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of the Milky Way. To
provide insight into the physical properties of Milky Way stars, we used these
data to produce a uniformly-derived, all-sky catalog of stellar astrophysical
parameters (APs): Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], activity index, emission
lines, rotation, 13 chemical abundance estimates, radius, age, mass, bolometric
luminosity, distance, and dust extinction. We developed the Apsis pipeline to
infer APs of Gaia objects by analyzing their astrometry, photometry, BP/RP, and
RVS spectra. We validate our results against other literature works, including
benchmark stars, interferometry, and asteroseismology. Here we assessed the
stellar analysis performance from Apsis statistically. We describe the
quantities we obtained, including our results' underlying assumptions and
limitations. We provide guidance and identify regimes in which our parameters
should and should not be used. Despite some limitations, this is the most
extensive catalog of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. These
comprise Teff, logg, and [M/H] (470 million using BP/RP, 6 million using RVS),
radius (470 million), mass (140 million), age (120 million), chemical
abundances (5 million), diffuse interstellar band analysis (1/2 million),
activity indices (2 million), H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths (200 million), and
further classification of spectral types (220 million) and emission-line stars

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe filled with a free
Schroedinger field. The probability fluid of the latter is used to mimic the
cosmological fluid (baryonic plus dark matter), thus providing the matter
density and pressure terms in the corresponding Friedmann-Lemaitre equations.
We first obtain the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on flat FLRW
space. A quantum operator qualifying as a cosmological constant is defined to
act on the Schroedinger field. We then compute the matrix representing the
cosmological constant in the basis of Laplacian eigenfunctions. For an estimate
of the orders of magnitude involved it suffices to determine the expectation
values of this operator. The expectation value that best fits the
experimentally measured value of the cosmological constant allows us to
identify the quantum state of the Schroedinger field that best represents the
matter contents (baryonic and dark) of the current Universe. Finally, the
operator inverse (modulo dimensional factors) to the one representing the
cosmological constant provides a measure of the gravitational Boltzmann entropy
of the Universe. We compute its matrix in the basis of Laplacian eigenfunctions
and verify that the expectation values of this entropy operator comply with the
upper bound set by the holographic principle.

consideration of the run-time behavior of the system. One of such research
attempts is to design the controller along with the task scheduler, known as
control-scheduling co-design, for more predictable timing behavior as well as
surviving system overloads. Unlike traditional controller designs, which have
equal-distance sampling periods, the co-design approach increases the system
flexibility and resilience by explicitly considering timing properties, for
example using an event-based controller or with multiple sampling times
(non-uniform sampling and control). Within this context, we introduce the first
work on the discretization of an energy-based controller that can switch
arbitrarily between multiple periods and adjust the control parameters
accordingly without destabilizing the system. A digital controller design based
on this paradigm for a DC motor with an elastic load as an example is
introduced and the stability condition is given based on the proposed Lyapunov
function. The method is evaluated with various computer-based simulations which
demonstrate its effectiveness.

DNNs that satisfy these assumptions are referred to as general DNNs. Our

DAGs are built from the bottom-up through the application of atomic operations

to derive the properties of general DNNs via mathematical induction. We show
that using the proposed approach, some properties hold true for general DNNs

of the parameters can not be recovered unless one tampers with the encoding
process itself. An example is presented by studying the estimation of the
relative time-delays that accumulate along two parallel optical transmission

inserting a sequence of balanced beam splitters (and eventually adding an extra
phase shift on one of the lines) that couples the two lines at regular
intervals in a setup that remind us a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel (GHOM)
interferometer. For the case of two time delays we prove that, when the
employed probe is the frequency-correlated biphoton state, the untwining occurs
in correspondence of exclusive zero-coincidence (EZC) point. Furthermore we
show the statistical independence of two time delays and the optimality of the
quantum Fisher information at the EZC point. Finally we prove the compatibility
of this scheme by checking the weak commutativity condition associated with the

relaxation for the QMI problem is proposed, with an additional valid linear
constraint. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightened LMI
relaxation problem to have a rank-one solution are established. When the
tightened LMI relaxation problem still has a high-rank solution, the LMI

engagement via video recommendations. It has become increasingly important
given the ever-growing popularity of online videos. However, prediction of
watch time not only depends on the match between the user and the video but is
often mislead by the duration of the video itself. With the goal of improving
watch time, recommendation is always biased towards videos with long duration.
Models trained on this imbalanced data face the risk of bias amplification,
which misguides platforms to over-recommend videos with long duration but
overlook the underlying user interests.
  This paper presents the first work to study duration bias in watch-time
prediction for video recommendation. We employ a causal graph illuminating that
duration is a confounding factor that concurrently affects video exposure and
watch-time prediction -- the first effect on video causes the bias issue and
should be eliminated, while the second effect on watch time originates from
video intrinsic characteristics and should be preserved. To remove the
undesired bias but leverage the natural effect, we propose a Duration
Deconfounded Quantile-based (D2Q) watch-time prediction framework, which allows
for scalability to perform on industry production systems. Through extensive
offline evaluation and live experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of this
duration-deconfounding framework by significantly outperforming the
state-of-the-art baselines. We have fully launched our approach on Kuaishou
App, which has substantially improved real-time video consumption due to more

probe an unprecedentedly large volume of space, enhancing the discovery power
of the observations to even new sources of gravitational wave emitters. In this
scenario, the development of highly optimized gravitational wave detection
algorithms is crucial. We propose a novel layered framework for real-time
detection of gravitational waves inspired by speech processing techniques and,
in the present implementation, based on a state-of-the-art machine learning
approach involving a hybridization of genetic programming and neural networks.
The key aspects of the newly proposed framework are: the well structured,
layered approach, and the low computational complexity. The paper describes the
basic concepts of the framework and the derivation of the first three layers.
Even if, in the present implementation, the layers are based on models derived
using a machine learning approach, the proposed layered structure has a
universal nature. To train and test the models, we used simulated binary black
hole gravitational wave waveforms in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of
Advanced LIGO sensitivity design. Compared to more complex approaches, such as
convolutional neural networks, our framework, even using the simple ground
model described in the paper, has only a slightly lower performance, but with a
much lower computational complexity and a higher degree of modularity.
Furthermore, the underlying exploitation of short-term features makes the
results of the new framework virtually independent against time-position of
gravitational wave signals, simplifying its future exploitation in real-time
multi-layer pipelines for gravitational-wave detection with second generation
interferometers.

Processes (MDPs). We introduce a lemma based on existing theoretical results in
reinforcement learning (RL) to measure the relativity between two arbitrary
MDPs, that is the difference between any two cumulative expected returns
defined on different policies and environment dynamics. Based on this lemma, we
propose two new algorithms referred to as Relative Policy Optimization (RPO)
and Relative Transition Optimization (RTO), which can offer fast policy
transfer and dynamics modeling, respectively. RPO updates the policy using the
relative policy gradient to transfer the policy evaluated in one environment to
maximize the return in another, while RTO updates the parameterized dynamics
model (if there exists) using the relative transition gradient to reduce the
gap between the dynamics of the two environments. Then, integrating the two
algorithms offers the complete algorithm Relative Policy-Transition
Optimization (RPTO), in which the policy interacts with the two environments
simultaneously, such that data collections from two environments, policy and
transition updates are completed in one closed loop to form a principled
learning framework for policy transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
RPTO in OpenAI gym's classic control tasks by creating policy transfer problems
via variant dynamics.

imposing monetary penalties on adversarial parties. This functionality is
called secure computation with penalties. Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014)
introduced the claim-or-refund functionality that can be implemented via
Bitcoin. They achieved secure computation with penalties with $O(n)$ rounds and
$O(n)$ broadcasts for any function, where $n$ is the number of parties. After
that, Kumaresan and Bentov (CCS 2014) showed a constant-round protocol.
Unfortunately, this protocol requires $O(n^2)$ broadcasts. As far as we know,
no protocol achieves $O(1)$ rounds and $O(n)$ broadcasts based on Bitcoin. This
work accomplishes such efficiency in secure computation with penalties. We
first show a protocol in a slightly relaxed setting called secure computation
with non-equivalent penalties. This setting is the same as secure computation
with penalties except that every honest party receives more than a
predetermined amount of compensation, while the previous one requires that
every honest party receives the same amount of compensation. Namely, our
setting allows the compensations for honest parties to be non-equivalent.
Moreover, we present a technique to remove the non-equivalence of our protocol
without sacrificing efficiency. We then propose a new ideal functionality
called claim-refund-or-give that can be implemented via Bitcoin.

obtained during the period 2015 - 2021. We measure the equivalent width of
H$\alpha$ (EW$_\alpha$), H$\beta$ ($EW_\beta$), and the distance between the
peaks of H$\alpha$ ($\Delta V_\alpha$), H$\beta$ ($\Delta V_\beta$), and FeII
($\Delta V_{FeII}$) lines. Combining new and old data, we find that:
  - the density of the circumstellar disc of MWC 656 ($\Delta V_\alpha$ versus
$EW_\alpha$ diagram) is similar to the Be stars. For the Be stars we find the
relation $\Delta V_\beta = 0.999 \Delta V_\alpha + 62.4$ km s$^{-1}$, and the
position of MWC~656 corresponds to the average behaviour of the Be stars. This
means that the presence of the black hole does not change the overall structure
of the circumstellar disc.
  - the periodogram analysis indicates modulation of $EW_\alpha$ with a period
$60.4 \pm 0.4$ days, which is identical to the binary orbital period. The
maxima of $EW_\alpha$ and $EW_\beta$ are around periastron (phase zero).
  - around orbital phase zero, $\Delta V_\beta$ and $\Delta V_{FeII}$ decrease
by about $30$ km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that we observe an increase of the
circumstellar disc size induced by the periastron passage of the black hole and
that the entire circumstellar disc pulsates with the orbital period with
relative amplitude of 10-20%. The observations also indicate, that the reason
for the black hole in MWC 656 to be in deep quiescence is a very low efficiency
of accretion ($\sim 2 \times 10^{-6}$).

  https://github.com/Byronliang8/HubnessGANSampling",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite the extensive studies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), how
to reliably sample high-quality images from their latent spaces remains an
under-explored topic. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN latent sampling
method by exploring and exploiting the hubness priors of GAN latent
distributions. Our key insight is that the high dimensionality of the GAN
latent space will inevitably lead to the emergence of hub latents that usually
have much larger sampling densities than other latents in the latent space. As
a result, these hub latents are better trained and thus contribute more to the
synthesis of high-quality images. Unlike the a posterior ""cherry-picking"", our
method is highly efficient as it is an a priori method that identifies
high-quality latents before the synthesis of images. Furthermore, we show that
the well-known but purely empirical truncation trick is a naive approximation
to the central clustering effect of hub latents, which not only uncovers the
rationale of the truncation trick, but also indicates the superiority and
fundamentality of our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

a continuous game with other optimizing agents: in this case, if all players

regret relative to fully adversarial environments. We study this problem in the
context of variationally stable games (a class of continuous games which
includes all convex-concave and monotone games), and when the players only have
access to noisy estimates of their individual payoff gradients. If the noise is
additive, the game-theoretic and purely adversarial settings enjoy similar
regret guarantees; however, if the noise is multiplicative, we show that the
learners can, in fact, achieve constant regret. We achieve this faster rate via
an optimistic gradient scheme with learning rate separation -- that is, the
method's extrapolation and update steps are tuned to different schedules,
depending on the noise profile. Subsequently, to eliminate the need for
delicate hyperparameter tuning, we propose a fully adaptive method that attains
nearly the same guarantees as its non-adapted counterpart, while operating
without knowledge of either the game or of the noise profile.

between subsequent $^{17}$O$(\alpha,n)^{20}$Ne and

work presents more precise measurements of resonances in the energy range
$E_{c.m.} = 612 - 1319$ keV. We extract resonance strengths of

any significant contribution from this resonance to the reaction rate. From
this work, a new $^{17}$O$(\alpha,\gamma)^{21}$Ne thermonuclear reaction rate
is calculated and compared to the literature. The effect of present
uncertainties in the $^{17}$O$(\alpha,\gamma)^{21}$Ne reaction rate on weak

a rotating $20M_{\odot}$ low-metallicity massive star. The resulting

pre-existing literature and found to enhance weak s-process yields in rotating
massive star models.

The current paradigm in the SSL is to utilize data augmentation at the input

maximize the representations between similar images and minimize them for
different ones. While this approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in

training the model to extract the original embeddings from virtual ones, hence,
better representation learning. Additionally, we propose a self-consistency

We validate TriMix on eight benchmark datasets consisting of natural and

purpose of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of the neural network to
demodulate/decode the complex modulations/codes close to the Shannon capacity
and characterize the error performance and the complexity of the neural
network. Regarding the neural network demodulator, we use the golden angle
modulation (GAM), a promising modulation format that can offer the Shannon
capacity approaching performance, to evaluate the demodulator. It is observed
that the neural network demodulator can get a close performance to the ML-based
method while it suffers from the lower complexity order in the low-order GAM.
Regarding the neural network decoder, we use the Gaussian codebook, achieving
the Shannon capacity, to evaluate the decoder. We also observe that the neural
network decoder achieves the error performance close to the ML decoder with a
much lower complexity order in the small Gaussian codebook. Limited by the
current training resources, we cannot evaluate the performance of the
high-order modulation and the long codeword. But, based on the results of the
low-order GAM and the small Gaussian codebook, we boldly give our conjecture:
the neural network demodulator/decoder is a strong candidate approach for
demodulating/decoding the complex modulations/codes close to the Shannon
capacity owing to the error performance of the near-ML algorithm and the lower

influencing factors and strong time correlation. In particular, the repeated
subsampling strategy tackles the variability of the knockoffs and the
dependency of factors. Simultaneously, we also control the proportion of false
discoveries over a grid of all possible values, which mitigates variability of
selected factors from ad-hoc choices of a specific false discovery level. In
the application for corporate bond recovery rates, we identify new important
groups of relevant factors on top of the known standard drivers. But we also
show that out-of-sample, the resulting sparse model has similar predictive
power to state-of-the-art machine learning models that use the entire set of
predictors.

for the rapidly growing smart grid ecosystem. Any coordinated cyberattack
targeting the distributed system of state estimators can cause unrestrained

smart grid arising from the exploitation of DSE vulnerabilities. To this aim,
novel adversarial strategies based on two-stage data availability and integrity
attacks are proposed towards a distributed industrial Internet of Things-based
smart grid. The former's attack goal is to prevent boundary data exchange among
distributed control centers, while the latter's attack goal is to inject a
falsified data to cause local and global system unobservability. The proposed
framework is evaluated on IEEE standard 14-bus system and benchmarked against
the state-of-the-art research. Experimental results show that the proposed
two-stage cyberattack results in an estimated error of approximately 34.74%

much research has focussed on the local translational motion of these slender

though it can be the dominant component of motion. In this study, we explore a
classically motivated ansatz for the Stokes flow around a rotating slender body
via superposed rotlet singularities, which leads us to pose an alternative
ansatz that accounts for both translation and rotation. Through an asymptotic
analysis that is supported by numerical examples, we determine the suitability
of these flow ansatzes for capturing the fluid velocity at the surface of a
slender body, assuming local axisymmetry of the object but allowing the
cross-sectional radius to vary with arclength. In addition to formally
justifying the presented slender-body ansatzes, this analysis reveals a
markedly simple relation between the local angular velocity and the torque
exerted on the body, which we term resistive torque theory. Though reminiscent
of classical resistive force theories, this local relation is found to be
algebraically accurate in the slender-body aspect ratio, even when translation
is present, and is valid and required whenever local rotation contributes to
the surface velocity at leading asymptotic order.

model proposal. The particle content of the model comprises $5_H$, $24_H$,
$35_H$, ${\overline{5}_F}_i$, ${10_F}_i$, $15_F$, $\overline{15}_F$, and
$24_V$, where subscripts $H$, $F$, and $V$ denote whether a given
representation contains scalars, fermions, or gauge bosons, respectively, while
$i=1,2,3$. The model employs all possible interaction terms, as allowed by the
Lorentz group, the $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry, and the aforementioned particle
content, to generate the Standard Model fermion masses through three different
mechanisms. It also connects the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the
experimentally observed mass disparity between the down-type quarks and charged
leptons. The minimal structure of the model requires $24_H$ and $5_H$ not only
to break $SU(5)$ and $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge groups,
respectively, but to accomplish one additional task each. The model furthermore
predicts that neutrinos are strictly Majorana fields, that one neutrino is
purely a massless particle, and that neutrino masses are of normal ordering.
The experimental bound on the $p \rightarrow \pi^0 e^+$ lifetime limit, in
conjunction with the prediction of the model for the gauge mediated proton
decays, implies that there are four new scalar multiplets at or below a
$120$\,TeV mass scale if these multiplets are mass degenerate. If these
multiplets are not mass degenerate, the quoted limit then applies, for all
practical purposes, to the geometric mean of their masses. The scalars in
question transform as $(1,3,0)$, $(8,1,0)$, $(\overline{3},3,-2/3)$, and
$(\overline{6},2,1/6)$ under the Standard Model gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2)
\times U(1)$ with calculable couplings to the Standard Model fields.

that it depends on the nonlocality scale $M_f$ and the fermion mass $m_f$ as
$\alpha_{NL} \propto m_f^2/M_f^2$. Such a dependence of the anomalous magnetic
momentum allows to explain, in a flavor-blind nonlocality scale, why the
observed anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is much closer to the
standard model prediction, and permits to predict a large anomaly that should
exist for the $\tau$ particle. We also determine the lower bounds on the

remaining challenge in Volume of Fluid (VOF) methods. Data-driven methods are
recently emerging as a promising alternative in this domain. They outperform
conventional methods on coarser grids but diverge with grid refinement.
Furthermore, unlike conventional methods, data-driven methods are sensitive to
coordinate system and sign conventions, thus often fail to capture basic
symmetry patterns in interfaces. The present work proposes a new data-driven
strategy which conserves the symmetries in a cost-effective way and delivers
consistent results over a wide range of grids. The method is based on
artificial neural networks with deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture
which read volume fraction fields on regular grids. The anti-symmetries are
preserved with no additional cost by employing a neural network model with
input normalization, odd-symmetric activation functions and bias-free neurons.
The symmetries are further conserved by height-function inspired rotations and
averaging over several different orientations. The new symmetry-preserving MLP
model is implemented into a flow solver (OpenFOAM) and tested against
conventional schemes in the literature. It shows superior performance compared
to its standard counterpart and has similar accuracy and convergence properties
with the state-of-the-art conventional method despite using smaller stencil.

due to the size of the state-space exploration, as the number of interleavings
grows exponentially with the number of program threads and statements. We
propose and evaluate EBF (Ensembles of Bounded Model Checking with Fuzzing) --
a technique that combines Bounded Model Checking (BMC) and Gray-Box Fuzzing
(GBF) to find software vulnerabilities in concurrent programs. Since there are
no publicly-available GBF tools for concurrent code, we first propose OpenGBF
-- a new open-source concurrency-aware gray-box fuzzer that explores different
thread schedules by instrumenting the code under test with random delays. Then,
we build an ensemble of a BMC tool and OpenGBF in the following way. On the one
hand, when the BMC tool in the ensemble returns a counterexample, we use it as
a seed for OpenGBF, thus increasing the likelihood of executing paths guarded
by complex mathematical expressions. On the other hand, we aggregate the
outcomes of the BMC and GBF tools in the ensemble using a decision matrix, thus
improving the accuracy of EBF. We evaluate EBF against state-of-the-art pure
BMC tools and show that it can generate up to 14.9% more correct verification
witnesses than the corresponding BMC tools alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the efficacy of OpenGBF, by showing that it can find 24.2% of the
vulnerabilities in our evaluation suite, while non-concurrency-aware GBF tools
can only find 0.55%. Finally, thanks to our concurrency-aware OpenGBF, EBF
detects a data race in the open-source wolfMqtt library and reproduces known
bugs in several other real-world programs, which demonstrates its effectiveness
in finding vulnerabilities in real-world software.

ability to express local dependence between variables and local dependence of
statements on variables.
  Known features of LFD include decidability, explicit axiomatization, finite
model property, and a bisimulation characterization. Others, including the
complexity of satisfiability, remained open so far. More generally, what has
been lacking is a good understanding of what makes the LFD approach to
dependence computationally well-behaved, and how it relates to other decidable
logics. In particular, how do allowing variable dependencies and guarding
quantifiers compare as logical devices?
  We provide a new compositional translation from GF into LFD, and conversely,
we translate LFD into GF in an `almost compositional' manner. Using these two
translations, we transfer known results about GF to LFD in a uniform manner,
yielding, e.g., tight complexity bounds for LFD satisfiability, as well as
Craig interpolation. Conversely, e.g., the finite model property of LFD
transfers to GF. Thus, local dependence and guarding turn out to be intricately

of the decoding SNN using pilots. Pilots, encoding SNNs, decoding SNN, and

Consequently, the reliability of these models is of critical importance and has

challenging to specify, let alone check, general functional-correctness
expectations from models. In this paper, we take inspiration from
specifications used in formal methods, expressing functional-correctness
properties by reasoning about $k$ different executions, so-called $k$-safety
properties. Considering a credit-screening model of a bank, the expected
property that ""if a person is denied a loan and their income decreases, they
should still be denied the loan"" is a 2-safety property. Here, we show the wide
applicability of $k$-safety properties for machine-learning models and present
the first specification language for expressing them. We also operationalize
the language in a framework for automatically validating such properties using
metamorphic testing. Our experiments show that our framework is effective in
identifying property violations, and that detected bugs could be used to train
better models.

scalable and robust high-fidelity entangling gates. To this end, quantum
control has become an essential tool, as it can make the entangling interaction
resilient to sources of noise. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to identify an
appropriate quantum control technique for a particular need given the breadth
of work pertaining to robust entanglement. To this end, we attempt to
consolidate the literature by providing a non-exhaustive summary and critical
analysis. The quantum control methods are separated into two categories:
schemes which extend the robustness to (i) spin or (ii) motional decoherence.
We choose to focus on extensions of the $\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x$
Molmer-Sorensen interaction using microwaves and a static magnetic field
gradient. Nevertheless, some of the techniques discussed here can be relevant
to other trapped ion architectures or physical qubit implementations. Finally,
we experimentally realize a proof-of-concept interaction with simultaneous
robustness to spin and motional decoherence by combining several quantum
control methods presented in this manuscript.

X-rays (CXRs) using deep learning (DL) methods can help reduce radiologist
effort, supplement clinical decision-making, and potentially result in improved
patient treatment. The majority of works in the literature discuss training
automatic segmentation models using coarse bounding box annotations. However,
the granularity of the bounding box annotation could result in the inclusion of
a considerable fraction of false positives and negatives at the pixel level
that may adversely impact overall semantic segmentation performance. This study
(i) evaluates the benefits of using fine-grained annotations of TB-consistent
lesions and (ii) trains and constructs ensembles of the variants of U-Net
models for semantically segmenting TB-consistent lesions in both original and
bone-suppressed frontal CXRs. We evaluated segmentation performance using
several ensemble methods such as bitwise AND, bitwise-OR, bitwise-MAX, and
stacking. We observed that the stacking ensemble demonstrated superior
segmentation performance (Dice score: 0.5743, 95% confidence interval:
(0.4055,0.7431)) compared to the individual constituent models and other
ensemble methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
apply ensemble learning to improve fine-grained TB-consistent lesion
segmentation performance.

multi-scale and multi-wavelength study of the W31 complex hosting two extended
HII regions (i.e., G10.30-0.15 (hereafter, W31-N) and G10.15-0.34 (hereafter,
W31-S)) powered by a cluster of O-type stars. Several Class I protostars and a
total of 49 ATLASGAL 870 $\mu$m dust clumps (at d = 3.55 kpc) are found toward
the HII regions where some of the clumps are associated with the molecular
outflow activity. These results confirm the existence of a single physical
system hosting the early phases of star formation. The Herschel 250 $\mu$m
continuum map shows the presence of hub-filament system (HFS) toward both W31-N
and W31-S. The central hubs harbour HII regions and they are depicted with
extended structures (with T$_{\text{d}}$ $\sim$ 25-32 K) in the Herschel
temperature map. In the direction of W31-S, an analysis of the NANTEN2
$^{12}$CO(J = 1-0) and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO(J = 2-1) line data supports the
presence of two cloud components around 8 and 16 km s$^{-1}$, and their
connection in velocity space. A spatial complementary distribution between the
two cloud components is also investigated toward W31-S, where the signposts of
star formation, including massive O-type stars, are concentrated. These
findings favor the applicability of cloud-cloud collision (CCC) around $\sim$2
Myr ago in W31-S. Overall, our observational findings support the theoretical
scenario of CCC in W31, which explains the formation of massive stars and the
existence of HFSs.

  Distillation","ICLR'23 accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown very promising capabilities in
transferring learning representations from large models (teachers) to small
models (students). However, as the capacity gap between students and teachers
becomes larger, existing KD methods fail to achieve better results. Our work
shows that the `prior knowledge' is vital to KD, especially when applying large
teachers. Particularly, we propose the dynamic prior knowledge (DPK), which
integrates part of teacher's features as the prior knowledge before the feature
distillation. This means that our method also takes the teacher's feature as
`input', not just `target'. Besides, we dynamically adjust the ratio of the
prior knowledge during the training phase according to the feature gap, thus
guiding the student in an appropriate difficulty. To evaluate the proposed
method, we conduct extensive experiments on two image classification benchmarks
(i.e. CIFAR100 and ImageNet) and an object detection benchmark (i.e. MS COCO.
The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in performance under
varying settings. Besides, our DPK makes the performance of the student model
positively correlated with that of the teacher model, which means that we can
further boost the accuracy of students by applying larger teachers. More
importantly, DPK provides a fast solution in teacher model selection for any
given model.

space, it turns out that box constraints, combined with weighted sparsity
regularization, can enable rather accurate recovery of sources with constant

of the inverse solution will be a subset of the support of the true source. We
present both an analysis of the problem and a series of numerical experiments.
Our work only addresses discretized problems.
  The reason for introducing the weighting procedure is that standard
(unweighted) sparsity regularization fails to provide adequate results for the
source identification task considered in this paper. This investigation is also
motivated by applications, e.g., recovering mass distributions from
measurements of gravitational fields and inverse scattering. We develop the
methodology and the analysis in terms of Euclidean spaces, and our results can
therefore be applied to many problems. For example, the results are equally
applicable to models involving the screened Poisson equation as to models using
the Helmholtz equation, with both large and small wave numbers.

Imaging (ACI) framework to break the optical limit of light-weight PAL design.
To facilitate learning-based image restoration, we introduce a wave-based
simulation pipeline for panoramic imaging and tackle the synthetic-to-real gap
through multiple data distributions. The proposed pipeline can be easily
adapted to any PAL with design parameters and is suitable for loose-tolerance
designs. Furthermore, we design the Physics Informed Image Restoration Network
(PI2RNet) considering the physical priors of panoramic imaging and single-pass
physics-informed engine. At the dataset level, we create the DIVPano dataset
and the extensive experiments on it illustrate that our proposed network sets
the new state of the art in the panoramic image restoration under
spatially-variant degradation. In addition, the evaluation of the proposed ACI
on a simple PAL with only 3 spherical lenses reveals the delicate balance
between high-quality panoramic imaging and compact design. To the best of our

an instance of a key structural condition that applies across broad domains of

representations leads to algorithmic developments in many architectures. For
neural networks, however, the intrinsic mechanism that yields low-rank
structures remains vague and unclear. To fill this gap, we perform a rigorous
study on the behavior of network rank, focusing particularly on the notion of
rank deficiency. We theoretically establish a universal monotonic decreasing
property of network rank from the basic rules of differential and algebraic
composition, and uncover rank deficiency of network blocks and deep function
coupling. By virtue of our numerical tools, we provide the first empirical
analysis of the per-layer behavior of network rank in practical settings, i.e.,
ResNets, deep MLPs, and Transformers on ImageNet. These empirical results are
in direct accord with our theory. Furthermore, we reveal a novel phenomenon of
independence deficit caused by the rank deficiency of deep networks, where
classification confidence of a given category can be linearly decided by the
confidence of a handful of other categories. The theoretical results of this
work, together with the empirical findings, may advance understanding of the
inherent principles of deep neural networks.

months for about 10 million stars. For many of those stars, a characterisation
in Fourier space and their variability classification are also provided. This
paper focuses on intermediate- to high-mass (IHM) main sequence pulsators M >=
1.3 Msun) of spectral types O, B, A, or F, known as beta Cep, slowly pulsating
B (SPB), delta Sct, and gamma Dor stars. These stars are often multi-periodic
and display low amplitudes, making them challenging targets to analyse with
sparse time series. All datasets used in this analysis are part of the Gaia DR3
data release. The photometric time series were used to perform a Fourier
analysis, while the global astrophysical parameters necessary for the empirical
instability strips were taken from the Gaia DR3 gspphot tables, and the vsini
data were taken from the Gaia DR3 esphs tables. We show that for nearby
OBAF-type pulsators, the Gaia DR3 data are precise and accurate enough to
pinpoint them in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We find empirical instability
strips covering broader regions than theoretically predicted. In particular,
our study reveals the presence of fast rotating gravity-mode pulsators outside
the strips, as well as the co-existence of rotationally modulated variables
inside the strips as reported before in the literature. We derive an extensive
period-luminosity relation for delta Sct stars and provide evidence that the

its advantages in data collection. A successful approach involves a
viewpoint-aware approach that learns an image distribution based on generative
models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) while generating various
view images based on 3D-aware models (e.g., neural radiance fields (NeRFs)).
However, they require images with various views for training, and consequently,
their application to datasets with few or limited viewpoints remains a
challenge. As a complementary approach, an aperture rendering GAN (AR-GAN) that
employs a defocus cue was proposed. However, an AR-GAN is a CNN-based model and
represents a defocus independently from a viewpoint change despite its high
correlation, which is one of the reasons for its performance. As an alternative
to an AR-GAN, we propose an aperture rendering NeRF (AR-NeRF), which can
utilize viewpoint and defocus cues in a unified manner by representing both
factors in a common ray-tracing framework. Moreover, to learn defocus-aware and
defocus-independent representations in a disentangled manner, we propose
aperture randomized training, for which we learn to generate images while
randomizing the aperture size and latent codes independently. During our
experiments, we applied AR-NeRF to various natural image datasets, including
flower, bird, and face images, the results of which demonstrate the utility of
AR-NeRF for unsupervised learning of the depth and defocus effects.

crystal Theory with the material mass and, simultaneously, with material
distortion is discussed. In its current implementation, elastic relaxation in
the phase field crystal occurs on a diffusive time scale through a dissipative
permeation mode. The very same phase field distortion that is included in solid
elasticity drives diffusive motion, resulting in a non physical relaxation of
the phase field crystal. We present two alternative theories to remedy this
shortcoming. In the first case, it is assumed that the phase field only
determines the incompatible part of the elastic distortion, and therefore one
is free to specify an additional compatible distortion so as to satisfy
mechanical equilibrium at all times (in the quasi static limit). A numerical
solution of the new model for the case of a dislocation dipole shows that,
unlike the classical phase field crystal model, it can account for the known
law of relative motion of the two dislocations in the dipole. The physical
origin of the compatible strain in this new theory remains to be specified.
Therefore, a second theory is presented in which an explicit coupling between
independent distortion and phase field accounts for the time dependence of the
relaxation of fluctuations in both. Preliminary details of its implementation
are also given.

local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer
of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control
problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure. Moreover, we apply
this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&P 500. We
present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given
by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described
by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the
corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data.
It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the
optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem
outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of
taking model uncertainty into account.

retention of women before they progress to senior roles. Numerous initiatives
have targeted the problem of the leaky pipeline in recent decades. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of initiatives related to techniques used to
boost recruitment and retention of women in undergraduate computing and related
courses in higher education. The primary aim was to identify interventions or
initiatives (which we called ""actions"") that have shown some effectiveness. A
secondary objective was to structure our findings as a categorisation, in order
to enable future action discussion, comparison and planning. A particular
challenge faced in a significant portion of the work was the lack of
evaluation: i.e. the assessment of the direct relationship between the
initiatives and the outcomes on retention or recruitment. The actions were
categorised into four groups: Policy, Pedagogy, Influence and Support and
Promotion and Engagement. Policy actions need support and potentially
structural change at institution level. Pedagogy actions are initiatives
related to the teaching of computing courses. The Influence and Support
category includes actions associated with ways to influence women to choose
computing and once enrolled to support and encourage them to stay. Finally,
Promotion and Engagement actions are initiatives to promote computing based
courses and involve engagement and outreach activities. We present our
categorisation, identifying the literature related to actions under each
category and subcategory. We discuss the challenges with evaluating the direct
impact of actions and outline how this work leads towards the next phase of our
work - a toolkit of actions to promote retention and recruitment of women in
computing undergraduate courses.

the general relativity and the Yarkovsky effect. The orbits of thousands of
fictitious Venus Trojans are numerically simulated. Using the method of
frequency analysis, their orbital stabilities and the dynamical mechanisms
behind are described in detail. The influences of general relativity and of
Yarkovsky effect, which were either neglected or oversimplified previously, are
investigated by long-term numerical simulations. The stability maps on the
$(a_0,i_0)$ plane and $(a_0,e_0)$ plane are depicted, and the most stable Venus
Trojans are found to occupy the low-inclination horseshoe orbits with low
eccentricities. The resonances that carve the fine structures in the stability
map are determined. The general relativity decreases the stability of orbits by
little but the Yarkovsky effect may drive nearly all Venus Trojans out of the
Trojan region in a relatively short time. The Venus Trojans have poor orbital
stability and cannot survive the age of the Solar system. The zodiacal dust
ring found around the orbit of Venus is more likely a sporadic phenomenon, as
the result of temporarily capture into the 1:1 mean motion resonance of dust
particles produced probably from passing comets or asteroids, but not Venus
Trojans.

  without Matching","18 pages, 6 figures and 5 tables",,,,"econ.EM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Matching has become the mainstream in counterfactual inference, with which
selection bias between sample groups can be significantly eliminated. However
in practice, when estimating average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) via
matching, no matter which method, the trade-off between estimation accuracy and
information loss constantly exist. Attempting to completely replace the
matching process, this paper proposes the GAN-ATT estimator that integrates
generative adversarial network (GAN) into counterfactual inference framework.
Through GAN machine learning, the probability density functions (PDFs) of
samples in both treatment group and control group can be approximated. By
differentiating conditional PDFs of the two groups with identical input
condition, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) can be estimated,
and the ensemble average of corresponding CATEs over all treatment group
samples is the estimate of ATT. Utilizing GAN-based infinite sample
augmentations, problems in the case of insufficient samples or lack of common
support domains can be easily solved. Theoretically, when GAN could perfectly
learn the PDFs, our estimators can provide exact estimate of ATT.
  To check the performance of the GAN-ATT estimator, three sets of data are
used for ATT estimations: Two toy data sets with 1/2 dimensional covariate
inputs and constant/covariate-dependent treatment effect are tested. The
estimates of GAN-ATT are proved close to the ground truth and are better than
traditional matching approaches; A real firm-level data set with
high-dimensional input is tested and the applicability towards real data sets
is evaluated by comparing matching approaches. Through the evidences obtained
from the three tests, we believe that the GAN-ATT estimator has significant
advantages over traditional matching methods in estimating ATT.

patients, with further testing on a real-world 50 patient sample diverse in not
only MRI scanner and field strength, but a random selection of pre- and

segmented lesions well, often equivalently to those trained on complete data,
exhibiting Dice coefficients of 0.907 (single sequence) to 0.945 (full

accurately detect enhancing tumour in the absence of contrast imaging,
quantifying its volume with an R2 between 0.95-0.97, and were invariant to

($^1P_1,~^3P_J~(J=0,1,2)$). The top three $Z^0$ propagated channels in cross
sections for double charmonia are $J/\psi+h_c,\eta_c+\chi_{c2}$, and
$\eta_c+\chi_{c0}$. For double bottomonia, they are $\eta_b+\Upsilon,

$B_c^{*+}+B_c^{*-}$,$B_c^{*+}+\chi_{bc2}^-$, and $\eta_{bc}^++B_c^{*-}$. The
cross sections of double $B_c$ mesons are roughly one order of magnitude larger
than those of the double bottomonia, and two orders of magnitude larger than
those of the double charmonia. To make it helpful for experimental study, we
present the total cross sections $\sigma$ as functions of CM energy $\sqrt{s}$,
$\sigma$ as functions of the renormalization scale $\mu$, the angle

an order of magnitude when adopting different potential models which becomes

significant indications of departures from equilibrium in the form of
asymmetric features in the phase space density of stars in the Solar
neighborhood. One such feature is the $z$--$v_z$ phase spiral, interpreted as
the response of the disk to the influence of a perturbation perpendicular to
the disk plane, which could be external (e.g., a satellite) or internal (e.g.,
the bar or spiral arms). In this work we use {\it Gaia} DR3 to dissect the
phase spiral by dividing the local data set into groups with similar azimuthal
actions, $J_\phi$, and conjugate angles, $\theta_\phi$, which selects stars on
similar orbits and at similar orbital phases, thus having experienced similar
perturbations in the past. These divisions allow us to explore areas of the
Galactic disk larger than the surveyed region. The separation improves the
clarity of the $z$--$v_z$ phase spiral and exposes changes to its morphology
across the different action-angle groups. In particular, we discover a
transition to two armed `breathing spirals' in the inner Milky Way. We conclude
that the local data contains signatures of not one, but multiple perturbations
with the prospect to use their distinct properties to infer the properties of
the interactions that caused them.

architecture, a learnable extension of the wavelet packet transform. As main
advantages, this model has few parameters, an intuitive initialization and
strong learning capabilities. Moreover, we show that it is possible to easily
modify the parameters of the model after the training step to tailor to
different noise intensities. Two case studies are conducted to compare this
model with the state of the art and commonly used denoising procedures. The
first experiment uses standard signals to study denoising properties of the
algorithms. The second experiment is a real application with the objective to
remove audio background noises. We show that the learnable wavelet packet
transform has the learning capabilities of deep learning methods while
maintaining the robustness of standard signal processing approaches. More
specifically, we demonstrate that our approach maintains excellent denoising
performances on signal classes separate from those used during the training
step. Moreover, the learnable wavelet packet transform was found to be robust
when different noise intensities, noise varieties and artifacts are considered.

to models trained on a precisely matched real data training set. Because
synthetic generation of training data from human-based models scales easily, we
find that our model transfer paradigm for X-ray image analysis, which we refer

conditions under which the FJ variants are able to induce opinion polarization
in a social network, as a function of the social ties between the nodes and
their individual susceptibility to the opinion of others. Thirdly, we discuss a
methodology for finding concrete opinion vectors that are able to bring the
network to a polarized state. Finally, our analytical results are applied to
two real social network graphs, showing how our theoretical findings can be
used to identify polarizing conditions under various configurations.

or ``central'' vertex in a (directed or undirected) graph, or rank the vertices
of a graph according to their importance. To this end, a plethora of so-called
centrality measures have been proposed in the literature. Such measures assess
which vertices in a graph are the most important ones by analyzing the
structure of the underlying graph. A family of centrality measures that are
suited for graph databases has been recently proposed by relying on the
following simple principle: the importance of a vertex in a graph is relative
to the number of ``relevant'' connected subgraphs surrounding it; we refer to
the members of this family as subgraph-based centrality measures. Although it
has been shown that such measures enjoy several favourable properties, their
absolute expressiveness remains largely unexplored. The goal of this work is to
precisely characterize the absolute expressiveness of the family of
subgraph-based centrality measures by considering both directed and undirected
graphs. To this end, we characterize when an arbitrary centrality measure is a
subgraph-based one, or a subgraph-based measure relative to the induced
ranking. These characterizations provide us with technical tools that allow us
to determine whether well-established centrality measures are subgraph-based.
Such a classification, apart from being interesting in its own right, gives
useful insights on the structural similarities and differences among existing
centrality measures.

which is part of the astrophysical parameters inference system (Apsis).
GSP-Phot is designed to produce a homogeneous catalogue of parameters for
hundreds of millions of single non-variable stars based on their astrometry,
photometry, and low-resolution BP/RP spectra. These parameters are effective
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, absolute $M_G$ magnitude, radius,
distance, and extinction for each star. GSP-Phot uses a Bayesian
forward-modelling approach to simultaneously fit the BP/RP spectrum, parallax,
and apparent $G$ magnitude. A major design feature of GSP-Phot is the use of
the apparent flux levels of BP/RP spectra to derive, in combination with
isochrone models, tight observational constraints on radii and distances. We
carefully validate the uncertainty estimates by exploiting repeat Gaia
observations of the same source. The data release includes GSP-Phot results for
471 million sources with $G<19$. Typical differences to literature values are
110 K for $T_{\rm eff}$ and 0.2-0.25 for $\log g$, but these depend strongly on
data quality. In particular, GSP-Phot results are significantly better for
stars with good parallax measurements ($\varpi/\sigma_varpi>20$), mostly within
2kpc. Metallicity estimates exhibit substantial biases compared to literature
values and are only useful at a qualitative level. However, we provide an
empirical calibration of our metallicity estimates that largely removes these
biases. Extinctions $A_0$ and $A_{\rm BP}$ show typical differences from
reference values of 0.07-0.09 mag. MCMC samples of the parameters are also
available for 95% of the sources. GSP-Phot provides a homogeneous catalogue of
stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions that can be used for various
purposes, such as sample selections (OB stars, red giants, solar analogues
etc.).

longitudinal motions of a rectilinear elastic rod. The control inputs are a
force, which is normal to the cross section and distributed piecewise
constantly along the rod's axis, as well as two external lumped loads at the
ends. It is assumed that the intervals of constancy in the normal force have
equal length. Given initial and terminal states with a fixed time horizon, the
optimal control problem is to minimize the mean mechanical energy stored in the
rod. To solve the problem, two unknown functions are introduced: the dynamical
potential and the longitudinal displacements. As a result, the initial-boundary
value problem is reformulated in a weak form, in which constitutive relations
are given as an integral quadratic equation. The unknown functions are both
continuous in the new statement. For the uniform rod, they are found as linear
combinations of traveling waves. In this case, all conditions on continuity as
well as boundary, initial, and terminal constraints form a linear algebraic
system with respect to the traveling waves and control functions. The minimal
controllability time is found from the solvability condition for this algebraic
system. After resolving the system, remaining free variables are used to
optimize the cost functional. Thus, the original control problem is reduced to
a one-dimensional variational problem. The Euler-Lagrange necessary condition
yields a linear system of ordinary differential equations with constant
coefficients supplemented by essential and natural boundary conditions.
Therefore, the exact optimal control law and the corresponding dynamic and
kinematic fields are found explicitly. Finally, the energy properties of the
optimal solution are analyzed.

number generation in this way is strongly related to the correlation length of
the angular mode. In this work, we calculate the correlation length of the
angular mode for a model exhibiting an approximate $U(1)$ symmetry. We find
that for a massive nearly non-interacting field, the correlation length of the
angular mode is determined by the mass parameter of the model and it is similar
to $H^{-1} \exp(H^2/m^2)$. Applying this result to baryogenesis via the
Affleck-Dine mechanism with a stochastic origin, we find that only for $m \ll
\mathcal O(0.1) H$(assuming $N_*=60$) can the correlation length of the baryon
number density be much larger than our current horizon size, such that we live
in the baryon-rich region. If this is not true, in the early time our universe
would consist of numerous patches of baryon-rich and anti-baryon-rich regions

220 million objects. Most of these are brighter than G = 17.65 but some BP/RP
spectra are published for sources down to G = 21.43. Their signal- to-noise
ratio varies significantly over the wavelength range covered and with magnitude
and colour of the observed objects, with sources around G = 15 having S/N above

sources with magnitudes 9 < G < 12, having S/N reaching 1000 in the central

clinical studies. One of the recent approaches is based on network structural
controllability that focuses on finding a control scheme and driver genes that
can steer the cell from an arbitrary state to a designated state. While
theoretically sound, this approach is impractical for many reasons, e.g., the
control scheme is often not unique and half of the nodes may be driver genes
for the cell. We developed a novel approach that transcends structural
controllability. Instead of considering driver genes for one control scheme, we
considered control hub genes that reside in the middle of a control path of
every control scheme. Control hubs are the most vulnerable spots for
controlling the cell and exogenous stimuli on them may render the cell
uncontrollable. We adopted control hubs as cancer-keep genes (CKGs) and applied
them to a gene regulatory network of bladder cancer (BLCA). All the genes on
the cell cycle and p53 singling pathways in BLCA are CKGs, confirming the
importance of these genes and the two pathways in cancer. A smaller set of 35
sensitive CKGs (sCKGs) for BLCA was identified by removing network links. Six
sCKGs (RPS6KA3, FGFR3, N-cadherin (CDH2), EP300, caspase-1, and FN1) were
subjected to small-interferencing-RNA knockdown in four cell lines to validate
their effects on the proliferation or migration of cancer cells. Knocking down
RPS6KA3 in a mouse model of BLCA significantly inhibited the growth of tumor
xenografts in the mouse model. Combined, our results demonstrated the value of
CKGs as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy and the potential of CKGs as an
effective means for studying and characterizing cancer etiology.

These experiments are fundamentally different from batch cultures where
populations of cells grow freely, and the statistical bias between them is
obtained by comparing our results to cell size distributions measured in
population. For exponential single-cell growth, characterizing most bacteria,
the lineage-population bias is obtained explicitly. In addition, if volume is
evenly split between the daughter cells at division, we show that cells are on
average smaller in populations. For more general power-law growth rates and
deterministic volume partitioning, both symmetric and asymmetric, we derive the
exact lineage distribution. This solution is in good agreement with E. Coli
mother machine data, and can be used to infer cell cycle parameters, such as
the strength of the size control and the asymmetry of the division. When
introducing stochastic volume partitioning, we derive the large-size and
small-size tails of the lineage size distributions, and show that they
respectively do not depend on the partitioning of volume and on the size
control strength. Finally, we show that introducing noise, either on the volume

require combiningdata from multiple sources to achieve adequate statistical

often limit the extent and speed of sharing resources, both data and code.
Epidemiological practices that follow FAIR principles can address these

(A)ccessible to authorized users and (I)nteroperable with other data, to
optimize the (R)e-use of resources with appropriate credit to its creators. We

by moving data and code from on-site locations to the Cloud, using
machine-readable and non-proprietary files, and developing open-source code.
Adoption of these practices will improve daily work and collaborative analyses,
and facilitate compliance with data sharing policies from funders and
scientific journals. Achieving a high degree of FAIRness will require funding,
training, organizational support, recognition, and incentives for sharing
resources. But these costs are amply outweighed by the benefits of making
research more reproducible, impactful, and equitable by facilitating the re-use

galaxies is essential in order to infer their escape fraction in the epoch of
reionisation, where direct measurements of LyC flux are impossible. To this
end, here we investigate whether strong C IV $\lambda \lambda 1548,1550$
emission in the rest-frame UV spectra of galaxies traces conditions ripe for
ample production and escape of LyC photons. We compile a sample of 19
star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $z=3.1-4.6$ from the VANDELS survey
that exhibit strong C IV emission, producing a stacked spectrum where all major
rest-UV emission lines are clearly detected. Best-fitting spectral energy
distribution models containing both stellar and nebular emission suggest the
need for low stellar metallicities ($Z=0.1-0.2\,Z_\odot$), young stellar ages
($\log(\rm{age/yr}) = 6.1-6.5$), a high ionisation parameter ($\log U = -2$)
and little to no dust attenuation ($E(B-V)=0.00-0.01$). However, these models
are unable to fully reproduce the observed C IV and He II line strengths. We
find that the Ly$\alpha$ line in the stacked spectrum is strong and peaks close
to the systemic velocity, features that are indicative of significant LyC
photon leakage along the line-of-sight. The covering fractions of
low-ionisation interstellar absorption lines are also low implying LyC escape
fraction in the range $\approx 0.05-0.30$, with signatures of outflowing gas.
Finally, C IV/C III] ratios of >0.75 for a subset of individual galaxies with
reliable detections of both lines are also consistent with physical conditions
that enable significant LyC leakage. Overall, we report that multiple
spectroscopic indicators of LyC leakage are present in the stacked spectrum of
strong C IV emitting galaxies, potentially making C IV an important tracer of
LyC photon escape at $z>6$.

Our method clusters programs into equivalence classes based on a distance

implements unsupervised learning techniques to classify the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS

image classification by utilizing large-scale datasets. However, it is still of
great challenge to learn from scratch on small-scale datasets efficiently and
effectively. With limited training datasets, the concepts of categories will be
ambiguous since the over-parameterized CNNs tend to simply memorize the
dataset, leading to poor generalization capacity. Therefore, it is crucial to
study how to learn more discriminative representations while avoiding
over-fitting. Since the concepts of categories tend to be ambiguous, it is
important to catch more individual-wise information. Thus, we propose a new
framework, termed Attract-and-Repulse, which consists of Contrastive
Regularization (CR) to enrich the feature representations, Symmetric Cross
Entropy (SCE) to balance the fitting for different classes and Mean Teacher to
calibrate label information. Specifically, SCE and CR learn discriminative
representations while alleviating over-fitting by the adaptive trade-off
between the information of classes (attract) and instances (repulse). After
that, Mean Teacher is used to further improve the performance via calibrating
more accurate soft pseudo labels. Sufficient experiments validate the
effectiveness of the Attract-and-Repulse framework. Together with other

as actions of an agent. iCITRIS identifies the potentially multidimensional

finite elements/meshes. Tetrahedral elements are most commonly used as they can
be generated in seemingly automated and effortless way. In practice, however,
due to complex aneurysm geometry, the process tends to require time consuming
mesh optimisation to ensure sufficiently high quality of tetrahedral elements.
Furthermore, ensuring solution convergence requires large number of tetrahedral
elements, which leads to long computation times. In this study, we focus on
generation of hexahedral meshes as they are known to provide converged solution
for smaller number of elements than tetrahedral meshes. Generation of
hexahedral meshes for continua with complex/irregular geometry, such as
aneurysms, requires analyst interaction. We propose a procedure for generating
high quality patient-specific hexahedral discretisation of aneurysm wall using
the algorithms available in commercial software package for mesh generation.
For aneurysm cases, we demonstrate that the procedure facilitates
patient-specific mesh generation within timeframe consistent with clinical
workflow constraints while requiring only limited input from the analyst.

Shapley Supercluster), we have discovered a narrow, long and straight, very
faint radio filament, which branches out at a straight angle from the tail of a
radio galaxy located in projection near the core of the cluster. The radio
filament spans 200 kpc and aligns with a sloshing cold front seen in the
X-rays, staying inside the front in projection. The radio spectral index along
the filament appears uniform (within large uncertainties) at $\alpha\simeq
-1.5$. We propose that the radio galaxy is located outside the cold front, but
dips its tail under the front. The tangential wind that blows there may stretch
the radio plasma from the radio galaxy into a filamentary structure. Some
reacceleration is needed in this scenario to maintain the radio spectrum
uniform. Alternatively, the cosmic ray electrons from that spot in the tail can
spread along the cluster magnetic field lines, straightened by that same
tangential flow, via anomalously fast diffusion. Our radio filament can provide
constraints on this process. We also uncover a compact radio source at the
Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) that is 2--3 orders of magnitude less luminous
than those in typical cluster central galaxies -- probably an example of a BCG
starved of accretion fuel by gas sloshing.

RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world
application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising
from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every
connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations,
contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a
solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication
between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with
backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as
well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with
units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so
that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We
show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the
computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the
number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without
compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared
to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including

of non-Gaussian correlations of the latter modes. We derive fundamental new

performers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the
task-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified
ML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the
recommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard
recommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features.
That is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique
IDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms.
To pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS
models in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a
mixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present
TransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework.
TransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an
end-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under
various scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically
study the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world

safe assumption for many applications, recent advances in ultrafast imaging
leverage the wealth of information that can be extracted from the exact time of
flight of light. In this context, physically-based transient rendering allows
to efficiently simulate and analyze light transport considering that the speed
of light is indeed finite. In this paper, we introduce a novel differentiable
transient rendering framework, to help bring the potential of differentiable
approaches into the transient regime. To differentiate the transient path
integral we need to take into account that scattering events at path vertices
are no longer independent; instead, tracking the time of flight of light
requires treating such scattering events at path vertices jointly as a
multidimensional, evolving manifold. We thus turn to the generalized transport
theorem, and introduce a novel correlated importance term, which links the
time-integrated contribution of a path to its light throughput, and allows us
to handle discontinuities in the light and sensor functions. Last, we present
results in several challenging scenarios where the time of flight of light
plays an important role such as optimizing indices of refraction,
non-line-of-sight tracking with nonplanar relay walls, and non-line-of-sight

argument by Faltings with improvements by Esteves-Popa. We hope to promote this
approach as a blueprint for other projectivity arguments.

any (measurement independent) local hidden variable theory. However, the
violation only implies incompatibility of the underlying assumptions of

extent to which each assumption is violated quantitatively. In contrast, Hall
(2010,2011) gave a quantification of each assumption and generalized the
Bell-CHSH inequality that gives a trade-off relationship between the underlying

capturing the physical processes responsible for their occurrence are key steps
for improving our understanding of climate variability and climate change and
for better evaluating the associated hazards. It has recently become apparent
that large deviation theory is very useful for investigating persistent extreme
events, and specifically, for flexibly estimating long return periods and for
introducing a notion of dynamical typicality. Using a methodological framework
based on large deviation theory and taking advantage of long simulations by a
state-of-the-art Earth System Model, we investigate the 2021 North America
Heatwave. Indeed, our analysis shows that the 2021 event can be seen as an
unlikely but possible manifestation of climate variability, whilst its
probability of occurrence is greatly amplified by the ongoing climate change.
We also clarify the properties of spatial coherence of the 2021 heatwave and
elucidate the role played by the Rocky Mountains in modulating hot, dry, and
persistent extreme events in the Western Pacific region of North America.

Here we address the question of how the size of large lecture halls affects
classroom-turnover times, focusing on non-emergency settings. By adapting the
established social-force model, we treat students as individuals who interact
and move through classrooms to reach their destinations. We find that social
interactions and the separation time between consecutive classes strongly
influence how long it takes entering students to reach their desks, and that
these effects are more pronounced in larger lecture halls. While the median
time that individual students must travel increases with decreased separation
time, we find that shorter separation times lead to shorter classroom-turnover
times overall. This suggests that the effects of scheduling gaps and
lecture-hall size on classroom dynamics depends on the perspective - individual
student or whole class - that one chooses to take.

data in the form of input-output pairs ignoring available domain knowledge. In
this work, the Constraint Guided Gradient Descent (CGGD) framework is proposed
that enables the injection of domain knowledge into the training procedure. The
domain knowledge is assumed to be described as a conjunction of hard inequality
constraints which appears to be a natural choice for several applications.
Compared to other neuro-symbolic approaches, the proposed method converges to a
model that satisfies any inequality constraint on the training data and does
not require to first transform the constraints into some ad-hoc term that is
added to the learning (optimisation) objective. Under certain conditions, it is
shown that CGGD can converges to a model that satisfies the constraints on the
training set, while prior work does not necessarily converge to such a model.
It is empirically shown on two independent and small data sets that CGGD makes
training less dependent on the initialisation of the network and improves the
constraint satisfiability on all data.

fluxonium and a transmon qubit, namely a cross-resonance (CR) and a CPHASE
gate. The large frequency difference between a transmon and a fluxonium makes
the realization of a two-qubit gate challenging. For a medium-frequency
fluxonium qubit, the transmon-fluxonium system allows for a cross-resonance
effect mediated by the higher levels of the fluxonium over a wide range of
transmon frequencies. This allows one to realize the cross-resonance gate by
driving the fluxonium at the transmon frequency, mitigating typical problems of
the cross-resonance gate in transmon-transmon chips related to frequency
targeting and residual ZZ coupling. However, when the fundamental frequency of
the fluxonium enters the low-frequency regime below 100 MHz, the
cross-resonance effect decreases leading to long gate times. For this range of
parameters, a fast microwave CPHASE gate can be implemented using the higher
levels of the fluxonium. In both cases, we perform numerical simulations of the
gate showing that a gate fidelity above 99% can be obtained with gate times
between 100 and 300 ns. Next to a detailed gate analysis, we perform a study of
chip yield for a surface code lattice of fluxonia and transmons interacting via
the proposed cross-resonance gate. We find a much better yield as compared to a
transmon-only architecture with the cross-resonance gate as native two-qubit
gate.

about 1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the European Space
Agency (ESA) Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase
(the same period covered Gaia early Data Release 3; Gaia EDR3). Low-resolution
spectra for 220 million sources are one of the important new data products
included in this release.
  Aims. In this paper, we focus on the external calibration of low-resolution
spectroscopic content, describing the input data, algorithms, data processing,
and the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality
of the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into
account to make the best use of the catalogue.
  Methods. We calibrated an instrument model to relate mean Gaia spectra to the
corresponding spectral energy distributions using an extended set of
calibrators: this includes modelling of the instrument dispersion relation,
transmission, and line spread functions. Optimisation of the model is achieved
through total least-squares regression, accounting for errors in Gaia and
external spectra.
  Results. The resulting instrument model can be used for forward modelling of
Gaia spectra or for inverse modelling of externally calibrated spectra in
absolute flux units.
  Conclusions. The absolute calibration derived in this paper provides an
essential ingredient for users of BP/RP spectra. It allows users to connect
BP/RP spectra to absolute fluxes and physical wavelengths.

on the use of superoperator projectors is presented. More precisely, working
with projectors in the Choi-Jamiolkowski picture is shown to provide a handy
way of defining the characterization constraints on any class of higher-order
transformations. The algebraic properties of these projectors are furthermore
identified as a model of multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL). The main
novelty of this work is the introduction in the algebra of the 'prec'
connector. It is used for the characterization of maps that are no signaling
from input to output or the other way around. This allows to assess the
possible signaling structure of any maps characterized within the projective
framework. The properties of the prec are moreover shown to yield a canonical
form for projective expressions. This provides an unambiguous way to compare
different higher-order theories.

than 470 million sources, in addition to the identification of over 11 million
variable stars. Using the astrophysical parameters and variability
classifications provided in Gaia DR3, we select various stellar populations to
explore and identify non-axisymmetric features in the disc of the Milky Way in
both configuration and velocity space. Using more about 580 thousand sources
identified as hot OB stars, together with 988 known open clusters younger than
100 million years, we map the spiral structure associated with star formation
4-5 kpc from the Sun. We select over 2800 Classical Cepheids younger than 200
million years, which show spiral features extending as far as 10 kpc from the
Sun in the outer disc. We also identify more than 8.7 million sources on the
red giant branch (RGB), of which 5.7 million have line-of-sight velocities,
allowing the velocity field of the Milky Way to be mapped as far as 8 kpc from
the Sun, including the inner disc. The spiral structure revealed by the young
populations is consistent with recent results using Gaia EDR3 astrometry and
source lists based on near infrared photometry, showing the Local (Orion) arm

the large scale kinematic signature of the bar in the inner disc, as well as
evidence of streaming motions in the outer disc that might be associated with
spiral arms or bar resonances. (abridged)

clinical routine since they aim at minimizing subjectivity by measuring
performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. In this paper, we report on a
study that consists of a semi-standardized history taking followed by two
standardized neuropsychological tests, namely the SKT and the CERAD-NB. The
tests include basic tasks such as naming objects, learning word lists, but also
widely used tools such as the MMSE. Most of the tasks are performed verbally
and should thus be suitable for automated scoring based on transcripts. For the
first batch of 30 patients, we analyze the correlation between expert manual
evaluations and automatic evaluations based on manual and automatic
transcriptions. For both SKT and CERAD-NB, we observe high to perfect
correlations using manual transcripts; for certain tasks with lower
correlation, the automatic scoring is stricter than the human reference since
it is limited to the audio. Using automatic transcriptions, correlations drop
as expected and are related to recognition accuracy; however, we still observe
high correlations of up to 0.98 (SKT) and 0.85 (CERAD-NB). We show that using
word alternatives helps to mitigate recognition errors and subsequently
improves correlation with expert scores.

astrophysical contexts. Among the different types, the Classical Cepheids are
fundamental tools for the calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder.
They are also powerful stellar population tracers in the context of Galactic
studies. The Gaia Third Data Release (DR3) publishes improved data on Cepheids
collected during the initial 34 months of operations. Aims. We present the Gaia
DR3 catalogue of Cepheids of all types, obtained through the analysis carried
out with the Specific Object Study (SOS) Cep&RRL pipeline. Methods. We discuss
the procedures adopted to clean the Cepheid sample from spurious objects, to
validate the results, and to re-classify sources with a wrong outcome from the
SOS Cep&RRL pipeline. Results. The Gaia DR3 includes multi-band time-series
photometry and characterisation by the SOS Cep&RRL pipeline for a sample of
15,006 Cepheids of all types. The sample includes 4,663, 4,616, 321 and 185
pulsators, distributed in the LMC, SMC, M31 and M33, respectively, as well as 5
221 objects in the remaining All Sky sub-region which includes stars in the MW
field/clusters and in a number of small satellites of our Galaxy. Among this
sample, 327 objects were known as variable stars in the literature but with a
different classification, while, to the best of our knowledge, 474 stars have
not been reported before to be variable stars and therefore they likely are new
Cepheids discovered by Gaia.

image SR methods are developed on a single fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic
downsampling), and thus cannot be applied to super-resolve real LF images with
diverse degradations. In this paper, we propose the first method to handle LF
image SR with multiple degradations. In our method, a practical LF degradation
model that considers blur and noise is developed to approximate the degradation
process of real LF images. Then, a degradation-adaptive network (LF-DAnet) is
designed to incorporate the degradation prior into the SR process. By training
on LF images with multiple synthetic degradations, our method can learn to
adapt to different degradations while incorporating the spatial and angular
information. Extensive experiments on both synthetically degraded and
real-world LFs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with
existing state-of-the-art single and LF image SR methods, our method achieves
superior SR performance under a wide range of degradations, and generalizes
better to real LF images. Codes and models are available at

measurement of inclusive ${\rm f}_{0}(980)$ production at LHC energies. The
production is measured at midrapidity, $|y| < 0.5$, in a wide transverse
momentum range, $0 < p_{\rm T} < 16$ GeV/$c$, by reconstructing the resonance
in the ${\rm f}_{0}(980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ hadronic decay channel
using the ALICE detector. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential yields are compared to
those of pions, protons and $\phi$ mesons as well as to predictions from the
HERWIG 7.2 QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator and calculations from a
coalescence model that uses the AMPT model as an input. The ratio of the
$p_{\rm T}$-integrated yield of ${\rm f}_{0}(980)$ relative to pions is
compared to measurements in ${\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-}$ and pp collisions at lower
energies and predictions from statistical hadronisation models and HERWIG 7.2.
A mild collision energy dependence of the ${\rm f}_{0}(980)$ to pion production
is observed in pp collisions from SPS to LHC energies. All considered models
underpredict the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated ${\rm f}_{0}(980)/(\pi^{+}+\pi^{-})$
ratio. The prediction from the $\gamma_{\rm s}$-CSM model assuming a zero total
strangeness content of ${\rm f}_{0}(980)$ is consistent with the data within
1.9$\sigma$ and is the closest to the data. The results provide an essential
reference for future measurements of the particle yield and nuclear
modification in p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions, which have been proposed to be
instrumental to probe the elusive nature and quark composition of the ${\rm

computational methods adopt approximations in some form in order to obtain a
favourable cost/accuracy trade-off and there are usually many approximations
that could be used. As a result, when a researcher wishes to measure a property
of a system with a computational technique, they are faced with an array of
options. Current computational workflow frameworks focus on helping researchers
automate a sequence of steps on a particular platform. The aim is often to
obtain a computational measurement of a property. However these frameworks are
unaware that there may be a large number of ways to do so. As such, they cannot
support researchers in making these choices during development or at
execution-time.
  We argue that computational workflow frameworks should be designed to be
\textit{approximation-aware} - that is, support the fact that a given workflow
description represents a task that \textit{could} be performed in different
ways. This is key to unlocking the potential of computational workflows to
accelerate discovery tasks, particularly those involving searches of large
entity spaces. It will enable efficiently obtaining measurements of entity
properties, given a set of constraints, by directly leveraging the space of
choices available. In this paper we describe the basic functions that an
approximation-aware workflow framework should provide, how those functions can
be realized in practice, and illustrate some of the powerful capabilities it
would enable, including approximate memoization, surrogate model support, and
automated workflow composition.

Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), a dependence measure based on
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). HSIC measures the dependence between
regions of an input image and the output of a model based on kernel embeddings
of distributions. It thus provides explanations enriched by RKHS representation
capabilities. HSIC can be estimated very efficiently, significantly reducing
the computational cost compared to other black-box attribution methods. Our
experiments show that HSIC is up to 8 times faster than the previous best
black-box attribution methods while being as faithful. Indeed, we improve or
match the state-of-the-art of both black-box and white-box attribution methods
for several fidelity metrics on Imagenet with various recent model
architectures. Importantly, we show that these advances can be transposed to
efficiently and faithfully explain object detection models such as YOLOv4.
Finally, we extend the traditional attribution methods by proposing a new
kernel enabling an ANOVA-like orthogonal decomposition of importance scores
based on HSIC, allowing us to evaluate not only the importance of each image
patch but also the importance of their pairwise interactions. Our

make $\delta$ many dependent choices over any definable relation without
terminal nodes. Friedman, the first author, and Kanovei constructed a model of
ZFC$^-$ (ZFC without power set) with largest cardinal $\omega$ in which this
principle fails for $\omega$ many choices. In this article we study failures of
dependent choice principles over ZFC$^-$ by considering the notion of big
proper classes. A proper class is said to be big if it surjects onto every
non-zero ordinal.
  We shall see that if one assumes the scheme of dependent choices of any
arbitrary set length then every proper class is indeed big. However, by
building on work of Zarach, we provide a general framework for separating
dependent choice schemes of various lengths by producing models of ZFC$^-$ with
proper classes that are not big. Using a similar idea, we then extend the
earlier result by producing a model of ZFC$^-$ in which there are unboundedly
many cardinals but the scheme of dependent choices of length $\omega$ still
fails.
  Finally, the second author has proven that a model of ZFC$^-$ cannot have a
non-trivial, cofinal, elementary self-embedding for which the von-Neumann
hierarchy exists up to its critical point. We answer a related question posed
by the second author by showing that the existence of such an embedding need
not imply the existence of any non-trivial fragment of the von-Neumann
hierarchy. In particular, that in such a situation $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ can be
a proper class.

Then, the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is employed to derive the dynamic
equation, which has a constant mass matrix and is free from trigonometric
functions as well as centrifugal and Coriolis terms. For numerical analysis of
nonlinear dynamics, a modified symplectic integration scheme is derived,
accommodating non-conservative forces and boundary conditions. Additionally,
formulations for statics and linearized dynamics around static equilibrium

layer at M = 4.5 that aims at reducing the linear growth of second Mack mode
instabilities. These instabilities are first characterized with local spatial
and global resolvent analyses, which allow to refine the control strategy and
to select appropriate actuators and sensors. After linear input-output reduced
order models have been identified, multi-criteria structured mixed
$H_{2}/H_{\infty}$ synthesis allows to fix beforehand the controller structure
and to minimize appropriate norms of various transfer functions: the $H_{2}$
norm to guarantee performance (reduction of perturbation amplification in
nominal condition) and the $H_{\infty}$ norm to maintain performance robustness
(with respect to sensor noise) and stability robustness (with respect to
uncertain free-stream velocity/density variations). Both feedforward and
feedback setups, i.e. with estimation sensor placed respectively
upstream/downstream of the actuator, allow to maintain the local perturbation
energy below a given threshold over a significant distance downstream of the
actuator, even in the case of noisy estimation sensors or free-stream density
variations. However, the feedforward setup becomes completely ineffective when
convective time-delays are altered by free-stream velocity variations of $\pm
5\%$, which highlights the strong relevance of the feedback setup for
performance robustness in convectively unstable flows.

systems, the automobile industry recently has focused attention on crash
response in relaxed postures with increased seatback recline. Prior research
found that this posture may result in greater risk of lumbar spine injury in
the event of a frontal crash. This study developed a lumbar spine injury risk
function that estimated injury risk as a function of simultaneously applied
compression force and flexion moment. Force and moment failure data from 40
compression-flexion tests were utilized in a Weibull survival model, including
appropriate data censoring. A mechanics-based injury metric was formulated,
where lumbar spine compression force and flexion moment were normalized to
specimen geometry. Subject age was incorporated as a covariate to further
improve model fit. A weighting factor was included to adjust the influence of
force and moment, and parameter optimization yielded a value of 0.11. Thus, the
normalized compression force component had a greater effect on injury risk than
the normalized flexion moment component. Additionally, as force was nominally
increased, less moment was required to produce injury for a given age and
specimen geometry. The resulting injury risk function can be utilized to
improve occupant safety in the field.

formulations in different Sobolev spaces. Based on the completely decoupled
modified weak formulation, the convergence of the iterative parallel algorithm
is proved rigorously. To carry out the convergence analysis of our proposed
algorithm, we propose an important but general convergence lemma for the
steady-state problems. Furthermore, with some suitable choice of parameters,
the new algorithm is proved to achieve the geometric convergence rate. Finally,
several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and validate the

We prove the first polynomial convergence guarantees for the core mechanic

estimate (an estimate of $\nabla \ln p$) that is accurate in $L^2(p)$. Compared
to previous works, we do not incur error that grows exponentially in time or
that suffers from a curse of dimensionality. Our guarantee works for any smooth
distribution and depends polynomially on its log-Sobolev constant. Using our
guarantee, we give a theoretical analysis of score-based generative modeling,
which transforms white-noise input into samples from a learned data
distribution given score estimates at different noise scales. Our analysis
gives theoretical grounding to the observation that an annealed procedure is
required in practice to generate good samples, as our proof depends essentially
on using annealing to obtain a warm start at each step. Moreover, we show that
a predictor-corrector algorithm gives better convergence than using either

by bond dimension $D$, and the extrapolation scheme to reach the
""thermodynamic"" limit $D \to \infty$. Recent advances in variational

valence-bond solids which are already well described by finite-$D$ iPEPS. In

worst-case weight perturbations which significantly improves generalization in

SAM which are based on a PAC-Bayes generalization bound and the idea of
convergence to flat minima are incomplete. Moreover, there are no explanations
for the success of using $m$-sharpness in SAM which has been shown as essential
for generalization. To better understand this aspect of SAM, we theoretically
analyze its implicit bias for diagonal linear networks. We prove that SAM
always chooses a solution that enjoys better generalization properties than
standard gradient descent for a certain class of problems, and this effect is
amplified by using $m$-sharpness. We further study the properties of the
implicit bias on non-linear networks empirically, where we show that
fine-tuning a standard model with SAM can lead to significant generalization
improvements. Finally, we provide convergence results of SAM for non-convex
objectives when used with stochastic gradients. We illustrate these results

quantum protocols that does not put any trust in their implementations. It
requires all claims, about e.g. security, to be made at the level of the final
classical data in hands of the end-users. This imposes a great challenge for
determining attainable key rates in device-independent quantum key distribution
(DIQKD), but also opens the door for consideration of eavesdropping attacks
that stem from the possibility of a given data being just generated by a
malicious third-party. In this work, we explore this path and present the
convex-combination attack as an efficient, easy-to-use technique for
upper-bounding DIQKD key rates. It allows verifying the accuracy of lower
bounds on key rates for state-of-the-art protocols, whether involving one-way

currently predicted constraints on the robustness of DIQKD protocols to
experimental imperfections, such as the finite visibility or detection
efficiency, are already very close to the ultimate tolerable thresholds.

affect various aspects of our lives. As a result, providing explanations for
their decisions to address the needs of users and organisations is increasingly
expected by laws, regulations, codes of conduct, and the public. However, as
laws and regulations do not prescribe how to meet such expectations,
organisations are often left to devise their own approaches to explainability,
inevitably increasing the cost of compliance and good governance. Hence, we
envision Explainability-by-Design, a holistic methodology characterised by
proactive measures to include explanation capability in the design of
decision-making systems. The methodology consists of three phases: (A)
Explanation Requirement Analysis, (B) Explanation Technical Design, and (C)
Explanation Validation. This paper describes phase (B), a technical workflow to
implement explanation capability from requirements elicited by domain experts
for a specific application context. Outputs of this phase are a set of
configurations, allowing a reusable explanation service to exploit logs
provided by the target application to create provenance traces of the
application's decisions. The provenance then can be queried to extract relevant
data points, which can be used in explanation plans to construct explanations
personalised to their consumers. Following the workflow, organisations can
design their decision-making systems to produce explanations that meet the
specified requirements. To facilitate the process, we present a software
architecture with reusable components to incorporate the resulting explanation
capability into an application. Finally, we applied the workflow to two
application scenarios and measured the associated development costs. It was
shown that the approach is tractable in terms of development time, which can be
as low as two hours per sentence.

difficulties in medical diagnosis by either physicians or computer-aided
diagnosis algorithms. Deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution (SR)
methods are feasible ways to improve resolution, with convolutional neural
networks (CNN) at their core. Despite recent progress, these methods are
limited by inherent properties of convolution operators, which ignore content
relevance and cannot effectively model long-range dependencies. In addition,
most of the existing methods use pseudo-paired volumes for training and
evaluation, where pseudo low-resolution (LR) volumes are generated by a simple
degradation of their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the domain gap
between pseudo- and real-LR volumes leads to the poor performance of these
methods in practice. In this paper, we build the first public real-paired
dataset RPLHR-CT as a benchmark for volumetric SR, and provide baseline results
by re-implementing four state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. Considering the
inherent shortcoming of CNN, we also propose a transformer volumetric
super-resolution network (TVSRN) based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with
convolutions entirely. This is the first research to use a pure transformer for

to the estimates of the disk sizes based on microlensing. We find these three
effects combined can explain the long-standing problem of the disk sizes from
microlensing being larger than those estimated using the standard disk model
(i.e., that without accounting for the above effects). In particular, an
increase of the color correction with the increasing temperature can lead to a
strong increase of the half-light radius even if this correction is close to
unity at the temperature corresponding to an observed frequency. Our proposed
formalism for calculating the half-light radius also resolves the long-standing
issue of discrepancies between the disk size estimates based on the accretion
rate and on the observed flux.

addresses two settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint

required to satisfy the constraint. For (i), we prove that our algorithm
returns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with probability $1 - \delta$, by making

absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Arterial transit time (ATT)
is a related physiological parameter reflecting the duration for the labeled
spins to reach the brain region of interest. Multiple post-labeling delay
(PLDs) can provide robust measures of both CBF and ATT, allowing for
optimization of regional CBF modeling based on ATT. The prolonged acquisition
time can potentially reduce the quality and accuracy of the CBF and ATT
estimation. We proposed a novel network to significantly reduce the number of
PLDs with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Method: CBF and ATT estimations
were performed for one PLD and two PLDs sepa-rately. Each model was trained
independently to learn the nonlinear transformation from perfusion weighted
image (PWI) to CBF and ATT images. Results: Both one-PLD and two-PLD models
outperformed the conventional method visually on CBF and two-PLD model showed
more accurate structure on ATT estima-tion. The proposed method significantly
reduces the number of PLDs from 6 to 2 on ATT and even to single PLD on CBF
without sacrificing the SNR. Conclusion: It is feasible to generate CBF and ATT
maps with reduced PLDs using deep learning with high quality.

behavior characteristics from logged user behavior data for accurate
recommendations. However, user behavior sequences are viewed as a script with
multiple ongoing threads intertwined. We find that only a small set of pivotal
behaviors can be evolved into the user's future action. As a result, the future
behavior of the user is hard to predict. We conclude this characteristic for
sequential behaviors of each user as the Behavior Pathway. Different users have
their unique behavior pathways. Among existing sequential models, transformers
have shown great capacity in capturing global-dependent characteristics.
However, these models mainly provide a dense distribution over all previous
behaviors using the self-attention mechanism, making the final predictions
overwhelmed by the trivial behaviors not adjusted to each user. In this paper,
we build the Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a novel Pathway Attention
mechanism. RETR can dynamically plan the behavior pathway specified for each
user, and sparingly activate the network through this behavior pathway to
effectively capture evolving patterns useful for recommendation. The key design
is a learned binary route to prevent the behavior pathway from being
overwhelmed by trivial behaviors. We empirically verify the effectiveness of
RETR on seven real-world datasets and RETR yields state-of-the-art performance.

inherent vulnerability during their training to adversarial backdoor attacks.
In this type of attack, the goal of the attacker is to use poisoned updates to
implant so-called backdoors into the learned model such that, at test time, the
model's outputs can be fixed to a given target for certain inputs. (As a simple
toy example, if a user types ""people from New York"" into a mobile keyboard app
that uses a backdoored next word prediction model, then the model could
autocomplete the sentence to ""people from New York are rude""). Prior work has
shown that backdoors can be inserted into FL models, but these backdoors are
often not durable, i.e., they do not remain in the model after the attacker
stops uploading poisoned updates. Thus, since training typically continues
progressively in production FL systems, an inserted backdoor may not survive
until deployment. Here, we propose Neurotoxin, a simple one-line modification
to existing backdoor attacks that acts by attacking parameters that are changed
less in magnitude during training. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation across
ten natural language processing and computer vision tasks, and we find that we
can double the durability of state of the art backdoors.

pandemics assail public health in two waves: first, from the contagion itself
and second, from plagues of suspicion and stigma. Now, we have in our hands and
on our phones an outbreak of moral controversy. Modern dependency on social
medias has not only facilitated access to the locations of vaccine clinics and
testing sites but also-and more frequently-to the convoluted explanations of
how ""COVID-19 was a FIFA conspiracy""[1]. The MIT Media Lab finds that false
news ""diffuses significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than
truth, in all categories of information, and by an order of magnitude""[2]. The
question is, how does the spread of misinformation interact with a physical
epidemic disease? In this paper, we estimate the extent to which misinformation
has influenced the course of the COVID-19 pandemic using natural language
processing models and provide a strategy to combat social media posts that are
likely to cause widespread harm.

signature of vehicles that represents the overall comfort level for passengers.
Due to highly uncertain behavior of production cars, probabilistic metamodels
or surrogates can be useful to estimate the NVH dispersion and assess different
NVH risks. These metamodels follow physical behaviors and shall aid as a design
space exploration tool during the early stage design process to support the NVH
optimization. The measurement databases constitute different noise paths such
as aerodynamic noise (wind-tunnel test), tire-pavement interaction noise
(rolling noise), and noise due to electric motors (whining noise). This
research work proposes a global NVH metamodeling technique for broadband noises
such as aerodynamic and rolling noises exploiting the Bayesian framework that
takes into account the prior (domain-expert) knowledge about complex physical
mechanisms. Generalized additive models (GAMs) with polynomials and Gaussian
basis functions are used to model the dependency of sound pressure level (SPL)
on predictor variables. Moreover, parametric bootstrap algorithm based on
data-generating mechanism using the point estimates is used to estimate the
dispersion in unknown parameters. Probabilistic modelling is carried out using
an open-source library PyMC3 that utilizes No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) and the
developed models are validated using Cross-Validation technique.

  Games and Applications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.00886",,,,"q-fin.RM math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a financial network represented at any time instance by a random
liability graph which evolves over time. The agents connect through credit
instruments borrowed from each other or through direct lending, and these
create the liability edges. These random edges are modified (locally) by the
agents over time, as they learn from their experiences and (possibly imperfect)
observations. The settlement of the liabilities of various agents at the end of
the contract period (at any time instance) can be expressed as solutions of
random fixed point equations. Our first step is to derive the solutions of
these equations (asymptotically and one for each time instance), using a recent
result on random fixed point equations. The agents, at any time instance, adapt
one of the two available strategies, risky or less risky investments, with an
aim to maximize their returns. We aim to study the emerging strategies of such
replicator dynamics that drives the financial network. We theoretically reduce
the analysis of the complex system to that of an appropriate ordinary
differential equation (ODE). Using the attractors of the resulting ODE we show
that the replicator dynamics converges to one of the two pure evolutionary
stable strategies (all risky or all less risky agents); one can have mixed
limit only when the observations are imperfect. We verify our theoretical
findings using exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations. The dynamics avoid the
emergence of the systemic-risk regime (where majority default). However, if all
the agents blindly adapt risky strategy it can lead to systemic risk regime.

  stabilization via artificial intelligence",,,,,"physics.soc-ph nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Irregular, especially chaotic, behavior is often undesirable for economic
processes because it presents challenges for predicting their dynamics. In this
situation, control of such a process by its mathematical model can be used to
suppress chaotic behavior and to transit the system from irregular to regular
dynamics.
  In this paper, we have constructed an overlapping generations model with a
control function. By applying evolutionary algorithms we showed that in the
absence of control, both regular and irregular behavior (periodic and chaotic)
could be observed in this model. We then used the synthesis of control by the
Pyragas control method with two control parameters to solve the problem of
controlling the irregular behavior of the model. We solved a number of
optimization problems applying evolutionary algorithms to select control
parameters in order to ensure stability of periodic orbits. We compared
qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the model's dynamics before and
after applying control and verified the results obtained using simulation.
  We thus demonstrated that artificial intelligence technologies (in
particular, evolutionary algorithms) combined with the Pyragas control method
are well suited for in-depth analysis and stabilization of irregular dynamics
in the model considered in this paper.
