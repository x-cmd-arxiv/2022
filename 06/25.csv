  2D turbulence",,,"10.1017/jfm.2022.935",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Instabilities of fluid flows often generate turbulence. Using extensive
direct numerical simulations, we study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a
wavenumber-localised instability superposed on stochastic forcing, in contrast
to previous studies of state-independent forcing. As the contribution of the
instability forcing, measured by a parameter $\gamma$, increases, the system
undergoes two transitions. For $\gamma$ below a first threshold, a regular
large-scale vortex condensate forms. Above this threshold, shielded vortices
(SVs) emerge within the condensate. At a second, larger value of $\gamma$, the
condensate breaks down, and a gas of weakly interacting vortices with broken
symmetry spontaneously emerges, characterised by preponderance of vortices of
one sign only and suppressed inverse energy cascade. The latter transition is
shown to depend on the damping mechanism. The number density of SVs in the
broken symmetry state slowly increases via a random nucleation process.
Bistability is observed between the condensate and mixed SV-condensate states.
Our findings provide new evidence for a strong dependence of two-dimensional
turbulence phenomenology on the forcing.

this technical report, we present a photo-realistic object-centric dataset
HM3D-ABO. It is constructed by composing realistic indoor scene and realistic
object. For each configuration, we provide multi-view RGB observations, a
water-tight mesh model for the object, ground truth depth map and object mask.
The proposed dataset could also be useful for tasks such as camera pose
estimation and novel-view synthesis. The dataset generation code is released at

in circumstellar disks, but observational constraints of grain size remain
challenging. (Sub)millimeter continuum observations often show a percent-level
polarization parallel to the disk minor axis, which is generally attributed to
scattering by $\sim 100\mu$m-sized spherical grains (with a size parameter $x
\equiv 2\pi a / \lambda < 1$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength). Larger
spherical grains (with $x$ greater than unity) would produce opposite
polarization direction. However, the inferred size is in tension with the
opacity index $\beta$ that points to larger mm/cm-sized grains. We investigate
the scattering-produced polarization by large irregular grains with a range of
$x$ greater than unity with optical properties obtained from laboratory
experiments. Using the radiation transfer code, RADMC-3D, we find that large
irregular grains still produce polarization parallel to the disk minor axis. If
the original forsterite refractive index in the optical is adopted, then all
samples can produce the typically observed level of polarization. Accounting
for the more commonly adopted refractive index using the DSHARP dust model,
only grains with $x$ of several (corresponding to $\sim$mm-sized grains) can
reach the same polarization level. Our results suggest that grains in disks can
have sizes in the millimeter regime, which may alleviate the tension between
the grain sizes inferred from scattering and other means. Additionally, if
large irregular grains are not settled to the midplane, their strong forward
scattering can produce asymmetries between the near and far side of an inclined
disk, which can be used to infer their presence.

the neural network, i.e. lowering the precision of the operands. By taking
quantization to the extreme, e.g. by using binary values, new opportunities
arise to increase the energy efficiency. Several hardware accelerators

design choices and their implications on the flexibility and energy efficiency

high on unseen domains encountered at test-time by using data from multiple
related source domains. Many existing DG algorithms reduce the divergence
between source distributions in a representation space to potentially align the
unseen domain close to the sources. This is motivated by the analysis that
explains generalization to unseen domains using distributional distance (such
as the Wasserstein distance) to the sources. However, due to the openness of
the DG objective, it is challenging to evaluate DG algorithms comprehensively
using a few benchmark datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy
of the models trained with DG methods varies significantly across unseen
domains, generated from popular benchmark datasets. This highlights that the
performance of DG methods on a few benchmark datasets may not be representative
of their performance on unseen domains in the wild. To overcome this roadblock,
we propose a universal certification framework based on distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) that can efficiently certify the worst-case performance of
any DG method. This enables a data-independent evaluation of a DG method
complementary to the empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
we propose a training algorithm that can be used with any DG method to provably
improve their certified performance. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method at significantly improving the worst-case loss
(i.e., reducing the risk of failure of these models in the wild) without
incurring a significant performance drop on benchmark datasets.

variety of models of ultralight bosons such as axions, new light scalars, and
dark photons. It is common lore to believe that superradiance bounds are
broadly model independent and therefore pretty robust. In this work we show
however that superradiance bounds on dark photons can be challenged by simple,
compelling extensions of the minimal model. In particular, if the dark photon
populates a larger dark sector and couples to dark fermions playing the role of
dark matter, then superradiance bounds can easily be circumvented, depending on
the mass and (dark) charge of the dark matter.

circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)

tracers of the innermost region of C-rich CSEs. Aims. We aim to constrain the
physical conditions of CSEs of C-rich stars using thermal lines of the HCN
molecule. Additionally, we also search for new HCN masers and probe the
temporal variations for HCN masers, which should shed light on their pumping
mechanisms. Methods. We observed 16 C-rich AGB stars in various HCN rotational
transitions within the ground and 12 vibrationally excited states with the APEX
12 m submillimeter telescope. Results. We detect 68 vibrationally excited HCN
lines from 13 C-rich stars, including 39 thermal transitions and 29 maser
lines, which suggests that vibrationally excited HCN lines are ubiquitous in
C-rich stars. Population diagrams constructed, for two objects from the sample,
for thermal transitions from different vibrationally excited states give
excitation temperature around 800-900 K, confirming that they arise from the
hot innermost regions of CSEs (i.e., r<20$R_{*}$). Among the detected masers,
23 are newly detected, and the results expand the total number of known HCN
masers lines toward C-rich stars by 47%. In particular, the J=2-1 (0, 3$^{1e}$,
0), J=3-2 (0, 2, 0), J=4-3 (0, 1$^{1f}$, 0) masers are detected in an
astronomical source for the first time. Our observations confirm temporal
variations of the 2-1 (0, 1$^{1e}$, 0) maser on a timescale of a few years. Our
analysis of the data suggests that all detected HCN masers are unsaturated. A
gas kinetic temperature of ${\gtrsim}$700K and an H$_{2}$ number density of
>10$^{8}$cm$^{-3}$ are required to excite the HCN masers. In some ways, HCN
masers in C-rich stars might be regarded as an analogy of SiO masers in O-rich
stars.

  (extended version)",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All data is not equally popular. Often, some portion of data is more
frequently accessed than the rest, which causes a skew in popularity of the
data items. Adapting to this skew can improve performance, and this topic has
been studied extensively in the past for disk-based settings. In this work, we
consider an in-memory data structure, namely hash table, and show how one can
leverage the skew in popularity for higher performance. Hashing is a
low-latency operation, sensitive to the effects of caching, branch prediction,
and code complexity among other factors. These factors make learning
in-the-loop especially challenging as the overhead of performing any additional
operations can be significant. In this paper, we propose VIP hashing, a fully
online hash table method, that uses lightweight mechanisms for learning the
skew in popularity and adapting the hash table layout. These mechanisms are
non-blocking, and their overhead is controlled by sensing changes in the
popularity distribution to dynamically switch-on/off the learning mechanism as
needed. We tested VIP hashing against a variety of workloads generated by
Wiscer, a homegrown hashing measurement tool, and find that it improves
performance in the presence of skew (22% increase in fetch operation throughput
for a hash table with one million keys under low skew, 77% increase under
medium skew) while being robust to insert and delete operations, and changing
popularity distribution of keys. We find that VIP hashing reduces the
end-to-end execution time of TPC-H query 9, which is the most expensive TPC-H
query, by 20% under medium skew.

with the improvement in performance, security and robustness of ViTs are also

robustness of ViTs against adversarial examples, this paper investigates a
representative causative attack, i.e., backdoor. We first examine the
vulnerability of ViTs against various backdoor attacks and find that ViTs are
also quite vulnerable to existing attacks. However, we observe that the
clean-data accuracy and backdoor attack success rate of ViTs respond
distinctively to patch transformations before the positional encoding. Then,
based on this finding, we propose an effective method for ViTs to defend both
patch-based and blending-based trigger backdoor attacks via patch processing.
The performances are evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet, which show the proposed novel defense is very
successful in mitigating backdoor attacks for ViTs. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper presents the first defensive strategy that utilizes a

velocity of tropical cyclones from environmental parameters assuming thermal
wind (gradient-wind and hydrostatic balances) and slantwise neutrality in the
free troposphere. E-PI's key equation relates proportionally the radial
gradients of saturated moist entropy and angular momentum. Here the E-PI
derivation is reconsidered to show that the thermal wind and slantwise
neutrality imply zero radial gradients of saturation entropy and angular
momentum at an altitude where, for a given radius, the tangential wind has a
maximum. It is further shown that, while E-PI's key equation requires that, at
the point of maximum tangential wind, the air temperature must increase towards
the storm center, the thermal wind equation dictates the opposite. From the
analysis of the equations of motion at the altitude of maximum tangential wind
in the free troposphere, it is concluded that here the air flow must be
supergradient. This implies that the supergradiency factor (a measure of the
gradient-wind imbalance) must change in the free troposphere as the air flow
tends to restore the balance. It is shown that such a change modifies the
derivative of saturation entropy over angular momentum, which cannot therefore
remain constant in the free troposphere as E-PI requires. The implications of
these findings for the internal coherence of E-PI, including its boundary layer
closure, are discussed.

dependence of magnetic susceptibility without introducing the martensitic phase
transition. Our results for local spin-spin correlation function and local
susceptibility reveal that the Curie-Weiss behavior appears due to partial
formation of local magnetic moments, which originate from $t_{2g}$ states and
occur due to local spin correlations caused by Hund's rule coupling. At the
same time, the fermionic quasiparticles remain well-defined, while the
formation of local moments is accompanied by a deviation from the Fermi-liquid
behavior. In particular, the self-energy of the $t_{2g}$ states shows the
non-analytic frequency dependence, which is a characteristic of the
spin-freezing behavior, while the quasiparticle damping changes approximately
linearly with temperature in the intermediate temperature range $200$--$700$~K.
By analyzing the momentum dependence of static magnetic susceptibility, we find
incommensurate magnetic correlations, which may provide a mechanism for
unconventional superconductivity at low temperatures.

  Features",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training models that are robust to data domain shift has gained an increasing
interest both in academia and industry. Question-Answering language models,
being one of the typical problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research,
has received much success with the advent of large transformer models. However,
existing approaches mostly work under the assumption that data is drawn from
same distribution during training and testing which is unrealistic and
non-scalable in the wild.
  In this paper, we explore adversarial training approach towards learning
domain-invariant features so that language models can generalize well to
out-of-domain datasets. We also inspect various other ways to boost our model
performance including data augmentation by paraphrasing sentences, conditioning
end of answer span prediction on the start word, and carefully designed
annealing function. Our initial results show that in combination with these
methods, we are able to achieve $15.2\%$ improvement in EM score and $5.6\%$
boost in F1 score on out-of-domain validation dataset over the baseline. We
also dissect our model outputs and visualize the model hidden-states by
projecting them onto a lower-dimensional space, and discover that our specific
adversarial training approach indeed encourages the model to learn domain
invariant embedding and bring them closer in the multi-dimensional space.

numerical energy or pseudo-energy have seen extensive investigation. Most
available methods either require the iterative solution of nonlinear algebraic
equations at each time step, or are explicit, but where the exact conservation
property depends on the exact evaluation of an integral in continuous time.
Under further restrictions, namely that the potential energy contribution to
the Hamiltonian is non-negative, newer techniques based on invariant energy
quadratisation allow for exact numerical energy conservation and yield linearly
implicit updates, requiring only the solution of a linear system at each time
step. In this article, it is shown that, for a general class of Hamiltonian
systems, and under the non-negativity condition on potential energy, it is
possible to arrive at a fully explicit method that exactly conserves numerical
energy. Furthermore, such methods are unconditionally stable, and are of
comparable computational cost to the very simplest integration methods (such as
Stormer-Verlet). A variant of this scheme leading to a conditionally-stable
method is also presented, and follows from a splitting of the potential energy.
Various numerical results are presented, in the case of the classic test
problem of Fermi, Pasta and Ulam, as well as for nonlinear systems of partial
differential equations, including those describing high amplitude vibration of

relevance as federated learning typically uses the FedAvg algorithm. Compared
to FedSGD, recovering data from FedAvg updates is much harder as: (i) the
updates are computed at unobserved intermediate network weights, (ii) a large
number of batches are used, and (iii) labels and network weights vary
simultaneously across client steps. In this work, we propose a new
optimization-based attack which successfully attacks FedAvg by addressing the
above challenges. First, we solve the optimization problem using automatic
differentiation that forces a simulation of the client's update that generates
the unobserved parameters for the recovered labels and inputs to match the
received client update. Second, we address the large number of batches by
relating images from different epochs with a permutation invariant prior.
Third, we recover the labels by estimating the parameters of existing FedSGD
attacks at every FedAvg step. On the popular FEMNIST dataset, we demonstrate
that on average we successfully recover >45% of the client's images from
realistic FedAvg updates computed on 10 local epochs of 10 batches each with 5
images, compared to only <10% using the baseline. Our findings show many
real-world federated learning implementations based on FedAvg are vulnerable.

resulting stylization must preserve both the global semantics of the object and
its fine-grained details, and (3) it must adhere to the user-specified text

the second target text prompt describes the local semantics. To modify the

After training, SemanticNav agents can be instructed to find objects described

contraction into a simple semi-analytic procedure for computing the density
profile of self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) haloes with the gravitational
influence from the inhabitant galaxies. We show that the model agrees well with
cosmological SIDM simulations over the entire core-forming stage and up to the
onset of gravothermal core-collapse. Using this model, we show that the halo
response to baryons is more diverse in SIDM than in CDM and depends sensitively
on galaxy size, a desirable link in the context of the structural diversity of
bright dwarf galaxies. The fast speed of the method facilitates analyses that
would be challenging for numerical simulations -- notably, 1) we quantify the
SIDM halo response as functions of the baryonic properties, on a fine mesh grid
spanned by the baryon-to-total-mass ratio, $M_{\rm b}/M_{\rm vir}$, and galaxy
compactness, $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir}$; 2) we show with high statistical precision
that for typical Milky-Way-like systems, the SIDM profiles are similar to their
CDM counterparts; and 3) we delineate the regime of gravothermal core-collapse
in the $M_{\rm b}/M_{\rm vir}$-$r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir}$ space, for a given cross
section and a given halo concentration. Finally, we compare the isothermal
Jeans model with the more sophisticated gravothermal fluid model, and show that
the former yields faster core formation and agrees better with cosmological
simulations. We attribute the difference to whether the target CDM halo is used
as a boundary condition or as the initial condition for the gravothermal
evolution, and thus comment on possible future improvements of the fluid model.

show how the production of both longitudinal mode and transverse mode dark

formation, the energy stored in the dark photon dark matter will be transformed
into a large number of vortex strings, eradicating the coherent dark photon
dark matter field. In the case where a dark photon magnetic field is produced,
bundles of vortex strings are formed in a superheated phase transition, and
evolve towards a configuration consisting of many string loops that are
uncorrelated on large scales, analogous to a melting phase transition in
condensed matter. In the process, they dissipate via dark photon and
gravitational wave emission, offering a target for experimental searches.
Vortex strings were also recently shown to form in dark photon superradiance
clouds around black holes, and we discuss the dynamics and observational
consequences of this phenomenon with phenomenologically motivated parameters.
In that case, the string loops ejected from the superradiance cloud, apart from
producing gravitational waves, are also quantised magnetic flux lines and can
be looked for with magnetometers. We discuss the connection between the

approaches to capture the effects of quantum geometry in the primordial power
spectrum in loop quantum cosmology. Both consider Fock quantized perturbations
over a loop quantized background and result in very similar predictions except
for the modes which exit the horizon in the effective spacetime in the Planck
regime. Understanding precise relationship between both approaches has so far
remained obscured due to differences in construction and technical assumptions.
We explore this issue at the classical and effective spacetime level for linear
perturbations, ignoring backreaction, which is the level at which practical
computations of the power spectrum in both of the approaches have so far been
performed. We first show that at the classical level both the approaches lead
to the same Hamiltonian up to the second order in perturbations and result in
the same classical mass functions in the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation on the
physical solutions. At the effective spacetime level, the difference in
phenomenological predictions between the two approaches in the Planck regime
can be traced to whether one uses the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable $Q_{\vec k}$
(the dressed metric approach) or its rescaled version $\nu_{\vec k}=aQ_{\vec
k}$ (the hybrid approach) to write the Hamiltonian of the perturbations, and
associated polymerization ambiguities. It turns out that if in the dressed
metric approach one chooses to work with $\nu_{\vec{k}}$, the effective mass
function can be written exactly as in the hybrid approach, thus leading to
identical phenomenological predictions in all regimes. Our results explicitly
show that the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches for linear
perturbations, at a practical computational level, can be seen as two sides of
the same coin.

generated trajectories as a latent vector, and also allows for the generation
of trajectories via sampling from latent space. In this manner, Bayesian
Optimization of the process is realized in the latent space of the system,
reducing the problem to a low-dimensional one. Here we apply this approach to a

Here, we advance the constraints on the nature and origin of SN~2018aoz based
on its evolution until the nebular phase. Near-peak spectroscopic features show
the SN is intermediate between two subtypes of normal Type Ia: Core-Normal and
Broad-Line. The excess emission could have contributions from the radioactive
decay of surface iron-peak elements as well as ejecta interaction with either
the binary companion or a small torus of circumstellar material. Nebular-phase
limits on H$\alpha$ and He~I favour a white dwarf companion, consistent with
the small companion size constrained by the low early SN luminosity, while the
absence of [O~I] and He~I disfavours a violent merger of the progenitor. Of the
two main explosion mechanisms proposed to explain the distribution of surface
iron-peak elements in SN~2018aoz, the asymmetric Chandrasekhar-mass explosion
is less consistent with the progenitor constraints and the observed blueshifts
of nebular-phase [Fe~II] and [Ni~II]. The helium-shell double-detonation
explosion is compatible with the observed lack of C spectral features, but
current 1-D models are incompatible with the infant-phase excess emission,
$B_{\rm max}-V_{\rm max}$ color, and absence of nebular-phase [Ca~II]. Although
the explosion processes of SN~2018aoz still need to be more precisely

grid. Like any other Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), PMUs are prone to
various types of cyberattacks. However, one form of attack is unique to the
PMU, the GPS-spoofing attack, where the time and /or the one second pulse that
enables time synchronization are modified and the measurements are computed
using the modified time reference. This article exploits the vulnerability of
PMUs in their GPS time synchronization signal. At first, the paper proposes an
undetectable attack scheme which is able to bypass Bad Data Detection (BDD)
algorithms used with PMU data. The attack is applied by solving a convex
optimization criterion at regular time interval, so that after a specific time
period the attack vector incurs a significant change in the angle information
delivered by the PMU. Secondly, the impact of phase angle shift on the power
flow calculation between two adjacent nodes of the transmission line is
analyzed with numerical experiment using IEEE 39 bus system. Moreover, the
undetectibilities of the proposed attack scheme against conventional $\chi^2$,
Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Kalman Filtering test on the estimation
residuals are investigated. Finally, the power flow results with the proposed
attack are compared with the results using a random GPS-spoofing attack. It can
be observed that using the proposed method enables the attacker with more
control over the impact against power grid than it is for the random attack.
Furthermore, the proposed attack model has demonstrated a very small
probability of detection against each of the common detection methods. For WLS

single task setting, where an agent learns to solve a task through
trial-and-error experience, given access to data only from that task. However,
many recent empirical works have demonstrated the significant practical
benefits of leveraging a joint representation trained across multiple, related
tasks. In this work we theoretically analyze such a setting, formalizing the
concept of task relatedness as a shared state-action representation that admits
linear dynamics in all the tasks. We introduce the Shared-MatrixRL algorithm
for the setting of Multitask MatrixRL. In the presence of $P$ episodic tasks of
dimension $d$ sharing a joint $r \ll d$ low-dimensional representation, we show
the regret on the the $P$ tasks can be improved from $O(PHd\sqrt{NH})$ to
$O((Hd\sqrt{rP} + HP\sqrt{rd})\sqrt{NH})$ over $N$ episodes of horizon $H$.
These gains coincide with those observed in other linear models in contextual
bandits and RL. In contrast with previous work that have studied multi task RL
in other function approximation models, we show that in the presence of
bilinear optimization oracle and finite state action spaces there exists a
computationally efficient algorithm for multitask MatrixRL via a reduction to
quadratic programming. We also develop a simple technique to shave off a
$\sqrt{H}$ factor from the regret upper bounds of some episodic linear
problems.

field of research for many years. This paper presents a novel data-driven
optimal adaptive control structure with less control effort and faster
adaptation than standard adaptive control counterparts. The proposed control
structure utilizes the system's recorded data to increase the speed of
adaptation and performance dramatically. In this study, we employ a conditional
generative adversarial net (CGAN) as a novel central pattern generator to
reproduce the steady-state harmonic pattern of the control signals matching the
system's uncertainties over a wide range. We can also use the CGAN architecture
as a fault detector. The CGAN provides a low-dimensional latent space of
uncertainties. It enables rapid and convenient adaptation when there are many
parametric uncertainties, especially for large-scale systems. Then, we
introduce a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework to adapt the latent
space of CGAN to the system's uncertainties as an optimal direct adaptive
controller without any system identifier. Another part of the control structure
is a regulator that achieves semi-global asymptotic tracking using the Lyapunov
stability analysis. Finally, via some simulations, we evaluate the capabilities

of a heterogeneous metamaterial slab based on multi-point measurements in
surrounding media. In this technique, two measurements are made in the ambient
media on each side of a finite thickness micro-structured slab to decompose
incoming and outgoing waves. The method is applied to an example with locally
resonant micro-structured inclusions while paying close attention to parameters
that influence the extracted material parameters. It is observed that the
extracted overall parameters converge to limiting values when the number of
unit cells across the slab thickness or ambient media modulus are increased.
Dependence of extracted material parameters on the number of cells through
thickness or ambient media properties are attributed to the different response
of boundary (skin) and interior cells. A method is presented which represents a
finite array with different effective properties for the skin regions vs. the
interior regions with great success in reproducing the scattering for different
slab thicknesses, and through which the interior regions properties become
independent of ambient media properties. In stop bands with lower material
loss, challenges arise that are associated with extremely small transmission.
The assumption of continuity in transmission phase is enforceable to remove
phase ambiguity, although in certain cases (associated with nearly lossless
specimens) this assumption appears to fail. In such cases, interference from
coupled shear modes may lead to apparent higher longitudinal transmission
within the stop band. This work provides a proof of concept for the development
of an experimental methodology capable of extracting the effective properties
and dispersion behavior of heterogeneous mechanical metamaterials without any
knowledge of the internal fields.

pseudo-synchronous rotation signal of binary A in TESS photometry. We detect
apsidal motion in binary A with a period of about 33 years, which is fully
explained by tidal and rotational contributions of stars aligned with the
orbit. The mutual orbit has a period of about 1450 days and eccentricity of
about 0.7. The LTTE amplitude is small, which points to low inclination of the
outer orbit and a high degree of misalignment with the inner orbits. We find
that when apsidal motion and mutual orbit are taken into account the orbital
period resonance is exact to within $10^{-5}$ cycles/day. Many properties of
CzeV343 are not compatible with requirements of the 3:2 resonance capture
theory for coplanar orbits. Future evolution of CzeV343 can lead to mergers,

follows a long-tail distribution, i.e., a few classes have a large number of
instances, while a lot of species have just a small percentage. Although in
most cases these rare species are the ones of interest to ecologists, they are
often neglected when using deep-learning models because these models require a
large number of images for the training. In this work, a simple and effective
framework called Square-Root Sampling Branch (SSB) is proposed, which combines
two classification branches that are trained using square-root sampling and
instance sampling to improve long-tail visual recognition, and this is compared
to state-of-the-art methods for handling this task: square-root sampling,
class-balanced focal loss, and balanced group softmax. To achieve a more
general conclusion, the methods for handling long-tail visual recognition were
systematically evaluated in four families of computer vision models (ResNet,
MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, and Swin Transformer) and four camera-trap
datasets with different characteristics. Initially, a robust baseline with the
most recent training tricks was prepared and, then, the methods for improving
long-tail recognition were applied. Our experiments show that square-root
sampling was the method that most improved the performance for minority classes
by around 15%; however, this was at the cost of reducing the majority classes'
accuracy by at least 3%. Our proposed framework (SSB) demonstrated itself to be
competitive with the other methods and achieved the best or the second-best
results for most of the cases for the tail classes; but, unlike the square-root
sampling, the loss in the performance of the head classes was minimal, thus
achieving the best trade-off among all the evaluated methods.

the magnetic scattering merely shifts the maximum of ${\cal R}\left(T\right)$

magnetic scattering has a milder impact on ${\cal R}$ than the non-magnetic
scattering. The surface superconductivity is quite robust; in fact, the ratio
${\cal R}\approx 1.7$ even in the gapless state. We used Eilenberger's energy

the pair-breaking pushes materials toward type-I behavior. We find a peculiar

tasks. Variational optical flow techniques based on a coarse-to-fine scheme
interpolate sparse matches and locally optimize an energy model conditioned on

addresses this problem and presents HybridFlow, a variational motion estimation
framework for large displacements and deformations. A multi-scale hybrid
matching approach is performed on the image pairs. Coarse-scale clusters formed
by classifying pixels according to their feature descriptors are matched using
the clusters' context descriptors. We apply a multi-scale graph matching on the
finer-scale superpixels contained within each matched pair of coarse-scale
clusters. Small clusters that cannot be further subdivided are matched using
localized feature matching. Together, these initial matches form the flow,
which is propagated by an edge-preserving interpolation and variational
refinement. Our approach does not require training and is robust to substantial
displacements and rigid and non-rigid transformations due to motion in the
scene, making it ideal for large-scale imagery such as Wide-Area Motion Imagery

filaments with homogeneous structural properties. Filament backbone stiffness
can be non-uniform in many biological systems like microtubules, where the
association and disassociation of proteins can lead to spatial and temporal
changes into structure. The consequences of such non-uniformities in the
configurational stability and transport of these fibers are yet unknown. Here,
we use slender-body theory and Euler-Bernoulli elasticity coupled with various
non-uniform bending rigidity profiles to quantify this buckling instability
using linear stability analysis and Brownian simulations. In shear flows, we
observe more pronounced buckling in areas of reduced rigidity in our
simulations. These areas of marked deformations give rise to differences in the
particle extra stress, indicating a nontrivial rheological response due to the
presence of these filaments. The fundamental mode shapes arising from each
rigidity profile are consistent with the predictions from our linear stability
analysis. Collectively, these results suggest that non-uniform bending rigidity
can drastically alter fluid-structure interactions in physiologically relevant
settings, providing a foundation to elucidate the complex interplay between

AV's obstacle detection module can reliably detect obstacles that pose a safety
threat (i.e., are safety-critical). It is therefore desirable that the
evaluation metric for the perception system captures the safety-criticality of
objects. Unfortunately, existing perception evaluation metrics tend to make
strong assumptions about the objects and ignore the dynamic interactions
between agents, and thus do not accurately capture the safety risks in reality.
To address these shortcomings, we introduce an interaction-dynamics-aware
obstacle detection evaluation metric by accounting for closed-loop dynamic
interactions between an ego vehicle and obstacles in the scene. By borrowing
existing theory from optimal control theory, namely Hamilton-Jacobi
reachability, we present a computationally tractable method for constructing a
``safety zone'': a region in state space that defines where safety-critical
obstacles lie for the purpose of defining safety metrics. Our proposed safety
zone is mathematically complete, and can be easily computed to reflect a
variety of safety requirements. Using an off-the-shelf detection algorithm from
the nuScenes detection challenge leaderboard, we demonstrate that our approach
is computationally lightweight, and can better capture safety-critical
perception errors than a baseline approach.

two parts: a filter and a controller. Firstly, an adaptive NN-based stochastic
filter is proposed that estimates attitude components and dynamics using
measurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts
for measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely unknown
bias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed loop
signals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Secondly, a novel control
law on $SO(3)$ coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control
law addresses unknown disturbances. In addition, the closed loop signals of the
proposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB. The proposed
approach offers robust tracking performance by supplying the required control
signal given data extracted from low-cost inertial measurement units. While the
filter-based controller is presented in continuous form, the discrete
implementation is also presented. Additionally, the unit-quaternion form of the
proposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed

application of this general comparison procedure, we provide a sharp estimate
of the MLSI constant of the switch chain on the the set of simple bipartite

the total variation mixing time of the switch chain is of order $O_d(n\log n)$.

  Subjective Cognitive Decline with Structural MRI","10 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) which occurs even before mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to
AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging
techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early
intervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods
usually suffer the small-sample-size problem which poses a great challenge to
related neuroimaging analysis. The central question we aim to tackle in this
paper is how to leverage related domains (e.g., AD/NC) to assist the
progression prediction of SCD. Meanwhile, we are concerned about which brain
areas are more closely linked to the identification of progressive SCD. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided autoencoder model for efficient
cross-domain adaptation which facilitates the knowledge transfer from AD to
SCD. The proposed model is composed of four key components: 1) a feature
encoding module for learning shared subspace representations of different
domains, 2) an attention module for automatically locating discriminative brain
regions of interest defined in brain atlases, 3) a decoding module for
reconstructing the original input, 4) a classification module for
identification of brain diseases. Through joint training of these four modules,
domain invariant features can be learned. Meanwhile, the brain disease related
regions can be highlighted by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on
the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model is
straightforward to train and test with only 5-10 seconds on CPUs and is
suitable for medical tasks with small datasets.

predictions, but at the same time they are also becoming more complicated and
less transparent. As a result, explainers are often relied on to provide
interpretability to these black-box prediction models. As crucial diagnostics
tools, it is important that these explainers themselves are reliable. In this
paper we focus on one particular aspect of reliability, namely that an
explainer should give similar explanations for similar data inputs. We
formalize this notion by introducing and defining explainer astuteness,
analogous to astuteness of classifiers. Our formalism is inspired by the
concept of probabilistic Lipschitzness, which captures the probability of local
smoothness of a function. For a variety of explainers (e.g., SHAP, RISE,
CXPlain), we provide lower bound guarantees on the astuteness of these
explainers given the Lipschitzness of the prediction function. These
theoretical results imply that locally smooth prediction functions lend
themselves to locally robust explanations. We evaluate these results
empirically on simulated as well as real datasets.

correlations between a set of traits observed in a sample of related organisms.
By directly modeling the evolution of the traits along an estimable
phylogenetic tree, the model's structure effectively controls for shared
evolutionary history. In these models, relevant correlations are usually
assessed through the high posterior density interval of their marginal
distributions. However, the selected correlations alone may not provide the
full picture regarding trait relationships. Their association structure,
expressed through a graph that encodes partial correlations, can in contrast
highlight sparsity patterns featuring direct associations between traits. In
order to develop a model-based method to identify this association structure we
explore the use of Gaussian graphical models (GGM) for covariance selection. We
model the precision matrix with a G-Wishart conjugate prior, which results in
sparse precision estimates. Furthermore the model naturally allows for Bayes
Factor tests of association between the traits, with no additional computation
required. We evaluate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations and
applications that examine the association structure and evolutionary
correlations of phenotypic traits in Darwin's finches and genomic and
phenotypic traits in prokaryotes. Our approach provides accurate graph
estimates and lower errors for the precision and correlation parameter
estimates, particularly for conditionally independent traits, which are the

the effect of the utilized CNN architecture, we tested our model with five

precision measurements. A principal method of generating entanglement for use
in atom interferometry is the process of spin squeezing whereupon the states
become more sensitive to $SU(2)$ rotations. One possibility to generate this
entanglement is provided by one-axis twisting (OAT), where a many-particle
entangled state of one degree of freedom is generated by a non-linear
Hamiltonian. We introduce a novel method which goes beyond OAT to create
squeezing and entanglement across two distinct degrees of freedom. We present
our work in the specific physical context of a system consisting of collective
atomic energy levels and discrete collective momentum states, but also consider
other possible realizations. Our system uses a nonlinear Hamiltonian to
generate dynamics in $SU(4)$, thereby creating the opportunity for dynamics not
possible in typical $SU(2)$ one-axis twisting. This leads to three axes
undergoing twisting due to the two degrees of freedom and their entanglement,
with the resulting potential for a more rich context of quantum entanglement.
The states prepared in this system are potentially more versatile for use in
multi-parameter or auxiliary measurement schemes than those prepared by
standard spin squeezing.

the potential to significantly improve system performance over a wide spectrum

the programmer: only 8-byte write atomicity, out of order flush and
availability limited by node failure. It's possible to work with the atomicity
and ordering constraints of PMEM directly by carefully sequencing the order of
store operations and inserting explicit flush and fence operations at each
ordering point. But this is tedious and error-prone: too many flush operations
defeat the performance benefits of PMEM, and even with generous use, it is
difficult to prove that a given program is crash-consistent. Logging is a great
abstraction to deal with these issues but prior work on PMEM logging has not
successfully hidden the idiosyncrasies of PMEM. Moreover, shortcomings in the
log interface and design have prevented attainment of full PMEM performance. We
believe that a log design that hides the idiosyncrasies from programmers while
delivering full performance is key to success. In this paper, we present the
design and implementation of Arcadia, a generic replicated log on PMEM to
address these problems. Arcadia handles atomicity, integrity, and replication
of log records to reduce programmer burden. Our design has several novel
aspects including concurrent log writes with in-order commit, atomicity and
integrity primitives for local and remote PMEM writes, and a frequency-based
log force policy for providing low overhead persistence with guaranteed bounded
loss of uncommitted records. Our evaluation shows that Arcadia outperforms

(AGN) has been proposed long time ago as a tool for measuring distances to the
monitored sources. However, the method faces serious problems as a number of
effects must be taken into account, including the contribution from the Broad
Line Region (BLR). Aims. In this paper, we model the expected time delays when
both the disk reprocessing of the incident X-ray flux and further reprocessing
by the BLR are included, with the aim to see if the two effects can be
disentangled. Methods. We use simple response function for the accretion disk,
without relativistic effects, and we use a parametric description to account
for the BLR contribution. We include only scattering of the disk emission by
the BLR inter-cloud medium. We also use artificial lightcurves with 1-day
sampling to check if the effects are likely to be seen in real data. Results.
We show that the effect of the BLR scattering on the predicted time delay is
very similar to the effect of rising height of the X-ray source, without any
BLR contribution. This brings additional degeneracy if we want in the future to
recover the parameters of the system from the observed time delays in a
specific object. Both effects, however, modify the slope of the delay versus
wavelength curve when plotted in log space which opens a way to obtaining bare
disk time delay needed for cosmology. In addition, when the disk irradiation is
strong, the modification of the predicted delay by the BLR scattering and by
X-ray source height become considerably different. However, the required data
quality must be high since our artificial curves with 1-day sampling give
rather noisy results.

hypergraphs can be built from the winding orders of the keypoints (in 2D) or
their convex hulls (in 3D), and many outliers can be filtered out via maximum
hyperclique computation. The last contribution is an extensive experimental

prohibitions, but any of its extensions, in an allowable way, results in a
prohibition being introduced.
  In this paper, we introduce five natural types of crucial permutations with
respect to monotone patterns, notably quadrocrucial permutations that are
linked most closely to Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres extremal permutations. The way we
define right-crucial and bicrucial permutations is consistent with the
definition of respective permutations studied in the literature in the contexts
of other prohibitions. For each of the five types, we provide its
characterization in terms of Young tableaux via the RSK correspondence.
Moreover, we use the characterizations to prove that the number of such
permutations of length $n$ is growing when $n\to\infty$, and to enumerate
minimal crucial permutations in all but one case. We also provide other
enumerative results.

J234628+124859. The group consists of four star-forming galaxies within 8-28
kpc and $v\sim40-340$ km s$^{-1}$ of each other, where tidal streams are weakly
visible in deep HST imaging. The group geometric centre is D=25 kpc from the
quasar (D=20-40 kpc for each galaxy). Galaxy G1 dominates the group
($1.66L_{\ast}$, ${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=11.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) while G2,
G3, and G4 are less massive ($0.1-0.3L_{\ast}$, ${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=1.4-2.0$

series and metal lines such as MgII, SiIII, and CIV, we characterised the
kinematic structure and physical conditions along the line-of-sight with
cloud-by-cloud multiphase Bayesian modelling. The absorption system has a total
$\log(N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})=20.53$ and an $N(HI)$-weighted mean metallicity of
$\log(Z/Z_{\odot})=-0.68$, with a very large MgII linewidth of $\Delta
v\sim700$ km s$^{-1}$. The highly kinematically complex profile is
well-modelled with 30 clouds across low and intermediate ionisation phases with
values ${13\lesssim\log(N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})\lesssim20}$ and
$-3\lesssim\log(Z/Z_{\odot})\lesssim1$. Comparing these properties to the
galaxy properties, we infer a wide range of gaseous environments, including
metal-rich outflows, metal-poor IGM accretion, and tidal streams from
galaxy--galaxy interactions. This diversity of structures forms the intragroup
medium around a complex compact group environment at the epoch of peak star
formation activity. Surveys of low redshift compact groups would benefit from
obtaining a more complete census of this medium for characterising evolutionary

explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic

inference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle
the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing
the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two
versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the
number of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper,
we resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several
observations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we
allow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference
algorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition
mappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two
optimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of
the dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites

behaves differently in multiple wavebands, suggesting a complex nature of
emission in this source. This source has shown a range of variability time from
days scale to month scale during this long period of observations between

representations? In picture naming, we view specific exemplars of concepts and
then name them with a category label, like 'dog'. In contrast, in overt
reading, the written word expresses the category (dog), not an exemplar.
  Here we used a decoding approach with magnetoencephalography to address
whether picture naming and overt word reading involve shared representations of
semantic categories. This addresses a fundamental question about the
modality-generality of conceptual representations and their temporal evolution.
Crucially, we do this using a language production task that does not require
explicit categorization judgment and that controls for word form properties
across semantic categories. We trained our models to classify the animal/tool
distinction using MEG data of one modality at each time point and then tested
the generalization of those models on the other modality. We obtained evidence
for the automatic activation of modality-independent semantic category
representations for both pictures and words starting at ~150ms and lasting
until about 500ms. The time course of lexical activation was also assessed
revealing that semantic category is represented before lexical access for
pictures but after lexical access for words. Notably, this earlier activation
of semantic category in pictures occurred simultaneously with visual
representations.
  We thus show evidence for the spontaneous activation of modality-independent
semantic categories in picture naming and word reading, supporting theories in
which amodal conceptual representations exist. Together, these results serve to
anchor a more comprehensive spatio-temporal delineation of the semantic feature
space during production planning.

information-theory-based optimal experimental design (OED) approach that
minimizes the uncertainty in the rate parameter, $k_{PL}$, recovered from
HP-MRI measurements. Mutual information (MI) is employed to measure the
information content of the HP measurements with respect to the first-order
exchange kinetics of the pyruvate conversion to lactate. Flip angles of the
pulse sequence acquisition are optimized with respect to the mutual
information. Further, a spatially varying model (high-fidelity) based on the
Block-Torrey equations is proposed and utilized as a control. A time-varying
flip angle scheme leads to a higher parameter optimization that can further
improve the quantitative value of mutual information over a constant flip angle
scheme. However, the constant flip angle scheme leads to the best accuracy and
precision when considering inference from noise-corrupted data. For the
particular MRI data examined here, pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and
28 degrees, respectively, were the best choice in terms of accuracy and
precision of the parameter recovery. Moreover, the recovery of rate parameter
$k_{PL}$ from the data generated from the high-fidelity model highlights the
influence of diffusion and strength of vascular source on the recovered rate
parameter. Since the existing pharmacokinetic models for HP-MRI do not account
for spatial variation, the optimized design parameters may not be fully optimal
in a more general 3D setting.

incomplete ablation. Computer-assisted intervention (CAI) can provide surgeons
with decision support and context awareness by identifying key structures in

Research in this domain has been hampered by the lack of high-quality data to

rotation are almost independent of the EOS. The EOS independence leads to the
idea of neutron star universality. In this paper, we compute sequences of

mass and radius and are almost independent of the EOS. This makes it
computationally inexpensive to include observations of rotating neutron stars
in EOS inference codes. We also construct a mapping from the measured mass and
radius of a rotating neutron star to a corresponding non-rotating star. The
mapping makes it possible to construct a zero-spin mass-radius curve if the
masses and radii of many neutron stars with different spins are measured.
  We show that the changes in polar and equatorial radii are symmetric, in that
the polar radius shrinks at the same rate that the equatorial radius grows.
This symmetry is related to the observation that the equatorial compactness
(the ratio of mass to radius) is almost constant on one of the constant-density
sequences.

the $d$ and $u$ quark transverse density profiles are similar. Some of these

it is infinite dimensional, has a similar structure, in which the Casimir is

quantizing the canonicalized system. The inverse of the reduction, i.e.,

valence parton distributions that should exist once partonic degrees of freedom
are relevant for high energy scattering from strongly interacting bound systems
like a nucleon, meson or a few nucleon system at very short distances. Our
observation is based on the notion that the Bjorken x weighted valence parton
distribution function has a peak, $x_p$, that characterizes the average
momentum fraction carried out by the valence quarks in the system. Within the
residual mean-field model of the valence quark distribution we found that $x_p$
has an upper limit: $x_p \leq {1\over 2(n_V-1)}$, where $n_V$ is the number of
valence quarks which can be considered in the cluster embedded in the strongly
interacting environment of the bound system. The existence of such a limit
imposes a new constraint on choosing the starting resolution scale $Q_0$ for
PDFs. Our prediction for the nucleon is that $x_p\mid_{Q\to Q_0}\le{1\over 4}$,
which is in agreement with all the available valence PDFs that employ the
standard approach for selecting starting $Q_0$. We also demonstrate how the
existence of this limit can be used to check the onset of quark-clusters in
short range nucleon correlations in nuclei.

more general and advanced theory around causal inference for longitudinal data
when confounders and treatments are measured continuously across time is
needed. We develop a framework to identify causal effects under a
user-specified treatment regime for continuous-time longitudinal studies. We
provide sufficient identification assumptions including generalized consistency
assumption, sequential randomization assumption, positivity assumption, and a
novel ``achievable'' assumption designed for continuous time. Under these
assumptions, we propose a g-computation process and an inverse probability
weighting process, which suggest a g-computation formula and an inverse

also construct two classes of population estimating equations to identify these
two processes, respectively, which further suggest a doubly robust formula that
identifies causal effects under the user-specified treatment regime with extra
robustness against process misspecification.

effects accurately. We formalize a new assumption -- the rank preservation
assumption (RPA) -- that defines when data are suitable to learn how to rank
individuals according to their causal effects, even if the effects themselves
cannot be accurately estimated. The RPA holds when there is data to estimate a
scoring variable that induces the same ranking of individuals as the causal
effect of interest. Some of the scoring variables we consider are confounded
estimates, proxy causal effects, and non-causal quantities. We show that such
scoring variables can work well for treatment assignment if the RPA is met, and
potentially even better than using causal effects as scores. We also show that
the RPA holds under conditions that are more general and weaker than the
typical assumptions made in observational studies. Finally, we showcase how
practitioners can apply and evaluate alternative scoring models (including
non-causal models) to maximize the causal impact of their targeting decisions.

  Question Answering",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In order to achieve a general visual question answering (VQA) system, it is
essential to learn to answer deeper questions that require compositional
reasoning on the image and external knowledge. Meanwhile, the reasoning process
should be explicit and explainable to understand the working mechanism of the
model. It is effortless for human but challenging for machines. In this paper,
we propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Module Network (HGNMN) that reasons over
multi-layer graphs with neural modules to address the above issues.
Specifically, we first encode the image by multi-layer graphs from the visual,
semantic and commonsense views since the clues that support the answer may
exist in different modalities. Our model consists of several well-designed
neural modules that perform specific functions over graphs, which can be used
to conduct multi-step reasoning within and between different graphs. Compared
to existing modular networks, we extend visual reasoning from one graph to more
graphs. We can explicitly trace the reasoning process according to module
weights and graph attentions. Experiments show that our model not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CRIC dataset but also obtains explicit and
explainable reasoning procedures.

supervised learning for image classification. In the case of human action
videos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of
variation, this gap remains significant. One of the key reasons for this is
that sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many
self-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively
to avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur
temporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of
motion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based
self-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key
contribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive
sampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This
enables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to
sample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video
retrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when
directly transferred to HMDB51. With end-to-end finetuning for action
classification, SLIC achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy (+0.8%) on UCF101 and 54.5%
on HMDB51 (+1.6%). SLIC is also competitive with the state-of-the-art in action
classification after self-supervised pretraining on Kinetics400.

optimal for estimating state value and solving the decision problem. To address
this issue, we propose a novel method, called value-consistent representation
learning (VCR), to learn representations that are directly related to
decision-making. More specifically, VCR trains a model to predict the future
state (also referred to as the ''imagined state'') based on the current one and
a sequence of actions. Instead of aligning this imagined state with a real
state returned by the environment, VCR applies a $Q$-value head on both states
and obtains two distributions of action values. Then a distance is computed and
minimized to force the imagined state to produce a similar action value
prediction as that by the real state. We develop two implementations of the
above idea for the discrete and continuous action spaces respectively. We
conduct experiments on Atari 100K and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks to
validate their effectiveness for improving sample efficiency. It has been
demonstrated that our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performance for

gravitational potential, the LT metric is an essentially curved metric, and
thus reveals the anomalous LV matter-gravity couplings as a manifestation of
the so-called gravito-magnetic effects, which go beyond the conventional
equivalence principle predictions. By collecting all the spin-dependent
operators from the OMEGI with some reasonable assumptions, we get a LV
non-relativistic Hamiltonian, from which we derive the anomalous spin
precession and gravitational acceleration due to LV. Combined these results

for efficient and robust linear system solvers is greater than ever. The
randomized Kaczmarz method (RK) and similar stochastic iterative methods have
received considerable recent attention due to their efficient implementation
and memory footprint. These methods can tolerate streaming data, accessing only
part of the data at a time, and can also approximate the least squares solution
even if the system is affected by noise. However, when data is instead affected
by large (possibly adversarial) corruptions, these methods fail to converge, as
corrupted data points draw iterates far from the true solution. A recently
proposed solution to this is the QuantileRK method, which avoids harmful
corrupted data by exploring the space carefully as the method iterates. The
exploration component requires the computation of quantiles of large samples
from the system and is computationally much heavier than the subsequent
iteration update.
  In this paper, we propose an approach that better uses the information
obtained during exploration by incorporating an averaged version of the block
Kaczmarz method. This significantly speeds up convergence, while still allowing
for a constant fraction of the equations to be arbitrarily corrupted. We
provide theoretical convergence guarantees as well as experimental supporting
evidence. We also demonstrate that the classical projection-based block
Kaczmarz method cannot be robust to sparse adversarial corruptions, but rather
the blocking has to be carried out by averaging one-dimensional projections.

backreaction on the correlation between two subsystems forming the thermofield
double (TFD) state. Each of these subsystems is described as a strongly coupled
large-$N_c$ thermal field theory, and the backreaction imparted to it is
sourced by the presence of a uniform distribution of heavy static quarks. The
TFD state we consider here holographically corresponds to an entangled state of
two AdS blackholes, each of which is deformed by a uniform distribution of
static strings. In order to make a holographic estimation of correlation
between two entangled boundary field theories in presence of backreaction we
compute the holographic mutual information in the backreacted eternal
blackhole. The late time exponential growth of an early perturbation is a
signature of chaos in the boundary thermal field theory. Using the shock wave
analysis in the dual bulk theory, we characterize this chaotic behavior by
computing the holographic butterfly velocity. We find that there is a reduction
in the butterfly velocity due to a correction term that depends on the
backreaction parameter. The late time exponential growth of an early
perturbation destroys the two-sided correlation, whereas the backreaction
always acts in favour of it. Finally we compute the entanglement velocity that
essentially encodes the rate of disruption of correlation between two boundary
theories.

require a 30-second facial video and enormous computational resources to obtain
accurate and robust results, which significantly limits their applications in
real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose a lightweight pulse extraction network,
FastBVP-Net, to quickly measure heart rhythm via facial videos. The proposed
FastBVP-Net uses a multi-frequency mode signal fusion (MMSF) mechanism to
characterize the different modes of the raw signals in a decompose module and
reconstruct the blood volume pulse (BVP) signal under a complex noise
environment in a compose module. Meanwhile, an oversampling training scheme is
used to solve the over-fitting problem caused by the limitations of the
datasets. Then, the HR and HRV can be estimated based on the extracted BVP
signals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets to
validate the proposed FastBVP-Net. For intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing,
the proposed approach achieves better performance for HR and HRV estimation
from 30-second facial videos with fewer computational burdens than the current
well-established methods. Moreover, the proposed approach also achieves
competitive results from 15-second facial videos. Therefore, the proposed
FastBVP-Net has the potential to be applied in many real-world scenarios with
shorter videos.

usually estimated on mini-batches during training, which incurs large
variability/uncertainty due to mini-batch sampling and complicated training
dynamics. As a result, some crucial weights could be pruned by commonly used

the uncertainty of importance scores by upper confidence bound (UCB) of
importance estimation. In particular, for the weights with low importance
scores but high uncertainty, PLATON tends to retain them and explores their
capacity. We conduct extensive experiments with several Transformer-based

mechanical performance is of vital importance to realize their full
functionality. It has been evidenced that the elastic properties of polymer
films are often strongly affected by their thickness; however, the underlying
mechanism of this phenomenon, especially a thorough understanding at the

experimental verifications, aiming to reveal the conformational origin of the

controls over the polymer network structures, we found that the bi-axial
modulus changes are essentially consequent of the alteration of polymer
conformations. A unified theory was then proposed, to quantitatively clarify
the correlation between the elastic properties of the system and the
distributional variations of the chain end-to-end distances, with predicting a
significant hardening effect on top of the conventional entropic elasticity
with largely uncoiled chains. Adopting processing protocols inspired by the
modeling, our experiments showed that PDMS films at approximately the same
thickness may exhibit a two order of magnitude difference in their moduli. The
good agreement between experiments and simulations illustrated our findings as

considerable attention on account of $A_2$ conjecture solved by Hyt\""{o}nen.
Advances have greatly improved conceptual understanding of classical objects

into the class of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators and fail to be bounded on all
$L^p(w)$ spaces for $p \in (1, \infty)$ and $w \in A_p$. In this paper we
develop Rubio de Francia extrapolation with quantitative bounds to investigate
quantitative weighted inequalities for operators beyond the (multilinear)
Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. We mainly establish a quantitative multilinear
limited range extrapolation in terms of exponents $p_i \in (\mathfrak{p}_i^-,
\mathfrak{p}_i^+)$ and weights $w_i^{p_i} \in A_{p_i/\mathfrak{p}_i^-} \cap
RH_{(\mathfrak{p}_i^+/p_i)'}$, $i=1, \ldots, m$, which refines a result of
Cruz-Uribe and Martell. We also present an extrapolation from multilinear
operators to the corresponding commutators. Additionally, our result is
quantitative and allows us to extend special quantitative estimates in the
Banach space setting to the quasi-Banach space setting. Our proof is based on
an off-diagonal extrapolation result with quantitative bounds. Finally, we
present various applications to illustrate the utility of extrapolation by
concentrating on quantitative weighted estimates for some typical multilinear
operators such as bilinear Bochner-Riesz means, bilinear rough singular
integrals, and multilinear Fourier multipliers. In the linear case, based on
the Littlewood-Paley theory, we include weighted jump and variational

vorticity in polarizing spin of particles in heavy ion collisions. We point out
that shear has a fundamental difference that it leads to particle
redistribution in the medium. The redistribution gives rise to an additional
contribution to spin polarization through the self-energy, which is
parametrically the same order as the one considered so far in the literature.
The self-energy contribution is in general gauge dependent. We introduce double
gauge links stretching along the Schwinger-Keldysh contour to restore gauge
invariance. We also generalize the straight path to adapt to the
Schwinger-Keldysh contour. We find another contribution associated with the
gauge link, which is also parametrically the same order. We illustrate the two
contributions with a massive probe fermion in massless QED plasma with shear. A
modest suppression of spin polarization is found from the combined
contributions when the probe fermion has momentum much greater than the

encoding a memory of the applied strain amplitude. However, recent experiments
find that the effect of such memory formation on the mechanical properties of
the bulk material is rather weak. Here we study the memory effect in a yield
stress solid formed by a dense suspension of cornstarch particles in paraffin
oil. Under cyclic shear, the system evolves towards a steady-state showing
training-induced strain stiffening and plasticity. A readout reveals that the
system encodes a strong memory of the training amplitude as indicated by a
large change in the differential shear modulus. We observe that memory can be
encoded for a wide range of training amplitude both above and below the
yielding, albeit, the strength of the memory decreases with increasing the
training amplitude. In-situ boundary imaging shows strain localization close to
the shearing boundaries, while the bulk of the sample moves like a solid plug.
In the steady-state, the average particle velocity (<v>) inside the solid-like
region slows down with respect to the moving plate as the strain approaches the
training amplitude, however, as the readout strain crosses the amplitude, <v>
suddenly increases. We demonstrate that inter-particle adhesive interaction is
crucial for such a strong memory effect. Interestingly, our system can also
remember more than one input only if the training strain with a smaller
amplitude is applied last.

to the presence of intermediate-age stellar components that are dominated by
stars in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. However, no robust evidence
of this scenario has been provided so far. One way to test this claim is by
comparison of CO indices for ETGs and for relic galaxies. Lacking the
intermediate-age stellar populations, relic galaxies provide us with a unique
opportunity to address the origin of strong CO absorptions in ETGs. Here, we
utilize the prototype relic galaxy NGC 1277 and compare the CO absorption
features of this galaxy with the ones of a representative sample of massive

significantly stronger than the predictions of stellar population synthesis

materials. The PSOI is the electron-electron interaction component that depends
on the spin and momentum of the electrons. Being produced by the Coulomb fields
of interacting electrons, it exists already in vacuum, but becomes orders of
magnitude larger in materials with the giant Rashba effect. The main nontrivial
feature of the PSOI is that it is attractive for electrons in certain spin
configurations tied to their momentum and competes with the Coulomb repulsion
of the electrons. Under certain conditions attainable in modern low-dimensional
structures the PSOI prevails. The resulting attraction between electrons leads
to the formation of bound electron pairs, the binding energy of which can be
controlled by electrical means. In many-electron systems the PSOI results in
the instabilities of the uniform ground state with respect to the density
fluctuations, which develop on different spatial scales, depending on the
geometry of the electric fields that produce the PSOI. If the PSOI is not too
strong the electronic system is stable, but its collective excitations reveal
the highly unusual spin-charge structure and spectrum, which manifest
themselves in the frequency dependence of the dynamic conductivity.

Generalized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two
crucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different
domains, leading to an inevitable {domain distribution gap}; 2) the features of
the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional
{feature gap}. To address the GITR problem, we propose an Asymmetric Transfer
Hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised
realizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by
the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the
feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on
cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the
bipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information
loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate
negative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is
preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both

$\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ pairs are identified via selections on
pair momentum asymmetry and acoplanarity. Differential cross-sections for
dimuon production are measured in different centrality, average muon momentum
and pair rapidity intervals as functions of acoplanarity and $k_\perp$, the
transverse momentum kick of one muon relative to the other. Measurements are
also made as a function of the rapidity separation of the muons and the angle
of the muon pair relative to the second-order event plane to test whether
magnetic fields generated in the quark-gluon plasma affect the measured muons.
A prior observation of a centrality-dependent broadening of the acoplanarity
distribution is confirmed. Furthermore, the improved precision of the
measurement reveals a depletion in the number of pairs having small
acoplanarity or $k_{\perp}$ values in more central collisions. The acoplanarity
distributions in a given centrality interval are observed to vary with the
mean-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of the muons in the pair, but the $k_{\perp}$
distributions do not. Comparisons with recent theoretical predictions are made.
The predicted trends associated with effects of magnetic fields on the dimuons
are not observed.

finding a non-linear spatial transformation between a pair of fixed and moving

have been widely used as they can perform image registration in a fast and
end-to-end manner. However, these methods usually have limited performance for
image pairs with large deformations. Recently, iterative deep registration
methods have been used to alleviate this limitation, where the transformations
are iteratively learned in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, iterative methods
inevitably prolong the registration runtime, and tend to learn separate image
features for each iteration, which hinders the features from being leveraged to
facilitate the registration at later iterations. In this study, we propose a
Non-Iterative Coarse-to-finE registration Network (NICE-Net) for deformable
image registration. In the NICE-Net, we propose: (i) a Single-pass Deep
Cumulative Learning (SDCL) decoder that can cumulatively learn coarse-to-fine
transformations within a single pass (iteration) of the network, and (ii) a
Selectively-propagated Feature Learning (SFL) encoder that can learn common
image features for the whole coarse-to-fine registration process and
selectively propagate the features as needed. Extensive experiments on six
public datasets of 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) show that our
proposed NICE-Net can outperform state-of-the-art iterative deep registration
methods while only requiring similar runtime to non-iterative methods.

classifiers for online decision-support. In this approach, data-label querying
is guided according to the expected value of perfect information for incipient
data points. For SHM applications, the value of information is evaluated with
respect to a maintenance decision process, and the data-label querying
corresponds to the inspection of a structure to determine its health state.
Sampling bias is a known issue within active-learning paradigms; this occurs
when an active learning process over- or undersamples specific regions of a
feature-space, thereby resulting in a training set that is not representative
of the underlying distribution. This bias ultimately degrades decision-making
performance, and as a consequence, results in unnecessary costs incurred. The
current paper outlines a risk-based approach to active learning that utilises a
semi-supervised Gaussian mixture model. The semi-supervised approach
counteracts sampling bias by incorporating pseudo-labels for unlabelled data
via an EM algorithm. The approach is demonstrated on a numerical example
representative of the decision processes found in SHM.

pattern matching, in which two strings $x$ and $y$ of same length are
considered to match (pal-match) if they have the same palindromic structures,
i.e., for any possible $1 \le i < j \le |x| = |y|$, $x[i..j]$ is a palindrome
if and only if $y[i..j]$ is a palindrome. The pal-matching problem is the
problem of searching for, in a text, the occurrences of the substrings that
pal-match with a pattern. Given a text $T$ of length $n$ over an alphabet of
size $\sigma$, an index for pal-matching is to support, given a pattern $P$ of
length $m$, the counting queries that compute the number $\mathsf{occ}$ of
occurrences of $P$ and the locating queries that compute the occurrences of
$P$. The authors in~[I et al., Theor. Comput. Sci., 2013] proposed an $O(n \lg

withdrawal) of an air bubble into (or from) an infinite body of viscous fluid.
The most commonly studied feature of such a model is how the Saffman-Taylor
instability drives viscous fingering patterns at the fluid/air interface. Here
we consider a more realistic model, which assumes the viscous fluid is finite,
covering a doubly connected two-dimensional region bounded by two fluid/air
interfaces. For the case in which the flow is driven by a pressure difference
across the two interfaces, we explore this model numerically, highlighting the
development of viscous fingering patterns on the interface with the higher
pressure. Our numerical scheme is based on the level set method, where each
interface is represented as a separate level set function. We show that the
scheme is able to reproduce the characteristic finger patterns observed
experimentally up to the point at which one of the interfaces bursts through
the other. The simulations are shown to compare well with experimental results.
Further, we consider a model for the problem in which an annular body of fluid
is evolving in a rotating Hele--Shaw cell. In this case, our simulations
explore how either one or both of the interfaces can be unstable and develop
fingering patterns, depending on the rotation rate and the volume of fluid

total sunspot areas, and hemispheric sunspot areas. For all the data sets, a
linear regression based on the maximal growth rate precursor shows a
significant correlation. Validation of predictions for cycles 1-24 shows high
correlations between the true and predicted cycle amplitudes reaching r = 0.93

the sum of maximal growth rate indicators determined separately for the north

performance is also confirmed with hemispheric sunspot areas with respect to

`phonon-liquid electron-crystal' concept, have attracted enormous attention due
to their ultralow thermal conductivity and high figure-of-merit (zT). However,
their high zT is generally obtained deep inside the superionic phase, e.g.,
near 1000~K in the Cu$_2$X (X: chalcogen atom) family where the superionic
transition is close to 400~K. At such high temperatures, the liquid-like flow
of the metal ions under an electric field or a temperature gradient, both of
which are integral to the working of a thermoelectric device, results in device
degradation. To harness the full potential of the superionic thermoelectrics,
it is, therefore, necessary to reach high zT at low temperatures where the
metal-ion diffusion is not an issue. Here, we present a novel
all-room-temperature route to fabricate 100\% dense, nanostructured Ag$_2$Te
with highly reproducible thermoelectric properties and a high zT of 1.2 at
570~K, i.e., merely 150~K above its superionic transition. The samples show a
broad particle-size distribution ranging from a few nm to a few $\mu$m. This
hierarchical nanostructuring is shown to suppress the thermal conductivity of
Ag$_2$Te beyond the phonon-liquid electron-crystal limit to ultralow values,
leading to a remarkable enhancement of 87\% in the zT over that of the ingot
sample. These values supersede the zT of any Ag$_2$Te previously reported. Our
results are supported by first-principles density functional theory
calculations of the electronic and thermal properties.

odometer mileage for all household vehicles for seven days in two sample waves,
before the Expo Line opened (fall, 2011) and after the Expo Line opened (fall,
2012). Our analysis indicates that opening the Expo Line had a statistically
significant impact on average daily CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. We found
that the CO2 emission of households who reside within a half-mile of an Expo
Line station was 27.17 percent smaller than those living more than a half-mile
from a station after the opening of the light rail, while no significant
difference exists before the opening. A difference-in-difference model suggests
that the opening of the Expo Line is associated with 3,145 g less of household
vehicle CO2 emissions per day as a treatment effect. A sensitivity analysis
indicates that the emission reduction effect is also present when the

corrections to the mean-field energy, along with self-bound quantum droplets.
We consider both the symmetric system with equal intra-species scattering
lengths and atomic masses, modeled by a single (scalar) LHY-corrected
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), and the general asymmetric case with different
intra-species scattering lengths, described by two coupled (spinor) GPEs. We
found that in the symmetric setting, 1D and 2D holes can exist in a stable form
within a range of chemical potentials that overlaps with that of self-bound
quantum droplets, but that extends far beyond it. In this case, holes are found
to be stable in 1D and they transform into pairs of stable out-of-phase kinks
at the critical chemical potential at which localized droplets turn into
flat-top states, thereby revealing the connection between localized and
extended nonlinear states. In contrast, spinor nature of the asymmetric systems
may lead to instability of 1D holes, which tend to break into two gray states
moving in the opposite directions. Such instability arises due to spinor nature
of the system and it affects only holes nested in extended
modulationally-stable backgrounds, while localized quantum droplet families
remain completely stable, even in the asymmetric case, while 1D holes remain
stable only close to the point where they transform into pairs of kinks. We
also found that symmetric systems allow fully stable 2D vortex-carrying
single-charge states at moderate amplitudes, while unconventional instabilities
appear also at high amplitudes. Symmetry also strongly inhibits instabilities
for double-charge vortex-holes, which thus exhibit unexpectedly robust

order for phase unwrapping of the wrapped phase in 3D shape measurement.
Although the special coding sequence algorithm can achieve with a large number
of codewords, it needs current codeword and its adjacent codewords to jointly
determine the fringe order. If any codeword of the grouped adjacent codewords
is incorrectly recognized, it will result in false fringe order.Therefore, it
is challenging to significantly increase the number of codewords. When it is
necessary to simultaneously measure more than two isolated objects with large
size differences, if the fringe frequency is high, the number of fringes on the
smaller objects is too few to determine the fringe orders. On the other hand,
if the fringe frequency is low, the image can not contain all isolated objects
at the same time. To solve this problem, we propose an absolute phase
measurement method based on bidirectional coding patterns. The wrapped phase of
the object is obtained by fou step phase shifting patterns, and the fringe
orders is obtained by two bidirectional coded patterns. When coding the
bidirectional patterns, we code two groups of stair phase with different
frequency along horizontal direction, which respectively represent local fringe
order information and partition information, then, we alternately repeated the
two groups of stair phase along the vertical direction to obtain the
bidirectional coding patterns in the whole pattern. Each local fringe order
information and the corresponding partition information in small region jointly
determine the fringe order of each position in the wrapped phase. To verify the
effectiveness of our method, we did simulations and three experiments.
Simulation and experimental results show that our method is effective for
complex surfaces and isolated objects with different sizes.

empirical observations, these models generate a shared belief among coalition
members over the outcome as a function of its postulated causes. The intensity

parameters needed to understand the phenomenon and to simulate forecast
scenarios require a delicate calibration phase, often made even more
challenging by the scarcity and uncertainty of the observed data reported by
official sources. In this context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), by
embedding the knowledge of the differential model that governs the physical
phenomenon in the learning process, can effectively address the inverse and
forward problem of data-driven learning and solving the corresponding epidemic
problem. In many circumstances, however, the spatial propagation of an
infectious disease is characterized by movements of individuals at different
scales governed by multiscale PDEs. This reflects the heterogeneity of a region
or territory in relation to the dynamics within cities and in neighboring
zones. In presence of multiple scales, a direct application of PINNs generally
leads to poor results due to the multiscale nature of the differential model in
the loss function of the neural network. To allow the neural network to operate
uniformly with respect to the small scales, it is desirable that the neural
network satisfies an Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning
process. To this end, we consider a new class of AP Neural Networks (APNNs) for
multiscale hyperbolic transport models of epidemic spread that, thanks to an
appropriate AP formulation of the loss function, is capable to work uniformly

different epidemic scenarios confirms the validity of the proposed approach,
highlighting the importance of the AP property in the neural network when
dealing with multiscale problems especially in presence of sparse and partially

interaction with low-energy acoustic phonons determines the temperature
dependence of the decoherence rate and the resulting broadening of the ZPL with
the temperature obeys a power law. GaN hosts bright and stable single-photon
emitters in the 600 nm to 700 nm wavelength range with strong ZPLs even at room
temperature. In this work, we study the temperature dependence of the ZPL
spectra of GaN SPEs integrated with solid immersion lenses with the goal of
understanding the relevant decoherence mechanisms. At temperatures below ~50 K,
the ZPL lineshape is found to be Gaussian and the ZPL linewidth is temperature
independent and dominated by spectral diffusion. Above ~50 K, the linewidth
increases monotonically with the temperature and the lineshape evolves into a
Lorentzian. Quite remarkably, the temperature dependence of the linewidth does
not follow a power law. We propose a model in which decoherence caused by
absorption/emission of optical phonons in an elastic Raman process determines
the temperature dependence of the lineshape and the linewidth. Our model
explains the temperature dependence of the ZPL linewidth and lineshape in the
entire 10 K to 270 K temperature range explored in this work. The ~19 meV
optical phonon energy extracted by fitting the model to the data matches
remarkably well the ~18 meV zone center energy of the lowest optical phonon
band (E2(low)) in GaN. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for
linewidth broadening in GaN SPEs. Since a low energy optical phonon band
(E2(low)) is a feature of most group III-V nitrides with a wurtzite crystal
structure, including hBN and AlN, we expect our proposed mechanism to play an
important role in defect emitters in these materials as well.

the formalism of second quantisation, which relies on the assumption that any

particle permutations. Coherence-induced many-body effects such as
superradiance, however, can arise even in systems whose constituents are not
fundamentally indistinguishable as long as all relevant dynamical observables
are permutation-invariant. Such systems are not confined to symmetric or
anti-symmetric states and therefore require a different theoretical approach.
Focusing on non-interacting systems, here we combine tools from representation
theory and thermodynamically consistent master equations to develop such a
framework. We characterise the structure and properties of the steady states
emerging in permutation-invariant ensembles of arbitrary multi-level systems
that are collectively coupled to a thermal environment. As an application of
our general theory, we further explore how these states can in principle be
used to enhance the performance of quantum thermal machines. Our
group-theoretical framework thereby makes it possible to analyse various
limiting cases that would not be accessible otherwise. In addition, it allows
us to show that the properties of multi-level ensembles differ qualitatively
from those of spin ensembles, which have been investigated earlier using the
standard Clebsch-Gordan theory. Our results have a large scope for future
generalisations and pave the way for systematic investigations of collective

filaments in PF-1000 in a pure deuterium operation by a novel modification of
the interferometer system that allows simultaneous interferometry and schlieren

this development in the larger context of plasma focus physics.

backdoor learning called BackdoorBench. It consists of an extensible
modular-based codebase (currently including implementations of 8
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks and 9 SOTA defense algorithms) and a
standardized protocol of complete backdoor learning. We also provide
comprehensive evaluations of every pair of 8 attacks against 9 defenses, with 5

applied to most tendon-driven robotic hands. We show that the robot hand can

is presented for the extraction of the complex index of refraction from the
extinction efficiency of homogeneous and layered dielectric spheres that
simultaneously removes scattering effects and corrects measured extinction
spectra for baseline shifts, tilts, curvature, and scaling. No reference
spectrum is required and the method automatically satisfies the Kramers-Kronig
relations. Thus, the method yields pure absorbance spectra for unambiguous
interpretation of the chemical information of the sample. In the case of
homogeneous spheres, the method also determines the radius of the sphere. In
the case of layered spheres, the method determines the radii of the layers and
the substances within each layer. Only a single-element detector is required.
Using simulated $Q_{ext}$ data of polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and
polystyrene homogeneous and layered spheres we show that our reconstruction
algorithm is reliable and accurately extracts pure absorbance spectra from

between consecutive cartoon frames is typically nonlinear, which breaks the
linear motion assumption of interpolation algorithms. Thus, it is unsuitable
for generating a training set directly from cartoon videos. For better adapting
frame interpolation algorithms from nature video to animation video, we present
AutoFI, a simple and effective method to automatically render training data for

Experimental results show that AutoFI performs favorably in training both DAIN

the relatively simple Ramberg-Osgood relationship. Whilst this description
captures the overall stress-strain curve under monotonic tensile loading with

immediate post-yield region where the interplay between the elastic and plastic
strains is particularly significant. This study proposes and develops a new
approach to the description of the tensile stress-strain curve based on the
Yield Volume Fraction (YVF) function. The YVF description provides an excellent
match to experimental stress-strain curves based on a physically meaningful
parameter that corresponds to the cumulative volume fraction of the polycrystal
that undergoes yielding during monotonic deformation. The statistical nature of
the polycrystal yield phenomenon is highlighted by the fact that the YVF model
achieves good agreement with observations when the lognormal and extreme value
distributions are employed to express the cumulative density function for the
total yield volume fraction, and the probability density function for the
incremental yield volume fraction, respectively. This proposed approach is
compared with crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations and the
Ramberg-Osgood model, along with experimental observations. The results
highlight the potential of more extensive use of statistical methods in the

considering a matter field with a solitonic profile with the ability to adjust
the field variable from kink to compact-like configurations, the appearance of
black hole solutions is noticed for an event horizon at $r_{+} \approx 1.5$. An
interesting result is displayed when analyzing the influence of matter field
compactification on the metric functions. As we obtain compact-like field
configurations the metric functions tend to a ``linearized behavior''. However,
the compactification of the field does not change the structure of the horizon
of the magnetic black hole vortex. With the ADM formalism, the mass of the
black hole vortex is calculated, and its numerical results are presented. By
analyzing the so-called ADM mass, it is observed that the mass of the black
hole vortex increases as the cosmological constant becomes more negative, and
this coincides with the vortex core becoming smaller. Nonetheless, this mass
tends to decrease as the solitonic profile of the matter field becomes more
compacted. Then, the black hole temperature study is performed using the
tunneling formalism. In this case, it is perceived that the cosmological
constant, and the $\alpha$-parameter, will influence the Bekenstein-Hawking
temperature. In other words, the temperature of the structure increases as
these parameters increase.

spins (spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum) could provide unique

to design a search scheme to detect compact binaries with precession spins. It
has been shown that the detection of compact binaries carrying precessing spins
is not achievable with aligned-spins template waveforms. Efforts have been made
to construct the template banks to detect the precessing binaries using the
matched filtering based detection pipelines. However, in the absence of robust
methods and huge computational requirements, the precessing searches, more or
less, still remain a challenge. This work introduces a detection scheme for the
binary black holes to classify them into aligned and precessing systems using a

classifies data as $\GW$ signals originated from binary black holes ($\BBH$) or
noise and then it further classifies the detected $\BBH$ systems as precessing

high-level regularities within them, such as the symmetries of a table, the
repetition of its legs, while possessing low-level priors of their geometries,
e.g., surfaces are smooth and edges are sharp. This kind of knowledge
constitutes an important part of human perceptual understanding and reasoning.
Representations of and how to reason in such knowledge, and the acquisition
thereof, are still open questions in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive
science. Building on the previous proposal of the \emph{3D shape programs}
representation alone with the accompanying neural generator and executor from
\citet{tian2019learning}, we propose an analytical yet differentiable executor
that is more faithful and controllable in interpreting shape programs
(particularly in extrapolation) and more sample efficient (requires no
training). These facilitate the generator's learning when ground truth programs
are not available, and should be especially useful when new shape-program
components are enrolled either by human designers or -- in the context of
library learning -- algorithms themselves. Preliminary experiments on using it
for adaptation illustrate the aforesaid advantages of the proposed module,
encouraging similar methods being explored in building machines that learn to

problems, and compared with convex relaxation methods, can achieve better
recovery results. In this paper, a new non-convex function, Minimax Logarithmic
Concave Penalty (MLCP) function, is proposed, and some of its intrinsic
properties are analyzed, among which it is interesting to find that the
Logarithmic function is an upper bound of the MLCP function. The proposed
function is generalized to tensor cases, yielding tensor MLCP and weighted
tensor $L\gamma$-norm. Consider that its explicit solution cannot be obtained
when applying it directly to the tensor recovery problem. Therefore, the
corresponding equivalence theorems to solve such problem are given, namely,
tensor equivalent MLCP theorem and equivalent weighted tensor $L\gamma$-norm
theorem. In addition, we propose two EMLCP-based models for classic tensor
recovery problems, namely low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust
principal component analysis (TRPCA), and design proximal alternate
linearization minimization (PALM) algorithms to solve them individually.
Furthermore, based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiwicz property, it is proved that the
solution sequence of the proposed algorithm has finite length and converges to
the critical point globally. Finally, Extensive experiments show that proposed
algorithm achieve good results, and it is confirmed that the MLCP function is
indeed better than the Logarithmic function in the minimization problem, which
is consistent with the analysis of theoretical properties.

that the structure information among samples includes local and global

algorithm with the deep sample pre-envelope network (DSEN) and local-global
structure consistency mechanism (LGSCM) is proposed here to solve the
problem.This algorithm can guarantee high-quality deep envelope samples for
considering the local manifold and global structures information, which is
helpful for imbalance learning. First, the deep sample envelope pre-network
(DSEN) is designed to mine structure information among samples.Then, the local
manifold structure metric (LMSM) and global structure distribution metric
(GSDM) are designed to construct LGSCM to enhance distribution consistency of
interlayer samples. Next, the DSEN and LGSCM are put together to form the final
deep sample envelope network (DSEN-LG). After that, base classifiers are
applied on the layers of deep samples respectively.Finally, the predictive
results from base classifiers are fused through bagging ensemble learning

Bitcoin using a feedforward neural network. Due to the increasing popularity of
cryptocurrencies in recent years, the question has arisen, as to whether market
inefficiencies could be exploited in Bitcoin. Several studies we refer to here
discuss this topic in the context of Bitcoin using either statistical tests or
machine learning methods, mostly relying exclusively on data from Bitcoin
itself. Results regarding market efficiency vary from study to study. In this
study, however, the focus is on applying various asset-related input features
in a neural network. The aim is to investigate whether the prediction accuracy
improves when adding equity stock indices (S&P 500, Russell 2000), currencies
(EURUSD), 10 Year US Treasury Note Yield as well as Gold&Silver producers index
(XAU), in addition to using Bitcoin returns as input feature. As expected, the
results show that more features lead to higher training performance from 54.6%
prediction accuracy with one feature to 61% with six features. On the test set,
we observe that with our neural network methodology, adding additional asset
classes, no increase in prediction accuracy is achieved. One feature set is
able to partially outperform a buy-and-hold strategy, but the performance drops
again as soon as another feature is added. This leads us to the partial
conclusion that weak market inefficiencies for Bitcoin cannot be detected using
neural networks and the given asset classes as input. Therefore, based on this
study, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is efficient in the sense of
the efficient market hypothesis during the sample period. We encourage further
research in this area, as much depends on the sample period chosen, the input
features, the model architecture, and the hyperparameters.

"2209.06076","Tony Lyons","Tony Lyons","On the intrinsic wave-particle duality of coordinate maps",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The relative motion of material, point-like observers is analysed in terms of
coordinate maps between the respective rest-frame of each observer. Under the
assumption these maps are $C^{2}$-regular, conservation laws are deduced, which
in turn are found to yield wave equations familiar as scalar and spinor fields.
Wave-particle dualism is then understood as a property of these coordinate maps
as opposed to an inherent property of the point-like observers themselves.
Additionally it is shown that the relative acceleration of these observers can
only be realised in this context by the introduction of additional potential
fields. It is shown that if each observer is to be associated with an inertial
frame of reference, then the potential field is necessarily a massless gauge
field.
