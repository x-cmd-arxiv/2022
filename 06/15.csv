[OIII] 88 $\mu$m, dust, and rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum emission for
A1689-zD1, a strongly lensed, sub-L* galaxy at $z=7.13$, by utilizing deep
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) observations. While the [OIII] line and UV continuum are compact, the
[CII] line is extended up to a radius of $r \sim 12$ kpc. Using multi-band
rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum data ranging from 52-400 $\mu$m, we
find an average dust temperature and emissivity index of $T_{\rm dust} =
41^{+17}_{-14}$ K and $\beta = 1.7^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$, respectively, across the
galaxy. We find slight differences in the dust continuum profiles at different
wavelengths, which may indicate that the dust temperature decreases with
distance. We map the star-formation rate (SFR) via IR and UV luminosities and
determine a total SFR of $37\pm 1~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ with an obscured
fraction of $87\%$. While the [OIII] line is a good tracer of the SFR, the
[CII] line shows deviation from the local $L_{\rm [CII]}$-SFR relations in the
outskirts of the galaxy. Finally, we observe a clear difference in the line
profile between [CII] and [OIII], with significant residuals ($\sim 5\sigma$)
in the [OIII] line spectrum after subtracting a single Gaussian model. This
suggests a possible origin of the extended [CII] structure from the cooling of
hot ionized outflows. The extended [CII] and high-velocity [OIII] emission may
both contribute in part to the high $L_{\rm [OIII]}$/$L_{\rm [CII]}$ ratios
recently reported in $z>6$ galaxies.

goal is settled for restricted classes of loops. For the class of solvable
loops, introduced by Kapur and Rodr\'iguez-Carbonell in 2004, one can
automatically compute invariants from closed-form solutions of recurrence
equations that model the loop behaviour. In this paper we establish a technique
for invariant synthesis for loops that are not solvable, termed unsolvable

identifies the so-called defective variables that characterise unsolvability.
We further present a novel technique that automatically synthesises
polynomials, in the defective variables, that admit closed-form solutions and
thus lead to polynomial loop invariants. Our implementation and experiments
demonstrate both the feasibility and applicability of our approach to both

$\rho:\pi_1(\Sigma)\to\mathrm{SO}_0(2,n+1)$ via the introduction of

  We prove that $\rho$-invariant pleated surfaces are always embedded, acausal,
and possess an intrinsic pseudo-metric and a hyperbolic structure. We describe
the latter by constructing a shear cocycle from the cross ratio naturally
associated to $\rho$. The process developed to this purpose applies to a wide
class of cross ratios, including examples arising from Hitchin and
$\Theta$-positive representations in $\mathrm{SO}(p,q)$. We also show that the
length spectrum of $\rho$ dominates the ones of $\rho$-invariant pleated
surfaces, with strict inequality exactly on curves that intersect the bending
locus.
  We observe that the canonical decomposition of a $\rho$-invariant pleated
surface into leaves and plaques corresponds to a decomposition of the
Guichard-Wienhard domain of discontinuity of $\rho$ into standard fibered
blocks, namely triangles and lines of photons. Conversely, we give a concrete
construction of photon manifolds fibering over hyperbolic surfaces by gluing
together triangles of photons.

investigate heterostructures of graphene and chromium trihalide magnetic

proximity effects featuring unprecedented gate-tunability. The graphene becomes
highly hole-doped due to charge transfer from the neighboring magnetic
insulator, and further exhibits a variety of atypical transport features. These
include highly extended quantum Hall plateaus, abrupt reversals in the Landau
level filling sequence, and hysteresis over at least days-long time scales. In
the case of CrI$_3$, we are able to completely suppress the charge transfer and
all attendant atypical transport effects by gating. The charge transfer can
additionally be altered in a first-order phase transition upon switching the
magnetic states of the nearest CrI$_3$ layers. Our results provide a roadmap

accumulated unstructured financial data, such as the textual disclosure

as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These documents are typically
very long and tend to contain valuable soft information about a company's
performance. It is therefore of great interest to learn predictive models from
these long textual documents, especially for forecasting numerical key
performance indicators (KPIs). Whereas there has been a great progress in
pre-trained language models (LMs) that learn from tremendously large corpora of
textual data, they still struggle in terms of effective representations for
long documents. Our work fills this critical need, namely how to develop better
models to extract useful information from long textual documents and learn
effective features that can leverage the soft financial and risk information
for text regression (prediction) tasks. In this paper, we propose and implement
a deep learning framework that splits long documents into chunks and utilizes
pre-trained LMs to process and aggregate the chunks into vector
representations, followed by self-attention to extract valuable document-level
features. We evaluate our model on a collection of 10-K public disclosure
reports from US banks, and another dataset of reports submitted by US
companies. Overall, our framework outperforms strong baseline methods for
textual modeling as well as a baseline regression model using only numerical

domain-specific and fine-tuned long-input LMs in representing long documents
can improve the quality of representation of textual data, and therefore, help

A
particularly important subclass of such random matrices is formed by the
adjacency matrix of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ equipped
with i.i.d. edge-weights. An observable of particular interest is the largest
eigenvalue. In this paper, we study the large deviations behavior of the
largest eigenvalue of such matrices, a topic that has received considerable
attention over the years. We focus on the case $p = \frac{d}{n}$, where most
known techniques break down. So far, results were known only for
$\mathcal{G}_{n,\frac{d}{n}}$ without edge-weights (Krivelevich and Sudakov,
'03), (Bhattacharya, Bhattacharya, and Ganguly, '21) and with Gaussian
edge-weights (Ganguly and Nam, '21).
  In the present article, we consider the effect of general weight
distributions. More specifically, we consider the entries whose tail
probabilities decay at rate $e^{-t^\alpha}$ with $\alpha>0$, where the regimes
$0<\alpha<2$ and $\alpha>2$ correspond to tails heavier and lighter than the
Gaussian tail respectively. While in many natural settings the large deviations
behavior is expected to depend crucially on the entry distribution, we
establish a surprising and rare universal behavior showing that this is not the
case when $\alpha > 2.$ In contrast, in the $\alpha< 2$ case, the large
deviation rate function is no longer universal and is given by the solution to
a variational problem, the description of which involves a generalization of
the Motzkin-Straus theorem, a classical result from spectral graph theory.
  As a byproduct of our large deviation results, we also establish new law of
large numbers results for the largest eigenvalue. In particular, we show that
the typical value of the largest eigenvalue exhibits a phase transition at
$\alpha = 2$, i.e. the Gaussian distribution.

forever, is not practical. As input distributions change over time, the model
will not only lose accuracy, any constraints to reduce bias against a protected
class may fail to work as intended. Thus, researchers have begun to explore
ways to maintain algorithmic fairness over time. One line of work focuses on
dynamic learning: retraining after each batch, and the other on robust learning
which tries to make algorithms robust against all possible future changes.
Dynamic learning seeks to reduce biases soon after they have occurred and
robust learning often yields (overly) conservative models. We propose an
anticipatory dynamic learning approach for correcting the algorithm to mitigate
bias before it occurs. Specifically, we make use of anticipations regarding the
relative distributions of population subgroups (e.g., relative ratios of male
and female applicants) in the next cycle to identify the right parameters for
an importance weighing fairness approach. Results from experiments over
multiple real-world datasets suggest that this approach has promise for
anticipatory bias correction.

Using spatially resolved spectral interferometry, we demonstrate a simple,
stationary, single-frame method to quantitatively characterize ultrashort light
pulses carrying ST-OAM. Using our method, the presence of an ST-OAM pulse,
including its main characteristics such as topological charge numbers and OAM
helicity, can be identified easily from the unique and unambiguous features
directly seen on the raw data--without any need for a full analysis of the
data. After processing and reconstructions, other exquisite features, including
pulse dispersion and beam divergence, can also be fully characterized. Our fast
characterization method allows high-throughput and quick feedback during the
generation and optical alignment processes of ST-OAM pulses. It is
straightforward to extend our method to single-shot measurement by using a
high-speed camera that matches the pulse repetition rate. This new method can
help advance the field of spatially and temporally structured light and its
applications in advanced metrologies.

discretized Heisenberg model with a type of random field, for several values of
the randomness coupling parameter $h_R$. The 12 states correspond to the [110]
directions of a cube. Simple cubic lattices of size $128 \times 128 \times 128$
with periodic boundary conditions were used, and 32 samples were studied for
each value of $h_R$. The model has the standard nonrandom two-spin exchange
term with coupling energy $J$ and a field which adds an energy $h_R$ to two of
the 12 spin states, chosen randomly and independently at each site. We provide
results for the cases $h_R / J =$ -2.5, -2.0, -1.5, 3.0 and 4.0. For all these
cases except $h_R / J =$ -2.5, we see an apparently sharp phase transition at a
temperature $T_c$ where the specific heat and the longitudinal susceptibility
are peaked. At $T_c$, the behavior of the peak in the structure factor, $S
({\bf k} )$, at small $|{\bf k}|$ is a straight line on a log-log plot.
However, the value of the slope of this line is different for $h_R /J =$ -1.5
and 3.0 than it is for $h_R / J =$ -2.0 and 4.0. We believe that the first two
cases are showing the behavior of a cubic fixed point in a weak random field,
and the behavior of the second two cases are showing the behavior of an
isotropic fixed point when the Imry-Ma length is smaller than the sample size.
Below $T_c$, these $L = 128$ samples show ferroelectric order, and this order
rapidly becomes oriented along one of the eight [111] directions as $T$ is
reduced. This rotation of the ordering direction is caused by the cubic
anisotropy. For $h_R / J =$ -2.5, we do not see clear evidence of a single
well-defined $T_c$.

astrophysical destruction mechanisms of civilisations including gamma-ray

efficiency of such processes and find that astrophysical effects can influence
the development of intelligent civilisations and change the number of systems
with such civilisations by roughly a factor of 2; potentially more if the
feedback is enhanced. Our results show that non-equilibrium evolution allows
for solutions in-between extreme cases such as ""rare Earth"" or extreme
colonisation, including scenarios with civilisation fractions between 10^{-2}
and 10^{-7}. These would imply still potentially large distances to the next
such civilisations, particularly when persistence phenomena are being
considered. As previous studies, we confirm that the main uncertainties are due
to the lifetime of civilisations as well as the assumed rate of colonisation.
For SETI-like studies, we believe that unbiased searches are needed considering
both the possibilities that the next civilisations are nearby or potentially
very far away.

corresponds to the synchronization of a neuron network, and mathematically
prevents the existence of a global classical solution. In this work, we propose
a new generalized solution based on reformulating the PDE model with a specific

which the transformed equation can be shown to be globally well-posed for any
connectivity parameter even in the event of the blow-up. The generalized
solution is then defined via the backward change of timescale, and it may have
a jump when the firing rate blows up. We establish properties of the
generalized solution including the characterization of blow-ups and the global
well-posedness in the original timescale. The generalized solution provides a
new perspective to understand the dynamics when the firing rate blows up as

Our main contribution is the design of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms
with respect to the number of vertices on the right side. Our algorithms make
use of a variety of techniques including color coding. At the core lie integer
linear programs encoding Hall like conditions. To establish the correctness of
our integer programs, we prove a new separation result, inspired by Frank's
separation theorem [Frank, Discrete Math. 1982], which may also be of
independent interest. We further obtain complete complexity dichotomies
regarding the number of colors and the maximum degree of each side.

derived from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where isotropic pressures are assumed.
Yet, in a collisionless plasma, an external magnetic field can sustain a stable
anisotropy. In \cite{BretJPP2018}, we devised a model for the kinetic history
of the plasma through the shock front, allowing to self-consistently compute
the downstream anisotropy, hence the density jump, in terms of the upstream
parameters. This model dealt with the case of a parallel shock, where the
magnetic field is normal to the front both in the upstream and the downstream.
Yet, MHD also allows for shock solutions, the so-called switch-on solutions,
where the field is normal to the front only in the upstream. This article
consists in applying our model to these switch-on shocks. While MHD offers only
1 switch-on solution within a limited range of Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers, our
model offers 2 kinds of solutions within a slightly different range of
Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers. These 2 solutions are most likely the outcome of the
intermediate and fast MHD shocks under our model. While the intermediate and
fast shocks merge in MHD for the parallel case, they do not within our model.
For simplicity, the formalism is restricted to non-relativistic shocks in pair
plasmas where the upstream is cold.

Bayesian computation (ABC), which replace distances among summaries with
discrepancies between the empirical distributions of the observed data and the
synthetic samples generated under the proposed parameter values. The success of
these solutions has motivated theoretical studies on the limiting properties of
the induced posteriors. However, current results are often specific to the
discrepancy analyzed, and mostly rely on difficult-to-verify existence
assumptions that are required to ease proofs at the expense of
not-readily-interpretable bounds and a limited exploration of asymptotic
properties in more complex settings. We address this gap via a novel
theoretical framework which introduces the concept of Rademacher complexity in
the analysis of the limiting properties for discrepancy-based ABC posteriors.
This yields a unified theory that relies on constructive arguments and provides
more interpretable asymptotic results and concentration bounds, even in
challenging settings not considered by current theoretical studies. Such
advancements are obtained by relating the limiting properties of summary-free
ABC posteriors to the behavior of the Rademacher complexity associated with the
chosen discrepancy within the broad family of integral probability semimetrics.
This class extends summary-based ABC, and includes the widely-implemented
Wasserstein distance and MMD, among others. As clarified through a focus of
these results on the MMD case and via two illustrative simulations, this novel
theoretical perspective yields an improved understanding of ABC and sets the
premises to study the concentration of more general pseudo-posteriors, such as
those induced by generalized Bayes.

for CO$_2$ adsorption. Given the importance of CO$_2$ confinement in Mg-MOF-74
for capture and storage applications, it is important to understand the
structural and dynamical behavior of CO$_2$ in Mg-MOF-74 pores. While most
molecular simulation studies use ideal single crystal models of nano-porous
substrates, the existence of inter-crystalline space has been shown to have
profound effects on the sorption, structure and dynamics of the adsorbed fluid.
To address these issues, we report a molecular dynamics simulation study at 300
K, of CO$_2$ confined in several models of Mg-MOF-74 with systematically
inserted inter-crystalline spacing of different widths. Both structural and
dynamical behavior of CO$_2$ is studied in 5 models of Mg-MOF-74, each at 4
different loadings. Six strong sites of CO$_2$ adsorption are found at the
periphery of the pores of Mg-MOF-74 in addition to a relatively weak adsorption
at the center of the pore. On insertion of inter-crystalline spacing,
additional six sites of strong adsorption are seen in the inter-crystalline
space close to the pore opening. These additional sites delocalize as the
inter-crystalline space is widened and the population of guest molecules
adsorbed at the pore center grows at the expense of peripheral population. This
redistribution of guest molecules has important implications for their
dynamics. While in the model without inter-crystalline space, translation
motion is found to be slower at higher loadings, as wider inter-crystalline
space is introduced, anomalous loading dependence of translational diffusivity
is observed. In general, inserting inter-crystalline spacing is found to
enhance both translational as well as rotational motion of the guest molecules.
The results reported here provide valuable insight to carbon capture and
storage.

leading example of collective decision-making in social insects. In this paper,
a piecewise colony migration system with recruitment switching is proposed to
explore underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects of colony size and quorum
on the outcomes of collective decision. The completed dynamical analysis for
the non-smooth system (including the dynamics on subsystems, switching surface,
and full system) is performed, and the sufficient conditions significantly
related to colony size for the stability of equilibria are provided. The
theoretical results suggest that large colonies are more likely to emigrate to
a new site. More interesting findings include but not limit to: (a) the system
may exhibit oscillation when the colony size is below a critical level; (b) the
system may also exhibit a bistable state, and colonies migrate to a new site or
the old nest depending on their initial sizes of recruiters. Bifurcation

in-distribution data, which may not always be available due to proprietary
datasets. Model inversion techniques, often considered privacy threats, can
reconstruct realistic training samples, potentially eliminating the need for
in-distribution data. Prior attempts to combine backdoor removal and model
inversion yielded limited results. Our work is the first to provide a thorough
understanding of leveraging model inversion for effective backdoor removal by
addressing key questions about reconstructed samples' properties, perceptual
similarity, and the potential presence of backdoor triggers.
  We establish that relying solely on perceptual similarity is insufficient for
robust defenses, and the stability of model predictions in response to input
and parameter perturbations is also crucial. To tackle this, we introduce a
novel bi-level optimization-based framework for model inversion, promoting
stability and visual quality. Interestingly, we discover that reconstructed
samples from a pre-trained generator's latent space are backdoor-free, even
when utilizing signals from a backdoored model. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support this finding. Our evaluation demonstrates that our
stabilized model inversion technique achieves state-of-the-art backdoor removal
performance without clean in-distribution data, matching or surpassing
performance using the same amount of clean samples.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In most PUF-based authentication schemes, a central server is usually engaged
to verify the response of the device's PUF to challenge bit-streams. However,
the server availability may be intermittent in practice. To tackle such an
issue, this paper proposes a new protocol for supporting distributed
authentication while avoiding vulnerability to information leakage where CRPs
could be retrieved from hacked devices and collectively used to model the PUF.
The main idea is to provision for scrambling the challenge bit-stream in a way
that is dependent on the verifier. The scrambling pattern varies per
authentication round for each device and independently across devices. In
essence, the scrambling function becomes node- and packet-specific and the
response received by two verifiers of one device for the same challenge
bit-stream could vary. Thus, neither the scrambling function can be reverted,
nor the PUF can be modeled even by a collusive set of malicious nodes. The
validation results using data of an FPGA-based implementation demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in thwarting PUF modeling attacks by collusive
actors. We also discuss the approach resiliency against impersonation, Sybil,
and reverse engineering attacks.

complexity of stochastic first-order methods in distributed training of machine

sampling of stochastic gradients. In contrast, it is well-known in practice and
recently confirmed in theory that stochastic methods based on
without-replacement sampling, e.g., Random Reshuffling (RR) method, perform
better than ones that sample the gradients with-replacement. In this work, we
close this gap in the literature and provide the first analysis of methods with
gradient compression and without-replacement sampling. We first develop a
na\""ive combination of random reshuffling with gradient compression (Q-RR).
Perhaps surprisingly, but the theoretical analysis of Q-RR does not show any
benefits of using RR. Our extensive numerical experiments confirm this
phenomenon. This happens due to the additional compression variance. To reveal
the true advantages of RR in the distributed learning with compression, we
propose a new method called DIANA-RR that reduces the compression variance and
has provably better convergence rates than existing counterparts with
with-replacement sampling of stochastic gradients. Next, to have a better fit
to Federated Learning applications, we incorporate local computation, i.e., we
propose and analyze the variants of Q-RR and DIANA-RR -- Q-NASTYA and
DIANA-NASTYA that use local gradient steps and different local and global
stepsizes. Finally, we conducted several numerical experiments to illustrate
our theoretical results.

The Curie temperature Tc of CFGT ranges from 310 K in the thinnest flake
studied to 328 K in the bulk. To investigate the prospect of high-temperature
monolayer ferromagnetism, Monte Carlo calculations were performed which
predicted a high value of Tc ~270 K in CFGT monolayers. Pathways towards

rapidly, the estimated body shapes often do not capture the true human shape.
This is problematic since, for many applications, accurate body shape is as

is the lack of data. While humans can label 2D joints, and these constrain 3D
pose, it is not so easy to ""label"" 3D body shape. Since paired data with images
and 3D body shape are rare, we exploit two sources of information: (1) we
collect internet images of diverse ""fashion"" models together with a small set
of anthropometric measurements; (2) we collect linguistic shape attributes for
a wide range of 3D body meshes and the model images. Taken together, these
datasets provide sufficient constraints to infer dense 3D shape. We exploit the
anthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes in several novel
ways to train a neural network, called SHAPY, that regresses 3D human pose and
shape from an RGB image. We evaluate SHAPY on public benchmarks, but note that
they either lack significant body shape variation, ground-truth shape, or
clothing variation. Thus, we collect a new dataset for evaluating 3D human

animation videos, and reveals three key improvements for practical animation
VSR. First, recent real-world super-resolution approaches typically rely on
degradation simulation using basic operators without any learning capability,
such as blur, noise, and compression. In this work, we propose to learn such
basic operators from real low-quality animation videos, and incorporate the
learned ones into the degradation generation pipeline. Such
neural-network-based basic operators could help to better capture the
distribution of real degradations. Second, a large-scale high-quality animation
video dataset, AVC, is built to facilitate comprehensive training and
evaluations for animation VSR. Third, we further investigate an efficient
multi-scale network structure. It takes advantage of the efficiency of
unidirectional recurrent networks and the effectiveness of sliding-window-based
methods. Thanks to the above delicate designs, our method, AnimeSR, is capable
of restoring real-world low-quality animation videos effectively and
efficiently, achieving superior performance to previous state-of-the-art
methods. Codes and models are available at

the robust correspondences offered by modern image representations to

find that the energies of the Dirac points of helical edge states in

realization of a time-reversal invariant second-order topological
superconducting phase with highly controllable Majorana Kramers pairs at the

Our study reveals promising platforms to implement highly controllable Majorana

single axion, the QCD axion, with an anomalous coupling to photons. Other light
axion-like particles can couple to photons by mixing through the QCD axion
portal and lie to the right of the QCD line in the mass-coupling plane. Axions
which break the unification relation between gluon and photon couplings are
necessarily charged under the GUT gauge group and become heavy from
perturbative mass contributions. A discovery of an axion to the left of the QCD

scattering of CMB photons from distant free electrons and yields a novel view
of the CMB quadrupole throughout the observable Universe. Galaxy shear measures
the shape distortions of galaxies, probing both their local environment and the
intervening matter distribution. Both observables give interesting constraints
on the cosmological model; here we ask: what can be learnt from their
combination? The pSZ-shear cross-spectrum measures the
shear-galaxy-polarization bispectrum and contains contributions from (1) the
Sachs-Wolfe (SW) effect, (2) the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and (3)
inflationary gravitational waves. Since the modes contributing to the pSZ
signal are not restricted to the Earth's past lightcone, the low-redshift
cross-spectra could provide a novel constraint on dark energy via the ISW
effect, whilst the SW signal couples scalar modes at very different times but
at similar positions; this provides a unique probe of the Universe's
homogeneous time evolution. We give expressions for all major contributions to
the shear, galaxy, and pSZ auto- and cross-spectra, and evaluate their
detectability via Fisher forecasts. Despite significant theoretical utility,
the cross-spectra will be challenging to detect: combining CMB-S4 with Rubin
yields a $1.6\sigma$ detection of the ISW contribution, which increases to
$5.2\sigma$ for a futuristic experiment involving CMB-HD and a higher galaxy
sample density. For parity-even (parity-odd) tensors, we predict a $1\sigma$
limit of $\sigma(r) = 0.9$ ($0.2$) for CMB-S4 and Rubin, or $0.3$ ($0.06$) for
the more futuristic setup. Whilst this is significantly better than the
constraints from galaxy shear alone (and less sensitive to systematics), it is
unlikely to be competitive, but may serve as a useful cross-check.

population-averaged cloud properties and host galaxy properties, and to assess
key timescales relevant to molecular cloud evolution and star formation. We
show that PHANGS probes a wide range of kpc-scale gas, stellar, and star
formation rate (SFR) surface densities, as well as orbital velocities and
shear. The population-averaged cloud properties in each aperture correlate
strongly with both local environmental properties and host galaxy global
properties. Leveraging a variable selection analysis, we find that the
kpc-scale surface densities of molecular gas and SFR tend to possess the most
predictive power for the population-averaged cloud properties. Once their
variations are controlled for, galaxy global properties contain little
additional information, which implies that the apparent galaxy-to-galaxy
variations in cloud populations are likely mediated by kpc-scale environmental
conditions. We further estimate a suite of important timescales from our
multiwavelength measurements. The cloud-scale free-fall time and turbulence
crossing time are ${\sim}5{-}20$ Myr, comparable to previous cloud lifetime
estimates. The timescales for orbital motion, shearing, and cloud-cloud

which is currently being utilized in the search for accreted UFDs. We produce
32 simulated stellar halos using particle tagging with the \textit{Caterpillar}

algorithms to recover tidally disrupted UFD remnants. We perform over 10,000
clustering runs, testing seven clustering algorithms, roughly twenty
hyperparameter choices per algorithm, and six different types of data sets each
with up to 32 simulated samples. Of the seven algorithms, HDBSCAN most
consistently balances UFD recovery rates and cluster realness rates. We find
that even in highly idealized cases, the vast majority of clusters found by
clustering algorithms do not correspond to real accreted UFD remnants and we
can generally only recover $6\%$ of UFDs remnants at best. These results focus
exclusively on groups of stars from UFDs, which have weak dynamic signatures
compared to the background of other stars. The recoverable UFD remnants are
those that accreted recently, $z_{\text{accretion}}\lesssim 0.5$. Based on
these results, we make recommendations to help guide the search for
dynamically-linked clusters of UFD stars in observational data. We find that
real clusters generally have higher median energy and $J_r$, providing a way to
help identify real vs. fake clusters. We also recommend incorporating chemical

distributions for different bins of both global properties. We use a piece-wise
analysis to characterize the slopes of the gradients from those properties at
different galactocentric distances. In general we find that most of the
properties -- derived from both the stellar continuum and the ionized gas
emission lines -- exhibit a negative gradient with a secondary impact by global
properties such as the total stellar mass or morphology. Our results confirm
the intimate interplay between the properties of the stellar component and
those of the ionized gas at local (kpc) scales in order to set the observed
gradients. Furthermore, the resemblance of the gradients for similar global
properties (in particular for the stellar parameters) indicates statistical
similar histories of star formation and chemical enrichment with an initial
radial gas distribution following the potential of the galaxy.

Recently, an additional early-type population of more extended ultradiffuse
galaxies (UDGs) has been identified, sparking a discussion on the potential
morphological and evolutionary connections between the three classifications.
Here, we present the first measurements of spatially resolved stellar
kinematics from deep integrated-light spectra of KDG 64 (UGC 5442), a large
dSph galaxy in the M 81 group. From these data, we infer stellar population
properties and dark matter halo parameters using Jeans dynamical modelling. We
find an old, metal-poor stellar population with no young stars and a dark
matter mass fraction of ~ 90 per cent within the half-light radius. These
properties and the position of KDG 64 on the Fundamental Plane indicate that it
is a local analogue of smaller UDGs in the Coma and Virgo clusters and is
probably a transitional dSph-UDG object. Its evolutionary path cannot be
uniquely established from the existing data, but we argue that supernovae
feedback and tidal heating played key roles in shaping KDG 64.

morphology and kinematics of the HI in this otherwise apparently normal galaxy.
High column density, cold HI is absent from an extended North-South region
passing by the optical centre of the galaxy, but instead is extended towards
the South, on both sides of the galaxy. Moreover, the HI kinematics do not show
a continuous change along the major axis of the galaxy as expected in a
classical rotating disk. We explore several scenarios to explain the HI
structure and kinematics in the galaxy: feedback from a central starburst
and/or an active galactic nucleus, ram pressure stripping, accretion, and tidal
interaction from a companion galaxy. All of these options are ruled out. The
most viable remaining explanation is the penetrating passage of a satellite
through the disk only a few Myr ago, redistributing the HI in the GRB host
without yet affecting its stellar distribution. It can also lead to the rapid
formation of peculiar stars due to a violent induced shock. The location of GRB

enhanced angular-momentum transport and redistribution, nonthermal particle

unequally. However, this microscopic physics cannot be captured with standard

this work, we explore the nonlinear development of MRI turbulence in a pair
plasma, employing fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations in two and
three dimensions. First, we thoroughly study the axisymmetric MRI with 2D
simulations, explaining how and why the 2D geometry produces results that
differ substantially from MHD expectations. We then perform the largest (to
date) 3D simulations, for which we employ a novel shearing-box approach,
demonstrating that 3D PIC models can reproduce the mesoscale (i.e. MHD) MRI
dynamics in sufficiently large runs. With our fully kinetic simulations, we are
able to describe the nonthermal particle acceleration and angular-momentum
transport driven by the collisionless MRI. Since these microscopic processes
ultimately lead to the emission of potentially measurable radiation in
accreting plasmas, our work is of prime importance to understand current and
future observations from first principles, beyond the limitations imposed by
fluid (MHD) models. While in this first study we focus on pair plasmas for
simplicity, our results represent an essential step toward designing more
realistic electron-ion simulations, on which we will focus in future work.

that seen in graphene. They -- and the corresponding edge states -- are broadly
tunable by adjusting the laser strength and can be observed in present-day

debris disks remain quite elusive, whether it is the absorption efficiencies at
millimeter wavelengths or the (un)polarized phase function at near-infrared
wavelengths. Thankfully the same particles are experiencing forces that are
size dependent (e.g., radiation pressure), and with high angular resolution
observations we can take advantage of this natural spatial segregation.
Observations at different wavelengths probe different ranges of sizes, and
there is therefore a great synergy in multi-wavelength observations to better
constrain the optical properties of the particles. We present a new approach to
simultaneously model SPHERE and ALMA observations and apply it to the debris
disk around HD\,32297, putting the emphasis on the spatial distribution of the
grains with different $\beta$ values. This modeling approach requires few
assumptions on the actual sizes of the particles and the interpretation can
therefore be done a posteriori. We find that the ALMA observations are best
reproduced with a combination of small and large $\beta$ values ($0.03$ and
$0.42$) while the SPHERE observations require several intervals of $\beta$
values. We discuss the nature of the halo previously reported in ALMA
observations, and hypothesize it could be caused by over-abundant $\mu$m-sized
particles (the over-abundance being the consequence of their extended
lifetime). We model the polarized phase function at near-infrared wavelengths
and fluffy aggregates larger than a few $\mu$m provide the best solution.
Comparing our results with comets of the solar system, we postulate that the
particles released in the disk originate from rather pristine cometary bodies
(to avoid compaction of the fluffy aggregates) and are then set on highly
eccentric orbits, which could explain the halo detected at long wavelengths.

justified and provides more accurate predictions than the earlier version,
CuspCore I (Freundlich et al. 2020). The CuspCore model assumes an
instantaneous change of potential, followed by a relaxation to a new Jeans
equilibrium. The relaxation turns out to be violent relaxation during the first
orbital period, followed by phase mixing. By tracing the energy diffusion
dE=dU(r) iteratively, the model reproduces the simulated DM profiles with ~10%
accuracy or better. A method based on adiabatic invariants shows similar
precision for moderate mass change but underestimates the DM expansion for
strong gas ejection. A method based on a simple empirical relation between DM
and total mass ratios makes slightly inferior predictions. The crude assumption
used in CuspCore I, of energy conservation for shells that encompass a fixed DM
mass, turns out to underestimate the DM response, which can be partially
remedied by introducing an alternative ""energy"" definition. Our model is being
generalized to address the differential response of a multi-component system of

by the partial ejection of a binary star's common envelope (CE) and the merger
of its components. The formation of the CE is likely to occur during unstable
mass transfer, initiated by a primary star which is evolving off the main
sequence (a Hertzsprung gap star) and a lower mass companion. In agreement with
observations, theoretical studies have shown that outflows from the pre-CE
phase produce a detectable brightening of the progenitor system a few years
before the ejection event. Based on these assumptions, we present a method to
identify Galactic LRNe precursors, the resulting precursor candidates, and our
follow-up analysis to uncover their nature. We begin by constructing a sample
of progenitor systems, i.e. Hertzsprung gap stars, by statistically modelling
the density of a colour magnitude diagram formed from ""well behaved"" Gaia DR2
sources. Their time-domain evolution from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
survey is used to search for slowly brightening events, as pre-CE precursor
candidates. The nature of the resulting candidates is further investigated
using archival data and our own spectroscopic follow-up. Overall, we
constructed a sample of $\sim5.4\times{10^4}$ progenitor sources, from which 21
were identified as candidate LRNe precursors. Further analysis revealed 16 of
our candidates to be H$\alpha$ emitters, with their spectra often suggesting
hotter (albeit moderately extincted) A-type or B-type stars. Because of their
long-term variability in optical and mid-infrared wavelengths, we propose that
many of our candidates are mass-transferring binaries with compact companions
surrounded by dusty circumstellar disks or alternatively magnetically active

current limiters (SCFCLs) are a pivotal tool for limiting fault currents rise
in power networks that have good performance characteristics. In a normal

limit short circuit currents when occur. In this chapter, various structures of
SCFCLs with different arrangements of ac windings & dc windings are presented
and the currents passing through the FCLs under the normal and faulty system
conditions are assessed and compared. The flux density in various regions of
the core in different arrangements has been investigated as well and the

nonconvex and nonsmooth problems often encountered in practice. In this paper,
we initialize a systematic stability and generalization analysis of stochastic

further extended to study the gap between the Moreau envelope of the empirical

$X$ injected at the nodes are extraneous to the network dynamics. In several
practical systems, the network structure is often unknown and needs to be
estimated from data. Towards this, one has access to samples of the node
potentials $Y$, but only the statistics of the node injections $X$. Motivated
by this important problem, we study the estimation of the sparsity structure of
the matrix $B^{*}$ from $n$ samples of $Y$ under the assumption that the node
injections $X$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance
$\Sigma_X$. We propose a new $\ell_{1}$-regularized maximum likelihood

problem is convex in the objective and admits a unique solution. Under a new
mutual incoherence condition, we establish sufficient conditions on the triple
$(n,p,d)$ for which exact sparsity recovery of $B^{*}$ is possible with high
probability; $d$ is the degree of the graph. We also establish guarantees for

exoplanets have been found, despite numerous searches among the many known

examine the hypothesis that dissipation of energy by tides in Trojan planets is
preventing their survival.
  The Appendix of this paper generalizes the conventional theory of tides to
include tidal forces independent of dissipation, as well as the effects of one
body on tides raised by another. The main text applies this theory to a model
system consisting of a primary of stellar mass, a secondary of sub-stellar mass
in a circular orbit about the primary, and a much lighter Trojan planet
librating with small amplitude about an equilateral point of the system.
  Next, we linearize the equations of motion about the Trojan points, including
the tidal forces, and solve for the motion of the Trojan. The results indicate
that tides damp out the Trojan's motion perpendicular to the orbital plane of
the primary and secondary, as well as its epicycles due to its eccentricity;
but they pump up the amplitude of its tadpole librations exponentially. We then
verify our analytic solutions by integrating the non-linearized equations of
motion numerically for several sample cases. In each case, we find that the
librations grow until the Trojan escapes its libration, which leads to a close
encounter with either the primary or the secondary.

jointly embedded in a metric space such that voters rank candidates that are
closer to them higher. A voting rule's purpose is to pick a candidate with
minimum total distance to the voters, given only the rankings, but not the
actual distances. As a result, in the worst case, each deterministic rule picks
a candidate whose total distance is at least three times larger than that of an
optimal one, i.e., has distortion at least 3. A recent breakthrough result
showed that achieving this bound of 3 is possible; however, the proof is
non-constructive, and the voting rule itself is a complicated exhaustive
search.
  Our main result is an extremely simple voting rule, called Plurality Veto,
which achieves the same optimal distortion of 3. Each candidate starts with a
score equal to his number of first-place votes. These scores are then gradually
decreased via an n-round veto process in which a candidate drops out when his
score reaches zero. One after the other, voters decrement the score of their
bottom choice among the standing candidates, and the last standing candidate
wins. We give a one-paragraph proof that this voting rule achieves distortion
3. This rule is also immensely practical, and it only makes two queries to each
voter, so it has low communication overhead.
  We also generalize Plurality Veto into a class of randomized voting rules in
the following way: Plurality veto is run only for k < n rounds; then, a
candidate is chosen with probability proportional to his residual score. This
general rule interpolates between Random Dictatorship (for k=0) and Plurality
Veto (for k=n-1), and k controls the variance of the output. We show that for
all k, this rule has distortion at most 3.

of influence in the form of a game currency. Agents attempt to have an opinion
that is a majority at the end of the game, to obtain a reward also paid in the
game currency. At the beginning of each round, a randomly selected agent is
selected, referred to as a speaker. The second agent is selected in the radius
of speaker influence (which is a set subset of the speaker's neighbors) to
interact with the speaker as a listener. In this interaction, the speaker
proposes a payoff in the game currency from their personal influence budget to
persuade the listener to hold the speaker's opinion in future rounds until
chosen listener again. The listener can either choose to accept or reject this
payoff to hold the speaker's opinion for future rounds. The listener's choice
is informed only by their estimate of global majority opinion through a limited

spanning trees of the graph $G$, it must have the least average inter-vertex
pair (shortest path) distances from amongst the members of the set
$\mathcal{T}(G)$. Similarly, for it to be considered $T^\#(G)$, it must have
the highest average inter-vertex pair (shortest path) distances. In this work,
we present an iteratively greedy rank-and-regress method that produces at least
one $T^*(G)$ or $T^\#(G)$ by eliminating one extremal edge per iteration. The
rank function for performing the elimination is based on the elements of the

main finding is a $1/\tau^2$ scaling of the excess work for large $\tau$ in
gapped systems. This result is at odds with the $1/\tau$ prediction of the
geometric approach to optimization, which is predicated on the slow evolution
of open systems close to canonical equilibrium. In contrast, our approach does
not lead to an obvious geometric interpretation. Furthermore, as the
thermodynamic work does not depend on how an isolated quantum system is split
into a system of interest and its environment, our results imply the failure of
the geometric approach prediction even for open systems. Additionally, we
provide alternative optimization procedures, both for slowly-varying processes
described by adiabatic perturbation theory and for weakly-varying processes
described by linear response theory. Our findings are benchmarked and confirmed
through the application to the driven transverse-field Ising chain.

states. In many circumstances the nuclear singlet order, defined as the
difference between the singlet population and the mean of the triplet
populations, is a long-lived state which persists for a relatively long time in
solution. Various methods have been proposed for generating singlet order,
starting from nuclear magnetization. This requires the stimulation of
singlet-to-triplet transitions by modulated radiofrequency fields. We show that
a recently described pulse sequence, known as PulsePol (Schwartz $\textit{et
al.}$, Science Advances, $\textbf{4}$, eaat8978 (2018) and arXiv:1710.01508),
is an efficient technique for converting magnetization into long-lived singlet
order. We show that the operation of this pulse sequence may be understood by
adapting the theory of symmetry-based recoupling sequences in
magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR. The concept of riffling allows PulsePol
to be interpreted using the theory of symmetry-based pulse sequences, and
explains its robustness. This theory is used to derive a range of new pulse
sequences for performing singlet-triplet excitation and conversion in solution
NMR. Schemes for further enhancing the robustness of the transformations are
demonstrated.

This paper proposes TriHorn-Net, a novel model that uses specific innovations

is the decomposition of the 3D hand pose estimation into the estimation of 2D
joint locations in the depth image space (UV), and the estimation of their
corresponding depths aided by two complementary attention maps. This
decomposition prevents depth estimation, which is a more difficult task, from
interfering with the UV estimations at both the prediction and feature levels.
The second innovation is PixDropout, which is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first appearance-based data augmentation method for hand depth images.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the

complexity, especially when queries are costly. We propose a novel gradient
estimation technique for ZO methods based on adaptive lazy queries that we term
as LAZO. Different from the classic one-point or two-point gradient estimation
methods, LAZO develops two alternative ways to check the usefulness of old
queries from previous iterations, and then adaptively reuses them to construct
the low-variance gradient estimates. We rigorously establish that through
judiciously reusing the old queries, LAZO can reduce the variance of stochastic
gradient estimates so that it not only saves queries per iteration but also
achieves the regret bound for the symmetric two-point method. We evaluate the
numerical performance of LAZO, and demonstrate the low-variance property and
the performance gain of LAZO in both regret and query complexity relative to
several existing ZO methods. The idea of LAZO is general, and can be applied to
other variants of ZO methods.

(LQBHs), recently derived by Alesci, Bahrami and Pranzetti (ABP). To understand
the structure of the model, we first derive several well-known LQBH solutions
by taking proper limits. These include the B\""ohmer-Vandersloot and
Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh models, which were all obtained by the so-called
bottom-up polymerizations within the framework of the minisuperspace
quantizations. Then, we study the ABP model, and find that the inverse volume
corrections become important only when the radius of the two-sphere is of the
Planck size. For macroscopic black holes, the minimal radius obtained at the
transition surface is always much larger than the Planck scale, and hence these
corrections are always sub-leading. The transition surface divides the whole
spacetime into two regions, and in one of them the spacetime is asymptotically
Schwarzschild-like, while in the other region, the asymptotical behavior
sensitively depends on the ratio of two spin numbers involved in the model, and
can be divided into three different classes. In one class, the spacetime in the
2-planes orthogonal to the two spheres is asymptotically flat, and in the
second one it is not even conformally flat, while in the third one it can be
asymptotically conformally flat by properly choosing the free parameters of the
model. In the latter, it is asymptotically de Sitter. However, in any of these
three classes, sharply in contrast to the models obtained by the bottom-up
approach, the spacetime is already geodesically complete, and no additional
extensions are needed in both sides of the transition surface. In particular,
identical multiple black hole and white hole structures do not exist.

quantitative estimate of systematic uncertainties originating from the atomic
data used in plasma codes. Though there have been several studies looking into
atomic data uncertainties using theoretical calculations, in general, there is
no commonly accepted solution for this task. We present a new approach for
estimating uncertainties in the line emissivities for the current models of
collisional plasma, mainly based upon dedicated analysis of observed high
resolution spectra of stellar coronae and galaxy clusters. We find that the
systematic uncertainties of the observed lines consistently show
anti-correlation with the model line fluxes, after properly accounting for the
additional uncertainties from the ion concentration calculation. The strong
lines in the spectra are in general better reproduced, indicating that the
atomic data and modeling of the main transitions are more accurate than those
for the minor ones. This underlying anti-correlation is found to be roughly
independent on source properties, line positions, ion species, and the line
formation processes. We further apply our method to the simulated XRISM and
Athena observations of collisional plasma sources and discuss the impact of
uncertainties on the interpretation of these spectra. The typical uncertainties
are 1-2% on temperature and 3-20% on abundances of O, Ne, Fe, Mg, and Ni.

DP-Adam, DP-LAMB and many others. The automatic variants are as private and
computationally efficient as existing DP optimizers, but require no DP-specific
hyperparameters and thus make DP training as amenable as the standard
non-private training. We give a rigorous convergence analysis of automatic
DP-SGD in the non-convex setting, which shows that it enjoys an asymptotic
convergence rate that matches the standard SGD. We also demonstrate on various
language and vision tasks that automatic clipping outperforms or matches the
state-of-the-art, and can be easily employed with minimal changes to existing
codebases.

To accelerate training, we introduce Reducible Holdout Loss Selection
(RHO-LOSS), a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those
points for training that most reduce the model's generalization loss. As a
result, RHO-LOSS mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods:
techniques from the optimization literature typically select 'hard' (e.g. high
loss) points, but such points are often noisy (not learnable) or less
task-relevant. Conversely, curriculum learning prioritizes 'easy' points, but
such points need not be trained on once learned. In contrast, RHO-LOSS selects
points that are learnable, worth learning, and not yet learnt. RHO-LOSS trains
in far fewer steps than prior art, improves accuracy, and speeds up training on
a wide range of datasets, hyperparameters, and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and
BERT). On the large web-scraped image dataset Clothing-1M, RHO-LOSS trains in
18x fewer steps and reaches 2% higher final accuracy than uniform data

detailed modelling of the intrinsic emission of X-ray pulsars. Combining our
results with the optical polarimetric data, we find that the spin axis of the

discrete actions of $G$ on complexes, quasi-isometry invariance of certain

  $\bullet$ if each subgroup $H\in \mathcal H$ is compactly presented, then $G$

$(G, \mathcal H)$ based on Bowditch's work using discrete actions on hyperbolic
fine graphs. For example, we prove that if $G$ is hyperbolic relative to

applications of the results of the article we prove combination results for
coherent topological groups with a compact open subgroup, and extend

alternative method of broadband beamforming that uses a set of linear

susceptible to adversarial examples and have unstable gradients which hinders
interpretability. However, existing methods to solve these issues, such as
adversarial training, are expensive and often sacrifice predictive accuracy.
  In this work, we consider curvature, which is a mathematical quantity which
encodes the degree of non-linearity. Using this, we demonstrate low-curvature
neural networks (LCNNs) that obtain drastically lower curvature than standard
models while exhibiting similar predictive performance, which leads to improved
robustness and stable gradients, with only a marginally increased training
time. To achieve this, we minimize a data-independent upper bound on the
curvature of a neural network, which decomposes overall curvature in terms of
curvatures and slopes of its constituent layers. To efficiently minimize this
bound, we introduce two novel architectural components: first, a non-linearity
called centered-softplus that is a stable variant of the softplus
non-linearity, and second, a Lipschitz-constrained batch normalization layer.
  Our experiments show that LCNNs have lower curvature, more stable gradients
and increased off-the-shelf adversarial robustness when compared to their
standard high-curvature counterparts, all without affecting predictive
performance. Our approach is easy to use and can be readily incorporated into

physical sensing in the most general form. Further, we introduce the notions of
attack effectiveness and stealthiness that are independent of the employed AD;
i.e., the attack remaining stealthy even from the best existing detectors. In
such setting, we consider attacks with different levels of runtime knowledge
about the plant and its states. We find sufficient conditions for existence of
stealthy effective attacks that force the plant state into an unsafe region
without being detected by any employed AD. We show that as the open-loop
unstable plant dynamics diverges faster and the closed-loop system converges
faster to an equilibrium point, the system will be more vulnerable to effective
stealthy attacks. Specifically, we show that depending on runtime information
available to the attacker, the probability of attack remaining stealthy
(against any AD) can be arbitrarily close to one, if the attackers estimate of
the plant state is arbitrarily close to the true plant state.

four geometric measures to predict topological entanglements: local curvature,

its application scope. In practice, each clinical site may only annotate

Incorporating such partially labeled data into a unified federation is an

the challenge by using a novel federated multi-encoding U-Net (Fed-MENU) method

sub-networks. Each sub-network can be seen as an expert of a specific organ and
trained for that client. Moreover, to encourage the organ-specific features
extracted by different sub-networks to be informative and distinctive, we
regularize the training of the MENU-Net by designing an auxiliary generic
decoder (AGD). Extensive experiments on six public abdominal CT datasets show
that our Fed-MENU method can effectively obtain a federated learning model

components: the initiation of the slope failure and the post-failure runout.
The Finite Element Method (FEM) excels at modeling the initiation of
instability but quickly loses accuracy in modeling large-deformation problems
due to mesh distortion. Hence, the FEM is unable to accurately model
post-failure slope runout. Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian methods, such as the
Material Point Method (MPM), offer a promising alternative for solving
large-deformation problems, because particles can move freely across a
background mesh, allowing for large deformation without computational issues.
However, the use of moving material points in MPM for integration rather than
the fixed Gauss points of the FEM reduces the accuracy of MPM in predicting
stress distribution and thus failure initiation. We have created a hybrid
method by initiating a failure simulation in FEM and subsequently transferring
the coordinates, velocities, and stresses to MPM particles to model the runout
behavior, combining the strength of both methods. We demonstrate the capability
of the hybrid approach by simulating the collapse of a frictional granular
column, comparing it to an empirical solution, and evaluating a suitable time
to transfer from FEM to MPM by trialing multiple iterations with transfers at
different stages of the collapse.

exponential space in terms of pathwidth and by extension treewidth. These

we study how well state-of-the-art machine learning models can automatically
detect common link types. We found that a pure BERT model trained on titles and

learning models, achieving an encouraging average macro F1-score of 0.64 for
detecting 9 popular link types across all repositories (weighted F1-score of
0.73). For the specific Subtask- and Epic- links, the model achieved top
F1-scores of 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. Our model does not simply learn the

improve the prediction accuracy with a strong negative correlation of -0.70. We
found that Relate-links often get confused with the other links, which suggests
that they are likely used as default links in unclear cases. We also observed
significant differences across the repositories, depending on how they are used

$^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr isobar collisions to scrutinize the expansion dynamics of
the quark-gluon plasma, where the initial geometry perturbations are sourced by
the differences in deformations and radial profiles between $^{96}$Ru and
$^{96}$Zr, and the collective response is captured by the change in anisotropic
flow $V_n$ between the two collision systems. Using a transport model, we
analyze how the nonlinear coupling between lower-order flow harmonics $V_2$ and
$V_3$ to the higher-order flow harmonics $V_4$ and $V_5$, expected to scale as
$V_{4\mathrm{NL}}=\chi_4 V_2^2$ and $V_{5\mathrm{NL}}=\chi_5 V_2V_3$, gets
modified as one moves from $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru to $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr systems.
We find that these scaling relations are valid to a high precision: variations
of order 20% in $V_{4\mathrm{NL}}$ and $V_{5\mathrm{NL}}$ due to differences in
quadrupole deformation, octupole deformation and nuclear skin modify $\chi_{4}$

collisions of isobars with different nuclear structure are an unique tool to

lightweight functional translation. We leverage Rust's rich region-based type
system to eliminate memory reasoning for many Rust programs, as long as they do
not rely on interior mutability or unsafe code. Doing so, we relieve the proof
engineer of the burden of memory-based reasoning, allowing them to instead
focus on functional properties of their code.
  Our first contribution is a new approach to borrows and controlled aliasing.
We propose a pure, functional semantics for LLBC, a Low-Level Borrow Calculus
that captures a large subset of Rust programs. Our semantics is value-based,
meaning there is no notion of memory, addresses or pointer arithmetic. Our
semantics is also ownership-centric, meaning that we enforce soundness of
borrows via a semantic criterion based on loans rather than through a syntactic
type-based lifetime discipline. We claim that our semantics captures the
essence of the borrow mechanism rather than its current implementation in the
Rust compiler.
  Our second contribution is a translation from LLBC to a pure lambda-calculus.
This allows the user to reason about the original Rust program through the
theorem prover of their choice. To deal with the well-known technical
difficulty of terminating a borrow, we rely on a novel approach, in which we
approximate the borrow graph in the presence of function calls. This in turn
allows us to perform the translation using a new technical device called
backward functions.
  We implement our toolchain in a mixture of Rust and OCaml. Our evaluation
shows significant gains of verification productivity for the programmer.
  Rust goes to great lengths to enforce static control of aliasing; the proof
engineer should not waste any time on memory reasoning when so much already
comes ""for free""!

disperse tens of kilometers in the ocean between salmon farms, leading to
connected sea lice populations that are difficult to control in isolation. In
this paper we develop a simple analytical model for the dispersal of sea lice
between two salmon farms. From the model we calculate the arrival time
distribution of sea lice dispersing between farms, as well as the level of
cross-infection of sea lice. We also use numerical flows from a hydrodynamic

arrival time of sea lice dispersing between two farms in the Broughton

of a pure WC is determined by tunneling processes that induce multi-spin
ring-exchange interactions, resulting in fully polarized ferromagnetism for
large enough $r_s$. Recently, Hossain et al. [PNAS 117 (51) 32244-32250]
reported the occurrence of a fully polarized ferromagnetic insulator at $r_s

larger than the predicted exchange energies for the pure WC. Here, we analyze
the large $r_s$ dynamics of an interstitial defect in the WC, and show that it

processes are dominant, which favor a large, fully polarized ferromagnetic
polaron. Based on the above results, we speculate concerning the phenomenology

fundamental optimization methods in machine learning such as linear programs

models, they are not easy to understand in terms of relationships between
inputs and outputs. As a linear program only provides the optimal solution to
an optimization problem, further explanations are often helpful. In this work,
we extend the attribution methods for explaining neural networks to linear
programs. These methods explain the model by providing relevance scores for the
model inputs, to show the influence of each input on the output. Alongside
using classical gradient-based attribution methods we also propose a way to
adapt perturbation-based attribution methods to LPs. Our evaluations of several
different linear and integer problems showed that attribution methods can
generate useful explanations for linear programs. However, we also demonstrate
that using a neural attribution method directly might come with some drawbacks,
as the properties of these methods on neural networks do not necessarily
transfer to linear programs. The methods can also struggle if a linear program
has more than one optimal solution, as a solver just returns one possible
solution. Our results can hopefully be used as a good starting point for

outliers among the weaker flare instances. Several experiments are carried out

  Classification","Presented at Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair

signals to pre-recorded ones to classify them. However, this comparison
typically needs to ignore differences due to signal noise, temporal offset,
signal magnitude, and other external factors. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
algorithm quantifies this similarity by finding corresponding regions between
the signals and non-linearly warping one signal by stretching and shrinking it.
Unfortunately, searching through all ""warps"" of a signal to find the best
corresponding regions is computationally expensive. The FastDTW algorithm
improves performance, but sacrifices accuracy by only considering small signal
warps.
  My goal is to improve the speed of DTW while maintaining high accuracy. My
key insight is that in any particular application domain, signals exhibit
specific types of variation. For example, the accelerometer signal measured for
two different people would differ based on their stride length and weight. My
system, called Machine Learning DTW (MLDTW), uses machine learning to learn the
types of warps that are common in a particular domain. It then uses the learned
model to improve DTW performance by limiting the search of potential warps
appropriately. My results show that compared to FastDTW, MLDTW is at least as
fast and reduces errors by 60% on average across four different data sets.
These improvements will significantly impact a wide variety of applications
(e.g. health monitoring) and enable more scalable processing of multivariate,
higher frequency, and longer signal recordings.

further examines the effect of basic competition on the role of the crowd

expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The
selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which
are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using
black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of

promising alternative to its more popular binary counterpart through larger,

transmons have readily addressable higher levels, making them natural
candidates for operation as quantum three-level systems (qutrits). Recent works
in transmon devices have realized high fidelity single qutrit operation.
Nonetheless, effectively engineering a high-fidelity two-qutrit entanglement

flexible, microwave-activated, and dynamic cross-Kerr entanglement between two
fixed-frequency transmon qutrits, expanding on work performed for the $ZZ$

enables fast reconstruction of undersampled MR images and has achieved
state-of-the-art performance for Cartesian k-space trajectories. However,
non-Cartesian trajectories such as the radial trajectory need to be transformed
onto a Cartesian grid in each iteration of the network training, slowing down
the training process and posing inconvenience and delay during training.
Multiple iterations of nonuniform Fourier transform in the networks offset the
deep learning advantage of fast inference. Current approaches typically either
work on image-to-image networks or grid the non-Cartesian trajectories before
the network training to avoid the repeated gridding process. However, the
image-to-image networks cannot ensure the k-space data consistency in the
reconstructed images and the pre-processing of non-Cartesian k-space leads to
gridding errors which cannot be compensated by the network training. Inspired
by the Transformer network to handle long-range dependencies in sequence
transduction tasks, we propose to rearrange the radial spokes to sequential
data based on the chronological order of acquisition and use the Transformer to
predict unacquired radial spokes from acquired ones. We propose novel data
augmentation methods to generate a large amount of training data from a limited
number of subjects. The network can be generated to different anatomical
structures. Experimental results show superior performance of the proposed
framework compared to state-of-the-art deep neural networks.

boundedness or stability of multidimensional nonlinear systems with
time-dependent nonperiodic coefficients-an essential task in various
engineering and natural science applications. Known approaches to assessing the
stability of such systems rest on the utility of Lyapunov functions and
Lyapunov first approximation methodologies, typically providing conservative
and computationally elaborate criteria for multidimensional systems of this
category. Adequate criteria of boundedness of solutions to nonhomogeneous
systems of this kind are rare in the contemporary literature. Lately, we
develop a new approach to these problems which rests on bounding the evolution
of the norms of solutions to initial systems by matching solutions of a scalar
auxiliary equation we introduced in [1], [2] and [3]. Still, the technique
advanced in [3] rests on the assumption that the average of the linear
components of the underlying system is defined by a stable matrix of general
position. The current paper substantially amplifies the application domain of
this approach. It is merely assumed that the time-dependent linear block of the
underlying system can be split into slow and fast varying components by
application of any smoothing technique. This dichotomy of temporal scales is
determined by the optimal criterion reducing the conservatism of our estimates.
In turn, we transform the linear subsystem with slow-varying matrix in a
diagonally dominant form by successive applications of the Lyapunov transforms.
This prompts the development of novel scalar auxiliary equations embracing the
estimation of the norms of solutions to our initial systems. Next, we formulate
boundedness or stability criteria and estimate the relevant regions of the
underlying systems using analytical and abridged numerical reasoning.

the lack of data, astrochemical models usually assume a simple scaling
relation, Esd = fEdes, where f is a constant, irrespective of adsorbed species.
Here, we experimentally measure Esd for CH4, H2S, OCS, CH3OH, and CH3CN on
water-ice surfaces using an ultra-high-vacuum transmission electron microscope
(UHV-TEM). Compiling the measured Esd values and Edes values from the
literature, we find that the value of f ranges from ~0.2 to ~0.7, depending on
the species. Unless f (or Esd) for the majority of species is available, a
natural alternative approach for astrochemical models is running multiple
simulations, varying f for each species randomly. In this approach, ranges of
molecular abundances predicted by multiple simulations, rather than abundances
predicted by each simulation, are important. We here run 10,000 simulations of
astrochemical models of molecular clouds and protostellar envelopes, randomly
assigning a value of f for each species. In the former case, we identify
several key species whose Esd most strongly affects the uncertainties of the
model predictions; Esd for those species should be investigated in future
laboratory and quantum chemical studies. In the latter case, uncertainties in
the Esd of many species contribute to the uncertainties in the model
predictions.

study the chemical properties of the Galactic bulge, focusing on the
metallicity difference between stars on the near side (in front of the Galactic

certain sight lines the near side is more metal-rich than the far side,
consistent with the negative vertical metallicity gradient of the disk, since
the far side is located higher above the disk plane than the near side.
However, at the region $l<0^\circ$ and $|b|\le6^\circ$, the near side is even
more metal-poor than the far side, and their difference changes with the
Galactic longitude. This is mainly due to the fact that stars around the minor
axis of the bar are more metal-poor than those around the major axis. Since the
bar is tilted, in the negative longitude region, the near side is mainly
contributed by stars close to the minor axis region than the far side to result
in such metallicity difference. We extract stars in the X-shape structure by
identifying the overdensities in the near and far sides. Their metallicity
properties are consistent with the results of the whole Galactic bulge. The
boxy/peanut-shaped bulge can naturally explain the metallicity difference of
the double red clump stars in observation. There is no need to involve a
classical bulge component with different stellar populations.

privacy-utility tradeoffs. Researchers primarily operate from a privacy first
perspective, setting strict privacy requirements and minimizing risk subject to
these constraints. Practitioners often desire an accuracy first perspective,
possibly satisfied with the greatest privacy they can get subject to obtaining
sufficiently small error. Ligett et al. have introduced a ""noise reduction""
algorithm to address the latter perspective. The authors show that by adding
correlated Laplace noise and progressively reducing it on demand, it is
possible to produce a sequence of increasingly accurate estimates of a private
parameter while only paying a privacy cost for the least noisy iterate
released. In this work, we generalize noise reduction to the setting of
Gaussian noise, introducing the Brownian mechanism. The Brownian mechanism
works by first adding Gaussian noise of high variance corresponding to the
final point of a simulated Brownian motion. Then, at the practitioner's
discretion, noise is gradually decreased by tracing back along the Brownian
path to an earlier time. Our mechanism is more naturally applicable to the
common setting of bounded $\ell_2$-sensitivity, empirically outperforms
existing work on common statistical tasks, and provides customizable control of
privacy loss over the entire interaction with the practitioner. We complement
our Brownian mechanism with ReducedAboveThreshold, a generalization of the
classical AboveThreshold algorithm that provides adaptive privacy guarantees.

nonadiabatic critical ionization fraction that substantially extends the
maximum phase-matched high-harmonic photon energy, that arises due to strong
reshaping of the intense driving laser field. We validate this understanding
through a systematic comparison between experiment and theory, for a wide range
of pulse durations and driving laser wavelengths. In particular, high harmonics
driven by intense few-cycle pulses experience the most pronounced spectral
reshaping, significantly extending the bright photon energy range. We also
present an analytical model that predicts the spectral extension that can be

computation primitive in many real-world applications. Due to SpGEMM's inherent
irregularity and the vast diversity of its input matrices, developing
high-performance SpGEMM implementation on modern processors such as GPUs is
challenging. The state-of-the-art SpGEMM libraries (i.e., $nsparse$ and
$spECK$) adopt several algorithms to tackle the challenges of global load
balance, local load balance, and allocation of the result matrix. While these
libraries focus on the high-level algorithm design for SpGEMM, they neglect
several low-level architecture-specific optimizations, which causes inefficient
implementations in their libraries. In this paper, we classify their
inefficient implementations into seven categories. Based on our observations,
we propose a highly optimized SpGEMM library called $OpSparse$. The
optimizations in $OpSparse$ include 1) optimizing the binning method by
improving the utilization of the shared memory, 2) optimizing the hashing
method by reducing the access to the hash table, 3) improving the trade-off
between hash collision rate and hardware utilization in the hashing method by
setting appropriate binning ranges, 4) reducing the overheads of global memory
utilization by minimizing the global memory usage of the metadata, and 5)
improving the execution parallelism by overlapping global memory allocation
with kernel execution. Performance evaluations with 26 commonly used matrices
on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU show that $OpSparse$ achieves up to $27.8\times$,
$1.81\times$, and $2.04\times$ performance speedup over three state-of-the-art

have noted that the rankings not only affect the satisfaction of the users

the ranking allocates exposure -- and thus economic opportunity -- to the
ranked items (e.g., articles, products, songs, job seekers, restaurants,
hotels). This has raised questions of fairness to the items, and most existing
works have addressed fairness by explicitly linking item exposure to item
relevance. However, we argue that any particular choice of such a link function
may be difficult to defend, and we show that the resulting rankings can still
be unfair. To avoid these shortcomings, we develop a new axiomatic approach
that is rooted in principles of fair division. This not only avoids the need to
choose a link function, but also more meaningfully quantifies the impact on the
items beyond exposure. Our axioms of envy-freeness and dominance over uniform
ranking postulate that for a fair ranking policy every item should prefer their
own rank allocation over that of any other item, and that no item should be
actively disadvantaged by the rankings. To compute ranking policies that are
fair according to these axioms, we propose a new ranking objective related to
the Nash Social Welfare. We show that the solution has guarantees regarding its
envy-freeness, its dominance over uniform rankings for every item, and its
Pareto optimality. In contrast, we show that conventional exposure-based
fairness can produce large amounts of envy and have a highly disparate impact
on the items. Beyond these theoretical results, we illustrate empirically how

overturning circulation on dry, tidally-locked rocky planets without the
condensation of water vapor or other species. We find that the main driving
process is the radiative cooling of CO2 (or other non-condensable greenhouse
gases) rather than CO2 greenhouse warming or stellar radiation. Stellar
radiation is the ultimate mechanism but not the direct mechanism. Due to the
combination of the uneven distribution in the stellar radiation and effective
horizontal energy transports in the free troposphere, there is strong
temperature inversion in the area away from the substellar region. This
inversion makes CO2 to have a radiative cooling effect rather than a radiative
warming effect for the atmosphere, same as that in the stratosphere of Earth's
atmosphere. This cooling effect produces negative buoyancy and drives
large-scale downwelling, supporting the formation of a global-scale overturning
circulation. If CO2 is excluded from the atmosphere, the overturning
circulation becomes very weak, regardless the level of stellar radiation. This
mechanism is completely different from that for the atmospheric overturning
circulation on Earth or on moist, tidally-locked rocky planets, where latent
heat release and/or baroclinic instability are the dominated mechanisms. Our
study improves the understanding of the atmospheric circulation on
tidally-locked exoplanets and also on other dry planets, such as Venus and Mars

serving as the go-to optimization algorithm for a diverse array of problems.
While the empirical success of SGD is often attributed to its computational
efficiency and favorable generalization behavior, neither effect is well
understood and disentangling them remains an open problem. Even in the simple
setting of convex quadratic problems, worst-case analyses give an asymptotic
convergence rate for SGD that is no better than full-batch gradient descent
(GD), and the purported implicit regularization effects of SGD lack a precise
explanation. In this work, we study the dynamics of multi-pass SGD on
high-dimensional convex quadratics and establish an asymptotic equivalence to a
stochastic differential equation, which we call homogenized stochastic gradient
descent (HSGD), whose solutions we characterize explicitly in terms of a
Volterra integral equation. These results yield precise formulas for the
learning and risk trajectories, which reveal a mechanism of implicit
conditioning that explains the efficiency of SGD relative to GD. We also prove
that the noise from SGD negatively impacts generalization performance, ruling
out the possibility of any type of implicit regularization in this context.
Finally, we show how to adapt the HSGD formalism to include streaming SGD,
which allows us to produce an exact prediction for the excess risk of
multi-pass SGD relative to that of streaming SGD (bootstrap risk).

image collections can generate multiview images of novel instances. The key
underpinnings to achieve this are a 3D radiance field generator and a volume
rendering process. However, existing methods either cannot generate
high-resolution images (e.g., up to 256X256) due to the high computation cost
of neural volume rendering, or rely on 2D CNNs for image-space upsampling which
jeopardizes the 3D consistency across different views. This paper proposes a
novel 3D-aware GAN that can generate high resolution images (up to 1024X1024)
while keeping strict 3D consistency as in volume rendering. Our motivation is
to achieve super-resolution directly in the 3D space to preserve 3D
consistency. We avoid the otherwise prohibitively-expensive computation cost by
applying 2D convolutions on a set of 2D radiance manifolds defined in the
recent generative radiance manifold (GRAM) approach, and apply dedicated loss
functions for effective GAN training at high resolution. Experiments on FFHQ
and AFHQv2 datasets show that our method can produce high-quality 3D-consistent
results that significantly outperform existing methods.

where the noise among different tasks is correlated, in the moderately high
dimensional regime where sample size $n$ and dimension $p$ are of the same
order. Our goal is to estimate the covariance matrix of the noise random
vectors, or equivalently the correlation of the noise variables on any pair of
two tasks. Treating the regression coefficients as a nuisance parameter, we
leverage the multi-task elastic-net and multi-task lasso estimators to estimate
the nuisance. By precisely understanding the bias of the squared residual
matrix and by correcting this bias, we develop a novel estimator of the noise
covariance that converges in Frobenius norm at the rate $n^{-1/2}$ when the
covariates are Gaussian. This novel estimator is efficiently computable.
  Under suitable conditions, the proposed estimator of the noise covariance
attains the same rate of convergence as the ""oracle"" estimator that knows in
advance the regression coefficients of the multi-task model. The Frobenius
error bounds obtained in this paper also illustrate the advantage of this new
estimator compared to a method-of-moments estimator that does not attempt to
estimate the nuisance.
  As a byproduct of our techniques, we obtain an estimate of the generalization
error of the multi-task elastic-net and multi-task lasso estimators. Extensive
simulation studies are carried out to illustrate the numerical performance of
the proposed method.

Numerous sensors for measuring the greenhouse parameters will be mounted on the

The microchip will collect and process data from sensors, transmit to the
cloud, and give commands to the actuators. The soil and climate parameters like
temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, pH will be measured
periodically. When the parameters are not within a specified range, the

knowledge of channel state information (CSI), and has been hindered by the
heavy overhead of channel training, estimation, and feedback in fast-changing

maximizing the average achievable rate (AAR) of IRS-assisted MIMO systems,
where the IRS is configured relatively infrequently based on statistical CSI
(S-CSI) and the base station precoder and power allocation are updated
frequently based on quickly outdated instantaneous CSI (I-CSI). The key idea is
that we first reveal the optimal small-timescale power allocation based on
outdated I-CSI yields a water-filling structure. Given the optimal power
allocation, a new mini-batch sampling (mbs)- based particle swarm optimization
(PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the large-timescale IRS configuration
with reduced channel samples. Another important aspect is that we develop a
model-driven PSO algorithm to optimize the IRS configuration, which maximizes a
lower bound of the AAR by only using the S-CSI and eliminates the need of
channel samples. The modeldriven PSO serves as a dependable lower bound for the
mbs-PSO. Simulations corroborate the superiority of the new two-timescale
beamforming strategy to its alternatives in terms of the AAR and efficiency,

the presence of noisy labels is becoming an important challenge in modern deep
learning. While existing methods address this problem in various directions,
they still produce unpredictable sub-optimal results since they rely on the
posterior information estimated by the feature extractor corrupted by noisy
labels. Lipschitz regularization successfully alleviates this problem by
training a robust feature extractor, but it requires longer training time and
expensive computations. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective
method, called ALASCA, which efficiently provides a robust feature extractor
under label noise. ALASCA integrates two key ingredients: (1) adaptive label
smoothing based on our theoretical analysis that label smoothing implicitly
induces Lipschitz regularization, and (2) auxiliary classifiers that enable
practical application of intermediate Lipschitz regularization with negligible
computations. We conduct wide-ranging experiments for ALASCA and combine our
proposed method with previous noise-robust methods on several synthetic and
real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our framework consistently
improves the robustness of feature extractors and the performance of existing

recurrent neural networks, including an input sampler that mimics the human
retina, a dorsal network that guides where to look next, and a ventral network

learn to take multiple glances at an image, attend to a salient part at each

test such models for their robustness against a varying level of adversarial
noises with a special focus on the effect of different input sampling
strategies. Our findings suggest that retinal foveation and sampling renders a
model more robust against adversarial noises, and the model may correct itself
from an attack when it is given a longer time to take more glances at an image.
In conclusion, robust visual recognition can benefit from the combined use of
three brain-inspired mechanisms: retinal transformation, attention guided eye
movement, and recurrent processing, as opposed to feedforward-only CNNs.

induces a special zero-energy mode. The peculiar distribution of the
zero-energy mode enables us to engineer a phase-robust topological router,
which can achieve quantum state transfer (QST) from one site (input port) to
multiple sites (output ports). Benefiting from the topological protection of
chiral symmetry, we demonstrate that the presence of the mild disorder in
nearest-neighbor and long-range hopping has no appreciable effects on QST in
the lattice. Especially, after introducing another new long-range hopping into
the extended SSH lattice, we propose an optimized protocol of the phase-robust
topological router, in which the number of the output ports can be efficiently
increased. Resorting to the Bose statistical properties of the superconducting
circuit lattice, the input port and output ports assisted by the zero-energy

in biomedical research, where it is critical for applications such as
drug-repositioning and designing new disease treatments. Recently, Cooley et
al. modeled this problem as Exact Weighted Clique Decomposition (EWCD) in
which, given an edge-weighted graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the goal is
to decompose $G$ into at most $k$ (overlapping) weighted cliques so that an
edge's weight is exactly equal to the sum of weights for cliques it
participates in. They show EWCD is fixed-parameter-tractable, giving a
$4^k$-kernel alongside a backtracking algorithm (together called cricca) to
iteratively build a decomposition. Unfortunately, because of inherent
exponential growth in the space of potential solutions, cricca is typically
able to decompose graphs only when $k \leq 11$.
  In this work, we establish reduction rules that exponentially decrease the
size of the kernel (from $4^k$ to $k2^k$) for EWCD. In addition, we use
insights about the structure of potential solutions to give new search rules
that speed up the decomposition algorithm. At the core of our techniques is a
result from combinatorial design theory called Fisher's inequality
characterizing set systems with restricted intersections. We deploy our
kernelization and decomposition algorithms (together called DeCAF) on a corpus
of biologically-inspired data and obtain over two orders of magnitude speed-up
over cricca. As a result, DeCAF scales to instances with $k \geq 17$.

analogs around nearby bright stars. Such planets induce a small stellar reflex
motion with RV amplitude of $\sim$10 cm/s. Detecting such a small RV signal
poses important challenges to instrumentation, data analysis, and the precision
of astrophysical models to mitigate stellar jitter. In this work, we
investigate an important component in the PRV error budget - the spectral
contamination from the Earth's atmosphere (tellurics). We characterize the
effects of telluric absorption on the RV precision and quantify its
contribution to the RV budget over time and across a wavelength range of 350 nm
- 2.5$\mu$m. We investigate the effectiveness in mitigating tellurics using
simulated spectra of a solar twin star with telluric contamination over a
year's worth of observations, and we extracted the RVs using two commonly
adopted algorithms: dividing out a telluric model before performing
cross-correlation or Forward Modeling the observed spectrum incorporating a
telluric model. We assume various degrees of cleanness in removing the
tellurics, including mimicking the lack of accurate knowledge of the telluric
lines by using a mismatched line profile to model the ""observed"" tellurics. We
conclude that the RV errors caused by telluric absorption can be suppressed to
close to or even below the photon-limited precision in the optical region,
especially in the blue, around 1-10 cm/s. At red through near-infrared
wavelengths, however, the residuals of tellurics can induce an RV error on the
m/s level even under the most favorable assumptions for telluric removal,
leading to significant systematic noise in the RV time series and periodograms.
If the red-optical or near-infrared becomes critical in the mitigation of
stellar activity, systematic errors from tellurics can be eliminated with a
space mission such as EarthFinder.

ferromagnetic hosts of iron and gadolinium at $\approx 6$~K, and the hyperfine
magnetic fields were determined by Time Differential Perturbed Angular
Distribution (TDPAD) measurements. The hyperfine field strengths at $\approx
6$~K are compared to the results of previous higher-temperature measurements
and the amplitudes of the $R(t)$ functions are compared to empirical
expectations. The results show that gadolinium can be a suitable host for
high-precision in-beam $g$-factor measurements. The results of new $g$-factor
measurements for isomers in $^{66}$Ga and $^{67}$Ge are $g(^{66}$Ga$,7^{-}) =
+0.126(4)$, supporting a $[\pi_{f5/2} \otimes \nu g_{9/2}]_{7^-}$ configuration

measurement of the ratio $g(^{67}\mathrm{Ge})/g(^{69}\mathrm{Ge}) = 0.869(9)$.
These values are in agreement with previous results. The $R(t)$ amplitudes
indicate that the nuclear alignment produced in the isomeric states was
significantly lower than the empirically expected $\sigma/I \approx 0.35$.

and dilated convolution to extract the relevant feature. Although extracting
features with both contextual and semantic information is critical for the
segmentation tasks, it brings a memory footprint and high computation cost for
real-time applications. This paper presents a new model to achieve a trade-off
between accuracy/speed for real-time road scene semantic segmentation.
Specifically, we proposed a lightweight model named Scale-aware Strip Attention
Guided Feature Pyramid Network (S$^2$-FPN). Our network consists of three main
modules: Attention Pyramid Fusion (APF) module, Scale-aware Strip Attention
Module (SSAM), and Global Feature Upsample (GFU) module. APF adopts an
attention mechanisms to learn discriminative multi-scale features and help
close the semantic gap between different levels. APF uses the scale-aware
attention to encode global context with vertical stripping operation and models
the long-range dependencies, which helps relate pixels with similar semantic
label. In addition, APF employs channel-wise reweighting block (CRB) to
emphasize the channel features. Finally, the decoder of S$^2$-FPN then adopts
GFU, which is used to fuse features from APF and the encoder. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on two challenging semantic segmentation
benchmarks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves better accuracy/speed
trade-off with different model settings. The proposed models have achieved a
results of 76.2\%mIoU/87.3FPS, 77.4\%mIoU/67FPS, and 77.8\%mIoU/30.5FPS on

nonreciprocal effect emerges in the presence of mobility edges, which leads to
a unidirectional transport for the excitation transfer and enables potential
applications in the engineering of quantum diodes.

difficult topic that has perplexed researchers for a long time. We show in this
paper that in the case of magnetic MXenes, the magneto-transport properties of
the material provide an easy solution. One of the fascinating properties that
MXenes offer is the realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism which is important
for two-dimensional (2D) materials family. The previous reports have only made
a few statements on some MXenes citing its usefulness for spintronics related
applications. Here, using first-principle calculations we have examined the
actual magneto-transport phenomena in MXenes family. We have considered all
possible combinations of 3\textit{d} transition metals ($Ti, V, Cr$ and $Mn$)
and nitride based functionalized $(O_2, F_2$ and $(OH)_2$) MXenes, $M_2NT_2$.
The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect is investigated in $Cr$ and $Mn$ based
MXenes as the compounds possess ground state stable ferromagnetic solutions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic Anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) can be used to
identify the functional groups in MXenes.
  Additionally, half-metallic features of these ferromagnetic MXenes make them
potential candidates for varieties of applications such as in logic and memory
devices, quantum computations, spintronics etc. The maximum anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) at Fermi energy, $E_F$, is found in case of $Mn_2NO_2$ (470
$S/cm$) which is attributed to the presence of avoided band crossing and larger
density of states. Together, when considered all the studied systems, the AHC
can be above 2500 $S/cm$ within $E_F \pm $ 0.25 $eV$. Our findings could be
useful not only in guiding the experimentalists by considering AHC as a simple
tool in determining the functional groups in 2D ferro(i)magnets, also, it could
be useful in designing memory device with negligible stray fields.

structure-preserving Lagrangian algorithm to solve generalized diffusions. The
Lagrangian algorithm for a generalized diffusion evolves the ""flow map"" which
determines the dynamics of the generalized diffusion. This avoids the
non-trivial task of computing the Wasserstein distance between two probability
functions.
  Unlike most existing methods that construct numerical discretizations based
on the strong or weak form of the underlying PDE, the proposed schemes are
constructed using variational formulations of these PDEs for preserving their
variational structures. Our schemes first perform temporal discretization on
these variational systems. By doing so, they are very
computer-memory-efficient. Moreover, instead of directly solving the obtained
nonlinear systems after temporal and spatial discretization, a minimizing
movement scheme is utilized to evolve the solutions. This guarantees the
monotonic decay of the energy of the system and is crucial for the long-term
stability of numerical computation. Lastly, the proposed neural-network-based
scheme is mesh-free and enables us to solve gradient flows in high dimensions.
Various numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and

suited for cases where the data contains domain-specific regions, i.e., there
is not a counterpart for a certain portion of the data in the other domain. We
propose Diffusion Transport Alignment (DTA), a semi-supervised manifold
alignment method that exploits prior correspondence knowledge between only a
few points to align the domains. By building a diffusion process, DTA finds a
transportation plan between data measured from two heterogeneous domains with
different feature spaces, which by assumption, share a similar geometrical
structure coming from the same underlying data generating process. DTA can also
compute a partial alignment in a data-driven fashion, resulting in accurate
alignments when some data are measured in only one domain. We empirically
demonstrate that DTA outperforms other methods in aligning multimodal data in
this semisupervised setting. We also empirically show that the alignment
obtained by DTA can improve the performance of machine learning tasks, such as
domain adaptation, inter-domain feature mapping, and exploratory data analysis,

generation performance on a subset of timesteps is crucial, which is greatly
influenced by the covariance design in DPMs. In this work, we consider diagonal

optimal result for such covariances, and then correct it when the mean of DPMs

terms of conditional expectations over functions of noise. Building upon it, we
propose to estimate the optimal covariance and its correction given imperfect

addressing the coupling dilemma between the range and angle resolutions, which
is historically and naturally inherited from a conventional FSR. First of all,
the frequency-modulated continuous-wave system architecture is selected to
exemplify and recall the characteristics of a conventional FSR with an emphasis
on that resolution coupling. Then, a radar solution featuring a stitched
frequency-space domain is introduced for the resolution decoupling, depending
on an array of FB-enabled LWA channels. With the radar equation, FB-related
conditions for realizing the critical frequency-space stitching are
analytically derived and equivalently converted into several design
specifications of an array of LWAs, i.e., engineered beam-scanning functions,
beam-crossovers, and phase alignments. To facilitate the practical
implementation of such an array technique, a detailed and generalized design
flow is developed. Finally, for a simple proof of concept, an FB-enabled
two-channel LWA array is modeled, fabricated, and measured. Simulated and
measured results are in a reasonable agreement, and both demonstrate the
desired frequency-space stitching behavior, i.e., enhanced spectrum bandwidth
and widened radiation beamwidth. The proposed array solution may be potentially
deployed for FSR systems with a full-band-locked beam illumination and a
decoupled range-angle resolution, which may present a competitor against the
phased array technique.

become larger and larger so that the training and inference often overwhelm the
hardware resources. Given the fact that neural networks are often
over-parameterized, one effective way to reduce such computational overhead is
neural network pruning, by removing redundant parameters from trained neural
networks. It has been recently observed that pruning can not only reduce
computational overhead but also can improve empirical robustness of deep neural
networks (NNs), potentially owing to removing spurious correlations while
preserving the predictive accuracies. This paper for the first time
demonstrates that pruning can generally improve certified robustness for
ReLU-based NNs under the complete verification setting. Using the popular
Branch-and-Bound (BaB) framework, we find that pruning can enhance the
estimated bound tightness of certified robustness verification, by alleviating
linear relaxation and sub-domain split problems. We empirically verify our
findings with off-the-shelf pruning methods and further present a new
stability-based pruning method tailored for reducing neuron instability, that
outperforms existing pruning methods in enhancing certified robustness. Our
experiments show that by appropriately pruning an NN, its certified accuracy
can be boosted up to 8.2% under standard training, and up to 24.5% under
adversarial training on the CIFAR10 dataset. We additionally observe the
existence of certified lottery tickets that can match both standard and
certified robust accuracies of the original dense models across different
datasets. Our findings offer a new angle to study the intriguing interaction

  Minimum-Margin Attack",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The AutoAttack (AA) has been the most reliable method to evaluate adversarial
robustness when considerable computational resources are available. However,
the high computational cost (e.g., 100 times more than that of the project
gradient descent attack) makes AA infeasible for practitioners with limited
computational resources, and also hinders applications of AA in the adversarial
training (AT). In this paper, we propose a novel method, minimum-margin (MM)
attack, to fast and reliably evaluate adversarial robustness. Compared with AA,
our method achieves comparable performance but only costs 3% of the
computational time in extensive experiments. The reliability of our method lies
in that we evaluate the quality of adversarial examples using the margin
between two targets that can precisely identify the most adversarial example.
The computational efficiency of our method lies in an effective Sequential
TArget Ranking Selection (STARS) method, ensuring that the cost of the MM
attack is independent of the number of classes. The MM attack opens a new way
for evaluating adversarial robustness and provides a feasible and reliable way
to generate high-quality adversarial examples in AT.

from observed pulsation frequencies. We show that model grids with insufficient

re-discussion of HD 139614 leads to different stellar parameters than the ones
derived by Murphy et al. (2021). We performed a model comparison between this
previous investigation and our results by applying the Akaike and Bayesian
information criteria. While the results with regard to our 10-d model are
inconclusive, they show (very) strong evidence of a 6-d model with fixed
accretion parameters (leading to almost identical stellar parameters to those
of the 10-d model) to be preferred over the model applied by Murphy et al.

the stellar parameters (\Delta R ~ 0.05 R_\odot, \Delta log g <~ 0.01, and

  overlap with arXiv:2108.13952",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evasion attacks against machine learning models often succeed via iterative
probing of a fixed target model, whereby an attack that succeeds once will
succeed repeatedly. One promising approach to counter this threat is making a
model a moving target against adversarial inputs. To this end, we introduce
Morphence-2.0, a scalable moving target defense (MTD) powered by
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection to defend against adversarial examples. By
regularly moving the decision function of a model, Morphence-2.0 makes it
significantly challenging for repeated or correlated attacks to succeed.
Morphence-2.0 deploys a pool of models generated from a base model in a manner
that introduces sufficient randomness when it responds to prediction queries.
Via OOD detection, Morphence-2.0 is equipped with a scheduling approach that
assigns adversarial examples to robust decision functions and benign samples to
an undefended accurate models. To ensure repeated or correlated attacks fail,
the deployed pool of models automatically expires after a query budget is
reached and the model pool is seamlessly replaced by a new model pool generated
in advance. We evaluate Morphence-2.0 on two benchmark image classification
datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10) against 4 reference attacks (3 white-box and 1
black-box). Morphence-2.0 consistently outperforms prior defenses while
preserving accuracy on clean data and reducing attack transferability. We also
show that, when powered by OOD detection, Morphence-2.0 is able to precisely
make an input-based movement of the model's decision function that leads to
higher prediction accuracy on both adversarial and benign queries.

this context, the interaction of the DC and AC sides of CIDERs has been shown
to have a significant impact. In order to analyze and support the mitigation of
such phenomena, the authors of this paper recently proposed a Harmonic

framework considers the coupling between harmonics, but ignores the DC-side
response of the CIDERs. Modelling the DC side and AC/DC converter introduces a
nonlinearity into the CIDER model that needs to be approximated for the

framework to address this aspect, whose inclusion is non-trivial. The extended
HPF method is applied to a modified version of the CIGRE low-voltage benchmark

interface, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) lead to a plethora of wave patterns
with myriad wave types. Identification of different types of MHD waves is an
important and challenging task in such complex wave patterns. Moreover, owing
to the multiplicity of solutions and their admissibility for different systems,
especially for intermediate-type MHD shock waves, the identification of MHD
wave types is complicated if one solely relies on the Rankine-Hugoniot jump
conditions. MHD wave detection is further exacerbated by the unphysical
smearing of discontinuous shock waves in numerical simulations. We present two
MHD wave detection methods based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) which
enables the classification of waves and identification of their locations. The
first method separates the output into a regression (location prediction) and a
classification problem assuming the number of waves for each training data is
fixed. In the second method, the number of waves is not specified a priori and
the algorithm, using only regression, predicts the waves' locations and
classifies their types. The first fixed output model efficiently provides high
precision and recall, the accuracy of the entire neural network achieved is up
to 0.99, and the classification accuracy of some waves approaches unity. The
second detection model has relatively lower performance, with more sensitivity
to the setting of parameters, such as the number of grid cells N_{grid} and the
thresholds of confidence score and class probability, etc. The proposed two
methods demonstrate very strong potential to be applied for MHD wave detection
in some complex wave structures and interactions.

of the limited representativeness of simulation, models trained in a classical

promising deep-learning algorithms to tackle this issue. However, these
approaches have been evaluated in a very favorable scenario with a synthetic

this work, we study the ATR problem outside of this ideal condition, which is
unlikely to occur in real operational contexts. Our contribution is threefold.

  Perspective",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern recommender systems aim to improve user experience. As reinforcement
learning (RL) naturally fits this objective -- maximizing an user's reward per
session -- it has become an emerging topic in recommender systems. Developing
RL-based recommendation methods, however, is not trivial due to the
\emph{offline training challenge}. Specifically, the keystone of traditional RL
is to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of
`errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannot
afford the price of making `errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to be
trained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under different
recommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimal
policies under these offline training settings.
  Here we propose a new learning paradigm -- namely Prompt-Based Reinforcement
Learning (PRL) -- for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents.
While traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs to
their expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e.,
recommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trained
to predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observed
reward value -- with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, this
historical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-reward
pairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question:
\emph{ Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions \& the
prompted reward value}? We implement PRL with four notable recommendation
models and conduct experiments on two real-world e-commerce datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
methods.

raised as unavoidable inter-radical interactions, such as strong
electron-electron dipolar coupling, appear to suppress its sensitivity. We
demonstrate that this can be overcome by driving the spin system through a
modulation of the inter-radical distance. It is shown that this dynamical
process markedly enhances geomagnetic field sensitivity in strongly coupled
radical pairs via a Landau-Zener type transition between singlet and triplet
states. These findings suggest that a ""live"" harmonically driven
magnetoreceptor can be more sensitive than its ""dead"" static counterpart.

grow the central BH, that are expected to cooperate in the high-redshift
star-forming progenitors of local massive galaxies. The first is the gaseous
dynamical friction process, that can cause the migration toward the nuclear
regions of stellar-mass BHs originated during the intense bursts of star
formation in the gas-rich host progenitor galaxy, and the buildup of a central
heavy BH seed $M_\bullet\sim 10^{3-5}\, M_\odot$ within short timescales
$\lesssim$ some $10^7$ yr. The second mechanism is the standard Eddington-type
gas disk accretion onto the heavy BH seed, through which the central BH can
become (super)massive $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-10}\, M_\odot$ within the typical
star-formation duration $\lesssim 1$ Gyr of the host. We validate our
semi-empirical approach by reproducing the observed redshift-dependent
bolometric AGN luminosity functions and Eddington ratio distributions, and the
relationship between the star-formation and the bolometric luminosity of the
accreting central BH. We then derive the relic (super)massive BH mass function
at different redshifts via a generalized continuity equation approach, and
compare it with present observational estimates. Finally, we reconstruct the
overall BH mass function from the stellar to the (super)massive regime, over
more than ten orders of magnitudes in BH mass.

for investigating fundamental effects in quantum physics. The ability to shape
the optical trapping potential using spatial light modulation and quantum

predispose them for emulating a range of physical systems and studying quantum
phenomena with massive objects. To extend these capabilities of levitated
nanoparticles to quantum many-body systems, it is crucial to develop feasible
strategies to couple and entangle multiple particles either directly or via a
common optical bus. Here, we propose a variable and deterministic scheme to
generate Gaussian entanglement in the motional steady state of multiple
levitated nanoparticles using coherent scattering to multiple cavity modes.
Coupling multiple nanoparticles to a common optical cavity mode allows cooling
of a collective Bogoliubov mode to its quantum ground state; cooling multiple
Bogoliubov modes (enabled by trapping each particle in multiple tweezers such
that each tweezer scatters photons into a separate cavity mode) removes most
thermal noise, leading to strong entanglement between nanoparticles. We present
numerical simulations for three nanoparticles showing great tuneability of the
generated entanglement with realistic experimental parameters. Our proposal
thus paves the way towards creating complex quantum states of multiple

enable the fine-grained description of COVID-19 treatments and the potential

the aim of suggesting more accurate treatments for treating the virus. We
provide services to traverse the KG and visualize the effects that a group of

rewards in real-world decision-making situations, such as finance, robotics,
autonomous driving, etc. The most natural choice of risk measures is variance,
which penalizes the upside volatility as much as the downside part. Instead,
the (downside) semivariance, which captures the negative deviation of a random
variable under its mean, is more suitable for risk-averse proposes. This paper
aims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement
learning w.r.t. steady reward distribution. Since semivariance is
time-inconsistent and does not satisfy the standard Bellman equation, the
traditional dynamic programming methods are inapplicable to MSV problems
directly. To tackle this challenge, we resort to Perturbation Analysis (PA)
theory and establish the performance difference formula for MSV. We reveal that
the MSV problem can be solved by iteratively solving a sequence of RL problems
with a policy-dependent reward function. Further, we propose two on-policy
algorithms based on the policy gradient theory and the trust region method.
Finally, we conduct diverse experiments from simple bandit problems to
continuous control tasks in MuJoCo, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods.

cluster core and north of the cluster centre. They have similar color
distribution and comparable stellar masses to the red dwarf galaxies. Based on
photometric selection, we identify a total of 9 globular cluster candidates
associated to the UDGs and 4 to the LSB galaxies, with the highest number of
candidates in an individual UDG being three. We find that there are no relevant
differences between dwarfs, LSB galaxies and UDGs: the structural parameters
(that is surface brightness, size, colors, n-index) and GCs content of the
three classes have similar properties and trends. This finding is consistent
with UDGs being the extreme LSB tail of the size-luminosity distribution of
dwarfs in this environment.

the lane detection task as an ordinal classification problem to get the

  Informaticae vol. 186 no 1-4",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we give an overview of some recent work on applying tools from
category theory in finite model theory, descriptive complexity, constraint
satisfaction, and combinatorics. The motivations for this work come from
Computer Science, but there may also be something of interest for model
theorists and other logicians.
  The basic setting involves studying the category of relational structures via
a resource-indexed family of adjunctions with some process category - which
unfolds relational structures into treelike forms, allowing natural resource
parameters to be assigned to these unfoldings. One basic instance of this
scheme allows us to recover, in a purely structural, syntax-free way: the
Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse~game; the quantifier rank fragments of first-order logic;
the equivalences on structures induced by (i) the quantifier rank fragments,
(ii) the restriction of this fragment to the existential positive part, and
(iii) the extension with counting quantifiers; and the combinatorial parameter
of tree-depth (Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez). Another instance recovers the
k-pebble game, the finite-variable fragments, the corresponding equivalences,
and the combinatorial parameter of treewidth. Other instances cover modal,
guarded and hybrid fragments, generalized quantifiers, and a wide range of
combinatorial parameters. This whole scheme has been axiomatized in a very
general setting, of arboreal categories and arboreal covers.
  Beyond this basic level, a landscape is beginning to emerge, in which
structural features of the resource categories, adjunctions and comonads are
reflected in degrees of logical and computational tractability of the
corresponding languages. Examples include semantic characterisation and
preservation theorems, and Lovasz-type results on counting homomorphisms.

  To this end, we revisited ensembling, a powerful approach, not often
adequately used due to its nature of increased complexity and training time,
making it viable by specific design choices. First, we trained end-to-end two
EfficientNet-b0 models (known to be the architecture with the best overall
accuracy/complexity trade-off in image classification) on disjoint subsets of
data (i.e. bagging). Then, we made an efficient adaptive ensemble by performing
fine-tuning of a trainable combination layer. In this way, we were able to
outperform the state-of-the-art by an average of 0.5\% on the accuracy with

effects limiting the achievable maximum beam intensity. The heavy-ion
superconducting synchrotron SIS100, currently under construction at GSI, should
provide intense beams for the future FAIR experiments. Using SIS100 as an
example, this paper develops a quantitative framework for characterizing the
half-integer stop band for realistic, Gaussian-like distributed bunched beams.
This study identifies the tune areas affected by the gradient-error-induced
half-integer resonance for varying space charge strengths. A key insight of our
analysis is that, for bunched beams a relatively small gradient error can
result in a large half-integer stop band width. The achievable maximum bunch
intensity, often referred to as space charge limit, is thus reduced
significantly. This contrasts the findings in existing studies in literature
based on more simplified beam distributions. The reason for discrepancy is
identified in the increasing stop band width for Gaussian distributions when
space charge becomes stronger, which appears on longer time scales as relevant
for synchrotrons. The role of synchrotron motion in providing continuous
emittance growth across the bunch is scrutinized. To minimize the half-integer
stop band for a bunched beam, and hence increase the space charge limit,
lattice corrections are applied: Including space charge in the optimization
procedure recovers results equivalent to conventional lattice correction.
Therefore, we find that conventional correction tools are well suited to
increase the gradient-error-induced space charge limit of synchrotrons.

honey yield, three workability traits and two traits for resistance against the
parasite Varroa destructor. For breeding value estimation, we use a honey
bee-specific model with maternal and direct effects, to account for the
contributions of the workers and the queen of a colony to the phenotypes. We
conducted a validation for the last generation and a five-fold
cross-validation. In the validation for the last generation, the predictive
ability of pedigree-based estimated breeding values was 0.06 for honey yield,
and ranged from 0.2 to 0.41 for the workability traits. The inclusion of
genomic marker data improved these predictive abilities to 0.11 for honey
yield, and a range from 0.22 to 0.44 for the workability traits. The inclusion
of genomic data did not improve the predictive ability for the disease related
traits. Traits with high heritability for maternal effects compared to the
heritability for direct effects showed the most promising results. Across all
traits, the bias with genomic methods was close to the bias with pedigree-based
BLUP. The results show that genomic selection can successfully be applied to

concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential
equations (PDEs), these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers
of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the
qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of
multi-species nonlocal advection-diffusion models, recently proposed for
modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of
species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual
avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an
energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests
that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state,
rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to
develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic
geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of
local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to
look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical
analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with
up to four classes of local minimum energy state can emerge. The associated
dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and
between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of
territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our
study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving
and interacting species.

control of magnetism of sufficient magnitude. To overcome the in-plane shape
anisotropy, needed is the electrical control of a perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA). It is known, within a free electron model, the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling provides such a control. Surprisingly, this same Rashba PMA
is enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude when a periodic potential is
added. Usually spin Berry phase physics reflects time dependent magnetic
fields. Here it is shown, within a time independent model, such physics arises
because the Rashba effective magnetic field has texture within the unit cell.
Predicted are electrical controllable band-structure gaps, linear in the
applied electric field $E$, that can result in a truly giant linear PMA. Also
possible is a Peierls mechanism, in which the magnetisation tilts from the
vertical, shifting these gaps to the Fermi level. As a consequence there are
low dissipation electric field driven dynamics, an alternative to the more
dissipative spin torque transfer (STT) effect. The theory requires the
introduction of an intrinsic spin Berry connection $\vec A_s$, an effective
vector potential, and is incompatible with current density functional theories
(DFT).

inevitably transform into higher grade ones. A classical treatment to delay
this transition is radiotherapy (RT). Following RT, the tumour gradually
shrinks during a period of typically 6 months to 4 years before regrowing. To
improve the patient's health-related quality of life and help clinicians build
personalised follow-ups, one would benefit from predictions of the time during
which the tumour is expected to decrease. The challenge is to provide a
reliable estimate of this regrowth time shortly after RT (i.e. with few data),
although patients react differently to the treatment. To this end, we analyse
the tumour size dynamics from a batch of 20 high-quality longitudinal data, and
propose a simple and robust analytical model, with just 4 parameters. From the
study of their correlations, we build a statistical constraint that helps
determine the regrowth time even for patients for which we have only a few
measurements of the tumour size. We validate the procedure on the data and
predict the regrowth time at the moment of the first MRI after RT, with
precision of, typically, 6 months. Using virtual patients, we study whether
some forecast is still possible just three months after RT. We obtain some
reliable estimates of the regrowth time in 75\% of the cases, in particular for
all ""fast-responders"". The remaining 25\% represent cases where the actual
regrowth time is large and can be safely estimated with another measurement a
year later. These results show the feasibility of making personalised
predictions of the tumour regrowth time shortly after RT.

$\boldsymbol{B}$, varying $\theta$ term produces $\boldsymbol{E} \cdot
\boldsymbol{B}$. An interesting example is the Witten effect where a magnetic
monopole becomes a dyon which, however, should disappear in the exact massless
limit of the fermion. Underlying mechanism of this phenomenon has been
understood by Callan by the presence of an effective axion-like degree of
freedom around the monopole, which is roughly the phase of the fermions. The
configuration of this axion cancels the effect of the $\theta$ term. Now, the
chiral anomaly implies that non-vanishing $\boldsymbol{E} \cdot \boldsymbol{B}$
induces the chiral charge in the system. The question is whether the chiral
charge is generated in the massless limit when we take into account the
axion-like degree of freedom in the discussion. The discussion is relevant for
the mechanism of baryogenesis under the background of time-dependent $\theta$.
We solve the system of the massless QED with time dependent $\theta$ by
reducing it to the two-dimensional QED. We demonstrate the occurrence of chiral
charge generation in the background of static magnetic field for two cases: a
magnetic monopole and a uniform magnetic flux. For the monopole case, the
chiral charge comes out from the monopole while canceling the Witten effect.
For the case of the uniform flux, on the other hand, the effect of the
backreaction cannot be ignored, giving a more non-trivial time dependence. We
also discuss their implications on baryogenesis.

the random nature of film grain makes it both difficult to preserve and very

well-known classic inverse monoids, as well as a novel inverse monoid (the
'arithmetic inverse monoid' A) that generalises these in a natural

  Based on this, we interpret classic inverse semigroup theoretic concepts
arithmetically, and vice versa. Composition and normal forms within A are based
on the Chinese remainder theorem, and a minimal generating set corresponds to
all prime-order polycyclic monoids. This then gives a close connection between

a lookback time of 1.5 Gyrs corresponding to the infall of the LMC and its

significant correlation with infall time and thus supporting the hypothesis

  Coefficients Particle Filter (LMCPF) for global NWP",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) modeling framework we study
the implementation of Gaussian uncertainty of individual particles into the
assimilation step of a localized adaptive particle filter (LAPF). We obtain a
local representation of the prior distribution as a mixture of basis functions.
In the assimilation step, the filter calculates the individual weight
coefficients and new particle locations. It can be viewed as a combination of
the LAPF and a localized version of a Gaussian mixture filter, i.e., a
Localized Mixture Coefficients Particle Filter (LMCPF).
  Here, we investigate the feasibility of the LMCPF within a global operational
framework and evaluate the relationship between prior and posterior
distributions and observations. Our simulations are carried out in a standard
pre-operational experimental set-up with the full global observing system, 52
km global resolution and $10^6$ model variables. Statistics of particle
movement in the assimilation step are calculated. The mixture approach is able
to deal with the discrepancy between prior distributions and observation
location in a real-world framework and to pull the particles towards the
observations in a much better way than the pure LAPF. This shows that using
Gaussian uncertainty can be an important tool to improve the analysis and
forecast quality in a particle filter framework.

adaptively guides deep neural network models to gain attention by exploiting
the properties of the models themselves. SSIA is a novel attention mechanism

during inference, which is in contrast to existing attention mechanism. In
short, by considering attention weights as higher-level semantic information,
we reconsidered the implementation of existing attention mechanisms and further
propose generating supervisory signals from higher network layers to guide
lower network layers for parameter updates. We achieved this by building a
self-supervised learning task using the hierarchical features of the network
itself, which only works at the training stage. To verify the effectiveness of
SSIA, we performed a particular implementation (called an SSIA block) in
convolutional neural network models and validated it on several image
classification datasets. The experimental results show that an SSIA block can
significantly improve the model performance, even outperforms many popular
attention methods that require additional parameters and computation costs,

leverages the benefits of both modules: Inductive bias of CNN, and the
multi-head attention of transformers, thus enabling a rich spatio-temporal

solve this problem using multi-modal input/output with supervised ground-truth

Alternatively to prior methods, this paper forecasts depth and ego motion using
only self-supervised raw images as input. The approach performs significantly
well on the KITTI dataset benchmark with several performance criteria being

unchanged up to 340 K and then increased and the dipoles correlated in

an application of the radiative transfer code POLARIS, with the goal to test
the observability of the ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ transition $1_{10}$-$1_{11}$ (372.42

generated synthetic single-dish and interferometric observations and studied
the differences in both techniques. The column densities we derive are
comparable to values reported for similar sources. These estimates depend on
the extent over which they are averaged, and sources with compact emission they
can be highly affected by beam dilution. Combined ALMA-ACA observations improve
in signal-to-noise ratio and lead to better column density estimates as
compared to ALMA alone. We confirm the feasibility to study ortho-H$_2$D$^+$

collapse will emit radiation and eventually disappear. Closely related to the
information loss puzzle is the challenge to define an objective notion of
physical entropy which increases throughout this process in a way consistent
with unitarity. In recent years, this has been addressed with certain notions
of coarse grained entropy. We have suggested instead that physical entropy
should be identified with matter-gravity entanglement entropy and that this may
offer an explanation of entropy increase both for the black hole collapse and
evaporation system and also for other closed unitarily evolving systems,
notably the universe as a whole. For this to work, it would have to be that the
matter-gravity entanglement entropy of the late-time state of black hole
evaporation is larger than the entropy of the freshly formed black hole. We
argue here that this is possibly the case due to (usually neglected)
photon-graviton interactions. If black hole evaporation is slowed down by
putting the black hole in a slightly permeable box, we give plausibility
arguments that the radiation remaining after a large black hole has evaporated
will (be pure and) mainly consist of roughly equal numbers of photons and
gravitons entangled with one another -- with a photon-graviton entanglement
entropy possibly greater than the entropy of the freshly formed black hole. It
also seems possible that, even in the absence of such a box, the matter-gravity
entanglement entropy might still increase and the late-time state again be a
pure state of (predominantly) photons highly entangled with soft gravitons that
the Hawking-emitted photons themselves had radiated. More work is needed to
find out if it is indeed so.

method using a single color blackbody model added to the pre-burst model, to
monitor the parametric changes as the burst decays. Based on our time-resolved

one-parameter formal deformation theory of left BiHom-alternative algebras.
Moreover, we study central and $T_\theta$-extensions of BiHom-alternative

of research and access type, was quantified. For this, the citations and social
attention accumulated until the year 2021 by a total of 244,880 research
articles published in the year 2018, were analyzed. The data source was
Dimensions.ai, and the units of study were research articles in Economics,

proportion of the articles received a large part of the citations and most of
the social attention. Both citations and social attention in-creased, in
general, with the number of co-authors. Thus, the greater the number of
co-authors, the greater the probability of being cited in academic articles and
mentioned on social media. The advantage in citation and social attention due
to collaboration is independent of the access type for the publication.
Furthermore, although collaboration with an additional co-author is in general
positive in terms of citation and social attention, these positive effects
reduce as the number of co-authors increases.

evidence that, in the limit of large $\Lambda$, integration over the character

computations. In two dimensions we recover standard expressions. For the theory
on a 3-dimensional periodic lattice $\Lambda$ with Migdal action we get a very
pleasant expression for the symplectic partition function, and with the Wilson
action a more elaborate one. Each is a sum of a series with positive terms. One
can also write down expressions for plaquette-plaquette correlations and 't

  Detection","Accepted to AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial to the safe deployment
of a classifier in the real world. However, deep neural networks are known to
be overconfident for abnormal data. Existing works directly design score
function by mining the inconsistency from classifier for in-distribution (ID)
and OOD. In this paper, we further complement this inconsistency with
reconstruction error, based on the assumption that an autoencoder trained on ID
data can not reconstruct OOD as well as ID. We propose a novel method, READ
(Reconstruction Error Aggregated Detector), to unify inconsistencies from
classifier and autoencoder. Specifically, the reconstruction error of raw
pixels is transformed to latent space of classifier. We show that the
transformed reconstruction error bridges the semantic gap and inherits
detection performance from the original. Moreover, we propose an adjustment
strategy to alleviate the overconfidence problem of autoencoder according to a
fine-grained characterization of OOD data. Under two scenarios of pre-training
and retraining, we respectively present two variants of our method, namely
READ-MD (Mahalanobis Distance) only based on pre-trained classifier and READ-ED
(Euclidean Distance) which retrains the classifier. Our methods do not require
access to test time OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive
comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms. On a CIFAR-10
pre-trained WideResNet, our method reduces the average FPR@95TPR by up to 9.8%

motion compensation strategy and rarely adopt the mode prediction technique
from the traditional standards like H.264/H.265 for both motion and residual
compression. In this work, we first propose a coarse-to-fine (C2F) deep video
compression framework for better motion compensation, in which we perform
motion estimation, compression and compensation twice in a coarse to fine
manner. Our C2F framework can achieve better motion compensation results
without significantly increasing bit costs. Observing hyperprior information
(i.e., the mean and variance values) from the hyperprior networks contains
discriminant statistical information of different patches, we also propose two
efficient hyperprior-guided mode prediction methods. Specifically, using
hyperprior information as the input, we propose two mode prediction networks to
respectively predict the optimal block resolutions for better motion coding and
decide whether to skip residual information from each block for better residual
coding without introducing additional bit cost while bringing negligible extra
computation cost. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate our proposed
C2F video compression framework equipped with the new hyperprior-guided mode

family of quantitative phase measurement. However, the reconstruction algorithm
for quantitative DPC (qDPC) imaging is not yet optimized, as it does not
incorporate the inborn properties of qDPC imaging. In this research, we propose
a simple but effective image prior, the dark-field sparse prior (DSP), to
facilitate the phase reconstruction quality for all DPC-based phase
reconstruction algorithms. The DSP is based on the key observation that most
pixel values for an idea differential phase contrast image are zeros since the
subtraction of two images under anti-symmetric illumination cancels all
background components. With this DSP prior, we formed a new cost function in
which L0-norm was used to represent the DSP. Further, we developed two
different algorithms based on (1) the Half Quadratic Splitting, and (2) the
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to solve this NP-hard L0-norm problem. We tested
our new model on both simulated and experimental data and compare against
state-of-the-art methods including L2-norm and total variation regularizations.
Results show that our proposed model is superior in terms of phase
reconstruction quality and implementation efficiency, in which it significantly
increases the experimental robustness, while maintaining the data fidelity.

Protocols for DQC are usually set up in the measurement-based quantum

protocols achieve several desired properties, including the security of inputs,
the blindness of computation and its verifiability, and have also recently been
extended to the multiparty setting. Two approaches are followed in DQC that
demand completely different operations on the clients' side. In one, the
clients are able to prepare quantum states, in the other, the clients are able
to measure them. In this work, we provide a novel stringent definition of the

allows in a natural way the incorporation of known data of the exact solution,

that quasi-minimizing neural controls exist, which converge quasi-optimally. We
specialize the analysis results to Galerkin, least-squares and minimal-residual

distance indicators at any epoch. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are necessary for the
aforementioned task because of their huge luminosity that allows us to extend
the cosmic ladder at very high redshifts. However, using GRBs alone as standard
candles is challenging because their luminosity varies widely. To this end, we
choose a reliable correlation for GRBs with a very small intrinsic scatter: the
so-called fundamental plane correlation for GRB afterglows corrected for
selection biases and redshift evolution. We choose a well-defined sample: the
platinum sample, composed of 50 Long GRBs. To further constrain cosmological
parameters, we use Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) given their reliability
as standard rulers. Thus, we have applied GRBs, SNe Ia, and BAOs in a binned
analysis in redshifts so that GRBs' contribution is fully included in the last
redshift bin, which reaches $z=5$. We use the fundamental plane correlation
together with SNe Ia and BAOs, to constrain $H_0$ and the density matter today,

GRBs+ SNe Ia+BAOs with better precision than the SNe Ia alone for every bin,
thus confirming the beneficial role of BAOs and GRBs added together. In
addition, consistent results between GRBs+ SNe Ia +BAOs are obtained when
compared with the SNe Ia +BAOs, showing the importance of GRBs since the
distance ladder is extended up to $z=5$ with a similar precision obtained with
other probes without including the GRBs.

milliarcsecond level, it has been possible to reduce the uncertainties in the

the most promising candidates. These isolated compact objects might emit X-rays
powered by accretion from the interstellar medium. Using data of the Chandra,
XMM-Newton, and INTEGRAL satellites, we searched for X-ray emission in the
isolated black hole candidate OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, and in several other putative
collapsed objects found with gravitational microlensing. OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 has
been recently interpreted as a 7.1 M_sun black hole at a distance of 1.6 kpc,
although a different group obtained a mass range (1.6-4.4 M_sun) that cannot
exclude a massive neutron star. We have derived upper limits on the flux from
OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 of 9$\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-7 keV
range and $\sim2\times10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 17-60 keV range.
The implied X-ray luminosity is consistent with the small radiative efficiency
expected for a black hole and disfavours a neutron star interpretation. Limits
down to a factor about five lower are obtained for the soft X-ray flux of other
candidates, but their interpretation is affected by larger uncertainties in the
masses, distances and spatial velocities.

length weighted by a danger index based on a prediction of human motion

  Splitting Approach",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMIMO) has become an integral part
of the fifth-generation (5G) standard, and is envisioned to be further
developed in beyond 5G (B5G) networks. With a massive number of antennas at the
base station (BS), MaMIMO is best equipped to cater prominent use cases of B5G
networks such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency
communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) or
combinations thereof. However, one of the critical challenges to this pursuit
is the sporadic access behaviour of a massive number of devices in practical
networks that inevitably leads to the conspicuous pilot contamination problem.
Conventional linearly precoded physical layer strategies employed for downlink
transmission in time division duplex (TDD) MaMIMO would incur a noticeable
spectral efficiency (SE) loss in the presence of this pilot contamination. In
this paper, we aim to integrate a robust multiple access and interference
management strategy named rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with TDD MaMIMO
for downlink transmission and investigate its SE performance. We propose a
novel downlink transmission framework of RSMA in TDD MaMIMO, devise a precoder
design strategy and power allocation schemes to maximize different network
utility functions. Numerical results reveal that RSMA is significantly more
robust to pilot contamination and always achieves a SE performance that is
equal to or better than the conventional linearly precoded MaMIMO transmission
strategy.

In
the standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\ldots,m$ we first sample
two randomly chosen bins, compare their two loads and then place a ball in the
least loaded bin. It is well-known that for any $m\geq n$, this results in a
gap (difference between the maximum and average load) of $\log_2\log
n+\Theta(1)$ (with high probability).
  In this work, we consider Two-Choice in different settings with noisy load
comparisons. One key setting involves an adaptive adversary whose power is
limited by some threshold $g\in\mathbb{N}$. In each step, such adversary can
determine the result of any load comparison between two bins whose loads differ
by at most $g$, while if the load difference is greater than $g$, the
comparison is correct.
  For this adversarial setting, we first prove that for any $m \geq n$ the gap
is $O(g+\log n)$ with high probability. Then through a refined analysis we
prove that if $g\leq\log n$, then for any $m \geq n$ the gap is
$O(\frac{g}{\log g}\cdot\log\log n)$. For constant values of $g$, this
generalizes the heavily loaded analysis of [BCSV06, TW14] for the Two-Choice
process, and establishes that asymptotically the same gap bound holds even if
load comparisons among ""similarly loaded"" bins are wrong. Finally, we
complement these upper bounds with tight lower bounds, which establish an
interesting phase transition on how the parameter $g$ impacts the gap.
  The analysis also applies to settings with outdated and delayed information.
For example, for the setting of [BCEFN12] where balls are allocated in
consecutive batches of size $b=n$, we present an improved and tight gap bound
of $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$. This bound also extends for a range of
values of $b$ and applies to a relaxed setting where the reported load of a bin
can be any load value from the last $b$ steps.

based on two common design principles: value decomposition and parameter
sharing. A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized
Q-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an
algorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution
(CTDE) and leads to efficient learning in practice. Despite all the advantages,
we revisit these two principles and show that in certain scenarios, e.g.,
environments with a highly multi-modal reward landscape, value decomposition,
and parameter sharing can be problematic and lead to undesired outcomes. In
contrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual policies provably
converge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially supports some
recent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL testbeds.
Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions on
implementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverse
emergent behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety of
domains, ranging from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complex

research and business. While our data is highly valuable, it is often
privacy-sensitive. Thus, regulations like the GDPR restrict what data can be
legally published, and what a buyer may do with this sensitive data. While
personal data must be protected, we can still sell some insights gathered from
our data that do not hurt our privacy. A data marketplace is a platform that
helps users to sell their data while assisting buyers in discovering relevant
datasets. The major challenge such a marketplace faces is balancing between
offering valuable insights into data while preserving privacy requirements.
Private data marketplaces try to solve this challenge by offering
privacy-preserving computations on personal data. Such computations allow for
calculating statistics or training machine learning models on personal data
without accessing the data in plain. However, the user selling the data cannot
restrict who can buy or what type of computation the data is allowed.
  We close the latter gap by proposing a flexible access control architecture
for private data marketplaces, which can be applied to existing data markets.
Our architecture enables data sellers to define detailed policies restricting
who can buy their data. Furthermore, a seller can control what computation a
specific buyer can purchase on the data, and make constraints on its parameters
to mitigate privacy breaches. The data market's computation system then
enforces the policies before initiating a computation.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide an implementation
for the KRAKEN marketplace, a distributed data market using MPC. We show that
our approach is practical since it introduces a negligible performance overhead
and is secure against several adversaries.

CB15. This allowed a substantial lowering of the ferronematic temperature
range, as well as induction of helical twisting in both nematic (N) and
ferronematic (NF) phases. The effects of 5CB and CB15 on the NF to N phase
transition were nearly identical, but the isotropic transition temperature
decreased more strongly upon addition of CB15. Optical transmission vs.
temperature measurements showed lower transmittance in the NF phase, probably
due to scattering on the domain boundaries. In the vicinity of the NF - N
transition, a noticeable range of anomalously low transmission was noted both
on heating and cooling, suggesting a complex character of molecular
reorientation features. In the chiral NF (N*F) system, helical twisting was
recorded using Grandjean-Cano wedge, with the helical pitch decreasing upon
cooling in both N* and N*F phases. In the cooling mode, transient undulations
emerged in the N*F phase. The complex picture of the ferronematic transition is
supported by POM images taken at different temperatures.

the output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static
nonlinear transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory
for quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing
that the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but
follows two coupled nonlinear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze
and compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic
dynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models
in the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an
approximation of NMM2 in this regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of
this limit in the context of realistic physiological parameter values by
analyzing the dynamics of models with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We
show that NMM1 fails to reproduce important dynamical features of the exact
model, such as the self-sustained oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF
network. Furthermore, in the exact model but not in the limit one, stimulation
of a pyramidal cell population induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak
frequency and amplitude increase with the self-coupling gain and the external
excitatory input. This may play a role in the enhanced response of densely

type of edges. This appears to be a genuine representation for many real-world
systems. However, due to a variety of potential factors, such as limited budget
and equipment, or physical impossibility, multiplex data can be difficult to
observe directly. Often, only partial information on the layer structure of the
system is available, whereas the remaining information is in the form of a
single-layer network. In this work, we face the problem of reconstructing the
hidden multiplex structure of an aggregated network from partial information.
We propose an algorithm that leverages the layer-wise community structure that
can be learned from partial observations to reconstruct the ground-truth
topology of the unobserved part of the multiplex. The algorithm is
characterized by a computational time that grows linearly with the network
size. We perform a systematic study of reconstruction problems for both
synthetic and real-world multiplex networks. We show that the ability of the
proposed method to solve the reconstruction problem is affected by the
heterogeneity of the individual layers and the similarity among the layers. On
real-world networks, we observe that the accuracy of the reconstruction
saturates quickly as the amount of available information increases. In genetic
interaction and scientific collaboration multiplexes for example, we find that
10% of ground-truth information yields 70% accuracy, while 30% information
allows for more than 90% accuracy.

systems is the so-called Koopman approach, where the nonlinear dynamics are
lifted to a (possibly infinite dimensional) linear space through nonlinear
functions called observables. In the lifted space, the dynamics are linear and
represented by a so-called Koopman operator. While the Koopman theory was
originally introduced for autonomous systems, it has been widely used to derive
linear time-invariant (LTI) models for nonlinear systems with inputs through
various approximation schemes such as the extended dynamics mode decomposition
(EDMD). However, recent extensions of the Koopman theory show that the lifting
process for such systems results in a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model
instead of an LTI form. As LTI Koopman model based control has been
successfully used in practice and it is generally temping to use such LTI
descriptions of nonlinear systems, due to the simplicity of the associated
control tool chain, a systematic approach is needed to synthesise optimal LTI
approximations of LPV Koopman models compared to the ad-hoc schemes such as
EDMD, which is based on least-squares regression. In this work, we introduce
optimal LTI Koopman approximations of exact Koopman models of nonlinear systems
with inputs by using l2-gain and generalized H2 norm performance measures. We
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Koopman modelling procedure compared

(2) the merging phase; and (3) the post-coalescence phase. We correctly
identify mergers between first pericentre passage and 500 Myr after coalescence
using kinematic asymmetry with 66% completeness, depending upon merger phase

find that merger detectability decreases with field-of-view, except in
retrograde mergers, where centrally concentrated asymmetric kinematic features
enhances their detectability. Using a cut-off derived from a combination of
photometric and kinematic asymmetry, we increase these detections to 89%

decade-long orbit, GJ 832b, discovered by radial velocity (RV). Later, a super
Earth or mini-Neptune orbiting within the stellar habitable zone was reported
(GJ 832c). The recently determined stellar rotation period (45.7 $\pm$ 9.3
days) is close to the orbital period of putative planet c (35.68 $\pm$ 0.03
days).
  Aims. We aim to confirm or dismiss the planetary nature of the RV signature
attributed to GJ 832c, by adding 119 new RV data points, new photometric data,
and an analysis of the spectroscopic stellar activity indicators. Additionally,
we update the orbital parameters of the planetary system and search for
additional signals.
  Methods. We performed a frequency content analysis of the RVs to search for
periodic and stable signals. Radial velocity time series were modelled with
Keplerians and Gaussian process (GP) regressions alongside activity indicators
to subsequently compare them within a Bayesian framework.
  Results. We updated the stellar rotational period of GJ 832 from activity
indicators, obtaining $37.5^{+1.4}_{-1.5}$ days, improving the precision by a
factor of 6. The new photometric data are in agreement with this value. We
detected an RV signal near 18 days (FAP < 4.6%), which is half of the stellar
rotation period. Two Keplerians alone fail at modelling GJ 832b and a second
planet with a 35-day orbital period. Moreover, the Bayesian evidence from the
GP analysis of the RV data with simultaneous activity indices prefers a model
without a second Keplerian, therefore negating the existence of planet c.

clusters to represent a given dataset. Motivated by the modern large-scale
applications, we study the problem in the \streaming model, in which the memory
is heavily limited and only a single or very few passes over the input are
allowed. Specifically, we investigate whether a good hierarchical clustering
can be obtained, or at least whether we can approximately estimate the value of
the optimal hierarchy. To measure the quality of a hierarchy, we use the HC
minimization objective introduced by Dasgupta. Assuming that the input is an
$n$-vertex weighted graph whose edges arrive in a stream, we derive the
following results on space-vs-accuracy tradeoffs:
  * With $O(n\cdot \text{polylog}\,{n})$ space, we develop a single-pass
algorithm, whose approximation ratio matches the currently best offline
algorithm.
  * When the space is more limited, namely, $n^{1-o(1)}$, we prove that no
algorithm can even estimate the value of optimum HC tree to within an
$o(\frac{\log{n}}{\log\log{n}})$ factor, even when allowed
$\text{polylog}{\,{n}}$ passes over the input.
  * In the most stringent setting of $\text{polylog}\,{n}$ space, we rule out
algorithms that can even distinguish between ""highly""-vs-""poorly"" clusterable
graphs, namely, graphs that have an $n^{1/2-o(1)}$ factor gap between their HC
objective value.
  * Finally, we prove that any single-pass streaming algorithm that computes an
optimal HC tree requires to store almost the entire input even if allowed
exponential time.
  Our algorithmic results establish a general structural result that proves
that cut sparsifiers of input graph can preserve cost of ""balanced"" HC trees to
within a constant factor. Our lower bound results include a new streaming lower
bound for a novel problem ""One-vs-Many-Expanders"", which can be of independent

systems that support human flourishing? Even if a system is in some sense fair,
just, or 'safe', it can nonetheless be exploitative, coercive, inconvenient, or
otherwise conflict with cultural, individual, or social values. This paper
proposes a dimension of interactional ethics thus far overlooked: the ways AI
systems should treat human beings. For this purpose, we explore the
philosophical concept of respect: if respect is something everyone needs and
deserves, shouldn't technology aim to be respectful? Despite its intuitive
simplicity, respect in philosophy is a complex concept with many disparate
senses. Like fairness or justice, respect can characterise how people deserve
to be treated; but rather than relating primarily to the distribution of
benefits or punishments, respect relates to how people regard one another, and
how this translates to perception, treatment, and behaviour. We explore respect
broadly across several literatures, synthesising perspectives on respect from
Kantian, post-Kantian, dramaturgical, and agential realist design perspectives
with a goal of drawing together a view of what respect could mean for AI. In so
doing, we identify ways that respect may guide us towards more sociable
artefacts that ethically and inclusively honour and recognise humans using the
rich social language that we have evolved to interact with one another every

taken different times. Prior methods devise specific networks from scratch to
predict change masks in pixel-level, and struggle with general segmentation
problems. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that reduces CD to semantic
segmentation which means tailoring an existing and powerful semantic
segmentation network to solve CD. This new paradigm conveniently enjoys the
mainstream semantic segmentation techniques to deal with general segmentation
problems in CD. Hence we can concentrate on studying how to detect changes. We
propose a novel and importance insight that different change types exist in CD
and they should be learned separately. Based on it, we devise a module named
MTF to extract the change information and fuse temporal features. MTF enjoys
high interpretability and reveals the essential characteristic of CD. And most
segmentation networks can be adapted to solve the CD problems with our MTF
module. Finally, we propose C-3PO, a network to detect changes at pixel-level.
C-3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. It is
simple but effective and can be considered as a new baseline in this field. Our

Language Processing (NLP), notably for their capacity to learn relevant word

transferred and finetuned for diverse end applications during a supervised
training phase. More recently, in 2018, the transfer of entire pretrained
Language Models and the preservation of their contextualization capacities
enabled to reach unprecedented performance on virtually every NLP benchmark,
sometimes even outperforming human baselines. However, as models reach such
impressive scores, their comprehension abilities still appear as shallow, which
reveal limitations of benchmarks to provide useful insights on their factors of
performance and to accurately measure understanding capabilities.
  In this thesis, we study the behaviour of state-of-the-art models regarding
generalization to facts unseen during training in two important Information
Extraction tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE).
Indeed, traditional benchmarks present important lexical overlap between
mentions and relations used for training and evaluating models, whereas the
main interest of Information Extraction is to extract previously unknown
information. We propose empirical studies to separate performance based on
mention and relation overlap with the training set and find that pretrained
Language Models are mainly beneficial to detect unseen mentions, in particular
out-of-domain. While this makes them suited for real use cases, there is still
a gap in performance between seen and unseen mentions that hurts generalization
to new facts. In particular, even state-of-the-art ERE models rely on a shallow
retention heuristic, basing their prediction more on arguments surface forms

H1-2 computer show that the resulting circuits are faster to execute and less

subsequently describe a posterior sampling strategy based on stochastic

minimizing a loss function at each client to learn an optimal model at the

estimation of the model parameters at the clients does not take into account
the uncertainty in the models estimated at each client. In many situations,
however, especially in limited data settings, it is beneficial to take into
account the uncertainty in the client models for more accurate and robust
predictions. Uncertainty also provides useful information for other important
tasks, such as active learning and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We
present a framework for Bayesian federated learning where each client infers
the posterior predictive distribution using its training data and present
various ways to aggregate these client-specific predictive distributions at the
server. Since communicating and aggregating predictive distributions can be
challenging and expensive, our approach is based on distilling each client's
predictive distribution into a single deep neural network. This enables us to
leverage advances in standard federated learning to Bayesian federated learning
as well. Unlike some recent works that have tried to estimate model uncertainty
of each client, our work also does not make any restrictive assumptions, such
as the form of the client's posterior distribution. We evaluate our approach on

parameters that define these filters are trained end-to-end and optimized
specifically for the task of speaker verification. Compared to the standard
Mel-scale filter-bank, the filters' bandwidths and center frequencies are
adjustable. Experimental results show that applying the learnable acoustic

narrow-band information benefits the SV system performance. The proposed model
achieves a good balance between performance and computation cost. In

gathering requires that all robots reach the same, not predefined position. In
the related near-gathering task, they must reach distinct positions such that
every robot sees the entire swarm. In the considered setting, gathering can be
solved in $\mathcal{O}(n + \Delta^2)$ synchronous rounds both in two and three

In this work, we formalize a key property of efficient gathering protocols and

$\lambda$-contracting. Remarkably, our improved and generalized runtime bound
is independent of $n$ and $d$. The independence of $d$ answers an open research
question. We also introduce an approach to make any $\lambda$-contracting
protocol collisionfree to solve near-gathering. The resulting protocols
maintain the runtime of $\Theta (\Delta^2)$ and work even in the
semi-synchronous model.

representation. While deep RL should automatically acquire such good
representations, prior work often finds that learning representations in an

representation learning parts (e.g., auxiliary losses, data augmentation). How
can we design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In this
paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an existing RL
algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation learning methods can be cast as
RL algorithms in their own right. To do this, we build upon prior work and
apply contrastive representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in
such a way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly
corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea to
reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning, and then use
the idea to propose a much simpler method that achieves similar performance.
Across a range of goal-conditioned RL tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL
methods achieve higher success rates than prior non-contrastive methods,
including in the offline RL setting. We also show that contrastive RL
outperforms prior methods on image-based tasks, without using data augmentation

to sound naturally like the target speaker while maintaining the linguistic
content and the prosody of the source speech. However, current approaches are
insufficient to achieve comprehensive source prosody transfer and target
speaker timbre preservation in the converted speech, and the quality of the
converted speech is also unsatisfied due to the mismatch between the acoustic
model and the vocoder. In this paper, we leverage the recent advances in
information perturbation and propose a fully end-to-end approach to conduct
high-quality voice conversion. We first adopt information perturbation to
remove speaker-related information in the source speech to disentangle speaker
timbre and linguistic content and thus the linguistic information is
subsequently modeled by a content encoder. To better transfer the prosody of
the source speech to the target, we particularly introduce a speaker-related
pitch encoder which can maintain the general pitch pattern of the source
speaker while flexibly modifying the pitch intensity of the generated speech.
Finally, one-shot voice conversion is set up through continuous speaker space
modeling. Experimental results indicate that the proposed end-to-end approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of
intelligibility, naturalness, and speaker similarity.

requirements to ensure the model fulfils its desired purpose. In recent years,
simulation-based inference methods have emerged as powerful tools for
performing this task when the model likelihood function is intractable, as is
often the case for ABMs. In some real-world use cases of ABMs, both the
observed data and the ABM output consist of the agents' states and their
interactions over time. In such cases, there is a tension between the desire to
make full use of the rich information content of such granular data on the one
hand, and the need to reduce the dimensionality of the data to prevent
difficulties associated with high-dimensional learning tasks on the other. A
possible resolution is to construct lower-dimensional time-series through the
use of summary statistics describing the macrostate of the system at each time
point. However, a poor choice of summary statistics can result in an
unacceptable loss of information from the original dataset, dramatically
reducing the quality of the resulting calibration. In this work, we instead
propose to learn parameter posteriors associated with granular microdata
directly using temporal graph neural networks. We will demonstrate that such an
approach offers highly compelling inductive biases for Bayesian inference using
the raw ABM microstates as output.

growing attention in the community. Motivated by the tremendous success of deep
learning in clustering, one of the most fundamental machine learning tasks, and
the large number of recent advances in this direction, in this paper we conduct

the graphene nanoribbon due to the partial depopulation of the valence band
induced by the boron atoms. The transferred charge builds localized magnetic
moments around the boron atoms. The orthogonal symmetry of the spin-hosting

the trace of the product of the PSM and the transpose of the PPM. Based on
this, the spectral degree of coherence (SDOC) of the scattered field is further
analysed. We show that for a special case where the spatial distributions of
scattering potentials of different types of particles are similar and the same
is true of their density distributions, the PPM and the PSM will reduce to two
new matrices whose elements separately quantify degree of angular correlation
of the scattering potentials of particles and their density distributions, and
the number of species of particles in this special case as a scaled factor

(AMR). Until now, the alignment between a sentence and its AMR representation
has been explored in different ways, such as through rules or via the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the
ability of Transformer-based parsing models to yield effective alignments
without ad-hoc strategies. We present the first in-depth exploration of
cross-attention for AMR by proxy of alignment between the sentence spans and
the semantic units in the graph. We show how current Transformer-based parsers
implicitly encode the alignment information in the cross-attention weights and
how to leverage it to extract such alignment. Furthermore, we supervise and
guide cross-attention using alignment, dropping the need for English- and

multivariate logistic regression -- was used to stratify the mortality risk
among the high-risk patients identified in the first stage. Lactate

unexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be

obtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we
propose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation
captured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by
graph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between
collaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies
have been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient
through fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing
multiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets
curated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three

with an accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP)
trained against abundant reference data calculated at the quantum-mechanical
density-functional-theory level. The high efficiency of NEP allows us to study
the effects of finite size and quenching rate in the formation of a-Si in great

fragile due to the decoherence. Here, we show that a quantum autoencoder, which
is trained to compress a particular set of quantum entangled states into a
subspace that is robust to decoherence, can be employed to preserve
entanglement. The training process is based on a hybrid quantum-classical
approach to improve the efficiency in building the autoencoder and reduce the
experimental errors during the optimization. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in
diamond, we demonstrate that the entangled states between the electron and
nuclear spins can be encoded into the nucleus subspace which has much longer
coherence time. As a result, lifetime of the Bell states in this solid-spin
system is extended from 2.22 {\pm} 0.43 {\mu}s to 3.03 {\pm} 0.56 ms, yielding
a three orders of magnitude improvement. The quantum autoencoder approach is
universal, paving the way of utilizing long lifetime nuclear spins as
immediate-access quantum memories in quantum information tasks.

the automation of CMR analysis for biomarker extraction. However, most AI
algorithms are trained on a specific input domain (e.g., single scanner vendor
or hospital-tailored imaging protocol) and lack the robustness to perform
optimally when applied to CMR data from other input domains. METHODS: Our
proposed framework consists of an AI-based algorithm for biventricular
segmentation of short-axis images, followed by a post-analysis quality control
to detect erroneous results. The segmentation algorithm was trained on a large
dataset of clinical CMR scans from two NHS hospitals (n=2793) and validated on
additional cases from this dataset (n=441) and on five external datasets
(n=6808). The validation data included CMR scans of patients with a range of
diseases acquired at 12 different centres using CMR scanners from all major
vendors. RESULTS: Our method yielded median Dice scores over 87%, translating
into median absolute errors in cardiac biomarkers within the range of
inter-observer variability: <8.4mL (left ventricle), <9.2mL (right ventricle),
<13.3g (left ventricular mass), and <5.9% (ejection fraction) across all
datasets. Stratification of cases according to phenotypes of cardiac disease
and scanner vendors showed good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: We show that our
proposed tool, which combines a state-of-the-art AI algorithm trained on a
large-scale multi-domain CMR dataset with a post-analysis quality control,
allows us to robustly deal with routine clinical data from multiple centres,
vendors, and cardiac diseases. This is a fundamental step for the clinical
translation of AI algorithms. Moreover, our method yields a range of additional
biomarkers of cardiac function (filling and ejection rates, regional wall
motion, and strain) at no extra computational cost.

unrelated widgets, but rather partitions discrete widgets into groups by
various visual cues, thus forming higher-order perceptual units such as tab,
menu, card or list. The ability to automatically segment a GUI into perceptual
groups of widgets constitutes a fundamental component of visual intelligence to
automate GUI design, implementation and automation tasks. Although humans can
partition a GUI into meaningful perceptual groups of widgets in a highly
reliable way, perceptual grouping is still an open challenge for computational
approaches. Existing methods rely on ad-hoc heuristics or supervised machine
learning that is dependent on specific GUI implementations and runtime
information. Research in psychology and biological vision has formulated a set
of principles (i.e., Gestalt theory of perception) that describe how humans
group elements in visual scenes based on visual cues like connectivity,
similarity, proximity and continuity. These principles are domain-independent
and have been widely adopted by practitioners to structure content on GUIs to
improve aesthetic pleasant and usability. Inspired by these principles, we
present a novel unsupervised image-based method for inferring perceptual groups
of GUI widgets. Our method requires only GUI pixel images, is independent of
GUI implementation, and does not require any training data. The evaluation on a
dataset of 1,091 GUIs collected from 772 mobile apps and 20 UI design mockups
shows that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ad-hoc
heuristics-based baseline. Our perceptual grouping method creates the
opportunities for improving UI-related software engineering tasks.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The lack of a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of the cerebellum has
hampered studies of cerebellar involvement in normal brain function and
disease. A good representation of the tightly foliated aspect of the cerebellar
cortex is difficult to achieve because of the highly convoluted surface and the
time it would take for manual delineation. The quality of manual segmentation
is influenced by human expert judgment, and automatic labelling is constrained
by the limited robustness of existing segmentation algorithms. The
20umisotropic BigBrain dataset provides an unprecedented high resolution
framework for semantic segmentation compared to the 1000um(1mm) resolution
afforded by magnetic resonance imaging. To dispense with the manual annotation
requirement, we propose to train a model to adaptively transfer the annotation
from the cerebellum on the Allen Brain Human Brain Atlas to the BigBrain in an
unsupervised manner, taking into account the different staining and spacing
between sections. The distinct visual discrepancy between the Allen Brain and
BigBrain prevents existing approaches to provide meaningful segmentation masks,
and artifacts caused by sectioning and histological slice preparation in the
BigBrain data pose an extra challenge. To address these problems, we propose a
two-stage framework where we first transfer the Allen Brain cerebellum to a
space sharing visual similarity with the BigBrain. We then introduce a
self-training strategy with a confidence map to guide the model learning from
the noisy pseudo labels iteratively. Qualitative results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, and quantitative experiments reveal that our
method can achieve over 2.6% loss reduction compared with other approaches.

scarcity often encountered in machine learning. In the application of

optimization of optoelectronic thin films with autonomous workflows, data
scarcity occurs especially for new materials. To achieve high-throughput
thickness characterization, we propose a machine learning model called
thicknessML that predicts thickness from UV-Vis spectrophotometry input and an
overarching transfer learning workflow. We demonstrate the transfer learning
workflow from generic source domain of generic band-gapped materials to
specific target domain of perovskite materials, where the target domain data
only come from limited number (18) of refractive indices from literature. The
target domain can be easily extended to other material classes with a few
literature data. Defining thickness prediction accuracy to be within-10%
deviation, thicknessML achieves 92.2% (with a deviation of 3.6%) accuracy with
transfer learning compared to 81.8% (with a deviation of 3.6%) 11.7% without

deposited perovskite films also corroborates the efficacy of the proposed
workflow by yielding a 10.5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Classifying abnormal rhythms is a laborious process prone to error. Therefore,
tools that perform automated classification with high accuracy are highly
desirable. The work presented classifies five different types of ECG arrhythmia
based on AAMI EC57 standard and using the MIT-BIH data set. These include
non-ectopic (normal), supraventricular, ventricular, fusion, and unknown beat.
By appropriately transforming pre-processed ECG waveforms into a rich feature
space along with appropriate post-processing and utilizing deep convolutional
neural networks post fine-tuning and hyperparameter selection, it is shown that
highly accurate classification for the five waveform types can be obtained.
Performance on the test set indicated higher overall accuracy (98.62%), as well
as better performance in classifying each of the five waveforms than hitherto

satellite systems is regularly used in many platforms such as drones, land
vehicles, and marine vessels. The fusion is commonly carried out in a
model-based extended Kalman filter framework. One of the critical parameters of
the filter is the process noise covariance. It is responsible for the real-time
solution accuracy, as it considers both vehicle dynamics uncertainty and the
inertial sensors quality. In most situations, the process noise is covariance
assumed to be constant. Yet, due to vehicle dynamics and sensor measurement
variations throughout the trajectory, the process noise covariance is subject
to change. To cope with such situations, several adaptive model-based Kalman
filters were suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
model and learning-based adaptive navigation filter. We rely on the model-based
Kalman filter and design a deep neural network model to tune the momentary
system noise covariance matrix, based only on the inertial sensor readings.
Once the process noise covariance is learned, it is plugged into the
well-established, model-based Kalman filter. After deriving the proposed hybrid
framework, field experiment results using a quadrotor are presented and a
comparison to model-based adaptive approaches is given. We show that the
proposed method obtained an improvement of 25% in the position error.
Furthermore, the proposed hybrid learning method can be used in any navigation
filter and also in any relevant estimation problem.

significant research content, both for equipment design, manufacturing, usage
and maintenance. Universal Generating Function (UGF) is an important method in
the reliability analysis, which efficiently obtains the system reliability by a
fast algebraic procedure. However, when structural relationships between
subsystems or components are not clear or without explicit expressions, the UGF
method is difficult to use or not applicable at all. Bayesian Network (BN) has
a natural advantage in terms of uncertainty inference for the relationship
without explicit expressions. For the number of components is extremely large,
though, it has the defects of low efficiency. To overcome the respective
defects of UGF and BN, a novel reliability analysis method called UGF-BN is
proposed for the complex MSS. In the UGF-BN framework, the UGF method is
firstly used to analyze the bottom components with a large number. Then
probability distributions obtained are taken as the input of BN. Finally, the
reliability of the complex MSS is modeled by the BN method. This proposed
method improves the computational efficiency, especially for the MSS with the
large number of bottom components. Besides, the aircraft reliability-based
design optimization based on the UGF-BN method is further studied with budget
constraints on mass, power, and cost. Finally, two cases are used to
demonstrate and verify the proposed method.

for the construction of neuromorphic photonic information processing systems,
due to their numerous desirable properties such as low power consumption, high
modulation speed, compactness, and ease of manufacturing. Of particular
interest is the ability of VCSELs to exhibit neural-like spiking responses,
much like biological neurons, but at ultrafast sub-nanosecond rates; thus
offering great prospects for high-speed light-enabled neuromorphic
(spike-based) processors. Recent works have shown the use the spiking dynamics
in VCSELs for pattern recognition and image processing problems such as image
data encoding and edge-feature detection. Additionally, VCSELs have also been
used recently as nonlinear elements in photonic reservoir computing (RC)
implementations, yielding excellent state of the art operation. This work
introduces and experimentally demonstrates for the first time the new concept
of a Ghz-rate photonic spiking neural network (SNN) built with a single VCSEL
neuron. The reported system effectively implements a photonic VCSEL-based
spiking reservoir computer, and demonstrates its successful application to a
complex nonlinear classification task. Importantly, the proposed system
benefits from a highly hardware-friendly, inexpensive realization (built with a
single VCSEL and off-the-shelf fibre-optic components), for high-speed
