heretofore inadequately explored practical aspects such as: relay sampling and
topology placement, network churn, and risks due to real-world usage patterns.
We show that, due to the lack of incorporating these aspects, Mixnets of this

to reason and resolve these issues, we model Mixnets as a three-stage
``Sample-Placement-Forward'' pipeline, and using the results of our evaluation
propose a novel Mixnet design, Bow-Tie. Bow-Tie mitigates user deanonymization
through a novel adaption of Tor's guard design with an engineered guard layer
and client guard-logic for stratified mixnets. We show that Bow-Tie has
significantly higher user anonymity in the dynamic setting, where the Mixnet is
used over a period of time, and is no worse in the static setting, where the
user only sends a single message. We show the necessity of both the guard layer
and client guard-logic in tandem as well as their individual effect when
incorporated into other reference designs. Ultimately, Bow-Tie is a significant
step towards addressing the gap between the design of Mixnets and practical
deployment and wider adoption because it directly addresses real-world user and

such structures analytically and by numerical simulations. A crucial challenge
is to keep the beam focused, especially in direction of the narrow channel. An
alternating phase focusing scheme is optimized for this purpose and matched
lattice functions are obtained. We distinguish synchronous operation with phase
jumps in the grating and asynchronous operation with a strictly periodic
grating and well-designed synchronicity mismatch. Especially the asynchronous
DLA undulator is a promising approach, since a simple, commercially available
grating suffices for the focusing lattice design. We pave the way towards
experiments of radiation generation in these structures and provide estimates
of the emitted radiation wavelength and power. The analytical models are
validated by numerical simulations in the dedicated DLA simulation tool

years, allowing for the identification of different mechanisms and the

generally accepted that there is an intrinsic mechanism that is insensitive to

give highly accurate predictions. Another important but more extrinsic
mechanism, called ballistic current, is also attracting a lot of attention, but
due to the complicated scattering processes, its numerical calculation for real
materials is only made possible quite recently. In addition, an intrinsic
ballistic current, usually referred to as injection current, will appear under
circularly-polarized light and has wide application in experiments. In this
article, experiments that are pertinent to the theory development are reviewed,

interactions between $1M_{\odot}$ stars and binary black holes (BBHs) in the
gravitational wave regime, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE) or a
pure scattering, focusing on the accretion rates, the back reaction on the BH
binary orbital parameters and the increase in the binary BH effective spin. We
find that TDEs can make a significant impact on the binary orbit, which is
often different from that of pure scattering. Binaries experiencing a prograde
(retrograde) TDE tend to be widened (hardened) by up to $\simeq 20\%$.
Initially circular binaries become more eccentric by $\lesssim 10\%$ by a
prograde or retrograde TDE, whereas the eccentricity of initially eccentric
binaries increases (decreases) by a retrograde (prograde) TDE by $\lesssim
5\%$. Overall a single TDE can generally result in changes of the gravitational
wave-driven merger time scale by order unity. The accretion rates of both black
holes are very highly super-Eddington, showing modulations (preferentially for
retrograde TDEs) on a time scale of the orbital period, which can be a
characteristic feature of BBH-driven TDEs. Prograde TDEs result in the

many domains encountered in scientific computations. In this paper, we present
a unifying deep learning framework built upon a richer data structure that
includes widely adopted topological domains.
  Specifically, we first introduce combinatorial complexes, a novel type of
topological domain. Combinatorial complexes can be seen as generalizations of
graphs that maintain certain desirable properties. Similar to hypergraphs,
combinatorial complexes impose no constraints on the set of relations. In
addition, combinatorial complexes permit the construction of hierarchical
higher-order relations, analogous to those found in simplicial and cell
complexes. Thus, combinatorial complexes generalize and combine useful traits
of both hypergraphs and cell complexes, which have emerged as two promising
abstractions that facilitate the generalization of graph neural networks to
topological spaces.
  Second, building upon combinatorial complexes and their rich combinatorial
and algebraic structure, we develop a general class of message-passing
combinatorial complex neural networks (CCNNs), focusing primarily on
attention-based CCNNs. We characterize permutation and orientation
equivariances of CCNNs, and discuss pooling and unpooling operations within
CCNNs in detail.
  Third, we evaluate the performance of CCNNs on tasks related to mesh shape
analysis and graph learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNNs have
competitive performance as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models
specifically tailored to the same tasks. Our findings demonstrate the
advantages of incorporating higher-order relations into deep learning models in
different applications.

recently proposed `smeared space' model of quantum geometry. The model
introduces additional degrees of freedom to describe the quantum state of the
background and gives rise to both the generalised uncertainty principle (GUP)
and extended uncertainty principle (EUP) without introducing modified
commutation relations. We compare our results to previous studies of the
Hausdorff dimension in GUP models based on modified commutators and show that
the minimum length enters the relevant formulae in a different way. We then
determine the Hausdorff dimension of the particle path in smeared momentum
space, $\tilde{D}_{\rm H}$, and show that the minimum momentum is dual to the
minimum length. For sufficiently coarse grained paths, $D_{\rm H} =
\tilde{D}_{\rm H} = 2$, as in canonical quantum mechanics. However, as the
resolutions approach the minimum scales, the dimensions of the paths in each
representation differ, in contrast to their counterparts in the canonical
theory. The GUP-induced corrections increase $D_{\rm H}$ whereas the
EUP-induced corrections decrease $\tilde{D}_{\rm H}$, relative to their
canonical values, and the extremal case corresponds to $D_{\rm H} = 3$,
$\tilde{D}_{\rm H} = 1$. These results show that the GUP and the EUP affect the
fractal properties of the particle path in fundamentally different, yet
complimentary, ways.

these features try to explain them as consequence of evolutionary mechanisms,
recently it was proposed that they could be `relics' of some primordial genome

attention to the S-H model, which is, up to the date, the unique model proposed
as a possible explanation for intra-strand parity and strand compositional
asymmetries in primordial genomes as mere consequence of randomness under
chemical/physical constraints. In particular, we shall discuss possible
directions to test some of the hypotheses of the S-H model, and we will present
a possible formulation of the S-H model as an evolutive model too.

development of artificial nanomotors. However, theory and experiments report
conflicting findings regarding their dynamics. The lack of consensus is mostly
caused by a limited understanding of specifics of self-propulsion mechanisms at
the nanoscale. Here, we study a generic model of a self-propelled nanoparticle
that does not rely on a particular mechanism. Instead, its main assumption is
the fundamental symmetry of microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions: the
principle of microscopic reversibility. Significant consequences of this
assumption arise if we subject the particle to an action of an external
time-periodic force. The particle diffusion coefficient is then enhanced
compared to the unbiased dynamics. The enhancement can be controlled by the
force amplitude and frequency. We also derive the power spectrum of particle
trajectories. Among new effects stemming from the microscopic reversibility are
the enhancement of the spectrum at all frequencies and sigmoid-shaped
transitions and a peak at characteristic frequencies of rotational diffusion
and external forcing. The microscopic reversibility is a generic property of a
broad class of chemical reactions, therefore we expect that the presented
results will motivate new experimental studies aimed at testing of our
predictions. This could provide new insights into dynamics of catalytic

symplectic geometry for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists
interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g. the three-body problem). The
main directions pursued in this article are: (1) given two periodic orbits,
decide when they can be connected by a regular family; (2) use numerical
invariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the
presence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign +/- to each elliptic or hyperbolic
Floquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, generalizing the classical
Krein--Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the
above in a visual, easily implementable and resource-efficient way. The
mathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors, where the
``Broucke stability diagram'' was rediscovered, but further refined with the
above signs, and algebraically reformulated in terms of GIT quotients of the
symplectic group. The advantage of the above framework is that it applies to
the study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. Moreover, in the
case where the system admits symmetries in the form of ``reflections'', i.e.
anti-symplectic involutions, which is the case for many systems of interest,
the information provided for orbits which are symmetric is richer, and one may
distinguish more symmetric orbits. This is the case for several well-known
families in the space mission design industry, such as the Halo orbits, which
are ubiquitous in real-life space missions. We will carry out numerical work
based on the cell-mapping method, for the Jupiter-Europa and the
Saturn-Enceladus systems. These are currently systems of interest, falling in
the agenda of space agencies like NASA, as these icy moons are considered
candidates for harbouring conditions suitable for extraterrestrial life.

of qubits situated in a one-dimensional array that interact through
variable-range XY interactions. The method proposed is based on repeated
evolution followed by a measurement on the single accessible qubit, which has
the potential to reduce the temperature in the rest of the subsystems, thereby
demonstrating cooling in the device. The performance of the refrigerator is
quantified by the fidelity of each local subsystem with the ground state of the
local Hamiltonian and the corresponding probability of success. We identify
system parameters, which include the interaction strength, range of
interactions, initial temperature of each qubit, and the position of the
measured qubit, so that the fidelities of all the unmeasured qubits approach
unity with a nonvanishing probability. We observe that although strong
interactions during evolution are required to achieve cooling, the long-range
interactions typically deteriorate the performance of the refrigerator, which
indicates that interactions are not ubiquitous. We report the scalability and
the saturation property of the success probability with respect to the system
size, which turns out to be independent of the involved system parameters and
the number of repeated measurements. Furthermore, we show that the number of
subsystems which can be cooled changes depending on the odd or even number of

to study an original concept of a hybrid accelerometer associating a
state-of-the-art electrostatic accelerometer (EA) and a promising quantum
sensor based on cold atom interferometry. To assess the performance potential
of such instrument, numerical simulations have been performed to determine its
impact in term of gravity field retrieval. Taking advantage of the long term
stability of the cold atom interferometer (CAI), it has been shown that the
reduced drift of the hybrid sensor could lead to improved gravity field
retrieval. Nevertheless this gain vanishes once temporal variations of the
gravity field and related aliasing effects are taken into account. Improved
de-aliasing models or some specific satellite constellations are then required
to maximize the impact of the accelerometer performance gain. To evaluate the
achievable acceleration performance in orbit, a numerical simulator of the
hybrid accelerometer has been developed and preliminary results are given. The
instrument simulator has been in part validated by reproducing the performance
achieved with a hybrid lab prototype operating on ground. The problematic of
satellite rotation impact on the CAI has been also investigated both with
instrument performance simulations and experimental demonstrations. It has been
shown that the proposed configuration, where the EA's proof-mass acts as the
reference mirror for the CAI, seems a promising approach to allow the
mitigation of satellite rotation. A preliminary design has been elaborated
along with a preliminary error, mass, volume and electrical power consumption

polydispersity has very little effect on the intercalation behavior yet leads
to capacity loss during the conversion reaction. We provide the code as an

computational cost of Hamiltonian analysis can obstruct the identification of
these modes. A computer algebra implementation of the Hamiltonian constraint
algorithm for curvature and torsion theories is presented. These non-Riemannian
or Poincar\'e gauge theories suffer notoriously from strong coupling. The
implementation forms a package (the `Hamiltonian Gauge Gravity Surveyor' -
HiGGS) for the xAct tensor manipulation suite in Mathematica. Poisson brackets
can be evaluated in parallel, meaning that Hamiltonian analysis can be done on
silicon, and at scale. Accordingly HiGGS is designed to survey the whole
Lagrangian space with high-performance computing resources (clusters and
supercomputers). To demonstrate this, the space of `outlawed' Poincar\'e gauge
theories is surveyed, in which a massive parity-even/odd vector or parity-odd
tensor torsion particle accompanies the usual graviton. The survey spans
possible configurations of teleparallel-style multiplier fields which might be
used to kill-off the strongly coupled modes, with the results to be analysed in
subsequent work. All brackets between the known primary and secondary
constraints of all theories are made available for future study. Demonstrations
are also given for using HiGGS - on a desktop computer - to run the
Dirac-Bergmann algorithm on specific theories, such as Einstein-Cartan theory

detailed analysis of its characteristic photon energy where the spectral index
changes significantly. We used the observations of the source by Swift-XRT from
2008 to 2019 to identify the characteristic photon energy and the corresponding
spectral indices. The spectra in the energy range 0.3-10.0 keV can be well
fitted by a log parabola as well as a smooth broken power-law. From the smooth
broken power-law spectral fit we show that the spectral indices before and
after the characteristic photon energy are strongly anti-correlated. Further,
the spectral curvature measured at the characteristic photon energy indicates
an anti-correlation with the low energy spectral index while the high energy
spectral index shows a positive correlation. These findings are at variance
with a simple radiative loss interpretation for the characteristic photon
energy, and alternative scenarios are thus discussed. Though these scenarios
are in principle capable of reproducing the correlation results, they deviate
significantly from the observed properties.

comparable with those of quiescent galaxies (QGs). After controlling redshift
and stellar mass, the sizes of PSBs are $\sim 13\%$ smaller on average than
those of QGs, such differences become larger and significant towards the
low-$M_*$ end, especially at $10^{9.5}~M_{\odot} \lesssim M_*\lesssim
10^{10.5}~M_{\odot}$ where PSBs can be on average $\sim 19\%$ smaller than QGs.
In comparison with predictions of possible PSB evolutionary pathways from
cosmological simulations, we suggest that a fast quenching of star formation
following a short-lived starburst event (might be induced by major merger)
should be the dominated pathway of our PSB sample. Furthermore, by
cross-matching with group catalogs, we confirm that local PSBs at
$M_*\lesssim10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ are more clustered than more massive ones. PSBs
resided in groups are found to be slightly larger in galaxy size and more
disk-like compared to field PSBs, which is qualitatively consistent with and
thus hints the environment-driven fast quenching pathway for group PSBs. Taken
together, our results support multiple evolutionary pathways for local PSB
galaxies: while massive PSBs are thought of as products of fast quenching
following a major merger-induced starburst, environment-induced fast quenching
should play a role in the evolution of less massive PSBs, especially at

vectors is often inefficient and does not provide error bounds. Thus, we
address the problem of computing a finite set of weight vectors such that for

of the optimal cost as a function of the weight vector, including its
continuity and concavity. Using these, we propose an algorithm that greedily

State-of-the-art neural implicit methods allow for high-quality reconstructions
of simple scenes from many input views. Yet, their performance drops
significantly for larger and more complex scenes and scenes captured from
sparse viewpoints. This is caused primarily by the inherent ambiguity in the
RGB reconstruction loss that does not provide enough constraints, in particular
in less-observed and textureless areas. Motivated by recent advances in the
area of monocular geometry prediction, we systematically explore the utility
these cues provide for improving neural implicit surface reconstruction. We
demonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by general-purpose monocular
estimators, significantly improve reconstruction quality and optimization time.
Further, we analyse and investigate multiple design choices for representing

  Towards Causal Explanations of Probabilistic Forecasts",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Forecasting tasks surrounding the dynamics of low-level human behavior are of
significance to multiple research domains. In such settings, methods for
explaining specific forecasts can enable domain experts to gain insights into
the predictive relationships between behaviors. In this work, we introduce and
address the following question: given a probabilistic forecasting model how can
we identify observed windows that the model considers salient when making its
forecasts? We build upon a general definition of information-theoretic saliency
grounded in human perception and extend it to forecasting settings by
leveraging a crucial attribute of the domain: a single observation can result
in multiple valid futures. We propose to express the saliency of an observed
window in terms of the differential entropy of the resulting predicted future
distribution. In contrast to existing methods that either require explicit
training of the saliency mechanism or access to the internal states of the
forecasting model, we obtain a closed-form solution for the saliency map for
commonly used density functions in probabilistic forecasting. We empirically
demonstrate how our framework can recover salient observed windows from head
pose features for the sample task of speaking-turn forecasting using a
synthesized conversation dataset.

during the prompt phase in GRBs are still unsettled. In order to perform an
unambiguous physical modelling of observations, a clear identification of the
emission mechanism is needed. An instance of a clear identification is the
synchrotron emission during the very strong flare in GRB160821A, that occurs
during the prompt phase at 135 s. Here we show that the distribution of the
radiating electrons in this flare is initially very narrow, but later develops
a power-law tail of accelerated electrons. We thus identify for the first time
the onset of particle acceleration in a GRB jet. The flare is consistent with a
late energy release from the central engine causing an external-shock as it
encounters a preexisting ring nebula of a progenitor Wolf-Rayet star.
Relativistic forward and reverse shocks develop, leading to two distinct
emission zones with similar properties. The particle acceleration only occurs
in the forward shock, moving into the dense nebula matter. Here, the
magnetisation also decreases below the critical value, which allows for Fermi
acceleration to operate. Using this fact, we find a bulk Lorentz factor of $420
\simleq \Gamma \simleq 770$, and an emission radius of $R \sim 10^{18}$ cm,
indicating a tenuous gas of the immediate circumburst surrounding. The
observation of the onset of particle acceleration thus gives new and
independent constraints on the properties of the flow as well as on theories of
particle acceleration in collisionless astrophysical shocks.

of available interstellar medium (ISM) gas and its physical state. Conversely,
the ISM's physical state depends on the SFR, because the ""feedback"" energy and
momentum injected by recently-formed massive stars is crucial to offsetting
losses from turbulent dissipation and radiative cooling. The ISM's physical
state also responds to the gravitational field that confines it, with increased
weight driving higher pressure. In a quasi-steady state, it is expected that
the mean total pressure of different thermal phases will match each other, that
the component pressures and total pressure will satisfy thermal and dynamical
equilibrium requirements, and that the SFR will adjust as needed to provide the
requisite stellar radiation and supernova feedback. The pressure-regulated,
feedback-modulated (PRFM) theory of the star-forming ISM formalizes these
ideas, leading to a prediction that the SFR per unit area, Sigma_SFR, will
scale nearly linearly with ISM weight W. In terms of large-scale gas surface
density Sigma, stellar plus dark matter density rho_sd, and effective ISM
velocity dispersion sigma_eff, an observable weight estimator is W~P_DE=pi G
Sigma^2/2+Sigma(2G rho_sd)^{1/2} sigma_eff, and this is predicted to match the

final MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) IFU sample. The counter-rotators
tend to located in small groups. The gaseous counter-rotators have intermediate
stellar masses and and located in the green valley and red sequence of the
color magnitude diagram. The average vertical extents of the stellar and
ionized gas disks are the same as for the rest of the sample while their radial
gas and stellar distributions are more centrally concentrated. This may point
at angular momentum loss during the formation process of the counter-rotating
disks. The counter-rotators have low gas and dust content, weak emission line
strengths, and low star formation rates. This suggests that the formation of
counter-rotators may be an efficient way to quench galaxies. One
counter-rotator, SDSS J080016.09+292817.1 (Galaxy F), has a post starburst
region and a possible AGN at the center. Another counter-rotator, SDSS
J131234.03+482159.8 (Galaxy H), is identified as a potential on-going galaxy
interaction with its companion satellite galaxy, a gas rich spiral galaxy. This
may be representative case of a gaseous counter-rotator forming through a
merger origin. However, tidal distortions expected in mergers are only found in
a few of the galaxies and we cannot rule out direct gas accretion as another
formation mechanism.

approximately parallel to the bipolar outflow that is observed in scattered IR

350 $\mu$m polarimetry and find that the 10,000 au scale H-band data match the
smaller scale 350 $\mu$m data, indicating that the collapse of L483 is
magnetically regulated on these larger scales. We also present high-resolution
1.3 mm ALMA data of L483 which reveals it is a close binary star with a
separation of 34 au. The plane of the binary of L483 is observed to be
approximately parallel to the twisted field in the inner 1000 au. Comparing
this result to the $\sim$ 1000 au protostellar envelope, we find that the
envelope is roughly perpendicular to the 1000 au HAWC+ field. Using the data
presented, we speculate that L483 initially formed as a wide binary and the
companion star migrated to its current position, causing an extreme shift in
angular momentum thereby producing the twisted magnetic field morphology
observed. More observations are needed to further test this scenario.

10 arcseconds, limited only by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. This increases
the sky-coverage of GRAVITY by two orders of magnitude, opening up

extragalactic sky. The first observations in 2019 - 2022 include first infrared
interferometry of two redshift $z\sim2$ quasars, interferometric imaging on the
binary system HD 105913A, and repeated observations of multiple star systems in
the Orion Trapezium Cluster. We find the coherence loss between the science
object and fringe-tracking reference star well described by the turbulence of
the Earth's atmosphere. We confirm that the larger apertures of the UTs result
in higher visibilities for a given separation due to larger overlap of the
projected pupils on sky and give predictions for visibility loss as a function
of separation to be used for future planning.

well-known Tracy-Widom distribution for the lowest eigenvalue of Gaussian
random Hermitian matrices, which appears in a very diverse set of physical and
mathematical contexts. Similarly, it is expected that the new distribution
characterizes a type of universality that can arise in various gravity

  Offline RL",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that explicitly
clones a behavior policy to constrain value learning. In offline RL, it is
often important to prevent a policy from selecting unobserved actions, since
the consequence of these actions cannot be presumed without additional
information about the environment. One straightforward way to implement such a
constraint is to explicitly model a given data distribution via behavior
cloning and directly force a policy not to select uncertain actions. However,
many offline RL methods instantiate the constraint indirectly -- for example,
pessimistic value estimation -- due to a concern about errors when modeling a
potentially complex behavior policy. In this work, we argue that it is not only
viable but beneficial to explicitly model the behavior policy for offline RL
because the constraint can be realized in a stable way with the trained model.
We first suggest a theoretical framework that allows us to incorporate
behavior-cloned models into value-based offline RL methods, enjoying the
strength of both explicit behavior cloning and value learning. Then, we propose
a practical method utilizing a score-based generative model for behavior
cloning. With the proposed method, we show state-of-the-art performance on
several datasets within the D4RL and Robomimic benchmarks and achieve
competitive performance across all datasets tested.

We argue that the inherent path-dependence of this statement can be addressed
when combining the Distance Conjecture with the recent Tameness Conjecture. The
latter asserts that effective theories are described by tame geometry and
implements strong finiteness constraints on coupling functions and field
spaces. By exploiting these tameness constraints we argue that the region near
the infinite distance point admits a decomposition into finitely many sectors
in which path-independent statements for the associated towers of states can be
established. We then introduce a more constrained class of tame functions with
at most polynomial asymptotic growth and argue that they suffice to describe
the known string theory effective actions. Remarkably, the multi-field
dependence of such functions can be reconstructed by one-dimensional linear
test paths in each sector near the boundary. In four-dimensional effective
theories, these test paths are traced out as a discrete set of cosmic string
solutions. This indicates that such cosmic string solutions can serve as
powerful tool to study the near-boundary field space region of any
four-dimensional effective field theory. To illustrate these general
observations we discuss the central role of tameness and cosmic string
solutions in Calabi-Yau compactifications of Type IIB string theory.

runtimes such as GPU, and language constraints. However, we also found that
more resources may be required to run the Docker images for building ML-based

delicate issue of dynamic sample selection in the evaluation of the gradient in
conjunction with inexact solutions to the SQP subproblems. Under reasonable
assumptions on the quality of the employed gradient approximations and the
accuracy of the solutions to the SQP subproblems, we establish global
convergence results for the proposed method. Motivated by these results, the
second part of the paper describes a practical adaptive inexact stochastic
sequential quadratic programming (PAIS-SQP) method. We propose criteria for
controlling the sample size and the accuracy in the solutions of the SQP
subproblems based on estimates of the variance in the stochastic gradient

the performance of the practical method on a subset of the CUTE problems and
constrained classification tasks.

using dirty-paper coding and stochastic encoding. However, K factorial encoding

the problem intractable. In addition, even though the capacity region is known,

dark energy era on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves.
The early dark energy era, which we choose it to have a constant equation of
state parameter $w$, is synergistically generated by an appropriate $f(R)$
gravity in the presence of matter and radiation perfect fluids. As we
demonstrate, the predicted signal for the energy spectrum of the $f(R)$
primordial gravitational waves is amplified and can be detectable, for various
reheating temperatures, especially for large reheating temperatures. The signal
amplitude depends on the duration of the early dark energy era and on the value
of the dark energy equation of state parameter, with the most latter affecting
more crucially the amplification. Specifically the amplification occurs when
the equation of state parameter approaches the de Sitter value $w=-1$.
Regarding the duration of the early dark energy era, we find that the largest
amplification occurs when the early dark energy era commences at a temperature
$T=0.85\,$eV until $T=7.8\,$eV. Moreover we study a similar scenario in which
amplification occurs, where the early dark energy era commences at $T=0.29\,$eV
and lasts until the temperature is increased by $\Delta T\sim 1.7\,$eV.

has enabled a wide range of high-throughput biochemical processes. Unlike solid
wells typically used in current biochemical assays, droplets are subject to
instability and can undergo breakup, especially under fast flow conditions.
Although the physics of single drops has been studied extensively, the flow of
crowded drops or concentrated emulsions, where droplet volume fraction exceeds
80 percent, is relatively unexplored in microfluidics. In this article and the
related invited lecture from the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Physical
Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics, we describe the collective behavior of
drops in a concentrated emulsion by tracking the dynamics and the fate of
individual drops within the emulsion. At the slow flow limit of the
concentrated emulsion, we observe an unexpected order, where the velocity of
individual drops in the emulsion exhibits spatiotemporal periodicity. As the
flow rate increases, the emulsion transitions from a solid-like to a
liquid-like material, and the spatiotemporal order in the flow is lost. At the
fast flow limit, droplet breakup starts to occur. We show that droplet breakup
within the emulsion follows a probability distribution, in stark contrast to
the deterministic behavior in classical single-drop studies. In addition to
capillary number and viscosity ratio, break-up probability is governed by a
confinement factor that measures drop size relative to a characteristic channel
length. The breakup probability arises from the time-varying packing
configuration of the drops. Finally, we discuss recent progress in computation
methods for recapitulating the flow of concentrated emulsions.

is affected by galaxy clustering, decreasing with fainter, more distant
galaxies, and by Solar System emissions and Galactic dust, which dominate the

enables an accurate measurement of the kinematic near-IR CIB dipole. The CIB,
effectively the integrated galaxy light (IGL), would be reconstructed from
resolved galaxies in the forthcoming space-borne wide surveys covering four
bands 0.9 to 2.5 micron. The galaxies will be sub-selected from the identified

more computationally expensive, alternative to Density Functional Theory (DFT)
for energy predictions of catalytic systems. A major computational bottleneck
in the use of DMC for catalysis is the need to perform finite-size
extrapolations by simulating increasingly large periodic cells (supercells) to
eliminate many-body finite-size effects and obtain energies in the
thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that this computational cost can be
significantly reduced by leveraging the cancellation of many-body finite-size
errors that accompanies the evaluation of energy differences when calculating
quantities like binding energies and mapping potential energy surfaces. We test
the error cancellation and convergence in two well-known adsorbate/slab
systems, H2O/LiH(001) and CO/Pt(111). Based on this, we identify strategies for
obtaining binding energies in the thermodynamic limit that optimize error
cancellation to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We then predict
the correct order of adsorption site preference on CO/Pt(111), a challenging
problem for DFT. Our accurate, inexpensive DMC calculations recover the top >
bridge > hollow site order, in agreement with experimental observations. We
proceed to map the potential energy surface of CO hopping between Pt(111)
adsorption sites. This reveals the existence of an L-shaped top-bridge-hollow
diffusion trajectory characterized by energy barriers that provide an
additional kinetic justification for experimental observations of CO/Pt(111)
adsorption. Overall, this work demonstrates that it is routinely possible to
achieve order-of-magnitude speedups and memory savings in DMC calculations by
taking advantage of error cancellation in the calculation of energy differences

cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, to weigh the different physical processes
that define the pattern of the angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropies. We use six phenomenological amplitudes to
account for the Sachs-Wolfe, early and late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe,
polarization contribution, Doppler and lensing effects. To do so, we have
adapted the CLASS Boltzmann code and used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampler of Cobaya to explore the Planck 2018 likelihood to constrain different
combinations of cosmological and phenomenological parameters. Observing
deviations of the mean values of the phenomenological amplitudes from the
predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model could be useful to resolve existing
cosmological tensions. For the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the
physical processes of the CMB has been performed using the Planck 2018
temperature, polarization and lensing power spectra. In a previous work, the
phenomenological amplitudes were constrained using only the TT data, however,
by including the polarization and lensing data we find that the constraints on
these physical contributions are tighter. In addition, some degeneracies that
appear only when considering TT data are completely broken by taking into
account all Planck 2018 data. Consequently, models with more than three
phenomenological amplitudes can be studied, which is prohibitive when only the
temperature power spectrum is used. The results presented in this paper show
that the Planck experiment can constrain all phenomenological amplitudes except
the late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. No inconsistencies were found with the
$\Lambda$CDM model, and the largest improvements were obtained for the models
that include the lensing parameter, $A_L$.

system and may also have been a feature of Earth's past. However, relatively
little is understood about the dynamics of these ice-covered oceans, which
affect not only the physical environment but also any potential life and its
detectability. A number of studies have simulated the circulation of icy-world
oceans, but have come to seemingly widely different conclusions. To better
understand and narrow down these diverging results, we discuss energetic
constraints for the circulation on ice-covered oceans, focusing in particular
on Snowball Earth, Europa, and Enceladus. Energy input that can drive ocean
circulation on ice-covered bodies can be associated with heat and salt fluxes
at the boundaries as well as ocean tides and librations. We show that heating
from the solid core balanced by heat loss through the ice sheet can drive an
ocean circulation, but the resulting flows would be relatively weak and
strongly affected by rotation. Salt fluxes associated with freezing and melting
at the ice sheet boundary are unlikely to energetically drive a circulation,
although they can shape the large-scale circulation when combined with
turbulent mixing. Ocean tides and librations may provide an energy source for
such turbulence, but the magnitude of this energy source remains highly
uncertain for the icy moons, which poses a major obstacle to predicting the
ocean dynamics of icy worlds and remains as an important topic for future
research.

model that fits data distributed on the nodes of a graph. We focus on Federated
Learning (FL) as a canonical application. One of the main challenges of FL is
the communication bottleneck between the nodes and the parameter server. A
popular solution in the literature is to allow each node to do several local
updates on the model in each iteration before sending it back to the PS. While
this mitigates the communication bottleneck, the statistical heterogeneity of
the data owned by the different nodes has proven to delay convergence and bias
the model. In this work, we study random walk (RW) learning algorithms for
tackling the communication and data heterogeneity problems. The main idea is to
leverage available direct connections among the nodes themselves, which are
typically ""cheaper"" than the communication to the PS. In a random walk, the
model is thought of as a ""baton"" that is passed from a node to one of its
neighbors after being updated in each iteration. The challenge in designing the
RW is the data heterogeneity and the uncertainty about the data distributions.
Ideally, we would want to visit more often nodes that hold more informative
data. We cast this problem as a sleeping multi-armed bandit (MAB) to design a
near-optimal node sampling strategy that achieves variance-reduced gradient
estimates and approaches sub-linearly the optimal sampling strategy. Based on
this framework, we present an adaptive random walk learning algorithm. We
provide theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our numerical results
validate our theoretical findings and show that our algorithm outperforms
existing random walk algorithms.

which is often one step closer to being human-understandable. However, these
ILP-like methods have not been able to capitalise fully on the rapid hardware,
software and algorithmic developments fuelling current developments in deep
neural networks. In this paper, we treat relational features as functions and
use the notion of generalised composition of functions to derive complex
functions from simpler ones. We formulate the notion of a set of
$\text{M}$-simple features in a mode language $\text{M}$ and identify two
composition operators ($\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$) from which all possible complex
features can be derived. We use these results to implement a form of
""explainable neural network"" called Compositional Relational Machines, or CRMs,
which are labelled directed-acyclic graphs. The vertex-label for any vertex $j$
in the CRM contains a feature-function $f_j$ and a continuous activation
function $g_j$. If $j$ is a ""non-input"" vertex, then $f_j$ is the composition
of features associated with vertices in the direct predecessors of $j$. Our
focus is on CRMs in which input vertices (those without any direct
predecessors) all have $\text{M}$-simple features in their vertex-labels. We
provide a randomised procedure for constructing and learning such CRMs. Using a
notion of explanations based on the compositional structure of features in a
CRM, we provide empirical evidence on synthetic data of the ability to identify
appropriate explanations; and demonstrate the use of CRMs as 'explanation

swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor operating at a pressure of approximately
1 MPa are explored experimentally. In particular, the dynamics and coupling
between the hydrodynamics, heat release rate and acoustics are compared for
various forcing amplitudes at a fixed forcing frequency $f_f$. The
hydrodynamics were characterized via laser Mie scattering from droplets in the
fuel spray, while the heat release rate was qualitatively measured using
chemiluminescence (CL) emissions in the 312 $\pm$ 12.5 nm wavelength range,
both at 10 kHz. The dynamics at the frequencies of interest were extracted
using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). In the unforced case,
the spray and CL oscillations exhibited similar dynamics, dominated by
oscillations at frequency $f_0$, whereas the pressure fluctuations were
predominantly at $f_P$. As the forcing amplitude was increased from zero, the
spray and CL exhibited changes in their power spectra characteristic of the
suppression route to synchronization. The pressure fluctuations, however, were
observed to follow the phase-locking route to synchronization. In contrast with
expectations from synchronization theory, the amplitude of the pressure
fluctuations increased significantly not only after lock-on, but also as the
frequency detuning with $f_f$ decreased. It is shown that this increase in
amplitude is not due to intermittency in the frequency of the pressure
oscillations. The simultaneous occurrence of phase-locking and suppression
illustrates the rich variety of dynamics that can occur in practical combustor
systems. In addition, the amplification of the pressure oscillations based on
the frequency detuning with the forcing suggests that classical reasoning based
on the Rayleigh Index may not be sufficient to understand the high amplitude
behaviour of multimodal systems.

knowledge about problem-specific parameters nor tuning of learning rates.
However, when it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, direct extensions of
such adaptive optimizers without proper time-scale separation may fail to work
in practice. We provide such an example proving that the simple combination of
Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) with adaptive stepsizes can diverge if the
primal-dual stepsize ratio is not carefully chosen; hence, a fortiori, such
adaptive extensions are not parameter-agnostic. To address the issue, we
formally introduce a Nested Adaptive framework, NeAda for short, that carries
an inner loop for adaptively maximizing the dual variable with controllable
stopping criteria and an outer loop for adaptively minimizing the primal
variable. Such mechanism can be equipped with off-the-shelf adaptive optimizers
and automatically balance the progress in the primal and dual variables.
Theoretically, for nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems, we show that
NeAda can achieve the near-optimal $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ gradient complexities respectively in the
deterministic and stochastic settings, without prior information on the
problem's smoothness and strong concavity parameters. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that simultaneously achieves
near-optimal convergence rates and parameter-agnostic adaptation in the
nonconvex minimax setting. Numerically, we further illustrate the robustness of
the NeAda family with experiments on simple test functions and a real-world
application.

decarbonize urban energy systems via harnessing solar energy available on

rooftops, are well established, the assessment on building facades usually
involves a higher effort due to more complex urban features and obstructions.
The drawback of existing physics-based simulation programs is that they require
significant manual modelling effort and computing time for generating time
resolved deterministic results. Yet, solar irradiation is highly intermittent
and representing its inherent uncertainty may be required for designing robust
BIPV energy systems. Targeting on these drawbacks, this paper proposes a
data-driven model based on Deep Generative Networks (DGN) to efficiently
generate high-fidelity stochastic ensembles of annual hourly solar irradiance
time series on building facades with uncompromised spatiotemporal resolution at
the urban scale. The only input required is easily obtainable, simple fisheye
images as categorical shading masks captured from 3D models. In principle, even
actual photographs of urban contexts can be utilized, given they are
semantically segmented. Our validations exemplify the high fidelity of the
generated time series when compared to the physics-based simulator. To
demonstrate the model's relevance for urban energy planning, we showcase its
potential for generative design by parametrically altering characteristic
features of the urban environment and producing corresponding time series on
building facades under different climatic contexts in real-time.

Our point estimates have a root mean square error of ~0.08-0.09, and an outlier
fraction of ~3-4 percent when compared to spectroscopic redshifts. We also
compare our results to the COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts, which contains
fewer sources, but had access to a larger number of bands and greater

answer causal questions across a variety of scientific and social disciplines.
However, observational data alone cannot distinguish in general between DAGs

DAGs); as a consequence the orientation of some edges in the graph remains
indeterminate. Interventional data, produced by exogenous manipulations of
variables in the network, enhance the process of structure learning because
they allow to distinguish among equivalent DAGs, thus sharpening causal
inference. Starting from an equivalence class of DAGs, a few procedures have
been devised to produce a collection of variables to be manipulated in order to
identify a causal DAG. Yet, these algorithmic approaches do not determine the
sample size of the interventional data required to obtain a desired level of
statistical accuracy. We tackle this problem from a Bayesian experimental

generated mock catalogues of galaxies for different models and classify HCGs by
implementing an algorithm that adapts the original selection method for mock
catalogues. Once the HCGs samples are classified, we analyzed their properties
and compared them between models. We found that a larger amount of HCGs are
counted in GDM simulations in comparison to CDM counts. This difference
suggests that HCGs can proliferate within GDM despite the suppressed
substructure, which indicates a possible modification in the HCG formation
process within models where DM is not perfectly like CDM. Additionally, we
identified different mechanisms of clustering, for models with a large amount
of galaxy-halos self-agglomerate because of their abundance while models with
fewer galaxy-halos need massive halos acting as a dominant potential well.
Finally, by comparing distributions of different observables of simulated HCGs

Machine Learning research and practice, moving from a training-from-scratch to
a fine-tuning paradigm. While in some applications the goal is to ""nudge"" the
pre-trained distribution towards preferred outputs, in others it is to steer it
towards a different distribution over the sample space. Two main paradigms have
emerged to tackle this challenge: Reward Maximization (RM) and, more recently,
Distribution Matching (DM). RM applies standard Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques, such as Policy Gradients, to gradually increase the reward signal.
DM prescribes to first make explicit the target distribution that the model is
fine-tuned to approximate. Here we explore the theoretical connections between
the two paradigms, and show that methods such as KL-control developed for RM
can also be construed as belonging to DM. We further observe that while DM
differs from RM, it can suffer from similar training difficulties, such as high
gradient variance. We leverage connections between the two paradigms to import
the concept of baseline into DM methods. We empirically validate the benefits
of adding a baseline on an array of controllable language generation tasks such
as constraining topic, sentiment, and gender distributions in texts sampled
from a language model. We observe superior performance in terms of constraint
satisfaction, stability and sample efficiency.

invariant, lead to universal relations that conflict with experimental data,
fail to display important mechanical behaviors (such as the Poynting effect in
simple shear), and may not provide a satisfactory link with the mesoscale.
However, the second invariant term is not a higher order strain contribution to
the energy, which lead us to reflect on what is incomplete about neo-Hookean
materials. Instead of the usual Cauchy-Green elastic formulation, we
investigate this matter from the perspective of left stretch $\mathbf{V}=

\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{I}$ formulations. Invariants of these tensors offer a
different interpretation than those of $\mathbf{B}$ and are linked to different
classes of materials. The main example we adopt is a general isotropic energy
quadratic in Bell strains, the quadratic-Biot material. Despite being quadratic
in stretch like neo-Hookean, this material presents both the classic and
reverse Poynting effect in simple shear, whose direction switches as a function
of the constant conjugate to the second invariant of
$\mathbf{E}_{\text{Bell}}$. Its second normal stress also presents a local
maximum as a function of the amount of shear, a transition that is not observed
in a Mooney-Rivlin solid. Moreover, even the Varga model, linear in Bell
strains, presents Poynting in simple shear, which poses the question of why
this is not true for a model linear in Green-Lagrange strains. Pure torsion of
a solid cylinder is also discussed, particularly how the behavior of the
resultant axial force contrasts between the different formulations.

perturbation methods and input encryption methods have been proposed to defend
against gradient leakage attacks. Nevertheless, these defenses can either
greatly sacrifice the model performance, or be evaded by more advanced attacks.
In this paper, we propose a new defense method to protect the privacy of
clients' data by learning to obscure data. Our defense method can generate
synthetic samples that are totally distinct from the original samples, but they
can also maximally preserve their predictive features and guarantee the model
performance. Furthermore, our defense strategy makes the gradient leakage

  Systems (ICDCS)",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Edge devices with local computation capability has made distributed deep
learning training on edges possible. In such method, the cluster head of a
cluster of edges schedules DL training jobs from the edges. Using such
centralized scheduling method, the cluster head knows all loads of edges, which
can avoid overloading the cluster edges, but the head itself may become
overloaded. To handle this problem, we propose a multi-agent RL (MARL) system
that enables each edge to schedule its jobs using RL. However, without
coordination among edges, action collision may occur, in which multiple edges
schedule tasks to the same edge and make it overloaded. For this reason, we
propose a system called Shielded ReinfOrcement learning (RL) based DL training
on Edges (SROLE). In SROLE, the shield deployed in an edge checks action
collisions and provides alternative actions to avoid collisions. As the central
shield for entire cluster may become a bottleneck, we further propose a
decentralized shielding method, where different shields are responsible for
different regions in the cluster and they coordinate to avoid action collisions
on the region boundaries. Our emulation and real device experiments show SROLE
reduces training time by 59% compared to MARL and centralized RL.

  Reconstruction from Undersampled Data",,,,,"eess.IV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating
high-quality medical images suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible
cost and with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent works
have shown significant promise for reconstructing MR images from sparsely
sampled k-space data using deep learning. In this work, we propose a technique
that rapidly estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction time by
fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In
brief, our algorithm alternates between searching for neighbors in a data set
that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network on
these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our
reconstruction model is learned on a dataset that is structurally similar to
the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse
training set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle changes in
training sets and flexible scan settings, while being relatively fast. Our
approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI, was validated on the FastMRI multi-coil knee data
set using deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions were performed
at four fold and eight fold undersampling of k-space with 1D variable-density
random phase-encode undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our
proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality reconstructions
compared to models trained globally on larger datasets.

important to consider how they will address the dimensions of care and how they
will interact not just with the direct receivers of assistance, but also with
those who provide it (e.g., caregivers, healthcare providers etc.). Caregiving
in its best form addresses challenges in a multitude of dimensions of a

existential dimensions (such as issues surrounding life and death). In this
study we use semi-structured qualitative interviews administered to healthcare
professions with multidisciplinary backgrounds (physicians, public health
professionals, social workers, and chaplains) to understand their expectations
regarding the possible roles robots may play in the healthcare ecosystem in the
future. We found that participants drew inspiration in their mental models of
robots from both works of science fiction but also from existing commercial
robots. Participants envisioned roles for robots in the full spectrum of care,
from physical to social-emotional and even existential-spiritual dimensions,
but also pointed out numerous limitations that robots have in being able to
provide comprehensive humanistic care. While no dimension of care was deemed as
exclusively the realm of humans, participants stressed the importance of
caregiving humans as the primary providers of comprehensive care, with robots
assisting with more narrowly focused tasks. Throughout the paper we point out
the encouraging confluence of ideas between the expectations of healthcare
providers and research trends in the human-robot interaction (HRI) literature.

emphasis on drones and self-driving cars. The course spans the entire
autonomous navigation pipeline; as such, it covers a broad set of topics,
including geometric control and trajectory optimization, 2D and 3D computer
vision, visual and visual-inertial odometry, place recognition, simultaneous
localization and mapping, and geometric deep learning for perception. VNAV has
three key features. First, it bridges traditional computer vision and robotics
courses by exposing the challenges that are specific to embodied intelligence,
e.g., limited computation and need for just-in-time and robust perception to
close the loop over control and decision making. Second, it strikes a balance
between depth and breadth by combining rigorous technical notes (including
topics that are less explored in typical robotics courses, e.g., on-manifold
optimization) with slides and videos showcasing the latest research results.
Third, it provides a compelling approach to hands-on robotics education by
leveraging a physical drone platform (mostly suitable for small residential

the complexity of radio-frequency (RF) $N$-beam analog beamforming systems.
There exist applications for wideband multi-beam beamformers in wireless
communication networks such as 5G/6G systems, system capacity can be improved
by exploiting the improvement of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) using coherent
summation of propagating waves based on their directions of propagation. The
presence of a multitude of RF beams allows multiple independent wireless links
to be established at high SNR, or used in conjunction with multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems, with the overall goal of improving
system SNR and therefore capacity. To realize such multi-beam beamformers at
acceptable analog circuit complexities, we use sparse factorization of the DVM
in order to derive a low arithmetic complexity DVM algorithm. The paper also
establishes an error bound and stability analysis of the proposed DVM
algorithm. The proposed efficient DVM algorithm is aimed at implementation
using analog realizations. For purposes of evaluation, the algorithm can be
realized using both digital hardware as well as software defined radio
platforms.

molecular material in the nucleus of one of the closest type 2 active galaxies.
  To this end, we obtained high angular resolution ALMA observations of the
nucleus of the Circinus galaxy. The observations map the emission at 350GHz and
690GHz with spatial resolutions of ~3.8pc and ~2.2pc, respectively.
  The continuum emission traces cold ($T\lesssim100$K) dust in a circumnuclear
disk with spiral arms on scales of 25pc, plus a marginally resolved nuclear
emission peak. The latter is not extended in polar direction as claimed based
on earlier ALMA observations. A significant amount (of the order of 40%) of the
350GHz emission is not related to dust, but most likely free-free emission
instead. We detect CO(3-2) and CO(6-5) as well as HCO$^+$(4-3), HCN(4-3), and
CS(4-3). The CO emission is extended, showing a spiral pattern, similar to the
extended dust emission. Towards the nucleus, CO is excited to higher
transitions and its emission is self-absorbed, leading to an apparent hole in
the CO(3-2) but not the CO(6-5) emission. On the other hand, the high gas
density tracers HCO$^+$, HCN, and CS show a strong, yet unresolved
(($\lesssim4$pc) concentration of the emission at the nucleus, pointing at a
very small 'torus'. The kinematics are dominated by rotation and point at a
geometrically thin disk down to the resolution limit of our observations. In
contrast to several other AGNs, no HCN enhancement is found towards the
nucleus.
  The Circinus nucleus is therefore composed of at least two distinct
components: (1) an optically thin, warm outflow of ionised gas containing
clouds of dust; and (2) a cold molecular and dusty disk. These findings support
the most recent radiative transfer calculations of the obscuring structures in
AGNs, which find a similar two-component structure. (Abridged)

real-time density-matrix dynamics simulations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
and quantum descriptions of electron-phonon and electron-impurity scattering
for the spin lifetimes of supported/free-standing germanene, a prototypical

on spin lifetime can surprisingly differ by two orders of magnitude. We find
that substrate effects on $\tau_s$ are closely related to substrate-induced
modifications of the SOC-field anisotropy, which changes the spin-flip
scattering matrix elements. We propose a new electronic quantity, named
spin-flip angle $\theta^{\uparrow\downarrow}$, to characterize spin relaxation
caused by intervalley spin-flip scattering. We find that the spin relaxation
rate is approximately proportional to the averaged value of
$\mathrm{sin}^{2}\left(\theta^{\uparrow\downarrow}/2\right)$, which can be used
as a guiding parameter of controlling spin relaxation.

populations have different levels of cooperation. The traditional game theory
assumes that individuals can acquire their neighbor's information without cost
after generating information. In fact, the environment and cognition of
populations often limit the magnitude of information received by individuals.
Our model divides information dynamics into two processes: generation and
dissemination. After generating, information starts to disseminate in the
population. Individuals match and interact with each other based on the
information received and then confirm partnerships, which differs from
traditional research's unilateral partner selection process. Specifically, we
find a function to simulate two constraints of information acquisition in
different populations: information dissemination cost and cognition competence.
These two kinds of constraints affect the choice of partnership and then the
evolution of cooperation. The game evolved under the condition of information
constraints. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we find that
information dissemination and cognition underlie the evolution of cooperation.
The lower cost of information dissemination and the more valid cognition of
information, the higher level of cooperation. Moreover, deviations in cognition
among individuals more sensitively determine the equilibrium cooperation
density. As the deviations increase, cooperation density decreases
significantly. This paper provides a new explanation for the diversity of
cooperation among populations with different information dissemination costs
and cognition competence.

LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution
images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification
accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction

particular magnetic systems, have attracted attention due to a variety of
electromagnetic responses that are governed by the topology. A well-studied
effect of topology on the deterministic and drift motion under a nonequilibrium
excitation is the so-called skyrmion Hall effect. For stochastic diffusive
motion, the effect of topology is expected to have a drastically stronger
impact, but the predicted even qualitative impact has not been demonstrated.
The required tuning of the topology to achieve zero effective topological
charge can be achieved using antiferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the
diffusive motion has previously not been observed due to strong pinning in
ferrimagnets and intrinsic antiferromagnets. Here we demonstrate enhanced
thermally-activated diffusive motion of skyrmions in a specifically designed
synthetic antiferromagnet where the topology can be tuned. Suppressing the
effective topological charge for synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmions leads to
a more than 10 times enhanced diffusion coefficient as compared to
ferromagnetic skyrmions. By varying the topology, we can not only demonstrate
the topology-dependence of the diffusion coefficient but also enable ultimately
energy-efficient unconventional computing that is actively making use of the
stochasticity.

most ensembling techniques require multiple parallel and costly evaluations and

consists of an exploration phase that finds high-performing regions of the
parameter space and multiple exploitation phases that effectively exploit the
compactness of the sparse model to quickly converge to different minima in the
energy landscape corresponding to high-performing subnetworks yielding diverse
ensembles. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the

Such calculations have only recently become available, in particular for the

of GaSb calculated with the fully-relativistic $GW$-BSE captures the large
spin-orbit splitting of peaks in the spectrum. For Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we find a

assessment (IAA) comes from the abstract nature of aesthetic labels. That is, a
vast variety of distinct contents can correspond to the same aesthetic label.
On the one hand, during inference, the IAA model is required to relate various
distinct contents to the same aesthetic label. On the other hand, when
training, it would be hard for the IAA model to learn to distinguish different
contents merely with the supervision from aesthetic labels, since aesthetic
labels are not directly related to any specific content. To deal with this
dilemma, we propose to distill knowledge on semantic patterns for a vast
variety of image contents from multiple pre-trained object classification (POC)
models to an IAA model. Expecting the combination of multiple POC models can
provide sufficient knowledge on various image contents, the IAA model can
easier learn to relate various distinct contents to a limited number of
aesthetic labels. By supervising an end-to-end single-backbone IAA model with
the distilled knowledge, the performance of the IAA model is significantly
improved by 4.8% in SRCC compared to the version trained only with ground-truth
aesthetic labels. On specific categories of images, the SRCC improvement
brought by the proposed method can achieve up to 7.2%. Peer comparison also
shows that our method outperforms 10 previous IAA methods.

schlieren (BOS) techniques based on computed tomography (CT-BOS) face when
measuring pressure fields of laser-induced underwater shock waves. To do this,
it proposes a novel BOS technique based on vector tomography (VT-BOS) of an
axisymmetric target. The remarkable feature of the proposed technique is the
reconstruction of an axisymmetric vector field with nonzero divergence, such as
the field of a laser-induced underwater shock wave. This approach is based on
an approximate relation between the projection of the axisymmetric vector field
and the reconstructed vector field. For comparison, the pressure fields of
underwater shock waves are measured with VT-BOS, CT-BOS, and a needle
hydrophone. It is found that VT-BOS is significantly better than CT-BOS in
terms of better convergence, less dependence on the spatial resolution of the
acquired images, and lower computational cost. The proposed technique can be
applied not only to fluid dynamical fields, but also to other axisymmetric
targets in other areas, such as electromagnetics and thermodynamics.

interest in using data-driven approaches to improve camera noise models via
neural networks. These data-driven approaches target noise present in the
raw-sensor image before it has been processed by the camera's image signal
processor (ISP). Modeling noise in the RAW-rgb domain is useful for improving
and testing the in-camera denoising algorithm; however, there are situations
where the camera's ISP does not apply denoising or additional denoising is
desired when the RAW-rgb domain image is no longer available. In such cases,
the sensor noise propagates through the ISP to the final rendered image encoded
in standard RGB (sRGB). The nonlinear steps on the ISP culminate in a
significantly more complex noise distribution in the sRGB domain and existing
raw-domain noise models are unable to capture the sRGB noise distribution. We
propose a new sRGB-domain noise model based on normalizing flows that is
capable of learning the complex noise distribution found in sRGB images under
various ISO levels. Our normalizing flows-based approach outperforms other
models by a large margin in noise modeling and synthesis tasks. We also show
that image denoisers trained on noisy images synthesized with our noise model
outperforms those trained with noise from baselines models.

pulse to realize population transfer, the external tiny error has a trivial
influence on the final population. The repeated application of the same pulse
will greatly amplify the error effect, making it easy to be detected. Here, we
propose to measure small control errors in three-level quantum systems by
coherent amplification of their effects, using several coherent control

analyze how the fidelity of population transfer are affected by Rabi

sensitivity of detecting these errors can be effectively amplified by the

products requiring networks of skilled labor and more inclusive institutions.
Yet the negative association between economic complexity and inequality on a
coarse scale could hide important dynamics at a fine-grained level. Complex
economic activities are difficult to develop and tend to concentrate spatially,
leading to 'winner-take-most' effects that spur regional inequality in
countries. Large, complex cities tend to attract both high- and low-skills
activities and workers, and are also associated with higher levels of
hierarchies, competition, and skill premiums. As a result, the association
between complexity and inequality reverses at regional scales; in other words,
more complex regions tend to be more unequal. Ideas from polarization theories,
institutional changes, and urban scaling literature can help to understand this

undervalued while being noticeable fundamental for real epidemic outbreaks. One
central question is which mean-field approach is more accurate in describing

susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model on networks.
Two pairwise mean-field theories, one based on recurrent dynamical
message-passing (rDMP) and the other on the pair quenched mean-field theory
(PQMF), are compared with extensive stochastic simulations on large networks of
different levels of heterogeneity. For waning immunity times longer than or
comparable with the recovering time, rDMP outperforms PQMF theory on power-law
networks with degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$. In particular, for
$\gamma > 3$, the epidemic threshold observed in simulations is finite, in
qualitative agreement with rDMP, while PQMF leads to an asymptotically null
threshold. The critical epidemic prevalence for $\gamma > 3$ is localized in a
finite set of vertices in the case of the PQMF theory. In contrast, the
localization happens in a subextensive fraction of the network in rDMP theory.
Simulations, however, indicate that localization patterns of the actual
epidemic lay between the two mean-field theories, and improved theoretical
approaches are necessary to understanding the SIRS dynamics.

prove that (i) entropy regularization and averaging ensure stability by
providing sufficient exploration to avoid near-deterministic and strictly
suboptimal policies and (ii) regularization leads to sharp sample complexity

bias-variance tradeoff in policy optimization. In the process, we identify the
importance of uniform approximation power of the actor neural network to
achieve global optimality in policy optimization due to distributional shift.

luminous X-rays reaching $L_x\approx 5.6\times10^{40}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$

photoelectric absorption originating from the local SN environment with
$NH_{\rm int}(t)\approx3\times 10^{22}(t/400

volume filling factor. Finally, we place SN\,2014C in the context of 119

maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still
limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due
to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this

patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus
real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers
hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art

low-rank network (LT$^2$LR-Net). First, we generalize the tensor singular value
decomposition (t-SVD) into an arbitrary unitary transform-based version and
subsequently propose the novel transformed tensor nuclear norm (TTNN). Then, we
design a novel TTNN-based iterative optimization algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to exploit the tensor
low-rank prior in the transformed domain. The corresponding iterative steps are
unrolled into the proposed LT$^2$LR-Net, where the convolutional neural network
(CNN) is incorporated to adaptively learn the transformation from the dynamic
MR dataset for more robust and accurate tensor low-rank representations.
Experimental results on the cardiac cine MR dataset demonstrate that the
proposed framework can provide improved recovery results compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

of smoothness, including the de Rham complex, the curldiv complex, the
elasticity complex, and the divdiv complex, are systematically constructed.
Smooth scalar finite elements in two dimensions are developed based on a
non-overlapping decomposition of the simplicial lattice and the Bernstein basis
of the polynomial space, with the order of differentiability at vertices being
greater than twice that at edges. Finite element de Rham complexes with
different levels of smoothness are devised using smooth finite elements with
smoothness parameters that satisfy certain relations. Finally, finite element
elasticity complexes and finite element divdiv complexes are derived from
finite element de Rham complexes by using the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG)
framework. This study is the first work to construct finite element complexes
in a systematic way. Moreover, the novel tools developed in this work, such as
the non-overlapping decomposition of the simplicial lattice and the discrete
BGG construction, can be useful for further research in this field.

imperfect cavities, where we introduce a broadening parameter in the spectral
density to mimic Fabry-P\'erot cavities. We investigate cavity modifications to
reaction rates using non-Markovian Langevin dynamics with frictional and random
forces to account for the presence of imperfect optical cavities. We
demonstrate that in the regime of weak solvent and cavity friction, the cavity
can enhance chemical reaction rates. On the other hand, in the high friction
regime, cavities can suppress chemical reactions. Furthermore, we find that the
broadening of the cavity spectral density gives rise to blue shifts of the
resonance conditions and, surprisingly, increases the sharpness of the

many real-world continuous-time (CT) networks. Given that usually only a
partial set of nodes are able to observe, in this paper, we consider linear CT
systems to depict networks since they can model unmeasured nodes via transfer
functions. Additionally, measurements tend to be noisy and with low and varying
sampling frequencies. For this reason, we consider CT models since
discrete-time approximations often require fine-grained measurements and
uniform sampling steps. The developed method applies dynamical structure

to describe networks of measured nodes. A numerical sampling method,
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN), is used to refine coarse-grained

transportation management department generally introduces the enlarged license
plate behind the rear of a vehicle. However, enlarged license plates have high
diversity as they are non-standard in position, size, and style. Furthermore,
the background regions contain a variety of noisy information which greatly
disturbs the recognition of license plate characters. Existing works have not

license plate recognition problem and contribute a dataset containing 9342

data are still insufficient to train deep methods of enlarged license plate
recognition, and building large-scale training data is very time-consuming and
high labor cost. To handle this problem, we propose a novel task-level
disentanglement generation framework based on the Disentangled Generation

background generation in an end-to-end manner to effectively ensure diversity

trajectory of the densities generated by the hypothesis velocity fields
converges to the solution of the FPE in the Wasserstein-2 sense. The proposed

appropriate for examining the evolution of the bulk of Coherent Structures
(CSs), $PVI \ge 3$. Using PVI, we observe a scale-dependent evolution in the
fraction of the dataset occupied by CSs, $f_{PVI \ge 3}$. Specifically,
regardless of the SW speed, a subtle increase is found in $f_{PVI\ge3}$ for
$\ell =20 d_i$, in contrast to a more pronounced radial increase in CSs
observed at larger scales. Intermittency is investigated in relation to plasma
parameters. Though, slower SW speed intervals exhibit higher $f_{PVI \geq 6}$
and higher kurtosis maxima, no statistical differences are observed for $f_{PVI
\geq 3}$. Highly Alfv\'enic intervals, display lower levels of intermittency.
The anisotropy with respect to the angle between the magnetic field and SW
flow, $\Theta_{VB}$ is investigated. Intermittency is weaker at $\Theta_{VB}
\approx 0^{\circ}$ and is strengthened at larger angles. Considering the
evolution at a constant alignment angle, a weakening of intermittency is
observed with increasing advection time of the SW. Our results indicate that
the strengthening of intermittency in the inner heliosphere is driven by the
increase in comparatively highly intermittent perpendicular intervals sampled
by the probes with increasing distance, an effect related directly to the
evolution of the Parker spiral.

For this problem, we present best-of-both-worlds algorithms that achieve nearly

regret bounds for stochastic environments. As Alon et al. [2015] have shown,
tight regret bounds depend on the structure of the feedback graph: strongly
observable graphs yield minimax regret of $\tilde{\Theta}( \alpha^{1/2} T^{1/2}
)$, while weakly observable graphs induce minimax regret of $\tilde{\Theta}(
\delta^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$, where $\alpha$ and $\delta$, respectively, represent
the independence number of the graph and the domination number of a certain
portion of the graph. Our proposed algorithm for strongly observable graphs has
a regret bound of $\tilde{O}( \alpha^{1/2} T^{1/2} ) $ for adversarial
environments, as well as of $ {O} ( \frac{\alpha (\ln T)^3 }{\Delta_{\min}} ) $

Slotted ALOHA with Reservation and Data slots (FSA-RD). We consider a symmetric
multi-access network where each user transmits its randomly generated status
updates to an access point in a framed manner. Each frame consists of one
reservation slot and several data slots. The reservation slot is made up of
some mini-slots. In each reservation slot, users, with a status update packet
to transmit, randomly send short reservation packets in one of the mini-slots
to contend for data slots of the frame. The data slots are assigned to those
users that succeed in reservation slot. To provide insights in optimizing the
information freshness of FSA-RD, we manage to derive a closed-form expression
of the average AoI under FSA-RD by applying a recursive method. Numerical
results validate the analytical expression and demonstrate the influence of the
frame size and reservation probability on the average AoI. We finally perform a
comparison between the AoI performance of FSA-RD with optimized frame size and
reservation probability, and that of slotted ALOHA with optimized transmission
probability. The comparison results show that FSA-RD can effectively reduce the
AoI performance of multi-access networks, especially when the status arrival
rate of the network becomes large.

limited by their: (1) large form-factor largely due to the adopted bulky
lens-based cameras; and (2) high communication cost required between the camera

this end, we propose a lensless FlatCam-based eye tracking algorithm and
accelerator co-design framework dubbed EyeCoD to enable eye tracking systems
with a much reduced form-factor and boosted system efficiency without
sacrificing the tracking accuracy, paving the way for next-generation eye
tracking solutions. On the system level, we advocate the use of lensless
FlatCams to facilitate the small form-factor need in mobile eye tracking
systems. On the algorithm level, EyeCoD integrates a predict-then-focus
pipeline that first predicts the region-of-interest (ROI) via segmentation and
then only focuses on the ROI parts to estimate gaze directions, greatly
reducing redundant computations and data movements. On the hardware level, we
further develop a dedicated accelerator that (1) integrates a novel workload
orchestration between the aforementioned segmentation and gaze estimation
models, (2) leverages intra-channel reuse opportunities for depth-wise layers,
and (3) utilizes input feature-wise partition to save activation memory size.
On-silicon measurement validates that our EyeCoD consistently reduces both the
communication and computation costs, leading to an overall system speedup of
10.95x, 3.21x, and 12.85x over CPUs, GPUs, and a prior-art eye tracking
processor called CIS-GEP, respectively, while maintaining the tracking

only Gaussian noise, (2) an astrophysical signal injected into Gaussian noise,
(3) a line embedded in Gaussian noise, and (4) an astrophysical signal
contaminated by both Gaussian noise and line noise. In our algorithm, different

sets of evenly-spaced lines, i.e., combs, and we only need to consider
perfectly sinusoidal line in this work. We find that our neural network can
distinguish between astrophysical signals and lines with high accuracy. In a
frequency band without line noise, the sensitivity depth of our network is
about $\mathcal{D}^{95\%} \simeq 43.9$ with a false alarm probability of $\sim

valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect in monolayer ferrovalley
material: Janus VSiGeN4, of which the edge states are chiral-spin-valley
locking. Besides, a small tensile or compressive strain can drive phase
transition in the material from valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall state
to half-valley-metal state. With the increase of the strain, the material turns
into ferrovalley semiconductor with valley anomalous Hall effect. The origin of
phase transition is sequent band inversion of V d orbital at K valley.
Moreover, we find that phase transition causes the sign reversal of Berry
curvature and induces different polarized light absorption in different valley
states. Our work provides an ideal material platform for practical applications
and experimental exploration of the interplay between topology, spintronics,

subpicosecond laser pulse is used to trigger ultrafast dynamics in a target
multilayered film, and a THz pulse is sent with variable delay to probe the
status of the system. For a slowly varying dielectric response, the
non-equilibrium THz response can be described using a quasi-static description
and hence standard transfer matrix methods (TMM) can be employed. However, if
the non-equilibrium timescale is similar to or shorter than the THz probe time
width, there are currently no available theoretical tools to describe this
situation. We develop a theoretical framework, the Perturbative Transfer Matrix
Method (PTMM), to fill in this gap. The full time dependence of the properties
of the materials, as well as the proper propagation via Maxwell's equations,
are correctly accounted for. We observe that, while slowly varying material
properties produce an OPTP signal which can very well be interpreted within the
quasi-static limit when the excitation dynamics are fast, that approximation
cannot account for crucial features of the OPTP signal. The fast excitation
timescale produces a significant broadening of the OPTP signal. We show that
not only OPTP can be used to extract the sub-picosecond timescale of the
excitation, but it also provides a sub THz period resolution, and dynamics as
fast as a few hundreds of femtoseconds can be distinguished even with
narrowband THz pulses with time durations as long as many picoseconds.

relaxation, as well as a rapid radial transport of heat and particles. Using a
mean-field helicity transport model implemented in the disruption runaway
modeling framework DREAM, we calculate the dynamics of runaway electrons in the
presence of current relaxation events. In scenarios where flux surfaces remain
intact in parts of the plasma, a skin current is induced at the boundary of the
intact magnetic field region. This skin current region becomes an important
center concerning the subsequent dynamics: It may turn into a hot ohmic current
channel, or a sizable radially localized runaway beam, depending on the heat
transport. If the intact region is in the plasma edge, runaway generation in
the counter-current direction can occur, which may develop into a sizable
reverse runaway beam. Even when the current relaxation extends to the entire

affected, as the induced electric field is reduced in the core and increased in

Presently, adversarial training (AT) is the most effective method to enhance
the robustness of the model against adversarial examples. However, because
adversarial training solved a min-max value problem, in comparison with natural
training, the robustness and generalization are contradictory, i.e., the
robustness improvement of the model will decrease the generalization of the
model. To address this issue, in this paper, a new concept, namely confidence
threshold (CT), is introduced and the reducing of the confidence threshold,
known as confidence threshold reduction (CTR), is proven to improve both the
generalization and robustness of the model. Specifically, to reduce the CT for
natural training (i.e., for natural training with CTR), we propose a
mask-guided divergence loss function (MDL) consisting of a cross-entropy loss
term and an orthogonal term. The empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the MDL loss improves the robustness and generalization of
the model simultaneously for natural training. However, the model robustness
improvement of natural training with CTR is not comparable to that of
adversarial training. Therefore, for adversarial training, we propose a
standard deviation loss function (STD), which minimizes the difference in the
probabilities of the wrong categories, to reduce the CT by being integrated
into the loss function of adversarial training. The empirical and theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the STD based loss function can further improve the
robustness of the adversarially trained model on basis of guaranteeing the
changeless or slight improvement of the natural accuracy.

applications demand accurate measurements when the entropy is small. Existing
algorithms that do not use conditional samples require a number of queries that
scale inversely with the entropy, which is unacceptable in this regime, and
indeed, a lower bound by Batu et al.(STOC 2002) established that no algorithm
using only sampling and evaluation oracles can obtain acceptable performance.
On the other hand, prior work in the conditional sampling model by Chakraborty

$\mathcal{O}(\frac{m^7}{\epsilon^8}\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ queries, to obtain

particularly for multi-dimensional non-linear signals like EEG. Applying MEMD
results in a set of oscillatory modes called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).
As the decomposition process is data-dependent, the IMFs vary in accordance
with signal variation caused by functional brain activity. Among the extracted
IMFs, it is found that those corresponding to high-oscillation modes are most
useful for detecting different mental states. Non-linear features are computed
from the IMFs that contribute most to mental state detection. These MEMD
features show a significant performance gain over the conventional

The dominance of specific brain region is observed by analysing the MEMD

we propose an exact formulation of the solution of diffusion ODEs. The
formulation analytically computes the linear part of the solution, rather than
leaving all terms to black-box ODE solvers as adopted in previous works. By
applying change-of-variable, the solution can be equivalently simplified to an
exponentially weighted integral of the neural network. Based on our

samples would have to be modified such that the class prediction changes.
Previous approaches mainly focus on image and tabular data. In this work we
propose SPARCE, a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture that
generates SPARse Counterfactual Explanations for multivariate time series. Our
approach provides a custom sparsity layer and regularizes the counterfactual
loss function in terms of similarity, sparsity, and smoothness of trajectories.
We evaluate our approach on real-world human motion datasets as well as a
synthetic time series interpretability benchmark. Although we make
significantly sparser modifications than other approaches, we achieve
comparable or better performance on all metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that
our approach predominantly modifies salient time steps and features, leaving
non-salient inputs untouched.

from natural to socio-economic, the analysis of these experimental data
conducted us to conclude about the omnipresence of power-laws. For example, in
living systems, we are used to observing anomalous diffusion, e.g. in the
motion of proteins within the cell. However, estimating the power-law exponents
is challenging. Both technical constraints and experimental limitations affect
the statistics of observed data. Here, we investigate in detail the influence
of two essential constraints in the experiment, namely, the temporal-spatial
resolution and the time-window of the experiment. We study how the observed
distribution of an observable is modified by them and analytically derive the
expression of the power-law distribution for the observed distribution through
the scope of the experiment. We also apply our results on data from an
experimental study of the transport of mRNA-protein complexes along dendrites.

arithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series
data. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the
off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix
profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is
extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy.
  In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator
for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile
computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three
key benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of
applications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic
processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution
time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses
between the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time
series data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and
energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental evaluation
shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2x (9.9x on average) and
reduces energy by up to 27.2x (19.4x on average), over the state-of-the-art

proposal in a single dissipative qubit system and demonstrate that the
evolution time of a qubit from an initial state to an arbitrary state can be
controlled by tuning the dissipation intensity in a non-Hermitian
Parity-Time-Symmetric ($\mathcal{P T}$-symmetric) quantum system. It decreases
with increasing dissipation intensity and also gives a tighter bound for
quantum speed limit (QSL). We also find that the evolution time of its reversal

that planets can be captured in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) during the disc

accumulation in the vicinity of the resonance, which is not centred on the
nominal resonance but instead presents an offset slightly exterior to it. Here
we extend on previous works by thoroughly exploring the effect of different
disc and planet parameters on the resonance offset during the disc migration
phase. The dynamical study is carried out for several first-order MMRs and for
both low-mass Earth-like planets undergoing type-I migration and giant planets
evolving under type-II migration. We find that the offset varies with time
during the migration of the two-planet system along the apsidal corotation
resonance family. The departure from the nominal resonance increases for higher
planetary masses and stronger eccentricity damping. In the Earth to super-Earth
regime, we find offset values in agreement with the observations when using a
sophisticated modelling for the planet-disc interactions, where the damping
timescale depends on the eccentricity. This dependence causes a feedback which
induces an increase of the resonance offsets. Regarding giant planets, the
offsets of detected planet pairs are well reproduced with a classical
$K$-factor prescription for the planet-disc interactions when the eccentricity
damping rate remains low to moderate. In both regimes, eccentricities are in
agreement with the observations too. As a result, planet-disc interactions
provide a generic channel to generate the offsets found in the observations.

unsupervised phonetic representations (UPR) and supervised phonetic

target languages. In this method, a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model is adopted to
extract UPRs and a language-independent automatic speech recognition (LI-ASR)
model is built with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss to
extract segment-level SPRs from the audio data of target languages. Then, an
acoustic model is designed, which first predicts UPRs and SPRs from texts
separately and then combines the predicted UPRs and SPRs to generate
mel-spectrograms. The results of our experiments on six languages show that the
proposed method outperformed the methods that directly predicted
mel-spectrograms from character or phoneme sequences and the ablated models
that utilized only UPRs or SPRs.

from face-centered cubic to diamond and thereby contribute to our understanding
of crystallization and open avenues to producing structures with useful
photonic properties. Despite the broad potential design space of DNA-coated
colloids, the design cycle for synthesizing DNA-coated particles is slow:
preparing a particle with a new type of DNA sequence takes more than one day
and requires custom-made and chemically modified DNA that typically takes the
supplier over a month to synthesize. Here, we introduce a method to generate
particles with custom sequences from a single feed stock in under an hour at
ambient conditions. Our method appends new DNA domains onto the DNA grafted to
colloidal particles based on a template that takes the supplier less than a
week to produce. The resultant particles crystallize as readily and at the same
temperature as those produced via direct chemical synthesis. Moreover, we show
that particles coated with a single sequence can be converted into a variety of
building blocks with differing specificities by appending different DNA
sequences to them. This approach to DNA-coated particle preparation will make
it practical to identify optimal and complex particle sequence designs and to
expand the use of DNA-coated colloids to a much broader range of investigators
and commercial entities.

distinctive trajectories of chronic diseases. These diseases recurrently
undergo acute, unstable, and stable phases, each of which requires a different
treatment regimen. However, the correct identification of trajectory phases,

data-driven, dynamic approach for identifying trajectory phases of chronic
diseases and thus suggesting treatment regimens. Specifically, we develop a
novel variable-duration copula hidden Markov model (VDC-HMMX). In our VDC-HMMX,
the trajectory is modeled as a series of latent states with acute, stable, and
unstable phases, which are eventually recovered. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our VDC-HMMX model on the basis of a longitudinal study with
928 patients suffering from low back pain. A myopic classifier identifies
correct treatment regimens with a balanced accuracy of slightly above 70%. In
comparison, our VDC-HMMX model is correct with a balanced accuracy of 83.65%.
This thus highlights the value of longitudinal monitoring for chronic disease
management.

optical excitation only. Since its discovery in the 60s, it was believed that
only an elliptical or circular polarization could magnetize matter by this
magneto-optical phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the generation of an IFE via a
linear polarization of light. This new physical concept results from the local
manipulation of light by a plasmonic nano-antenna. We demonstrate that a gold
nanorod excited by a linear polarization generates a non-zero magnetic field by
IFE when the incident polarization of the light is not parallel to the long
axis of the rod. We show that this dissymmetry generates hot spots of local
non-vanishing spin densities (local elliptical polarization state), introducing
the concept of super circular light, allowing this magnetization. Moreover, by
varying the angle of the incident linear polarization with respect to the
nano-antenna, we demonstrate the on-demand flipping of the magnetic field
orientation. Finally, this linear IFE generates a stationary magnetic field 25
times stronger than what a gold nanoparticle produces when excited by a
circular polarization and via a classical IFE. The creation of stationary
magnetic fields by IFE in a plasmonic nanostructure is nowadays the only
technique allowing the creation of ultra-short, intense magnetic field pulses
at the nanoscale. Thus, it finds applications in the ultrafast control of
magnetic domains with applications not only in data storage technologies but
also in research fields such as magnetic trapping, magnetic skyrmion, magnetic
circular dichroism, to spin control, spin precession, spin currents, and spin

in the spectra of non-Hermitian systems, are garnering extensive attention in
various multidisciplinary fields. However, constructing higher-order EPs still
remains as a challenge due to the strict requirement of the system symmetries.
Here we demonstrate that higher-order EPs can be judiciously fabricated in PT
-symmetric staggered rhombic lattices by introducing not only on-site gain/loss
but also nonHermitian couplings. Zero-energy flatbands persist and
symmetry-protected third-order EPs (EP3) arise in these systems owing to the
non-Hermitian chiral/sublattice symmetry, but distinct phase transitions and
propagation dynamics occur. Specifically, the EP3 arises at the Brillouin zone
(BZ) boundary in the presence of on-site gain/loss. The single-site excitations
display an exponential power increase in the PT -broken phase. Meanwhile, a
nearly flatband sustains when a small lattice perturbation is applied. For the
lattices with non-Hermitian couplings, however, the EP3 appears at the BZ
center. Quite remarkably, our analysis unveils a dynamical
delocalization-localization transition for the excitation of the dispersive
bands and a quartic power increase beyond the EP3. Our scheme provides a new
platform towards the investigation of the higher-order EPs, and can be further
extended to the study of topological phase transitions or nonlinear processes

emergence of the automatic computer-aided diagnosis system solves this problem.
This paper proposes a framework called CVM-Cervix based on deep learning to
perform cervical cell classification tasks. It can analyze pap slides quickly
and accurately. CVM-Cervix first proposes a Convolutional Neural Network module
and a Visual Transformer module for local and global feature extraction
respectively, then a Multilayer Perceptron module is designed to fuse the local
and global features for the final classification. Experimental results show the
effectiveness and potential of the proposed CVM-Cervix in the field of cervical
Pap smear image classification. In addition, according to the practical needs
of clinical work, we perform a lightweight post-processing to compress the
model.

the observed level of regularity. Justifications of this fact tend to present
our universe as a likely option among some range of possibilities. In this

problems that consist of finding a zero in the sum of two monotone operators,
in which one is maximal monotone while another is locally Lipschitz continuous.
In particular, we first propose a primal-dual extrapolation (PDE) method for
solving a structured strongly MI problem by modifying the classical
forward-backward splitting method by using a point and operator extrapolation
technique, in which the parameters are adaptively updated by a backtracking
line search scheme. The proposed PDE method is almost parameter-free, equipped
with a verifiable termination criterion, and enjoys an operation complexity of
${\cal O}(\log \epsilon^{-1})$, measured by the amount of fundamental
operations consisting only of evaluations of one operator and resolvent of
another operator, for finding an $\epsilon$-residual solution of the structured
strongly MI problem. We then propose another PDE method for solving a
structured non-strongly MI problem by applying the above PDE method to
approximately solve a sequence of structured strongly MI problems. The
resulting PDE method is parameter-free, equipped with a verifiable termination
criterion, and enjoys an operation complexity of ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log
\epsilon^{-1})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-residual solution of the structured
non-strongly MI problem. As a consequence, we apply the latter PDE method to
convex conic optimization, conic constrained saddle point, and variational
inequality problems, and obtain complexity results for finding an
$\epsilon$-KKT or $\epsilon$-residual solution of them under local Lipschitz
continuity. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies were conducted to
investigate methods with complexity guarantees for solving the aforementioned
problems under local Lipschitz continuity. All the complexity results obtained
in this paper are entirely new.

even quench the dominant $\ell=m=2$ mode of the bar-deformation by dynamically
forming a mixed (fermion-boson) star that retains part of the angular momentum

of a mixed bar that leads to significant gravitational-wave emission,
substantially different to that of the isolated neutron star. Our results
indicate that dark-matter accretion in neutron stars could change the frequency
of the expected emission of the bar-mode instability, which would have an
important impact on ongoing searches for continuous gravitational waves.

However, most of the R-convolution graph kernels face two challenges: 1) They

challenges limit their performances. To mitigate the two challenges, we propose
a novel graph kernel called the Multi-scale Path-pattern Graph kernel (MPG), at

path-pattern around a node. A path-pattern is constructed by the concatenation
of all the node labels in a path of a truncated BFS tree rooted at each node.
Since the path-pattern node feature map can only compare graphs at local
scales, we incorporate into it the multiple different scales of the graph
structure, which are captured by the truncated BFS trees of different depth. We
use the Wasserstein distance to compute the similarity between the multi-scale
path-pattern node feature maps of two graphs, considering the distributions of
path-patterns. We empirically validate MPG on various benchmark graph datasets
and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

and acknowledged not only in the Information Systems (IS) literature, but also
in other management streams such as innovation and strategy. However, to date,

Our theoretical review addresses this gap by consolidating and analyzing

includes 95 papers published between 1998 to 2020 in outlets from the IS and
related management fields. We craft a four-phase framework that integrates

innovation in outsourcing settings; (2) arrangement options that facilitate
strategic innovation in outsourcing relationships; (3) the generation of
strategic innovations; and (4) realized strategic innovation outcomes, as
assessed in the literature. We find that the research landscape to date is
skewed, with many studies focusing on the first two phases. The last two phases
remain relatively uncharted. We also discuss how innovation-oriented
outsourcing insights compare with established research on cost-oriented

phonon band. For a finite phonon bandwidth, the center of the Gaussian is
either shifted to larger or smaller frequencies, depending on the sign of the
phonon hopping. We illustrate that this can be well understood by considering
the Born-Oppenheimer surfaces. A similar behavior is seen for the bipolaron for
strong coupling. For the bipolaron with weak and intermediate coupling
strengths and a flat phonon band, we obtain two very different spectra. The
latter also has a temperature-dependent resonance at a frequency below the

mechanical and electronic properties. The interlayer interactions of these
bilayers are reported differently in theoretical and experimental studies.
Herein, we design and investigate bilayer beta12-borophene, by first-principles
calculations. Our results show that the interlayer distance of the relaxed
AA-stacked bilayer is about 2.5 A, suggesting a van der Waals (vdW) interlayer
interaction. However, this is not supported by previous experiments, therefore
by constraining the interlayer distance, we propose a preferred model which is
close to experimental records. This preferred model has one covalent interlayer
bond in every unit cell (single-pillar). Further, we argue that the preferred
model is nothing but the relaxed model under a 2% compression. Additionally, we
designed three substrate-supported bilayers on the Ag, Al, and Au substrates,
which lead to double-pillar structures. Afterward, we investigate the AB
stacking, which forms covalent bonds in the relaxed form, without the need for
compression or substrate. Moreover, phonon dispersion shows that, unlike the AA
stacking, the AB stacking is stable in freestanding form. Subsequently, we
calculate the mechanical properties of the AA and AB stackings. The ultimate
strengths of the AA and the AB stackings are 29.72 N/m at 12% strain and 23.18
N/m at 8% strain, respectively. Moreover, the calculated Young's moduli are 419
N/m and 356 N/m for the AA and the AB stackings, respectively. These results
show the superiority of bilayer borophene over bilayer MoS2 in terms of
stiffness and compliance. Our results can pave the way for future studies on

representation suitable for busy urban environments. Occupancy grids allow the
AV to reason collectively about the behavior of groups of agents without
processing their individual trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our sparse input representation and our model in terms of computation and

explicit map?
  For the task of PointGoal navigation ('Go to $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$') under
idealized settings (no RGB-D and actuation noise, perfect GPS+Compass), the
answer is a clear 'yes' - map-less neural models composed of task-agnostic
components (CNNs and RNNs) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning
achieve 100% Success on a standard dataset (Gibson). However, for PointNav in a
realistic setting (RGB-D and actuation noise, no GPS+Compass), this is an open
question; one we tackle in this paper. The strongest published result for this
task is 71.7% Success.
  First, we identify the main (perhaps, only) cause of the drop in performance:
the absence of GPS+Compass. An agent with perfect GPS+Compass faced with RGB-D
sensing and actuation noise achieves 99.8% Success (Gibson-v2 val). This
suggests that (to paraphrase a meme) robust visual odometry is all we need for
realistic PointNav; if we can achieve that, we can ignore the sensing and
actuation noise.
  With that as our operating hypothesis, we scale the dataset and model size,
and develop human-annotation-free data-augmentation techniques to train models
for visual odometry. We advance the state of art on the Habitat Realistic
PointNav Challenge from 71% to 94% Success (+23, 31% relative) and 53% to 74%

explicit mapping may not be necessary for navigation, even in a realistic

  OSM has consistently shown better classification accuracies over

approach, algorithms based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which include

exploring a grid of values for the penalisation parameter. The SAEM approach is
much faster than a classical MCMC algorithm and our method shows very good
selection performances on simulated data. Its flexibility is demonstrated by
implementing it for a variety of nonlinear mixed effects models. The usefulness
of the proposed method is illustrated on a problem of genetic markers
identification, relevant for genomic-assisted selection in plant breeding.

years given its promising performance in image segmentation and classification
tasks. The success of machine learning, in particular supervised learning,
depends on the availability of manually annotated datasets. For medical imaging
applications, such annotated datasets are not easy to acquire, it takes a
substantial amount of time and resource to curate an annotated medical image
set. In this paper, we propose an efficient annotation framework for brain MR
images that can suggest informative sample images for human experts to
annotate. We evaluate the framework on two different brain image analysis
tasks, namely brain tumour segmentation and whole brain segmentation.
Experiments show that for brain tumour segmentation task on the BraTS 2019
dataset, training a segmentation model with only 7% suggestively annotated
image samples can achieve a performance comparable to that of training on the
full dataset. For whole brain segmentation on the MALC dataset, training with
42% suggestively annotated image samples can achieve a comparable performance
to training on the full dataset. The proposed framework demonstrates a
promising way to save manual annotation cost and improve data efficiency in
medical imaging applications.

still a holy grail in vision and language understanding, especially for video
QA. Compared with image QA that focuses primarily on understanding the
associations between image region-level details and corresponding questions,
video QA requires a model to jointly reason across both spatial and long-range
temporal structures of a video as well as text to provide an accurate answer.
In this paper, we specifically tackle the problem of video QA by proposing a
Structured Two-stream Attention network, namely STA, to answer a free-form or
open-ended natural language question about the content of a given video. First,
we infer rich long-range temporal structures in videos using our structured
segment component and encode text features. Then, our structured two-stream
attention component simultaneously localizes important visual instance, reduces
the influence of background video and focuses on the relevant text. Finally,
the structured two-stream fusion component incorporates different segments of
query and video aware context representation and infers the answers.
Experiments on the large-scale video QA dataset \textit{TGIF-QA} show that our
proposed method significantly surpasses the best counterpart (i.e., with one
representation for the video input) by 13.0%, 13.5%, 11.0% and 0.3 for Action,

the ion energetics, the acceleration mechanisms and the possible sources of
different plasma and suprathermal ion populations. The determination of the
exact shape of the total particle spectrum, provide the necessary means to
address the inner heliosheath (IHS) dynamics. Apart from various modeling
efforts, a direct fit to the measured ion spectra for an extended energy range
of $\sim$0.11 to 344 MeV has not been performed to date.
  We use an extended set of combined 0.11-55 keV ENA measurements from the
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX-Lo and IBEX-Hi) and Cassini/Ion and
Neutral Camera (INCA), converted to protons, together with $\sim$28 keV to 344
MeV ion measurements from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) and Cosmic Ray
Subsystem (CRS) experiments on Voyager 2, over the declining phase of Solar
Cyle 23 (SC23) and ascending phase Solar Cylce 24 (SC24) (2009-2016) to study
the characteristics of the particle energy spectrum.
  We fit the 0.11 keV to 344 MeV composite spectra with a set of regularized
isotropic $\kappa$-distribution functions (RKD) allowing the determination of
the macroscopic physical properties.
  We demonstrate that the 2009-2012 spectrum that corresponds to the declining
phase of SC23 is well fitted by three different RKDs, while the 2013-2016
spectrum, associated with the rise of SC24, can only be approximated with six
different RKDs.
  Our results are generally consistent with shock accelerated particles that
undergo additional acceleration inside the IHS. We identify a low energy
transmitted population of particles, a suprathermal reflected population and a
very high energy component that is modulated by GCRs. The 2013-2016 time period
is most likely associated with a mixture of particles from SC23 and SC24, which
is reflected by the need to employ six RDKs.

inference and has received increasing attention in many areas, especially in

disentangled representation learning methods that decompose covariates into
three latent factors, including instrumental, confounding and adjustment

it remains an open problem how to learn the underlying disentangled factors
precisely. Specifically, previous methods fail to obtain independent
disentangled factors, which is a necessary condition for identifying treatment
effect. In this paper, we propose Disentangled Representations for
Counterfactual Regression via Mutual Information Minimization (MIM-DRCFR),
which uses a multi-task learning framework to share information when learning
the latent factors and incorporates MI minimization learning criteria to ensure
the independence of these factors. Extensive experiments including public
benchmarks and real-world industrial user growth datasets demonstrate that our
method performs much better than state-of-the-art methods.

developed for decades. However, compared with the fourth generation programming
language, the fifth generation programming language has not been widely used
because of its obscure semantics, rigorous representation of problems, and
limited inference ability. For this reason, COOL (Constraint and Object Ordered
Language), a fifth generation programming language proposed in this paper,
overcomes the problems of intuitive semantics, rigorous restrictions on
handling problem conditions, and improves the inference ability of previous
fifth generation programming languages. Specific improvements are as follows:
First, COOL supports process-oriented and object-oriented for easy application
in production projects; Second, COOL supports expression as function
declaration and function return, which improves language affinity for
mathematical formulas, and supports embedding function parameters into function
name strings to make function naming closer to natural languages. Make
mathematical problems easier to describe; Third, COOL introduces a weighting
mechanism and accelerates the inference process through cumulative weighting.
Fourth, COOL introduces the concepts of forward and reverse functions in
programming so that computers can infer and execute problems with logical
sequential constraints. Fifth, the computer can deduce the reverse solution
process by using the forward solution process through the back-tracking
algorithm and the dynamic programming algorithm, so that the computer can
deduce the problem with time-sequential constraints. Sixth, the pre-execution
step is introduced to separate the inference and function query process of the
program from the execution process, so as to improve the execution speed of the
program.

stable than the \textit{Pnma} phase, contrary to what is observed for
Sb$_2$S$_3$ and Bi$_2$S$_3$, and irrespective of the exchange-correlation

  The result for Sb$_2$Se$_3$ is in contradiction to experiments where all
three compounds are usually grown in the \textit{Pnma} phase.
  This result is further confirmed by free-energy calculations taking into
account the temperature dependence of the unit-cell volumes and phonon

  Lattice dynamics and elastic tensor calculations further show that both

mechanically stable at zero applied pressure.

result obtained from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we calculate the
amplitude of the ISW auto-power spectrum as a function of multipole order l for
the IDMDE model. The results indicate that the amplitude of the ISW auto-power
spectrum in the IDMDE model for different phantom dark energy equations of
state behaves similar to the one for the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas, for the
quintessence dark energy equations of state, the amplitude of the ISW-auto
power spectrum for the IDMDE model should be higher than the one for the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Also, it turns out that the corresponding results by
different values of the coupling parameter demonstrate that $\xi$ is inversely
proportional to the amplitude of the ISW-auto power spectrum in the IDMDE
model. Finally, by employing four different surveys, we calculate the amplitude
of the ISW-cross power spectrum as a function of multipole order $l$ for the

such a property, provided some constraint conditions relating the potential
parameters are satisfied, in other words they are conditionally deformed shape
invariant. Since, in the second step of the construction of a partner potential
hierarchy, the constraint conditions change, we impose compatibility conditions
between the two sets to build quasi-exactly solvable potentials with known
ground and first-excited states. Some explicit results are obtained for the
first three members of the family. We then use a generating function method,
wherein the first two superpotentials, the first two partner potentials, and
the first two eigenstates of the starting potential are built from some
generating function $W_+(r)$ [and its accompanying function $W_-(r)$]. From the
results obtained for the latter for the first three family members, we propose
some formulas for $W_{\pm}(r)$ valid for the $m$th family member, depending on
$m+1$ constants $a_0$, $a_1$, \ldots, $a_m$. Such constants satisfy a system of
$m+1$ linear equations. Solving the latter allows us to extend the results up

laser spots through genetic algorithm to perform physical attacks. It realizes
robust and covert physical attack by using low-cost laser equipment. As far as
we know, AdvLS is the first light-based physical attack that perform physical
attacks in the daytime. A large number of experiments in the digital and
physical environments show that AdvLS has excellent robustness and covertness.
In addition, through in-depth analysis of the experimental data, we find that
the adversarial perturbations generated by AdvLS have superior adversarial

due to the capillary effects. Regarding $D$ dependence, it turned out that

maximizing water retention is determined by the void formation due to the

solid impact onto a hierarchically structured granular target. Impact drag
force model for the hierarchically structured granular target is developed
based on the experiment. We perform a set of granular impact experiments in
which mechanical strength and porosity of target grains are systematically
varied. Tiny glass beads ($5$~$\mu$m in diameter) are agglomerated to form
porous grains of $2$--$4$~mm in diameter. Then, the grains are sintered to
control their strength. A polyethylene sphere ($12.7$~mm in diameter) is
dropped onto a hierarchical granular target consisting of these porous grains.
Motion of the penetrating sphere is captured by a high-speed camera and
analyzed. We find that impact drag force produced by the hierarchically
structured granular target can be modeled by the sum of inertial drag and
depth-proportional drag. The depth-proportional drag in hierarchical granular
impact is much greater than that of the usual granular target consisting of
rigid grains. The ratio between grain strength and impact dynamic pressure is a
key dimensionless parameter to characterize this extraordinary large
depth-proportional drag. Grain fracturing plays an important role in the impact
dynamics when the impact dynamic pressure is sufficiently larger than the grain
strength. This implies that the effect of grain fracturing should be considered
also for the impact on a small body. Perhaps, effective strength of the surface
grains can be estimated based on the kinematic observation of the intrusion or
touchdown of the planetary explorator.

Purcell radiative rate enhancement and the coupling efficiency into a desired

that is discussed and unsolved for a long period. In the research of narrow AI,
this seems not a severe problem, since researchers in that field focus on some
specific problems as well as one or some aspects of cognition, and the criteria
for evaluation are explicitly defined. By contrast, an AGI agent should solve
problems that are never-encountered by both agents and developers. However,
once a developer tests and debugs the agent with a problem, the
never-encountered problem becomes the encountered problem, as a result, the
problem is solved by the developers to some extent, exploiting their
experience, rather than the agents. This conflict, as we call the trap of
developers' experience, leads to that this kind of problems is probably hard to
become an acknowledged criterion. In this paper, we propose an evaluation
method named Artificial Open World, aiming to jump out of the trap. The
intuition is that most of the experience in the actual world should not be
necessary to be applied to the artificial world, and the world should be open
in some sense, such that developers are unable to perceive the world and solve
problems by themselves before testing, though after that they are allowed to
check all the data. The world is generated in a similar way as the actual
world, and a general form of problems is proposed. A metric is proposed aiming
to quantify the progress of research. This paper describes the conceptual
design of the Artificial Open World, though the formalization and the
implementation are left to the future.

Currently restricted to single objects with simple shapes, the interest in

detected flashes on Jupiter and comparable with the Tunguska impact on Earth in
1908. This detection indicates that Tunguska-like impact events on Jupiter
occur approximately once per year, two-three orders of magnitude more frequent
than terrestrial impacts. The observed flash displayed a single-temperature
blackbody spectrum with an effective temperature of approximately 8300 K
without clear temporal variation, possibly representing common radiative
features of terrestrial Tunguska-class superbolides.

  Implementation Approach","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent studies, moving target defense (MTD) has been applied to detect
false data injection (FDI) attacks using distributed flexible AC transmission
system (D-FACTS) devices. However, the inherent conflict between the security
goals of MTD (i.e., detecting FDI attacks) and the economic goals of D-FACTS
devices (i.e., reducing power losses) would impede the application of MTD in
real systems. Moreover, the detection capabilities of existing MTDs are often
insufficient. This paper proposes a multi-stage MTD (MMTD) approach to resolve
these two issues by adding a group of designed security-oriented schemes before
D-FACTS' economic-oriented scheme to detect FDI attacks. We keep these
security-oriented schemes for a very short time interval and then revert to the
economic-oriented scheme for the remaining time to ensure the economic
requirements. We prove that a designed MMTD can significantly improve the
detection capability compared to existing one-stage MTDs. We find the supremum
of MMTD's detection capability and study its relationship with system topology
and D-FACTS deployment. Meanwhile, a greedy algorithm is proposed to search the
MMTD strategy to reach this supremum. Simulation results show that the proposed
MMTD can achieve the supremum against FDI attacks while outperforming current
MTD strategies on economic indicators.

find that the predicted range of the effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$

unflavored leptogenesis regime and we take into account the decay of the three

based on the RNA-world scenario for the origin of life. These chemical
compounds could have been partially delivered to the young Earth from
extraterrestrial objects, stressing the importance of establishing the
reservoir of nitriles in the interstellar medium. We report here the detection
towards the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 of several nitriles, including cyanic
acid (HOCN), and three C$_4$H$_3$N isomers (cyanoallene, CH$_2$CCHCN; propargyl
cyanide, HCCCH$_2$CN; and cyanopropyne (CH$_3$CCCN), and the tentative
detections of cyanoformaldehyde (HCOCN), and glycolonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). We
have also performed the first interstellar search of cyanoacetaldehyde
(HCOCH$_2$CN), which was not detected. Based on the derived molecular
abundances of the different nitriles in G+0.693-0.027 and other interstellar
sources, we have discussed their formation mechanisms in the ISM. We propose
that the observed HOCN abundance in G+0.693-0.027 is mainly due to surface
chemistry and subsequent shock-induced desorption, while HCOCN might be mainly
formed through gas-phase chemistry. In the case of HOCH$_2$CN, several
grain-surface routes from abundant precursors could produce it. The derived
abundances of the three C$_4$H$_3$N isomers in G+0.693-0.027 are very similar,
and also similar to those previously reported in the dark cold cloud TMC-1.
This suggests that the three isomers are likely formed through gas-phase
chemistry from common precursors, possibly unsaturated hydrocarbons (CH$_3$CCH
and CH$_2$CCH$_2$) that react with the cyanide radical (CN). The rich nitrile
feedstock found towards G+0.693-0.027 confirms that interstellar chemistry is
able to synthesize in space molecular species that could drive the prebiotic
chemistry of the RNA-world.

  The main peculiarity of this work with respect to previous studies is that no
(regularizing) viscosity contribution is added to the fluid-dynamics equations
and only diffusivity effects are included. Motivated by applications to
oceanography, the diffusivity effects included in this work are induced by an
advection term whose specific form was proposed by Gent and McWilliams in the
90's to model effective eddy correlations for non-eddy-resolving systems.
  The results of this paper heavily rely on the assumption of stable
stratification. We provide the well-posedness of the hydrostatic equations and
of the original (non-hydrostatic) equations for stably stratified fluids, as
well as their convergence in the limit of vanishing shallow-water parameter.
The results are established in high but finite Sobolev regularity and keep
track of the various parameters at stake.
  A key ingredient of our analysis is the reformulation of the systems by means
of isopycnal coordinates, which allows to provide careful energy estimates that
are far from being evident in the original coordinate system.

recognition in recent years. These solutions, however, suffer from data
dependency and are difficult to achieve model generalization. To address this
problem, we are inspired by the idea of domain adaptation and propose a
universal learning-based framework, which achieves generalization while
training with limited data. To reduce differences between data distributions, a
compressed U-Net is introduced as a domain mapper to map the raw region of
interest image onto a target domain. The concentrated target domain is a
unified feature space for the subsequent matching, in which a local descriptor
model SOSNet is employed to embed patches into descriptors measuring the
similarity of matching pairs. In the proposed framework, the domain mapper is
an approximation to a specific extraction function thus the training is only a
one-time effort with limited data. Moreover, the local descriptor model can be
trained to be representative enough based on a public dataset of
non-finger-vein images. The whole pipeline enables the framework to be well
generalized, making it possible to enhance universality and helps to reduce
costs of data collection, tuning and retraining. The comparable experimental
results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in five public datasets prove
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the framework shows
application potential in other vein-based biometric recognition as well.

manually annotated pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide

other dichotomy questions remain open, including the dichotomy classification
of list homomorphism problems for signed graphs. Signed graphs arise naturally
in many contexts, including for instance nowhere-zero flows for graphs embedded
in non-orientable surfaces. For a fixed signed graph $\widehat{H}$, the list
homomorphism problem asks whether an input signed graph $\widehat{G}$ with
lists $L(v) \subseteq V(\widehat{H}), v \in V(\widehat{G}),$ admits a
homomorphism $f$ to $\widehat{H}$ with all $f(v) \in L(v), v \in
V(\widehat{G})$. Usually, a dichotomy classification is easier to obtain for
list homomorphisms than for homomorphisms, but in the context of signed graphs
a structural classification of the complexity of list homomorphism problems has
not even been conjectured, even though the classification of the complexity of
homomorphism problems is known. Kim and Siggers have conjectured a structural
classification in the special case of ``weakly balanced"" signed graphs. We
confirm their conjecture for reflexive and irreflexive signed graphs; this
generalizes previous results on weakly balanced signed trees, and weakly
balanced separable signed graphs \cite{separable,trees}. In the reflexive case,
the result was first presented in \cite{KS}, with the proof using some of our
results included in this paper. In fact, here we present our full proof, as an
alternative to the proof in \cite{KS}. In particular, we provide direct
polynomial algorithms where previously algorithms relied on general dichotomy
theorems. The irreflexive results are new, and their proof depends on first
deriving a theorem on extensions of min orderings of (unsigned) bipartite
graphs, which is interesting on its own. [shortened, full abstract in PDF]

obtains relations between them in a particular case. The first family of
energies consists of the Willmore-type energies involving the integral of
powers of the mean curvature which extends the Willmore and Helfrich energies.
A second family of energies is the area functionals arising in weighted
manifolds, following the theory developed by Gromov, when the density is a
power of the height function. The third one is the free energies of a fluid
deposited in a horizontal hyperplane when the potentials depend on the height
with respect to this hyperplane. In this paper we find relations between each
of them when the critical point is a hypersurface of cylindrical type.
Cylindrical hypersurfaces are determined by their generating planar curves and
for each of the families of energies, these curves satisfy suitable ordinary
differential equations. For the Willmore-type energies, the equation is of
fourth order, whereas it is of order two in the other two cases. We prove that
the generating curves coincide for the Willmore-type energies without area
constraint and for weighted areas, and the similar result holds for the
generating curves of Willmore-type energies and of the vertical potential
energies, after suitable choices of the physical parameters. In all the cases,
generating curves are critical points for a family of energies extending the
classical bending energy. In the final section of the paper, we analyze the
stability of a liquid drop deposited on a horizontal hyperplane with vertical
potential energies. It is proven that if the free interface of the fluid is a
graph on this hyperplane, then the hypersurface is stable in the sense that it
is a local minimizer of the energy. In fact, we prove that the hypersurface is
a global minimizer in the class of all graphs with the same boundary.

  Averaging Criterion using Solution Choice Observations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decisions under uncertainty or with multiple objectives usually require the
decision maker to formulate a preference regarding risks or trade-offs. If this
preference is known, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) criterion can be
applied to aggregate scenarios or objectives into a single function.
Formulating this preference, however, can be challenging, as we need to make
explicit what is usually only implicit knowledge. We explore an
optimization-based method of preference elicitation for a risk-averse decision
maker to identify appropriate non-increasing OWA weights. We follow a
data-driven approach, assuming the existence of observations, where the
decision maker has chosen the preferred solution, but otherwise remains passive
during the elicitation process. We then use these observations to determine the
underlying preference by finding the preference vector that is at minimum
distance to the polyhedra of feasible vectors for each of the observations.
Using our optimization-based model, weights are determined by solving an
alternating sequence of linear programs and standard OWA problems. Numerical
experiments show that our passive elicitation method compares well against
actively having to conduct pairwise comparisons and performs particularly well
when there are inconsistencies in the decision maker's choices.

injury. We analyzed a cohort of 64 adult patients requiring hospitalization for
non-penetrating traumatic brain injury of all severities as well as 32 healthy
controls. Patients underwent brain MRI and clinical neuropsychological
assessment in the subacute (2-weeks) and chronic (6-months) post-injury period,
and controls underwent a single MRI. For each subject, we derived a summary
score representing deviations in whole brain white matter (1) extracellular
free water volume fraction (VF) and (2) free water-corrected fractional
anisotropy (fw-FA). The summary specific anomaly score (SAS) for VF was
significantly higher in TBI patients in the subacute and chronic post-injury
period relative to controls. SAS for VF significantly correlated with
neuropsychological functioning in the subacute, but not chronic post-injury
period. These findings indicate abnormalities in whole brain white matter
extracellular water fraction in patients with TBI and are an important step
toward identifying and validating noninvasive biomarkers that map onto the

proposes a soft calibration scheme, in which the outcome and the selection
indicator follow mixed-effects models. The scheme imposes an exact calibration
on the fixed effects and an approximate calibration on the random effects. On
the one hand, our soft calibration has an intrinsic connection with best linear
unbiased prediction, which results in a more efficient estimation compared to
hard calibration. On the other hand, soft calibration weighting estimation can
be envisioned as penalized propensity score weight estimation, with the penalty
term motivated by the mixed-effects structure. The asymptotic distribution and

However, enriching a Knowledge Graph in the fashion domain has its own

very laborious task. Even more, fashion products display a high variability and
require an intricate ontology of attributes to link to. We use a transfer

labeled data, followed by an EL module that links the previously identified
named entities to the appropriate entities within the FKG. Experiments using a
pre-trained model show that it is possible to achieve 89.75% accuracy in NER

relying on simple rule-based or ML models (due to lack of training data), is
able to link relevant attributes to products, thus automatically enriching the

complex systems via interactions between constituent entities. Machine learning
(ML) refers to approaches whereby statistical algorithms 'learn' from data on
their own, without imposing a priori theories of system behavior. Biological
systems -- from molecules, to cells, to entire organisms -- consist of vast
numbers of entities, governed by complex webs of interactions that span many
spatiotemporal scales and exhibit nonlinearity, stochasticity and intricate
coupling between entities. The macroscopic properties and collective dynamics
of such systems are difficult to capture via continuum modelling and mean-field
formalisms. ABM takes a 'bottom-up' approach that obviates these difficulties
by enabling one to easily propose and test a set of well-defined 'rules' to be
applied to the individual entities (agents) in a system. Evaluating a system
and propagating its state over discrete time-steps effectively simulates the
system, allowing observables to be computed and system properties to be
analyzed. Because the rules that govern an ABM can be difficult to abstract and
formulate from experimental data, there is an opportunity to use ML to help
infer optimal, system-specific ABM rules. Once such rule-sets are devised, ABM
calculations can generate a wealth of data, and ML can be applied there too --
e.g., to probe statistical measures that meaningfully describe a system's
stochastic properties. As an example of synergy in the other direction (from
ABM to ML), ABM simulations can generate realistic datasets for training ML
algorithms (e.g., for regularization, to mitigate overfitting). In these ways,
one can envision various synergistic ABM$\rightleftharpoons$ML loops. This
review summarizes how ABM and ML have been integrated in contexts that span
spatiotemporal scales, from cellular to population-level epidemiology.

perturbations of the latent variables--e.g. images in a reinforcement learning
environment where actions move individual sprites--identification is achievable
under unknown continuous latent distributions. We show that if the
perturbations are applied only on mutually exclusive blocks of latents, we
identify the latents up to those blocks. We also show that if these
perturbation blocks overlap, we identify latents up to the smallest blocks
shared across perturbations. Consequently, if there are blocks that intersect
in one latent variable only, then such latents are identified up to permutation
and scaling. We propose a natural estimation procedure based on this theory and
illustrate it on low-dimensional synthetic and image-based experiments.

temporal trigger altering the average chrominance of the video sequence. The
backdoor signal is designed by taking into account the peculiarities of the
Human Visual System (HVS) to reduce the visibility of the trigger, thus
increasing the stealthiness of the backdoor. To force the network to look at
the presence of the trigger in the challenging clean-label scenario, we choose
the poisoned samples used for the injection of the backdoor following a
so-called Outlier Poisoning Strategy (OPS). According to OPS, the triggering
signal is inserted in the training samples that the network finds more
difficult to classify. The effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack and
its generality are validated experimentally on different datasets and

to learn the complex behavior of the camera sensor noise. Recently, more

dependence on supervised data (i.e., paired clean images) is a limiting factor

framework for training a noise model and a denoiser simultaneously while
relying only on pairs of noisy images rather than noisy/clean paired image
data. We apply this framework to the training of the Noise Flow architecture.
The noise synthesis and density estimation results show that our framework
outperforms previous signal-processing-based noise models and is on par with
its supervised counterpart. The trained denoiser is also shown to significantly
improve upon both supervised and weakly supervised baseline denoising
approaches. The results indicate that the joint training of a denoiser and a

theoretically, to be robust to label noise under certain conditions -- notably
the typical assumption is that label noise is independent of the features given
the class label. We provide a theoretical framework that generalizes beyond
this typical assumption by modeling label noise as a distribution over feature
space. We show that both the scale and the shape of the noise distribution
influence the posterior likelihood; and the shape of the noise distribution has
a stronger impact on classification performance if the noise is concentrated in
feature space where the decision boundary can be moved. For the special case of
uniform label noise (independent of features and the class label), we show that
the Bayes optimal classifier for $c$ classes is robust to label noise until the
ratio of noisy samples goes above $\frac{c-1}{c}$ (e.g. 90% for 10 classes),
which we call the tipping point. However, for the special case of
class-dependent label noise (independent of features given the class label),
the tipping point can be as low as 50%. Most importantly, we show that when the
noise distribution targets decision boundaries (label noise is directly
dependent on feature space), classification robustness can drop off even at a
small scale of noise. Even when evaluating recent label-noise mitigation
methods we see reduced accuracy when label noise is dependent on features.
These findings explain why machine learning often handles label noise well if
the noise distribution is uniform in feature-space; yet it also points to the
difficulty of overcoming label noise when it is concentrated in a region of
feature space where a decision boundary can move.

usually have large cosmogenic neutron backgrounds. The Taishan Antineutrino
Observatory (TAO) is a ton-level liquid scintillator detector located at about
30 m from a core of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. It will measure the
reactor antineutrino spectrum with high precision and high energy resolution to
provide a reference spectrum for JUNO and other reactor antineutrino
experiments, and provide a benchmark measurement to test nuclear databases.
Background is one of the critical concerns of TAO since the overburden is just
10 meter-water-equivalent. The cosmogenic neutron background was estimated to
be ~10% of signals. With detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we propose several
measures in this work to reduce the neutron backgrounds, including doping
Gadolinium in the buffer liquid, adding a polyethylene layer above the bottom
lead shield, and optimization of the veto strategy. With these improvements,
the neutron background-to-signal ratio can be reduced to ~2%, and might be
further suppressed with pulse shape discrimination.

cosmological simulations, on the other hand, are designed to match the observed

spectroscopic surveys at a redshift of z~2.3, corresponding to an epoch of
nearly 11 Gyrs ago. This allows us to 'fast-forward' the simulation to our
present-day and study the evolution of observed cosmic structures
self-consistently. We confirm that several previously-reported protoclusters
will evolve into massive galaxy clusters by our present epoch, including the
'Hyperion' structure that we predict will collapse into a giant filamentary
supercluster spanning 100 Megaparsecs. We also discover previously unknown
protoclusters, with lower final masses than typically detectable by other

represents a unique opportunity for studying early structure formation and
matching galaxy properties between high and low redshifts.

  models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The choice of the prior model can have a large impact on the ability to
assimilate data. In standard applications of ensemble-based data assimilation,
all realizations in the initial ensemble are generated from the same covariance
matrix with the implicit assumption that this covariance is appropriate for the
problem. In a hierarchical approach, the parameters of the covariance function,
for example the variance, the orientation of the anisotropy and the ranges in
two principal directions, may all be uncertain. Thus, the hierarchical approach
is much more robust against model misspecification. In this paper, three
approaches to sampling from the posterior for hierarchical parameterizations
are discussed: an optimization-based sampling approach (RML), an iterative
ensemble smoother (IES), and a novel hybrid of the previous two approaches
(hybrid IES). The three approximate sampling methods are applied to a
linear-Gaussian inverse problem for which it is possible to compare results
with an exact ""marginal-then-conditional"" approach. Additionally, the IES and
the hybrid IES methods are tested on a two-dimensional flow problem with
uncertain anisotropy in the prior covariance. The standard IES method is shown
to perform poorly in the flow examples because of the poor representation of
the local sensitivity matrix by the ensemble-based method. The hybrid method,
however, samples well even with a relatively small ensemble size.

factorization emerges as a promising way to handle the credit assignment issue

However, existing value function factorization methods cannot deal with ad-hoc
cooperation, that is, adapting to new configurations of teammates at test time.
Specifically, these methods do not explicitly utilize the relationship between
agents and cannot adapt to different sizes of inputs. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel method, called Relation-Aware Credit Assignment
(RACA), which achieves zero-shot generalization in ad-hoc cooperation
scenarios. RACA takes advantage of a graph-based relation encoder to encode the
topological structure between agents. Furthermore, RACA utilizes an
attention-based observation abstraction mechanism that can generalize to an
arbitrary number of teammates with a fixed number of parameters. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods on the StarCraftII

Spallation Source neutrino Super Beam (ESS$\nu$SB) feasibility study. This
facility has been proposed after the measurements reported in 2012 of a
relatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, which raised
the possibility of observing potential CP violation in the leptonic sector with
conventional neutrino beams. The measured value of $\theta_{13}$ also
privileges the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum for the discovery of CP violation
instead of the more typically studied $1^{st}$ maximum. The sensitivity at this
$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum is about three times higher than at the $1^{st}$
one, which implies a reduced influence of systematic errors. Working at the
$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum requires a very intense neutrino beam with an
appropriate energy. The world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source,
the European Spallation Source (ESS), will have a proton linac operating at
5\,MW power, 2\,GeV kinetic energy and 14~Hz repetition rate (3~ms pulse
duration, 4\% duty cycle) for neutron production. In this design study it is
proposed to double the repetition rate and compress the beam pulses to the
level of microseconds in order to provide an additional 5~MW proton beam for
neutrino production. The physics performance has been evaluated for such a
neutrino super beam, in conjunction with a megaton-scale underground water
Cherenkov neutrino detector installed at a distance of 360--550\,km from ESS.
The ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring required for proton-pulse
compression, the target station design and optimisation, the near and far
detector complexes, and the physics potential of the facility are all described
in this report. The ESS linac will be operational by 2025, at which point the
implementation of upgrades for the neutrino facility could begin.

mpox outbreak in 2022 have demonstrated the value of genomic sequencing data
for tracking the origin and spread of pathogens. Laboratories around the globe
generated new sequences at unprecedented speed and volume and bioinformaticians
developed new tools and dashboards to analyze this wealth of data. However, a
major challenge that remains is the lack of simple and efficient approaches for
accessing and processing sequencing data.
  Results: The Lightweight API for Sequences (LAPIS) facilitates rapid
retrieval and analysis of genomic sequencing data through a REST API. It
supports complex mutation- and metadata-based queries and can perform
aggregation operations on massive datasets. LAPIS is optimized for typical
questions relevant to genomic epidemiology. Using a newly-developed in-memory
database engine, it has a high speed and throughput: between 25 January and 4
February 2023, the SARS-CoV-2 instance of LAPIS, which contains 14.5 million
sequences, processed over 20 million requests with a mean response time of 411
ms and a median response time of 1 ms. LAPIS is the core engine behind our
dashboards on genspectrum.org and we currently maintain public LAPIS instances
for SARS-CoV-2 and mpox.
  Conclusions: Powered by an optimized database engine and available through a
web API, LAPIS enhances the accessibility of genomic sequencing data. It is
designed to serve as a common backend for dashboards and analyses with the
potential to be integrated into common database platforms such as GenBank.

the impacts of both ISP pipeline and data preprocessing. In this paper, we
develop an image-scaling attack targeting on ISP pipeline, where the crafted
adversarial RAW can be transformed into attack image that presents entirely

The measured free-electron energy at different spatio-temporal coordinates

reshaped the spatial patterns of population movement within countries.
Anecdotal evidence of an urban exodus from large cities to rural areas emerged
during early phases of the pandemic across western societies. Yet, these claims
have not been empirically assessed. Traditional data sources, such as censuses
offer coarse temporal frequency to analyse population movement over short-time
intervals. Drawing on a data set of 21 million observations from Facebook
users, we aim to analyse the extent and evolution of changes in the spatial
patterns of population movement across the rural-urban continuum in Britain
over an 18-month period from March, 2020 to August, 2021. Our findings show an
overall and sustained decline in population movement during periods of high
stringency measures, with the most densely populated areas reporting the
largest reductions. During these periods, we also find evidence of
higher-than-average mobility from highly dense population areas to low densely
populated areas, lending some support to claims of large-scale population
movements from large cities. Yet, we show that these trends were temporary.
Overall mobility levels trended back to pre-coronavirus levels after the easing
of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Following these interventions, we also
found a reduction in movement to low density areas and a rise in mobility to
high density agglomerations. Overall, these findings reveal that while COVID-19
generated shock waves leading to temporary changes in the patterns of
population movement in Britain, the resulting vibrations have not significantly
reshaped the prevalent structures in the national pattern of population
movement.

In the sporadic and sparse, though commendable efforts so far devoted to the
characterization and understanding of function and affordance, there has also
been no general framework that could unify all the different use domains and
situations related to the representation and application of functional
concepts. This paper develops just such a general framework, with an approach
that emphasizes the fact that the representations involved must be explicitly
cognitive and conceptual, and they must also contain causal characterizations
of the events and processes involved, as well as employ conceptual constructs
that are grounded in the referents to which they refer, in order to achieve
maximal generality. The basic general framework is described, along with a set
of basic guiding principles with regards to the representation of
functionality. To properly and adequately characterize and represent
functionality, a descriptive representation language is needed. This language
is defined and developed, and many examples of its use are described. The
general framework is developed based on an extension of the general language
meaning representational framework called conceptual dependency. To support the
general characterization and representation of functionality, the basic
conceptual dependency framework is enhanced with representational devices
called structure anchor and conceptual dependency elaboration, together with
the definition of a set of ground level concepts. These novel representational
constructs are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing
with functionality would represent a major step toward achieving Artificial

For fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing $\Delta$

bypassing the need for manual annotations of the LAT. The Deep Learning
network, the CNN-LSTM model, is a hybrid network architecture which combines
convolutional neural network (CNN) layers with long short-term memory (LSTM)
layers. 1452 EGM signals from a total of 9 patients undergoing
clinically-indicated 3D cardiac mapping were used for the training, validation
and testing of our models. From our findings, the CNN-LSTM model achieved an
accuracy of 81% for the balanced dataset. For comparison, we separately
developed a rule-based Decision Trees model which attained an accuracy of 67%
for the same balanced dataset. Our work elucidates that analysing the EGM
signals using a set of explicitly specified rules as proposed by the Decision
Trees model is not suitable as EGM signals are complex. The CNN-LSTM model, on
the other hand, has the ability to learn the complex, intrinsic features within
the signals and identify useful features to differentiate the EGM signals.

charging demand at a neighborhood granularity using cellular signaling data.
Second, we propose a segmentation model to partition the total charging needs
among different charging technology: normal, semi-rapid, and fast charging. The
segmentation model, an approach based on the city's points of interest, is a
state-of-the-art method that derives useful trends applicable to city planning.
A case study for the city of Brussels is proposed.

around the world having easy access to rapidly disseminated information.
However, a more interconnected society enables the spread of intentionally
false information. To mitigate the negative impacts of fake news, it is
essential to improve detection methodologies. This work introduces Multi-Policy
Statement Checker (MPSC), a framework that automates fake news detection by
using deep learning techniques to analyze a statement itself and its related
news articles, predicting whether it is seemingly credible or suspicious. The
proposed framework was evaluated using four merged datasets containing real and
fake news. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models were
trained to utilize both lexical and syntactic features, and their performance
was evaluated. The obtained results demonstrate that a multi-policy analysis
reliably identifies suspicious statements, which can be advantageous for fake
news detection.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Space communications, particularly mega satellite networks, re-emerged as an
appealing candidate for next generation networks due to major advances in space
launching, electronics, processing power, and miniaturization. However, mega
satellite networks rely on numerous underlying and intertwined processes that
cannot be truly captured using conventionally used models, due to their dynamic
and unique features such as orbital speed, inter-satellite links, short time
pass, and satellite footprint, among others. Hence, new approaches are needed
to enable the network to proactively adjust to the rapidly varying conditions
associated within the link. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a pathway to
capture these processes, analyze their behavior, and model their effect on the
network. This article introduces the application of AI techniques for
integrated terrestrial satellite networks, particularly mega satellite network
communications. It details the unique features of mega satellite networks, and
the overarching challenges concomitant with their integration into the current
communication infrastructure. Moreover, the article provides insights into
state-of-the-art AI techniques across various layers of the communication link.
This entails applying AI for forecasting the highly dynamic radio channel,
spectrum sensing and classification, signal detection and demodulation,
inter-satellite link and satellite access network optimization, and network
security. Moreover, future paradigms and the mapping of these mechanisms onto
practical networks are outlined.

  Tasks in the Overparameterized Regime",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Overparameterization is known to permit strong generalization performance in
neural networks. In this work, we provide an initial theoretical analysis of
its effect on catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setup. We show
experimentally that in permuted MNIST image classification tasks, the
generalization performance of multilayer perceptrons trained by vanilla
stochastic gradient descent can be improved by overparameterization, and the
extent of the performance increase achieved by overparameterization is
comparable to that of state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms. We
provide a theoretical explanation of this effect by studying a qualitatively
similar two-task linear regression problem, where each task is related by a
random orthogonal transformation. We show that when a model is trained on the
two tasks in sequence without any additional regularization, the risk gain on
the first task is small if the model is sufficiently overparameterized.

pattern shows the growth of the pure anatase phase of TiO$_{2}$. UV absorption
