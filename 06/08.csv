  Intelligence",,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-rigid 3D registration, which deforms a source 3D shape in a non-rigid way
to align with a target 3D shape, is a classical problem in computer vision.
Such problems can be challenging because of imperfect data (noise, outliers and
partial overlap) and high degrees of freedom. Existing methods typically adopt
the $\ell_p$ type robust norm to measure the alignment error and regularize the
smoothness of deformation, and use a proximal algorithm to solve the resulting
non-smooth optimization problem. However, the slow convergence of such
algorithms limits their wide applications. In this paper, we propose a
formulation for robust non-rigid registration based on a globally smooth robust
norm for alignment and regularization, which can effectively handle outliers
and partial overlaps. The problem is solved using the majorization-minimization
algorithm, which reduces each iteration to a convex quadratic problem with a
closed-form solution. We further apply Anderson acceleration to speed up the
convergence of the solver, enabling the solver to run efficiently on devices
with limited compute capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for non-rigid alignment between two shapes with
outliers and partial overlaps, with quantitative evaluation showing that it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of registration accuracy and
computational speed. The source code is available at

However, deep learning (DL)-based direct segmentation of CBCT images is a
challenging task, mainly due to the poor image quality and lack of
well-labelled large training datasets. Deformable image registration (DIR) is
often used to propagate the manual contours on the planning CT (pCT) of the
same patient to CBCT. In this work, we undertake solving the problems mentioned
above with the assistance of DIR. Our method consists of three main components.
First, we use deformed pCT contours derived from multiple DIR methods between
pCT and CBCT as pseudo labels for initial training of the DL-based direct
segmentation model. Second, we use deformed pCT contours from another DIR
algorithm as influencer volumes to define the region of interest for DL-based
direct segmentation. Third, the initially trained DL model is further
fine-tuned using a smaller set of true labels. We found that DL-based direct
segmentation on CBCT trained with pseudo labels and without influencer volumes
shows poor performance compared to DIR-based segmentation. However, adding
deformed pCT contours as influencer volumes in the direct segmentation network
dramatically improves segmentation performance, reaching the accuracy level of
DIR-based segmentation. The DL model with influencer volumes can be further
improved through fine-tuning using a smaller set of true labels. Experiments
showed that 7 out of 19 structures have an at least 0.2 Dice similarity
coefficient increase compared to DIR-based segmentation. A DL-based direct CBCT
segmentation model can be improved to outperform DIR-based segmentation models
by using deformed pCT contours as pseudo labels and influencer volumes for

changes in camera viewpoint, and new content that arises over time. Existing
video generation methods often fail to produce new content as a function of
time while maintaining consistencies expected in real environments, such as
plausible dynamics and object persistence. A common failure case is for content
to never change due to over-reliance on inductive biases to provide temporal
consistency, such as a single latent code that dictates content for the entire
video. On the other extreme, without long-term consistency, generated videos
may morph unrealistically between different scenes. To address these
limitations, we prioritize the time axis by redesigning the temporal latent
representation and learning long-term consistency from data by training on
longer videos. To this end, we leverage a two-phase training strategy, where we
separately train using longer videos at a low resolution and shorter videos at
a high resolution. To evaluate the capabilities of our model, we introduce two
new benchmark datasets with explicit focus on long-term temporal dynamics.

decades. While current approaches manage to precisely and robustly identify the

to fit the recorded measurements to a model of a known object, this paper
treats robot calibration as an offline SLAM problem, where scanning poses are
linked to a fixed point in space by a moving kinematic chain. As such, the
presented framework allows robot calibration using nothing but an arbitrary
eye-in-hand depth sensor, thus enabling fully autonomous self-calibration
without any external tools. My new approach is utilizes a modified version of
the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to run bundle adjustment on multiple 3D
recordings estimating the optimal parameters of the kinematic model. A detailed
evaluation of the system is shown on a real robot with various attached 3D
sensors. The presented results show that the system reaches precision
comparable to a dedicated external tracking system at a fraction of its cost.

transit lightcurves to date -- adopted a linear prior on $\tilde{\rho}$. Here,
we show that such a prior biases measurements of impact parameter, $b$, due to
the non-linear relationship between $\tilde{\rho}$ and transit duration. This
bias slightly favors low values ($b \lesssim 0.3$) and strongly disfavors high
values ($b \gtrsim 0.7$) unless transit signal-to-noise ratio is sufficient to
provide an independent constraint on $b$, a criterion that is not satisfied for
the majority of Kepler planets. Planet-to-star radius ratio, $r$, is also
biased due to $r{-}b$ covariance. Consequently, the median Kepler DR25 target
suffers a $1.6\%$ systematic underestimate of $r$. We present a techniques for
correcting these biases and for avoiding them in the first place.

eruption in 2018. Here we report ground-based optical, Swift UV and X-ray, and
Fermi-LAT \gamma-ray observations following the eruption for almost three
years. V392 Per is one of the fastest evolving novae yet observed, with a $t_2$
decline time of 2 days. Early spectra present evidence for multiple and
interacting mass ejections, with the associated shocks driving both the
\gamma-ray and early optical luminosity. V392 Per entered Sun-constraint within
days of eruption. Upon exit, the nova had evolved to the nebular phase, and we
saw the tail of the super-soft X-ray phase. Subsequent optical emission
captured the fading ejecta alongside a persistent narrow line emission spectrum
from the accretion disk. Ongoing hard X-ray emission is characteristic of a
standing accretion shock in an intermediate polar. Analysis of the optical data
reveals an orbital period of 3.230 \pm 0.003 days, but we see no evidence for a
white dwarf (WD) spin period. The optical and X-ray data suggest a high mass
WD, the pre-nova spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates an evolved donor,
and the post-nova SED points to a high mass accretion rate. Following eruption,
the system has remained in a nova-like high mass transfer state, rather than
returning to the pre-nova DN low mass transfer configuration. We suggest that
this high state is driven by irradiation of the donor by the nova eruption. In
many ways, V392 Per shows similarity to the well-studied nova and DN GK Persei.

approachable in constrained environments where there is ample prior knowledge

building systems that scale beyond specific situational instances and
gracefully operate in novel conditions. In the past, researchers used heuristic
and simple rule-based strategies to accomplish tasks such as scene segmentation

environments where a roboticist can make simplifying assumptions about
everything from the geometries of the objects to be interacted with, level of

The work in this thesis will demonstrate how to build a system for robotic
mobile manipulation that is robust to changes in these variables. This
robustness will be enabled by recent simultaneous advances in the fields of big

realistic sensory data enables the generation of massive corpora of labeled

superiority of Transformers should largely be credited to their
self-attention-like architectures per se. In this paper, we question that

three highly effective architecture designs for boosting robustness, yet simple
enough to be implemented in several lines of code, namely a) patchifying input

normalization layers. Bringing these components together, we are able to build
pure CNN architectures without any attention-like operations that are as robust

antihistamines as anti-infective agents and identifies gaps in research that
have impaired its applicability in human health. Methods. The literature search
encompassed MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to 2022. Results. The
literature search identified 12 antihistamines with activity against different
pathogens. Eight molecules were second-generation antihistamines with
intrinsically lower tendency to cross the blood brain barrier thereby with
reduced side effects. Only five antihistamines had in vivo evaluations in
rodents while one study utilized a wax moth model to determine astemizole
anti-Cryptococcus sp. activity combined with fluconazole. In vitro studies
showed that clemastine was active against Plasmodium, Leishmania, and
Trypanosoma, while terfenadine suppressed Candida spp. and Staphylococcus
aureus growth. In vitro assays found that SARS-coV-2 was inhibited by doxepin,
azelastine, desloratadine, and clemastine. Different antihistamines inhibited
Ebola virus (diphenhydramine, chlorcyclizine), Hepatitis C virus
(chlorcyclizine), and Influenza virus (carbinoxamine, chlorpheniramine).
Generally, in vitro activity (IC50) of antihistamines was in the low to
sub-microM range, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (loratadine MIC=50
microM) and SARS-coV-2 (desloratadine 70% inhibition at 20 microM). Conclusion.
Many antihistamine drugs showed potential to progress to clinical trials based
on in vitro data and availability of toxicological and pharmacological data.
However, the overall lack of systematic preclinical trials has hampered the
advance of repurposed antihistamines for off label evaluation. The low interest
of pharmaceutical companies has to be counterbalanced through collaborations
between research groups, granting agencies and government to support the needed
clinical trials.

  at finite deformation",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Fracture of materials with rate-dependent mechanical behaviour, e.g.
polymers, is a highly complex process. For an adequate modelling, the coupling
between rate-dependent stiffness, dissipative mechanisms present in the bulk
material and crack driving force has to be accounted for in an appropriate
manner. In addition, the fracture toughness, i.e. the resistance against crack
propagation, can depend on rate of deformation. In this contribution, an
energetic phase-field model of rate-dependent fracture at finite deformation is
presented. For the deformation of the bulk material, a formulation of finite
viscoelasticity is adopted with strain energy densities of Ogden type assumed.
The unified formulation allows to study different expressions for the fracture
driving force. Furthermore, a possibly rate-dependent toughness is
incorporated. The model is calibrated using experimental results from the
literature for an elastomer and predictions are qualitatively and
quantitatively validated against experimental data. Predictive capabilities of
the model are studied for monotonic loads as well as creep fracture.
Symmetrical and asymmetrical crack patterns are discussed and the influence of
a dissipative fracture driving force contribution is analysed. It is shown
that, different from ductile fracture of metals, such a driving force is not
required for an adequate simulation of experimentally observable crack paths
and is not favourable for the description of failure in viscoelastic rubbery
polymers. Furthermore, the influence of a rate-dependent toughness is discussed
by means of a numerical study. From a phenomenological point of view, it is
demonstrated that rate-dependency of resistance against crack propagation can
be an essential ingredient for the model when specific effects such as
rate-dependent brittle-to-ductile transitions shall be described.

arbitrary anomalies in data, dispensing with the necessity for manual
labelling. Recently, autoregressive transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance for anomaly detection in medical imaging. Nonetheless, these models
still have some intrinsic weaknesses, such as requiring images to be modelled
as 1D sequences, the accumulation of errors during the sampling process, and
the significant inference times associated with transformers. Denoising
diffusion probabilistic models are a class of non-autoregressive generative
models recently shown to produce excellent samples in computer vision
(surpassing Generative Adversarial Networks), and to achieve log-likelihoods
that are competitive with transformers while having fast inference times.
Diffusion models can be applied to the latent representations learnt by
autoencoders, making them easily scalable and great candidates for application
to high dimensional data, such as medical images. Here, we propose a method
based on diffusion models to detect and segment anomalies in brain imaging. By
training the models on healthy data and then exploring its diffusion and
reverse steps across its Markov chain, we can identify anomalous areas in the
latent space and hence identify anomalies in the pixel space. Our diffusion
models achieve competitive performance compared with autoregressive approaches
across a series of experiments with 2D CT and MRI data involving synthetic and
real pathological lesions with much reduced inference times, making their usage
clinically viable.

order to detect structures and predict link and node properties. The latent
space models (LSM) have become prominent frameworks for embedding networks and
include the latent distance (LDM) and eigenmodel (LEM) as the most widely used
LSM specifications. For latent community detection, the embedding space in LDMs
has been endowed with a clustering model whereas LEMs have been constrained to
part-based non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) inspired representations
promoting community discovery. We presently reconcile LSMs with latent
community detection by constraining the LDM representation to the D-simplex
forming the hybrid-membership latent distance model (HM-LDM). We show that for
sufficiently large simplex volumes this can be achieved without loss of
expressive power whereas by extending the model to squared Euclidean distances,
we recover the LEM formulation with constraints promoting part-based
representations akin to NMF. Importantly, by systematically reducing the volume
of the simplex, the model becomes unique and ultimately leads to hard
assignments of nodes to simplex corners. We demonstrate experimentally how the
proposed HM-LDM admits accurate node representations in regimes ensuring
identifiability and valid community extraction. Importantly, HM-LDM naturally
reconciles soft and hard community detection with network embeddings exploring
a simple continuous optimization procedure on a volume constrained simplex that
admits the systematic investigation of trade-offs between hard and mixed
membership community detection.

correctness of their behavior remains a major challenge. It is known that
neural networks can be fragile in the presence of even small input
perturbations, yielding unpredictable outputs. The verification of neural
networks is therefore vital to their adoption, and a number of approaches have
been proposed in recent years. In this paper we focus on semidefinite
programming (SDP) based techniques for neural network verification, which are
particularly attractive because they can encode expressive behaviors while
ensuring a polynomial time decision. Our starting point is the DeepSDP
framework proposed by Fazlyab et al, which uses quadratic constraints to
abstract the verification problem into a large-scale SDP. When the size of the
neural network grows, however, solving this SDP quickly becomes intractable.
Our key observation is that by leveraging chordal sparsity and specific
parametrizations of DeepSDP, we can decompose the primary computational
bottleneck of DeepSDP -- a large linear matrix inequality (LMI) -- into an
equivalent collection of smaller LMIs. Our parametrization admits a tunable
parameter, allowing us to trade-off efficiency and accuracy in the verification
procedure. We call our formulation Chordal-DeepSDP, and provide experimental
evaluation to show that it can: (1) effectively increase accuracy with the
tunable parameter and (2) outperform DeepSDP on deeper networks.

given tasks: it (a) allows to reduce the training error by gradient flow, (b)
leads to models that generalize well, and (c) can be identified by stochastic
gradient descent. SubGD identifies these subspaces from an eigendecomposition

Demonstrably, we can identify low-dimensional suitable subspaces for few-shot

augmenting the energy deposition by neutrino pair annihilation process

context of its encounters with Sagittarius. We built toy models of the
interaction between a host and a satellite galaxy using orbital integrations
after a tidal encounter. We derived analytically the shape of the structures in
phase space as a function of time for simple power-law potential models. We
compared these models to a more realistic N-body simulation of the MW
Sagittarius-like interaction and to data from Gaia DR3. As found before, an
impulsive distant tidal approach of a galactic satellite leads to a two-armed
spiral structure made of orbits in between their apocentres and pericentres,
thus, with average negative galactocentric radial velocity. The two-arm pattern
rotates at an angular speed of $\omega-1/2\kappa$ which depends on radius, thus
causing a wind-up with time. This produces ridges in the $R$-$V_\phi$
projection with alternating signs of $V_R$ and oscillations of $V_R$ in the
$L_Z$-$\phi$ space, like those observed in the Gaia data. The frequency of
these kinematic features increases with time, offering a powerful means to
infer the potential and the perturbation's onset time and azimuthal phase.
Fourier analysis allows us to date the impact times of simple models and even
to date perturbations from various pericentric passages. For the MW, the
Fourier analysis indicates a superposition of two different frequencies, as in
previous studies. Assuming that both are due to impulsive and distant
pericentre passages, we find perturbation times <0.6 Gyr and in the range of
0.8-2.1 Gyr. The latter is compatible with a previous pericentre of Sagittarius
and would be related to four wraps of the spiral arms in the observed radial
range. Further work on the self-gravitating response of galactic discs and
possible degeneracies with secular processes by the bar is necessary. (ABR)

years, the TESS satellite has identified many planets of this kind, and their
characterization is mandatory to understand how they formed and evolved. Within

characterization of the ultra-short period planet (USPP) TOI-1807b, orbiting
its young host star BD+39 2643 (~300 Myr) in only 13 hours. This is the
youngest USPP discovered so far. Thanks to a joint modeling of the stellar

radial-velocity measurements, combined with accurate estimation of stellar
parameters, we validated the planetary nature of TOI-1807b and measured its

provides an important formation channel of multiple star systems, including
close binaries. We here study the nature of disc fragmentation, systematically
performing a suite of two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, in a
broad range of metallicities, from the primordial to the solar values. In
particular, we follow relatively long-term disc evolution over 15 kyr after the
disc formation, incorporating the effect of heating by the protostellar
irradiation. Our results show that the disc fragmentation occurs at all
metallicities $1$--$0$ $Z_{\odot}$, yielding self-gravitating clumps. Physical
properties of the clumps, such as their number and mass distributions, change
with the metallicity due to different gas thermal evolution. For instance, the
number of clumps is the largest for the intermediate metallicity range of
$10^{-2}$--$10^{-5}$ $Z_{\odot}$, where the dust cooling is effective
exclusively in a dense part of the disc and causes the fragmentation of spiral
arms. The disc fragmentation is more modest for $1$--$0.1$ $Z_{\odot}$ thanks
to the disc stabilization by the stellar irradiation. Such metallicity
dependence agrees with the observed trend that the close binary fraction
increases with decreasing metallicity in the range of $1$--$10^{-3}$
$Z_{\odot}$.

structures via the power spectrum of weak lensing cosmic shear. It is based on
a template-fitting approach, where a redshift-dependent amplitude of lensing
modulates a fixed template power spectrum. Such an amplitude, which is promoted
to a free parameter and fit against tomographic cosmic shear data, reads
$D(z)\,\sigma_8\,\Omega_{{\rm m},0}=:\Omega\sigma_8(z)$, with $D(z)$ the growth
factor, $\sigma_8$ a proxy for the overall amplitude of the matter power
spectrum, and $\Omega_{{\rm m},0}$ the present-day matter abundance. I show
that this method is able to correctly reconstruct $\Omega\sigma_8$ at the per
cent level across redshift, thus allowing us to measure the growth of
structures unbiased by observing discrete tracers. Moreover, I only makes use
of measurements on linear scales. The method is highly complementary to
measurements of the bias and growth, $b\sigma_8(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, from
galaxy clustering analysis. I also demonstrate that the method is robust
against an incorrect choice of cosmological parameters in the template, thanks

constructed a protocol that takes advantage of the instability to reduce the

OGLE-2011-BLG-0950 from adaptive optics (AO) images using the Keck observatory.
The original analysis by Choi et al. 2012 reports degenerate solutions between
planetary and stellar binary lens systems. This is due to a degeneracy in high
magnification events where the shape of the light curve peak can be explained
by a source approach to two different cusp geometries with different source
radius crossing times. This particular case is the most important type of
degeneracy for exoplanet demographics, because the distinction between a
planetary mass or stellar binary companion has direct consequences for
microlensing exoplanet statistics. The 8 and 10-year baselines between the
event and the Keck observations allow us to directly measure a relative proper
motion of $4.20\pm 0.21\,$mas/yr, which confirms the detection of the lens star
system and directly rules out the planetary companion models that predict a
${\sim}4 \times$ smaller relative proper motion. The combination of the lens
brightness and close stellar binary light curve parameters yield primary and
secondary star masses of $M_{A} = 1.12^{+0.06}_{-0.04}M_\odot$ and $M_{B} =
0.47^{+0.04}_{-0.03}M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_L =

$0.39^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\,$AU. Since this degeneracy is likely to be common, the
high resolution imaging method described here will be used to disentangle the
central caustic cusp approach degeneracy for events observed by the

particular, we identify regimes of optimal noise suppression and in turn,
optimal control bandwidth directly proportional to the size of the frequency
bands where the noise power is large. In addition to providing guiding
principles for filter design, our approach enables the development of controls
that simultaneously yield robust noise filtering and high fidelity single qubit

higher dimensions, the generalised Lie derivative of $E_{8(8)}$ Exceptional
Field Theory requires a set of ""covariantly constrained"" fields to be

us to rule out a higher-dimensional origin of many 3-dimensional gauged

large programs, as well as individual observations of $z\sim 6$ QSO hosts. When
accounting for non-detections and correcting for selection effects, we find
that the median surface density of the ISM of the massive galaxy population
evolves as $\sim(1+z)^{3.3}$. This means that the ISM column density towards
the nucleus of a $z>3$ galaxy is typically $>100$ times larger than locally,
and it may reach values as high as Compton-thick at $z\gtrsim6$. Remarkably,
the median ISM column density is of the same order of what is measured from
X-ray observations of large AGN samples already at $z\gtrsim2$.
  We develop a simple analytic model for the spatial distribution of ISM clouds
within galaxies, and estimate the total covering factor towards active nuclei
when obscuration by ISM clouds on the host scale is added to that of pc-scale
circumnuclear material (the so-called 'torus'). The model includes clouds with
a distribution of sizes, masses, and surface densities, and also allows for an
evolution of the characteristic cloud surface density with redshift,
$\Sigma_{c,*}\propto(1+z)^\gamma$. We show that, for $\gamma=2$, such a model
successfully reproduces the increase of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift
that is commonly observed in deep X-ray surveys, both when different absorption
thresholds and AGN luminosities are considered.
  Our results suggest that 80-90\% of supermassive black holes in the early

compact region within ~ 2 pc from the clusters' centers, for which the disk
fraction information considering the outer part is practically absent. We aim
to test if disk fraction estimates change when inferred from an extended region

a representative sample of 19 young clusters considering two concentric fields
of view (FOV) with radii ~ 20 pc and ~ 2 pc. Our analysis reveals that the
inner disk fractions inferred from the compact and the extended regions are
equal within ~ 10%, which does not support a previous hypothesis proposing that
disk fractions should be significantly larger considering extended regions. A

fractions must be accurately determined by using multi-wavelength analysis

$1/2$, $1$, $3/2$, $2$, and spin $5/2$ fields in the asymptotically flat
Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. Our aim is to investigate the problem from
the numerical point of view, by comparing some numerical methods available in
the literature and still not applied for solving the eigenvalue problems
arising from the perturbation equations in the Schwarzschild black hole
spacetime. We focus on the pseudo-spectral and the asymptotic iteration
methods. These numerical methods are tested against the available results in
the literature, and confronting the precision between each other. Besides
testing the different numerical methods, we calculate higher overtones
quasinormal frequencies for all the investigated perturbation fields in
comparison with the known results. In particular, we obtain purely imaginary
frequencies for spin $1/2$ and $3/2$ fields that are in agreement with analytic
results reported previously in the literature. The purely imaginary frequencies
for the spin $1/2$ field are exactly the same as the frequencies obtained for
the spin $3/2$ field. In turn, the quasinormal frequencies for the spin $5/2$
perturbation field are calculated for the very first time, and purely imaginary
frequencies are found also in this case. We conclude that both methods provide
accurate results and they complement each other.

Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, supplemented with additional data from the literature
to constrain the continuum variations over a significantly longer baseline than
the original monitoring program. Modeling of the continuum light curve and the
velocity-resolved variations across the H$\beta$ emission line constrains the
geometry and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR). The BLR is well
described by a very thick disk with similar opening angle ($\theta_o \approx
57^{\circ}$) and inclination angle ($\theta_i \approx 58^{\circ}$), suggesting
that our sight line towards the innermost central engine skims just above the
surface of the BLR. The inclination is consistent with constraints from
geometric modeling of the narrow line region, and the similarity between the
inclination and opening angles is intriguing given previous studies of NGC 4151
that suggest BLR gas has been observed temporarily eclipsing the X-ray source.
The BLR kinematics are dominated by eccentric bound orbits, with $\sim10$% of
the orbits preferring near-circular motions. With the BLR geometry and
kinematics constrained, the models provide an independent and direct black hole
mass measurement of $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot} = 7.22^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ or
$M_{\rm BH}=1.66^{+0.48}_{-0.34}\times10^7 M_{\odot}$, which is in good
agreement with mass measurements from stellar dynamical modeling and gas
dynamical modeling. NGC 4151 is one of the few nearby broad-lined Seyferts
where the black hole mass may be measured via multiple independent techniques,
and it provides an important test case for investigating potential systematics
that could affect the black hole mass scales used in the local Universe and for
high-redshift quasars.

$b=-0.43\pm0.16$. To constrain the projected extent of C IV, we calculate the
transverse autocorrelation function. The flattening of the autocorrelation
function at low $r_\perp$ provides a lower limit for the coherence length of
the metal enriched CGM - on the order of 200 $h^{-1}$ comoving kpc. This
physical size constraint allows us to refine our understanding of the metals in

overparameterization at a more granular level of data subgroups is less
understood. Recent empirical studies demonstrate encouraging results: (i) when
groups are not known, overparameterized models trained with empirical risk
minimization (ERM) perform better on minority groups; (ii) when groups are
known, ERM on data subsampled to equalize group sizes yields state-of-the-art
worst-group-accuracy in the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we
complement these empirical studies with a theoretical investigation of the risk
of overparameterized random feature models on minority groups. In a setting in
which the regression functions for the majority and minority groups are
different, we show that overparameterization always improves minority group

corrected for charge trapping, also known as the ramp effect in time-series

and using the typically discarded first orbit, we are better capable of
constraining and optimizing the emission and transmission spectra. We did a
grid retrieval in this transitional temperature regime and found the spectra

indicating that the inversion at high altitude is model-dependent. Despite no

high-precision results with stare mode spectroscopy. As a new generation of

ExpTS, which simultaneously yields both the finite-time regret bound as well as
the asymptotic regret bound. In particular, for a $K$-armed bandit with
exponential family rewards, ExpTS over a horizon $T$ is sub-UCB (a strong
criterion for the finite-time regret that is problem-dependent), minimax
optimal up to a factor $\sqrt{\log K}$, and asymptotically optimal, for
exponential family rewards. Moreover, we propose ExpTS$^+$, by adding a greedy
exploitation step in addition to the sampling distribution used in ExpTS, to
avoid the over-estimation of sub-optimal arms. ExpTS$^+$ is an anytime bandit
algorithm and achieves the minimax optimality and asymptotic optimality
simultaneously for exponential family reward distributions. Our proof
techniques are general and conceptually simple and can be easily applied to
analyze standard Thompson sampling with specific reward distributions.

situation where the surface rotational speed of the surviving companion can
drop to one-third of its pre-explosion value when it expands to a maximum

observed metallicity range. Additionally, we find that the [P/Fe] differs by
$\sim$ 0.1 dex between thin disk and thick disk stars that were identified with
kinematics. The P abundances were compared with $\alpha$-elements, iron-peak,
odd-Z, and s-process elements and we found that P in the disk most strongly
resembles the evolution of the $\alpha$-elements. We also find molar P/C and
N/C ratios for our sample match the scatter seen from other abundance studies.
Finally, we measure a [P/Fe] = 0.09 $\pm$ 0.1 ratio in one low-$\alpha$ halo
star and probable Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) member, an abundance ratio
$\sim$ 0.3 - 0.5 dex lower than the other Milky Way disk and halo stars at
similar metallicities. Overall, we find that P is likely most significantly
produced by massive stars in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) based on the
largest P abundance survey to-date.

sequential two-player games, where the leader makes a binary here-and-now
decision, and the follower responds a continuous wait-and-see decision after
observing the leader's action and revelation of uncertainty. Only the
information of the mean, covariance, and support is known. We formulate the
problem as a distributionally robust (DR) two-stage problem. The pessimistic DR
bilevel program is shown to be equivalent to a generic two-stage
distributionally robust stochastic (nonlinear) program with both a random
objective and random constraints under proper conditions of ambiguity sets.
Under continuous distributions, using linear decision rule approaches, we
construct upper bounds on the pessimistic DR bilevel program based on (1) 0-1
semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation and (2) an exact 0-1 copositive
programming reformulations. When the ambiguity set is restricted to discrete
distributions, an exact 0-1 SDP reformulation is developed, and explicit
construction of the worst-case distribution is derived. To further improve the
computation of the proposed 0-1 SDPs, a cutting-plane framework is developed.
Moreover, based on a mixed-integer linear programming approximation, another
cutting-plane algorithm is proposed. Extensive numerical studies are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on a facility

alternate approach to understanding Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes and

metric spaces, Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings have persistent homology
barcodes that agree with those of Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes, ignoring
whether endpoints of bars are open or closed. Combining this result with the
known homotopy types and barcodes of the Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes of

Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of the circle are homotopy equivalent to
odd-dimensional spheres at the expected scale parameters. Our approach is to
find quotients of the metric thickenings that preserve homotopy type and show
that the quotient spaces can be described as CW complexes. The quotient maps
are also natural with respect to the scale parameter and thus provide a direct
proof of the persistent homology of the metric thickenings.

simulations of the contraction of a thin circular annular sheet, we show that
these sheets wrinkle into a structure with negligible stretching energy, in
which the contracted boundary forms spontaneous facets. We construct a strictly
isometric wrinkled surface formed of triangles and cones that matches geometric

wrinkled deformations is isometric. Isometry favours the restriction of such
deformations to a robust low-bending energy channel that avoids stretching.
This class of buckling also offers a novel way to manipulate sheet morphology
via boundary forces. Finally, it serves as a minimal model for illustrating the

To address this need, we present VADEERS, a Variational Autoencoder-based Drug

performed by a novel variational autoencoder with a semi-supervised Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) prior. The prior defines a clustering in the latent space,
where the clusters are associated with specific drug properties. In addition,
VADEERS is equipped with a cell line autoencoder and a sensitivity prediction
network. The model combines data for SMILES string representations of
anti-cancer drugs, their inhibition profiles against a panel of protein
kinases, cell lines biological features and measurements of the sensitivity of
the cell lines to the drugs. The evaluated variants of VADEERS achieve a high
r=0.87 Pearson correlation between true and predicted drug sensitivity

data points accurately reflect the given clustering. In summary, VADEERS offers
a comprehensive model of drugs and cell lines properties and relationships

poor scaling with respect to the problem size, as the sample complexity of
learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy is $\tilde{\Omega}\left(|S||A|H^3 /

$|A|$ due to the low rank structure, we show that without imposing further
assumptions beyond low rank of $Q^*$, if one is constrained to estimate the $Q$
function using only observations from a subset of entries, there is a worst
case instance in which one must incur a sample complexity exponential in the
horizon $H$ to learn a near optimal policy. We subsequently show that under
stronger low rank structural assumptions, given access to a generative model,
Low Rank Monte Carlo Policy Iteration (LR-MCPI) and Low Rank Empirical Value

development, tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion. A
predictive understanding of the emergent mechanical behaviors in collective
cell motion is challenging due to the complex interplay between cell-cell
interactions, cell-matrix adhesions and active cell behaviors. To overcome this
challenge, we develop a predictive cellular vertex model that can delineate the
relative roles of substrate rigidity, tissue mechanics and active cell
properties on the movement of cell collectives. We apply the model to the
specific case of collective motion in cell aggregates as they spread into a
two-dimensional cell monolayer adherent to a soft elastic matrix. Consistent
with recent experiments, we find that substrate stiffness regulates the driving
forces for the spreading of cellular monolayer, which can be pressure-driven or
crawling-based depending on substrate rigidity. On soft substrates, cell
monolayer spreading is driven by an active pressure due to the influx of cells
coming from the aggregate, whereas on stiff substrates, cell spreading is
driven primarily by active crawling forces. Our model predicts that cooperation
of cell crawling and tissue pressure drives faster spreading, while the
spreading rate is sensitive to the mechanical properties of the tissue. We find
that solid tissues spread faster on stiff substrates, with spreading rate
increasing with tissue tension. By contrast, the spreading of fluid tissues is
independent of substrate stiffness and is slower than solid tissues. We compare
our theoretical results with experimental results on traction force generation
and spreading kinetics of cell monolayers, and provide new predictions on the
role of tissue fluidity and substrate rigidity on collective cell motion.

limits increases to signal sparsity. Contrasting methods using Wigner
$D$-functions that require measurements on all of $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, we show
that the orthogonality structure of the Slepian functions only requires
measurements on the sub-domain $R$, which is select-able. Due to the
particulars of this approach and the inherent presence of Slepian functions
with low concentrations on $R$, our approach gives the highest accuracy when
the signal under study is well concentrated on $R$. We provide numerical
examples of our method in comparison with other classical and compressive
sensing approaches. In terms of reconstruction quality, we find that our method
outperforms the other compressive sensing approaches we test and is at least as
good as classical approaches but with a significant reduction in the number of
measurements.

task processing, especially for a multi-robot system (MRS) to collaborate and
collect valuable data from the field. However, a robot in situations where it
does not have access to GPS signals, such as in an environmentally controlled,
indoor, or underground environment, finds it difficult to locate using its
sensor alone. As a result, robots sharing their local information to improve
their localization estimates benefit the entire MRS team. There have been
several attempts to model-based multi-robot localization using Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a source to calculate bearing information. We also
utilize the RSSI for wireless networks generated through the communication of
multiple robots in a system and aim to localize agents with high accuracy and
efficiency in a dynamic environment for shared information fusion to refine the
localization estimation. This estimator structure reduces one source of
measurement correlation while appropriately incorporating others. This paper
proposes a decentralized Multi-robot Synergistic Localization System (MRSL) for
a dense and dynamic environment. Robots update their position estimation
whenever new information receives from their neighbors. When the system senses
the presence of other robots in the region, it exchanges position estimates and
merges the received data to improve its localization accuracy. Our approach
uses Bayesian rule-based integration, which has shown to be computationally
efficient and applicable to asynchronous robotics communication. We have
performed extensive simulation experiments with a varying number of robots to
analyze the algorithm. MRSL's localization accuracy with RSSI outperformed
other algorithms from the literature, showing a significant promise for future
development.

functions on graphs as the problem of characterizing the graphs (called,
ABC-graphs) for which the unique consensus function satisfying the axioms (A),

  In this paper, we show that modular graphs with $G^2$-connected medians (in
particular, bipartite Helly graphs) are ABC-graphs. On the other hand, the
addition of some simple local axioms satisfied by the median function in all

which models suggest may be the best planetary targets. No candidate H$_3^+$
emission is found. The limits we place on the emission of H$_3^+$ from brown
dwarfs indicates that auroral generation of H$_3^+$ in these environments
likely does not linearly scale from the processes found on Jupiter, plausibly
due to deeper atmospheric penetration by precipitating auroral electrons.
Detection of H$_3^+$ emission in brown dwarfs may be possible with the James

efficient, faster, and generalizable to low-end hardware. Current network
compression methods have two open problems: first, there lacks a theoretical

over-prunned, resulting in significant network performance drop. To solve these
two problems, this study propose a gradient-matrix singularity analysis-based
method to estimate the maximum network redundancy. Guided by that maximum rate,
a novel and efficient hierarchical network pruning algorithm is developed to
maximally condense the neuronal network structure without sacrificing network

of the new method for pruning several advanced convolutional neural network

not always hold in real-world graphs. We address this problem by developing a
decoupled self-supervised learning (DSSL) framework for graph neural networks.
DSSL imitates a generative process of nodes and links from latent variable
modeling of the semantic structure, which decouples different underlying
semantics between different neighborhoods into the self-supervised learning
process. Our DSSL framework is agnostic to the encoders and does not need
prefabricated augmentations, thus is flexible to different graphs. To
effectively optimize the framework, we derive the evidence lower bound of the

variational inference. We provide a theoretical analysis to justify that DSSL
enjoys the better downstream performance. Extensive experiments on various

better performance compared with competitive baselines.

compressive forcing and misty, small-scale clouds for solenoidal forcing. The
cold phase gas has stronger large-scale velocities for compressive forcing. The

tackle these issues, we propose the approximation of hyperbolic operators using
Taylor series expansions, which allows us to reformulate the computationally
expensive tangent and cosine hyperbolic functions into their polynomial
equivariants which are more efficient. This allows us to retain the benefits of
preserving the hierarchical anatomy of the hyperbolic space, while maintaining
the scalability over current accelerated deep learning infrastructure. The
polynomial formulation also enables us to utilize the advancements in Euclidean
networks such as gradient clipping and ReLU activation to avoid vanishing
gradients and remove errors due to frequent switching between tangent space and
hyperbolic space. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks in the domain
of graph analysis and computer vision shows that our polynomial formulation is
as scalable as Euclidean architectures, both in terms of memory and time
complexity, while providing results as effective as hyperbolic models.

segment piston with generated ~ 0.6 arcsec and ~ 1.2 arcsec seeing turbulence
due to non-linear modal cross-talk and poor pixel sampling of the segment gaps
on the PyWFS detector. We report the success of an alternate solution to
control piston using the novel HDFS while controlling all other modes with the
PyWFS purely as a slope sensor (piston mode removed). This ""second channel"" WFS

large gaps between the segments either caused by the shadow of the mechanical
structure of the secondary mirror (E-ELT and TMT) or intrinsically by design
(GMT). These gaps are large enough to fragment the aperture into independent
segments that are separated by more than the typical Fried parameter. This
creates piston and petals modes that are not well sensed by conventional
wavefront sensors such as the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor or the pyramid
wavefront sensor. We propose to use a new optical device, the Holographic
Dispersed Fringe Sensor (HDFS), to sense and control these petal/piston modes.
The HDFS uses a single pupil-plane hologram to interfere the segments onto
different spatial locations in the focal plane. Numerical simulations show that
the HDFS is very efficient and that it reaches a differential piston rms
smaller than 10 nm for GMT/E-ELT/TMT for guide stars up to 13th J+H band
magnitude. The HDFS has also been validated in the lab with MagAO-X and HCAT,
the GMT phasing testbed. The lab experiments reached 5 nm rms piston error on
the Magellan telescope aperture. The HDFS also reached 50 nm rms of piston
error on a segmented GMT-like aperture while the pyramid wavefront sensor was
compensating simulated atmosphere under median seeing conditions. The
simulations and lab results demonstrate the HDFS as an excellent piston sensor
for the GMT. We find that the combination of a pyramid slope sensor with a HDFS
piston sensor is a powerful architecture for the GMT.

demonstrate its application to a simple system - a finite one-dimensional
dipolar chain in an external electric field. We then describe how the approach
naturally extends to more complicated spin systems and to continuum field
theories. Furthermore, we numerically illustrate the efficacy of our approach

three nuclear EOSs that span the range of allowed compactness. Nuclear reaction

excess X-ray/radio emission following GW170817. We find 2e-5Msun of free

UV/optical brightness by a factor of a few due to previously neglected
relativistic effects, with appreciable enhancements up to 10h post-merger,

learning paradigm, has sparked extensive interest in exploiting tremendous data

local learning rates and local training epochs are adaptively adjusted by all
resource-heterogeneous clients through locally deployed DDPG-assisted adaptive
hyper-parameter selection schemes. Particularly, the rationality of the
proposed hyper-parameter selection scheme is confirmed through rigorous
mathematical proof. Besides, due to the thoughtlessness of security
consideration of adaptive FL systems in previous studies, we introduce the
Paillier cryptosystem to aggregate local models in a secure and
privacy-preserving manner. Rigorous analyses show that the proposed Dap-FL
system could guarantee the security of clients' private local models against
chosen-plaintext attacks and chosen-message attacks in a widely used
honest-but-curious participants and active adversaries security model. In
addition, through ingenious and extensive experiments, the proposed Dap-FL
achieves higher global model prediction accuracy and faster convergence rates
than conventional FL, and the comprehensiveness of the adjusted local training
hyper-parameters is validated. More importantly, experimental results also show
that the proposed Dap-FL achieves higher model prediction accuracy than two

estimating both primal and dual Hessians. Theoretically, we show that DISH
achieves a linear (Q-linear) convergence rate to the exact optimal solution for
strongly convex functions, regardless of agents' choices of gradient-type and
Newton-type updates. Finally, we perform numerical studies to demonstrate the

clustering of quartets of galaxies over random, is the lowest-order statistic
sensitive to parity violation. Each galaxy defines one vertex of the
tetrahedron. Parity-odd modes of the 4PCF probe an imbalance between tetrahedra
and their mirror images. We measure these modes from the largest currently
available spectroscopic samples, the 280,067 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) of
BOSS DR12 LOWZ ($\bar{z} = 0.32$) and the 803,112 LRGS of BOSS DR12 CMASS

parity-odd 4PCF, and in CMASS we detect a parity-odd 4PCF at $7.1\sigma$.
Gravitational evolution alone does not produce this effect; parity-breaking in
LSS, if cosmological in origin, must stem from the epoch of inflation. We have
explored many sources of systematic error and found none that can produce a
spurious parity-odd \textit{signal} sufficient to explain our result.
Underestimation of the \textit{noise} could also lead to a spurious detection.
Our reported significances presume that the mock catalogs used to calculate the
covariance sufficiently capture the covariance of the true data. We have
performed numerous tests to explore this issue. The odd-parity 4PCF opens a new
avenue for probing new forces during the epoch of inflation with 3D LSS; such
exploration is timely given large upcoming spectroscopic samples such as DESI

colliding flow. We found that the efficiency of the dense gas formation depends
on $\theta$. For small $\theta$, anisotropic super-Alfv\'enic turbulence delays
the formation of gravitationally unstable clumps. An increase in $\theta$
develops shock-amplified magnetic fields along which the gas is accumulated,
making prominent filamentary structures. We further investigate the statistical
properties of dense clumps identified with different density thresholds. The
statistical properties of the dense clumps with lower densities depend on $V_0$
and $\theta$ because their properties are inherited from the global turbulence
structure of the molecular clouds. By contrast, denser clumps appear to have
asymptotic universal statistical properties, which do not depend on the
properties of the colliding flow significantly. The internal velocity
dispersions approach subsonic and plasma $\beta$ becomes order of unity. We
develop an analytic formula of the virial parameter which reproduces the

equations. In this paper, we prove that two known intrinsic conditions, which
were obtained previously by Weiss, Thomas and Rivertz, are sufficient to ensure
the existence of such symmetric 2-tensor field under certain generic condition
when $m=3$. Note that, in the case $m=3$, a symmetric 2-tensor field satisfying
the Gauss equation does not satisfy the Codazzi equation automatically, which
is different from the cases $m \geq 4$. In our proof, the symbolic method,
which is a famous tool known in classical invariant theory, plays an important
role. As applications of our result, we consider $3$-dimensional warped product
Riemannian manifolds whether they can be locally isometrically embedded into
$\mathbb{R}^4$. In some case, the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation naturally appears.

abundances in DLAs must be corrected for dust depletion effects, which can be
accomplished by calibrating the relation between abundance ratios such as
[Zn/Fe] and depletions (the fraction of metals in gas, as opposed to dust).
Using samples of gas-phase abundances and depletions in the Milky Way (MW),
LMC, and SMC, we demonstrate that the relation between [Zn/Fe] and other
abundance ratios does not change significantly between these local galaxies and
DLAs, indicating that [Zn/Fe] should trace depletions of heavy elements in
those systems. The availability of photospheric abundances in young massive
stars, a proxy for the total (gas+dust) metallicity of neutral gas, in the MW
LMC, and SMC allows us to calibrate the relation between [Zn/Fe] and depletions
in these nearby galaxies. We apply the local calibrations of depletions to DLA
systems. We find that the fraction of metals in dust, the dust-to-gas-ratio,
and total abundances are 2-5 times lower than inferred from previous depletion
calibrations based on MW measurements and a different formalism. However, the
trend of dust abundance vs. metallicity remains only slightly sub-linear for
all existing depletion calibrations, contrary to what is inferred from FIR, 21
cm, and CO emission in nearby galaxies and predicted by chemical evolution
models. Observational constraints on the FIR dust opacity and depletions at
metallicities lower than 20\% solar will be needed to resolve this tension.

It is shown that, when the continuous dynamics are ISS but the discrete
dynamics governing the delay-dependent impulses are not, the impulsive system
as a whole is ISS provided the destabilizing impulses do not occur too
frequently. On the contrary, when the discrete dynamics are ISS but the
continuous dynamics are not, the delayed impulses must occur frequently enough
to overcome the destabilizing effects of the continuous dynamics so that the
ISS can be achieved for the impulsive system. Particularly, when the discrete
dynamics are ISS and the continuous dynamics are also ISS or just stable for
the zero input, the impulsive system is ISS for arbitrary impulse time
sequences. Compared with the existing results on impulsive time-delay systems,
the obtained ISS criteria are more general in the sense that these results are
applicable to systems with delay dependent impulses while the existing ones are
not. Moreover, when consider time-delay systems with delay-free impulses, our
result for systems with unstable continuous dynamics and stabilizing impulses
is less conservative than the existing ones, as a weaker condition on the upper

particles are often observed to be restructured into more compact shapes. This
compaction has a major effect on the radiative properties of the aggregates,
and may also influence their aerosol-cloud interactions and toxicity. Recent
laboratory studies have presented conflicting arguments on whether this
compaction occurs during condensation or during evaporation. In this three-part
study, we combine theory and experiments to explain these conflicting results.
First, we review the surface-science literature and identify explicit
mechanisms for condensation compaction as well as evaporation compaction. We
also identify a mechanism for avoiding compacting during condensation, which is
predicted from heterogeneous nucleation theory and the kinetic barriers to
capillary formation. Second, we review the soot-restructuring literature and
find evidence for all of these compaction mechanisms, the most common being
condensation-compaction. Some atmospheric studies have reported non-compacted
soot in internal mixtures, which we attribute to coagulation, and which is less
common. Third, we present new experimental results from a study in our
laboratory where the surface tension of anthracene coatings was ""switched on""
or ""switched off"" by using solid or liquid phases during addition and removal.
Consequently, we demonstrated condensation compaction, evaporation compaction,
and no compaction, for the same soot source. Overall, our study indicates that
it is most reasonable to assume that soot will undergo compaction upon coating
condensation in the atmosphere, in combustion systems, and in human lungs.

success in handling the statistical heterogeneity of FL clients. However,
standardized evaluation and systematical analysis of diverse pFL methods remain
a challenge. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, FL simulation settings and
pFL implementations prevent easy and fair comparisons of pFL methods. Secondly,
the current pFL literature diverges in the adopted evaluation and ablation
protocols. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of pFL methods are
under-explored in various practical scenarios, such as the generalization to
new clients and the participation of resource-limited clients. To tackle these
challenges, we propose the first comprehensive pFL benchmark, pFL-Bench, for
facilitating rapid, reproducible, standardized and thorough pFL evaluation. The
proposed benchmark contains more than 10 dataset variants in various
application domains with a unified data partition and realistic heterogeneous
settings; a modularized and easy-to-extend pFL codebase with more than 20
competitive pFL method implementations; and systematic evaluations under
containerized environments in terms of generalization, fairness, system
overhead, and convergence. We highlight the benefits and potential of
state-of-the-art pFL methods and hope the pFL-Bench enables further pFL
research and broad applications that would otherwise be difficult owing to the
absence of a dedicated benchmark. The code is released at

widely used in decision-making systems. However, studies have shown critical
issues of ML discrimination and unfairness, which hinder their adoption on
high-stake applications. Recent research on fair classifiers has drawn
significant attention to developing effective algorithms to achieve fairness
and good classification performance. Despite the great success of these
fairness-aware machine learning models, most of the existing models require
sensitive attributes to pre-process the data, regularize the model learning or
post-process the prediction to have fair predictions. However, sensitive
attributes are often incomplete or even unavailable due to privacy, legal or
regulation restrictions. Though we lack the sensitive attribute for training a
fair model in the target domain, there might exist a similar domain that has
sensitive attributes. Thus, it is important to exploit auxiliary information
from a similar domain to help improve fair classification in the target domain.
Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring domain
adaptation for fair classification. We propose a new framework that can learn
to adapt the sensitive attributes from a source domain for fair classification
in the target domain. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model for fair classification, even when no
sensitive attributes are available in the target domain.

Meanwhile, there usually exists numerous unlabeled data in practical
applications, and pre-training is an efficient way of exploiting the knowledge
in unlabeled data. However, the pre-training paradigm for M3OD is hardly
studied. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. To this end, we first draw two
observations: (1) The guideline of devising pre-training tasks is imitating the
representation of the target task. (2) Combining depth estimation and 2D object
detection is a promising M3OD pre-training baseline. Afterwards, following the
guideline, we propose several strategies to further improve this baseline,
which mainly include target guided semi-dense depth estimation, keypoint-aware
2D object detection, and class-level loss adjustment. Combining all the
developed techniques, the obtained pre-training framework produces pre-trained
backbones that improve M3OD performance significantly on both the KITTI-3D and
nuScenes benchmarks. For example, by applying a DLA34 backbone to a naive
center-based M3OD detector, the moderate ${\rm AP}_{3D}70$ score of Car on the

  Large Eddy Simulation","34 pages, 27 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vortex particle method (VPM) is a mesh-free approach to computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) solving the Navier-Stokes equations in their
velocity-vorticity form. The VPM uses a Lagrangian scheme, which not only
avoids the hurdles of mesh generation, but it also conserves vortical
structures over long distances with minimal numerical dissipation while being
orders of magnitude faster than conventional mesh-based CFD. However, VPM is
known to be numerically unstable when vortical structures break down close to
the turbulent regime. In this study, we reformulate the VPM as a large eddy
simulation (LES) in a scheme that is numerically stable, without increasing its
computational cost. A new set of VPM governing equations are derived from the
LES-filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The new equations reinforce conservation
of mass and angular momentum by reshaping the vortex elements subject to vortex
stretching. In addition to the VPM reformulation, a new anisotropic dynamic
model of subfilter-scale (SFS) vortex stretching is developed. This SFS model
is well suited for turbulent flows with coherent vortical structures where the
predominant cascade mechanism is vortex stretching. Advection, viscous
diffusion, and vortex stretching are validated through simulation of isolated
and leapfrogging vortex rings. Mean and fluctuating components of turbulent
flow are validated through simulation of a turbulent round jet, where Reynolds
stresses are resolved directly and compared to experimental measurements.
Finally, the computational efficiency of the scheme is showcased in the
simulation of an aircraft rotor in hover, showing our meshless LES to be 100x
faster than a mesh-based LES with similar fidelity, while being 10x faster than
a low-fidelity unsteady Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes simulation and 1000x
faster than a high-fidelity detached-eddy simulation.

viable option. This application necessitates efficient inquiry of relevant
disease symptoms in order to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. This can
be formulated as a problem of sequential feature (symptom) selection and
classification for which reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been
proposed as a natural solution. They perform well when the feature space is
small, that is, the number of symptoms and diagnosable disease categories is
limited, but they frequently fail in assignments with a large number of
features. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-Model-Fused
Actor-Critic (MMF-AC) RL framework that consists of a generative actor network
and a diagnostic critic network. The actor incorporates a Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) to model the uncertainty induced by partial observations of
features, thereby facilitating in making appropriate inquiries. In the critic
network, a supervised diagnosis model for disease predictions is involved to
precisely estimate the state-value function. Furthermore, inspired by the
medical concept of differential diagnosis, we combine the generative and
diagnosis models to create a novel reward shaping mechanism to address the
sparse reward problem in large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets for empirical evaluations. The
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency while also being more
effectively scalable to large search spaces. Besides, our method is adaptable
to both categorical and continuous features, making it ideal for online

to heavy-tailed elliptical distributions as well as robust to non-elliptical
outliers. Second, it pairs well with a data-driven tuning procedure, which is

  Analyses of algorithms with communication compression have attributed

compression (only messages from workers to server are compressed) or
bidirectional compression. In this paper, we consider distributed stochastic
algorithms for minimizing smooth and non-convex objective functions under

algorithms whether using unbiased or contractive compressors in unidirection or

counterpart of the optical flow that represents the motion of pixels in the 2D
image. However, it is difficult to obtain the ground truth of scene flow in the
real scenes, and recent studies are based on synthetic data for training.
Therefore, how to train a scene flow network with unsupervised methods based on
real-world data shows crucial significance. A novel unsupervised learning
method for scene flow is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the images of
two consecutive frames taken by monocular camera without the ground truth of
scene flow for training. Our method realizes the goal that training scene flow
network with real-world data, which bridges the gap between training data and
test data and broadens the scope of available data for training. Unsupervised
learning of scene flow in this paper mainly consists of two parts: (i) depth
estimation and camera pose estimation, and (ii) scene flow estimation based on
four different loss functions. Depth estimation and camera pose estimation
obtain the depth maps and camera pose between two consecutive frames, which
provide further information for the next scene flow estimation. After that, we
used depth consistency loss, dynamic-static consistency loss, Chamfer loss, and
Laplacian regularization loss to carry out unsupervised training of the scene
flow network. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that realizes the
unsupervised learning of 3D scene flow from monocular camera. The experiment
results on KITTI show that our method for unsupervised learning of scene flow
meets great performance compared to traditional methods Iterative Closest Point

strong correlation with the target class (i.e., dataset bias) when making
predictions. Due to the dataset bias, the model correctly classifies data
samples including bias attributes (i.e., bias-aligned samples) while failing to
correctly predict those without bias attributes (i.e., bias-conflicting
samples). Recently, a myriad of studies focus on mitigating such dataset bias,
the task of which is referred to as debiasing. However, our comprehensive study
indicates several issues need to be improved when conducting evaluation of
debiasing in image classification. First, most of the previous studies do not
specify how they select their hyper-parameters and model checkpoints (i.e.,
tuning criterion). Second, the debiasing studies until now evaluated their
proposed methods on datasets with excessively high bias-severities, showing
degraded performance on datasets with low bias severity. Third, the debiasing
studies do not share consistent experimental settings (e.g., datasets and
neural networks) which need to be standardized for fair comparisons. Based on
such issues, this paper 1) proposes an evaluation metric `Align-Conflict (AC)
score' for the tuning criterion, 2) includes experimental settings with low
bias severity and shows that they are yet to be explored, and 3) unifies the
standardized experimental settings to promote fair comparisons between
debiasing methods. We believe that our findings and lessons inspire future
researchers in debiasing to further push state-of-the-art performances with
fair comparisons.

networks may fall into an ""identical shortcut"", where both normal and anomalous
samples can be well recovered, and hence fail to spot outliers. To tackle this
obstacle, we make three improvements. First, we revisit the formulations of
fully-connected layer, convolutional layer, as well as attention layer, and
confirm the important role of query embedding (i.e., within attention layer) in
preventing the network from learning the shortcut. We therefore come up with a
layer-wise query decoder to help model the multi-class distribution. Second, we
employ a neighbor masked attention module to further avoid the information leak
from the input feature to the reconstructed output feature. Third, we propose a
feature jittering strategy that urges the model to recover the correct message
even with noisy inputs. We evaluate our algorithm on MVTec-AD and CIFAR-10
datasets, where we surpass the state-of-the-art alternatives by a sufficiently
large margin. For example, when learning a unified model for 15 categories in
MVTec-AD, we surpass the second competitor on the tasks of both anomaly

networks can escape the ""lazy training,"" or Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime,
where the network is coupled with its first order Taylor expansion at
initialization. While the NTK is minimax optimal for learning dense polynomials
(Ghorbani et al, 2021), it cannot learn features, and hence has poor sample
complexity for learning many classes of functions including sparse polynomials.
Recent works have thus aimed to identify settings where gradient based
algorithms provably generalize better than the NTK. One such example is the
""QuadNTK"" approach of Bai and Lee (2020), which analyzes the second-order term
in the Taylor expansion. Bai and Lee (2020) show that the second-order term can
learn sparse polynomials efficiently; however, it sacrifices the ability to
learn general dense polynomials.
  In this paper, we analyze how gradient descent on a two-layer neural network
can escape the NTK regime by utilizing a spectral characterization of the NTK
(Montanari and Zhong, 2020) and building on the QuadNTK approach. We first
expand upon the spectral analysis to identify ""good"" directions in parameter
space in which we can move without harming generalization. Next, we show that a
wide two-layer neural network can jointly use the NTK and QuadNTK to fit target
functions consisting of a dense low-degree term and a sparse high-degree term
-- something neither the NTK nor the QuadNTK can do on their own. Finally, we
construct a regularizer which encourages our parameter vector to move in the
""good"" directions, and show that gradient descent on the regularized loss will
converge to a global minimizer, which also has low test error. This yields an
end to end convergence and generalization guarantee with provable sample
complexity improvement over both the NTK and QuadNTK on their own.

performance on test data with the same distribution as training set, where
various denoising models based on synthetic or collected real-world training

denoising performance is still limited. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective Bayesian deep ensemble (BDE) method for real-world image denoising,
where several representative deep denoisers pre-trained with various training
data settings can be fused to improve robustness. The foundation of BDE is that
real-world image noises are highly signal-dependent, and heterogeneous noises
in a real-world noisy image can be separately handled by different denoisers.
In particular, we take well-trained CBDNet, NBNet, HINet, Uformer and GMSNet
into denoiser pool, and a U-Net is adopted to predict pixel-wise weighting maps
to fuse these denoisers. Instead of solely learning pixel-wise weighting maps,
Bayesian deep learning strategy is introduced to predict weighting uncertainty
as well as weighting map, by which prediction variance can be modeled for
improving robustness on real-world noisy images. Extensive experiments have
shown that real-world noises can be better removed by fusing existing denoisers
instead of training a big denoiser with expensive cost. On DND dataset, our BDE
achieves +0.28~dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art denoising method.
Moreover, we note that our BDE denoiser based on different Gaussian noise
levels outperforms state-of-the-art CBDNet when applying to real-world noisy

Unfortunately, existing methods require knowledge of both the target

we introduce autoregressive (AR) poisoning, a method that can generate poisoned

more resistant against common defenses such as adversarial training and strong

compact representations without labels and have been widely applied to
out-of-distribution (OoD) detection, they are generally still poorly understood
and are used incorrectly in detecting outliers where the normal and abnormal

assumed to contain key information that is only important for describing
samples within the training distribution, and that the reconstruction of
outliers leads to high residual errors. However, recent work suggests that AEs
are likely to be even better at reconstructing some types of OoD samples. In
this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate what auto-encoders
actually learn when they are posed to solve two different tasks. First, we
propose two metrics based on the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) and
confidence scores of a trained classifier to assess whether AEs can learn the

Second, we investigate whether AEs are able to synthesize normal images from

constrain the latent manifold and allow reconstruction of abnormal patterns, or
they are failing to accurately restore the inputs from their latent

loading, MSMAs have been used for actuation applications. This work introduced
a new feature to the existing macroscale magneto-mechanical model for Ni-Mn-Ga

two variants is not exactly perpendicular as observed by D silva et al. This
offset helps explain some of the power harvesting capabilities of MSMAs. Model
predictions are compared to experimental data collected on a Ni-Mn-Ga single

bias magnetic field load (which mimics power harvesting or sensing) and
fieldcontrolled loading with constant bias compressive stress (which mimics
actuation). Each type of test was performed at several different load levels,
and the applied field was measured without the MSMA specimen present so that
demagnetization does not affect the experimentally measured field as suggested
by Eberle et al. Results show decent agreement between model predictions and
experimental data. Although the model predicts experimental results decently,
it does not capture all the features of the experimental data. In order to
capture all the experimental features, finally, a generalized regression neural

gate errors. Quantum error correction codes are one important technique to
address this issue. In particular, the Quantum Reed-Solomon codes are known to
be quite efficient for quantum communication tasks. The high degree of physical
resources required, however, makes such a code difficult to use in practice. A
recent technique called quantum multiplexing has been shown to reduce resources
by using multiple degrees of freedom of a photon. In this work, we propose a
method to decompose multi-controlled gates using fewer $\rm{CX}$ gates via this
quantum multiplexing technique. We show that our method can significantly
reduce the required number of $\rm{CX}$ gates needed in the encoding circuits
for the quantum Reed-Solomon code. Our approach is also applicable to many
other quantum error correction codes and quantum algorithms, including Grovers
and quantum walks.

inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free single-carrier (SC) communication without
relying on sophisticated channel equalization. The key idea of DAM is to
pre-introduce deliberate symbol delays at the transmitter side, so that all
multi-path signal components may arrive at the receiver simultaneously and be
superimposed constructively, rather than causing the detrimental ISI. Compared
to the classic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission,
DAM has several appealing advantages, including low peak-to-average-power ratio
(PAPR) and high tolerance for Doppler frequency shift, which makes DAM also
appealing for radar sensing. Therefore, in this paper, DAM is investigated for
the emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) setup. We first derive
the output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ISI-free communication and radar
sensing, respectively, and then propose an efficient beamforming design for
DAM-ISAC to maximize the communication SNR while guaranteeing the sensing
performance. The comparison analysis of DAM versus OFDM for ISAC is developed,
and it is revealed that DAM enables higher sensing SNR and larger Doppler
frequency estimation. Simulation results are provided to show the great
potential of DAM for ISAC

better pathway configurations and exploit the knowledge in pre-trained models

exploration loss to further explore different pathways throughout the model
hub. To fully exploit the knowledge in pre-trained models, each model is
further trained by specific data that activate it, which ensures its

and tilting.} The type-I tilting that we study here displays both positive and
negative magnetoconductances depending on the field strengths and time.
Furthermore, we find that a direct temporal tuning of the irradiated field
strengths can {lead to fluctuating} magneto-transport behavior which can be
easily improvised and checked in the laboratories.

  copies",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In machine learning, data augmentation (DA) is a technique for improving the
generalization performance. In this paper, we mainly considered gradient
descent of linear regression under DA using noisy copies of datasets, in which
noise is injected into inputs. We analyzed the situation where random noisy
copies are newly generated and used at each epoch; i.e., the case of using
on-line noisy copies. Therefore, it is viewed as an analysis on a method using
noise injection into training process by DA manner; i.e., on-line version of
DA. We derived the averaged behavior of training process under three situations
which are the full-batch training under the sum of squared errors, the
full-batch and mini-batch training under the mean squared error. We showed
that, in all cases, training for DA with on-line copies is approximately
equivalent to a ridge regularization whose regularization parameter corresponds
to the variance of injected noise. On the other hand, we showed that the
learning rate is multiplied by the number of noisy copies plus one in
full-batch under the sum of squared errors and the mini-batch under the mean
squared error; i.e., DA with on-line copies yields apparent acceleration of
training. The apparent acceleration and regularization effect come from the
original part and noise in a copy data respectively. These results are
confirmed in a numerical experiment. In the numerical experiment, we found that
our result can be approximately applied to usual off-line DA in
under-parameterization scenario and can not in over-parametrization scenario.
Moreover, we experimentally investigated the training process of neural
networks under DA with off-line noisy copies and found that our analysis on
linear regression is possible to be applied to neural networks.

the same within a larger time series. Such motifs often represent concealed
structures, such as heart beats in an ECG recording, or sleep spindles in EEG
sleep data. Motif discovery (MD) is the task of finding such motifs in a given
input series. As there are varying definitions of what exactly a motif is, a
number of algorithms exist. As central parameters they all take the length l of
the motif and the maximal distance r between the motif's occurrences. In
practice, however, suitable values for r are very hard to determine upfront,
and the found motifs show a high variability. Setting the wrong input value
will result in a motif that is not distinguishable from noise. Accordingly,
finding an interesting motif with these methods requires extensive
trial-and-error. We present a different approach to the MD problem. We define
k-Motiflets as the set of exactly k occurrences of a motif of length l, whose
maximum pairwise distance is minimal. This turns the MD problem upside-down:
Our central parameter is not the distance threshold r, but the desired size k
of a motif set, which we show is considerably more intuitive and easier to set.
Based on this definition, we present exact and approximate algorithms for
finding k-Motiflets and analyze their complexity. To further ease the use of
our method, we describe extensions to automatically determine the
right/suitable values for its input parameters. Thus, for the first time,
extracting meaningful motif sets without any a-priori knowledge becomes
feasible. By evaluating real-world use cases and comparison to 4
state-of-the-art MD algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm is (a)
quantitatively superior, finding larger motif sets at higher similarity, (b)
qualitatively better, leading to clearer and easier to interpret motifs, and
(c) has the lowest runtime.

we first regard unobserved labels as negative labels, casting the WSML task
into noisy multi-label classification. From this point of view, we empirically
observe that memorization effect, which was first discovered in a noisy
multi-class setting, also occurs in a multi-label setting. That is, the model
first learns the representation of clean labels, and then starts memorizing
noisy labels. Based on this finding, we propose novel methods for WSML which
reject or correct the large loss samples to prevent model from memorizing the
noisy label. Without heavy and complex components, our proposed methods
outperform previous state-of-the-art WSML methods on several partial label

health care system, as they serve as the entry point for many patients.
However, among other factors, the variability of patient acuity levels and
corresponding treatment requirements of patients visiting EDs imposes
significant challenges on decision makers. Balancing waiting times of patients
to be first seen by a physician with the overall length of stay over all acuity
levels is crucial to maintain an acceptable level of operational performance
for all patients. To address those requirements when assigning idle resources
to patients, several methods have been proposed in the past, including the
Accumulated Priority Queuing (APQ) method. The APQ method linearly assigns
priority scores to patients with respect to their time in the system and acuity
level. Hence, selection decisions are based on a simple system representation
that is used as an input for a selection function. This paper investigates the
potential of an Machine Learning (ML) based patient selection method. It
assumes that for a large set of training data, including a multitude of
different system states, (near) optimal assignments can be computed by a
(heuristic) optimizer, with respect to a chosen performance metric, and aims to
imitate such optimal behavior when applied to new situations. Thereby, it
incorporates a comprehensive state representation of the system and a complex
non-linear selection function. The motivation for the proposed approach is that
high quality selection decisions may depend on a variety of factors describing
the current state of the ED, not limited to waiting times, which can be
captured and utilized by the ML model. Results show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms the APQ method for a majority of evaluated settings

  Beamforming",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hybrid
analog-digital beamforming is an essential technique for exploiting the
potential array gain without using a dedicated radio frequency chain for each
antenna. However, due to the large number of antennas, the conventional channel
estimation and hybrid beamforming algorithms generally require high
computational complexity and signaling overhead. In this work, we propose an
end-to-end deep-unfolding neural network (NN) joint channel estimation and
hybrid beamforming (JCEHB) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate in
time-division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO. Specifically, the recursive
least-squares (RLS) algorithm and stochastic successive convex approximation
(SSCA) algorithm are unfolded for channel estimation and hybrid beamforming,
respectively. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, we consider a
mixed-timescale hybrid beamforming scheme, where the analog beamforming
matrices are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) statistics
offline, while the digital beamforming matrices are designed at each time slot
based on the estimated low-dimensional equivalent CSI matrices. We jointly
train the analog beamformers together with the trainable parameters of the RLS
and SSCA induced deep-unfolding NNs based on the CSI statistics offline. During
data transmission, we estimate the low-dimensional equivalent CSI by the RLS
induced deep-unfolding NN and update the digital beamformers. In addition, we
propose a mixed-timescale deep-unfolding NN where the analog beamformers are
optimized online, and extend the framework to frequency-division duplex (FDD)
systems where channel feedback is considered. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional algorithms with
reduced computational complexity and signaling overhead.

observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E
`burst storm', where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence

source's activity between observations. The burst storm shows a steep energy
distribution (power-law index $\alpha = 2.39\pm0.12$) and a bi-modal wait-time
distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ s and
23.61$^{+3.06}_{-2.71}$ s. We attribute these wait-time distribution peaks to a
characteristic event timescale and pseudo-Poisson burst rate, respectively. The

$\sim24$ ms timescale seen for both FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A --

Specifically, we find a reduced viscosity, an enhanced intracycle shear
thinning, the onset of a finite $N_2$ and its frequency doubling, all near a
critical strain amplitude $\gamma_c$ that scales with the volume fraction
$\phi$ as $\gamma_c \sim \phi^{-2}$. These rheological changes also signify a
reversible-irreversible transition (RIT), dividing stroboscopic particle
dynamics into a reversible absorbing phase (for $\gamma_0<\gamma_c$) and a
persistently diffusing phase (for $\gamma_0>\gamma_c$). We explain the results
based on two flow-induced mechanisms and elucidate their connection in the
context of RIT through the underlying microstructure, which tends towards
hyperuniformity near $\gamma_0=\gamma_c$. Overall, we expect this
correspondence between rheology and emergent dynamics to hold in a wide range
of settings where structural organizations are dominated by volume exclusions.

power spectra with the same amplitude from noise power spectra of similar but
distinct amplitudes. The former is the signature of a spatially uncorrelated
pulsar term of a nanohertz gravitational-wave background, whereas the latter
could represent ensemble pulsar noise properties. We test the methodology on
simulated data sets. We find that the reported common process in PPTA pulsars
is indeed consistent with the spectral feature of a pulsar term. We recommend
this methodology as one of the validity tests that the real astrophysical and
cosmological backgrounds should pass, as well as for inferences about the
spatially uncorrelated component of the background.

decomposition along the dislocation line is studied via modeling and
experimental characterization. To model these phenomena, both
finite-deformation microscopic phase-field chemomechanics (MPFCM) and Monte
Carlo molecular dynamics (MCMD) are employed. MPFCM calibration is carried out
with the same Fe-Mn MEAM-based potential used in MCMD, as well as CALPHAD data.
Simulation results for Mn segregation to, and spinodal decomposition along,
straight screw and edge dislocations as well as dislocation loops, are compared
with characterization results from atom probe tomography (APT) for two Fe-Mn
alloy compositions. In contrast to classical Volterra dislocation theory, both
MPFCM and MCMD predict a non-zero hydrostatic stress field in screw cores.
Being of much smaller magnitude than the hydrostatic stress in straight edge
cores, much less solute segregates to screw than to edge cores. In addition,
the segregated amount in screw cores is below the critical concentration of
0.157 for the onset of spinodal decomposition along the line. Results from
MPFCM-based modeling imply that the concentration dependence of the solute
misfit distortion and resulting dependence of the elastic energy density on
concentration have the strongest effect. The maximum amount of Mn segregating
to straight edge dislocations predicted by MPFCM agrees well with APT results.
The MPFCM model for Fe-Mn predicts little or no variation in Mn concentration
along a straight dislocation line, in contrast to the APT results. As shown by
the example of a dislocation loop in the current work, a change in the
hydrostatic stress along the line due to changing character of dislocation does
lead to a corresponding variation in Mn concentration. Such a variation in Mn
concentration can also then be expected along a dislocation line with kinks or
jogs.

(models with finite resilience). We consider a general framework where the

have diffusive components. First we continuously extend the problem from
processes of finite variation to progressively measurable processes. Then we
reduce the extended problem to a linear quadratic (LQ) stochastic control
problem. Using the well developed theory on LQ problems we describe the
solution to the obtained LQ one and trace it back up to the solution to the

pathway to high temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect as well as
various novel topological quantum phases. Although quantized transport
properties have been observed in exfoliated MnBi2Te4 thin flakes, it remains a
big challenge to achieve molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown MnBi2Te4 thin films
even close to the quantized regime. In this work, we report the realization of
quantized anomalous Hall resistivity in MBE-grown MnBi2Te4 thin films with the
chemical potential tuned by both controlled in-situ oxygen exposure and top
gating. We find that elongated post-annealing obviously elevates the
temperature to achieve quantization of the Hall resistivity, but also increases
the residual longitudinal resistivity, indicating a picture of high-quality QAH
puddles weakly coupled by tunnel barriers. These results help to clarify the
puzzles in previous experimental studies on MnBi2Te4 and to find a way out of
the big difficulty in obtaining MnBi2Te4 samples showing quantized transport
properties.

applications, such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and augmented
reality. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the global 6 DoF
camera pose from a single RGB image in a given environment. Previous works
consider every part of the image valuable for localization. However, many image
regions such as the sky, occlusions, and repetitive non-distinguishable
patterns cannot be utilized for localization. In addition to adding unnecessary
computation efforts, extracting and matching features from such regions produce
many wrong matches which in turn degrades the localization accuracy and
efficiency. Our work addresses this particular issue and shows by exploiting an
interesting concept of sparse 3D models that we can exploit discriminatory
environment parts and avoid useless image regions for the sake of a single
image localization. Interestingly, through avoiding selecting keypoints from
non-reliable image regions such as trees, bushes, cars, pedestrians, and
occlusions, our work acts naturally as an outlier filter. This makes our system
highly efficient in that minimal set of correspondences is needed and highly
accurate as the number of outliers is low. Our work exceeds state-ofthe-art
methods on outdoor Cambridge Landmarks dataset. With only relying on single
image at inference, it outweighs in terms of accuracy methods that exploit pose
priors and/or reference 3D models while being much faster. By choosing as
little as 100 correspondences, it surpasses similar methods that localize from
thousands of correspondences, while being more efficient. In particular, it
achieves, compared to these methods, an improvement of localization by 33% on
OldHospital scene. Furthermore, It outstands direct pose regressors even those
that learn from sequence of images

they can utilize an auxiliary $P_3$ with a strong network link to $P_2$ to
accelerate the secure computation. Our three-party protocol requires 1 domain

different ways of how to transform our protocols into homogeneous protocols

domains. Typically, the scaling factor of this action noise is chosen as a
hyper-parameter and is kept constant during training. In this paper, we focus
on action noise in off-policy deep reinforcement learning for continuous
control. We analyze how the learned policy is impacted by the noise type, noise
scale, and impact scaling factor reduction schedule. We consider the two most
prominent types of action noise, Gaussian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and
perform a vast experimental campaign by systematically varying the noise type
and scale parameter, and by measuring variables of interest like the expected
return of the policy and the state-space coverage during exploration. For the
latter, we propose a novel state-space coverage measure
$\operatorname{X}_{\mathcal{U}\text{rel}}$ that is more robust to estimation
artifacts caused by points close to the state-space boundary than
previously-proposed measures. Larger noise scales generally increase
state-space coverage. However, we found that increasing the space coverage
using a larger noise scale is often not beneficial. On the contrary, reducing
the noise scale over the training process reduces the variance and generally
improves the learning performance. We conclude that the best noise type and
scale are environment dependent, and based on our observations derive heuristic
rules for guiding the choice of the action noise as a starting point for
further optimization.

this structure to absorb the stochastic approximation error inside the
diffusion process, and obtain improved convergence guarantees for these
algorithms. For SGLD, we prove the first stable convergence rate in KL
divergence without requiring uniform warm start, assuming the target density
satisfies a Log-Sobolev Inequality. Our result implies superior first-order
oracle complexity compared to prior works, under significantly milder
assumptions. We also prove the first guarantees for SGLD under even weaker
conditions such as H\""{o}lder smoothness and Poincare Inequality, thus bridging
the gap between the state-of-the-art guarantees for LMC and SGLD. Our analysis
motivates a new algorithm called covariance correction, which corrects for the
additional noise introduced by the stochastic approximation by rescaling the
strength of the diffusion. Finally, we apply our techniques to analyze RBM, and
significantly improve upon the guarantees in prior works (such as removing
exponential dependence on horizon), under minimal assumptions.

which the total number of antennas $LM$ is distributed among the $L$ remote

Due to pilot contamination and system scalability, each RU can only serve a
limited number of users. Obtaining the optimal number of users simultaneously
served on one resource block (RB) by the $L$ RUs regarding the sum spectral
efficiency (SE) is not a simple challenge though, as many of the system
parameters are intertwined. For example, the dimension $\tau_p$ of orthogonal
Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) pilots limits the number of users that an
RU can serve. Thus, depending on $\tau_p$, the optimal user load yielding the
maximum sum SE will vary. Another key parameter is the users' uplink transmit
power $P^{\rm ue}_{\rm tx}$, where a trade-off between users in outage,
interference and energy inefficiency exists. We study the effect of multiple

the performance of different levels of RU antenna distribution. We provide
extensive numerical investigations to illuminate the behavior of the system SE

extract features observed from the lung window. However, it has been proved
that some appearances related to diagnosis can be observed better from the
mediastinal window rather than the lung window, e.g., the pulmonary
consolidation happens more in severe symptoms. In this paper, we propose a
novel Dual Window RCNN Network (DWRNet), which mainly learns the distinctive
features from the successive mediastinal window. Regarding the features
extracted from the lung window, we introduce the Lung Window Attention Block
(LWA Block) to pay additional attention to them for enhancing the
mediastinal-window features. Moreover, instead of picking up specific slices
from the whole CT slices, we use a Recurrent CNN and analyze successive slices
as videos. Experimental results show that the fused and representative features
improve the predictions of disease course by reaching the accuracy of 90.57%,
against the baseline with an accuracy of 84.86%. Ablation studies demonstrate
that combined dual window features are more efficient than lung-window features
alone, while paying attention to lung-window features can improve the model's

conceptual model, we quantitatively compare three mechanisms, which combine the
global signal with local signaling between neighboring cells, to enhance the
boundary formation process. These mechanisms differ with respect to the way in
which they combine the signals, by following either an AND, an OR, or a SUM
rule. Within our model, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary formation
process, and the fuzziness of the resulting boundary. Furthermore, we consider
the tunability of the boundary position, and its scaling with system size. We
nd that all three mechanisms produce less fuzzy boundaries than the purely
gradient-based reference mechanism, even in the regime of high noise in the
local signals relative to the noise in the global signal. Among the three
mechanisms, the SUM rule produces the most accurate boundary. However, in
contrast to the other two mechanisms, it requires noise to exit metastable
states and rapidly reach the stable boundary pattern.

heliosphere is characterized by the quasi omni-presence of magnetic switchbacks
(""switchback"" hereinafter), local backward-bends of magnetic field lines.
Switchbacks also tend to come in patches, with a large-scale modulation that
appears to have a spatial scale size comparable to supergranulation on the Sun.
Here we inspect data from the first ten encounters of PSP focusing on different
time intervals when clear switchback patches were observed by PSP. We show that
the switchbacks modulation, on a timescale of several hours, seems to be
independent of whether PSP is near perihelion, when it rapidly traverses large
swaths of longitude remaining at the same heliocentric distance, or near the
radial-scan part of its orbit, when PSP hovers over the same longitude on the
Sun while rapidly moving radially inwards or outwards. This implies that
switchback patches must also have an intrinsically temporal modulation most
probably originating at the Sun. Between two consecutive patches, the magnetic
field is usually very quiescent with weak fluctuations. We compare various
parameters between the quiescent intervals and the switchback intervals. The
results show that the quiescent intervals are typically less Alfv\'enic than
switchback intervals, and the magnetic power spectrum is usually shallower in
quiescent intervals. We propose that the temporal modulation of switchback
patches may be related to the ""breathing"" of emerging flux that appears in

sets corresponding to nonlinear dynamical systems subject to a discrete control
constraint set. For data sets of this kind, a new definition, namely
exponential attraction on data sets, is proposed to describe nonlinear
dynamical systems under consideration. Based on the data sets and parameterized
Lyapunov functions, the problem for exponential attraction on data sets is
converted to a pattern classification one. Furthermore, the controller design
is proposed accordingly, where the pattern classification function is used to
decide which control element in the control set should be employed.
Illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed CWP.

of the dearth of materials with natural dipole-active electronic transitions in
this spectral region. One approach to solve this problem is through
quantum-engineering of the electron dispersion to create artificial
transitions, as in quantum cascade devices. In this work we propose an
alternative method to generate mid-infrared light, utilizing the coupling
between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom due to the nonlocal
optical response of nanoscopic polar dielectric crystals. Polar crystals
support sub-diffraction photonic modes in the mid-infrared. They also support
longitudinal phonons, which couple efficiently with electrical currents through
the Fr\""ohlich interaction. As we have shown in previous theoretical and
experimental works, these two degrees of freedom can hybridize forming
longitudinal-transverse polaritons. Here we theoretically demonstrate that
longitudinal-transverse polaritons can be efficiently generated by electrical
currents, leading to resonant narrowband photonic emission. This approach can
therefore be utilised to electrically generate far-field mid-infrared photons
in the absence of dipole-active electronic transitions, potentially
underpinning a novel generation of mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.

the process which preserves the properties of fractional Brownian motion at a

all discriminative features of each potential semantic class in the pretraining

and high diversity and thus covers most features in downstream dataset, in
fine-tuning phase, the pretrained encoder can capture as much features as it
can in downstream datasets, and would not lost these features with theoretical

transformations while considering the sequence information. The proposed method
is validated on three public cardiac cine MRI datasets with comprehensive
evaluations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform
other approaches, yielding higher motion tracking accuracy with reasonable
volume preservation and better generalizability to varying data distributions.
It also enables better estimates of myocardial strains, which indicates the

applied to parameteric models such as Mixture of Normal (MN) distributions,
Markow Switching(MS), or Structural Autoregressive (SVAR) models. In the
approach, it is assumed that model parameters are identified under the null
whereas under the alternative they are not identified. Thanks to the setting,
the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator preserves its properties under the null
hypothesis. The proposed test is based on a comparison of two consistent
estimators based on independent subsamples of the data set. A Wald type
statistic is proposed which has a typical $\chi^2$ distribution. Finally, the
method is adjusted to test if the heteroscedasticity assumption is sufficient
to identify parameters of SVAR model. Its properties are evaluated with a Monte

mis-specified VAR order. They indicate that the test has an asymptotically
correct size. Moreover, outcomes show that the power of the test makes it

notions of stability such as hypothesis stability and $L_2$-stability, the
literature suggests that only polynomial generalization bounds are possible in
general cases. The present paper addresses this long standing tension between
these two regimes of results and makes progress towards relaxing it inside a
classic framework of confidence-boosting. To this end, we first establish an
in-expectation first moment generalization error bound for potentially
randomized learning algorithms with $L_2$-stability, based on which we then
show that a properly designed subbagging process leads to near-tight
exponential generalization bounds over the randomness of both data and

their impact on VSI saturation. Inertial-wave linear theory is developed and
applied to a representative global 2D simulation using the Athena++ code. It is
found that the VSI saturates by separating the disk into several radial wave
zones roughly demarcated by corotation resonances (turning points); this
structure also manifests in modest radial variations in the vertical turbulence
strength. Future numerical work should employ large radial domains to
accommodate this radial structure of the VSI, while concurrently adopting
sufficiently fine resolutions to resolve the parametric instability that
attacks the saturated VSI inertial waves.

non-interacting, indistinguishable quantum particles can be realized as a
thermodynamic machine as an artifact of energy quantization and hence bears no
classical analog. Such a thermodynamic machine depends on the statistics of the
particles, the chemical potential, and the spatial dimension of the system. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates the fundamental features of quantum Stirling
cycles from the viewpoint of particle statistics and system dimensions that
helps us to realize desired quantum heat engines and refrigerators by
exploiting the role of quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, a clear
distinction between the behavior of a Fermi gas and a Bose gas is observed in
one dimension than in higher dimensions, solely due to the innate differences
in their particle statistics indicating the conspicuous role of a quantum
thermodynamic signature in lower dimensions.

These clusters of like-minded individuals tend to reinforce prior beliefs,
elicit animosity towards others and aggravate the spread of misinformation. We
study this phenomenon on a Twitter dataset related to the 2017 French

recommendations. We use a quadratic program to find optimal recommendations
that maximise the diversity of content users are exposed to, while still
accounting for their preferences. Our method relies on a theoretical model that

  Gaussianization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we elaborate an extension of rotation-based iterative
Gaussianization, RBIG, which makes image Gaussianization possible. Although
RBIG has been successfully applied to many tasks, it is limited to medium
dimensionality data (on the order of a thousand dimensions). In images its
application has been restricted to small image patches or isolated pixels,
because rotation in RBIG is based on principal or independent component
analysis and these transformations are difficult to learn and scale. Here we
present the \emph{Convolutional RBIG}: an extension that alleviates this issue
by imposing that the rotation in RBIG is a convolution. We propose to learn
convolutional rotations (i.e. orthonormal convolutions) by optimising for the
reconstruction loss between the input and an approximate inverse of the
transformation using the transposed convolution operation. Additionally, we
suggest different regularizers in learning these orthonormal convolutions. For
example, imposing sparsity in the activations leads to a transformation that
extends convolutional independent component analysis to multilayer
architectures. We also highlight how statistical properties of the data, such
as multivariate mutual information, can be obtained from \emph{Convolutional
RBIG}. We illustrate the behavior of the transform with a simple example of
texture synthesis, and analyze its properties by visualizing the stimuli that
maximize the response in certain feature and layer.

transmission systems, in which image compression plays an important role.
Generally speaking, image compression algorithms are developed to ensure good
visual quality at limited bit rates. However, due to the different compression
optimization methods, the compressed images may have different levels of
quality, which needs to be evaluated quantificationally. Nowadays, the
mainstream full-reference (FR) metrics are effective to predict the quality of
compressed images at coarse-grained levels (the bit rates differences of
compressed images are obvious), however, they may perform poorly for
fine-grained compressed images whose bit rates differences are quite subtle.
Therefore, to better improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) and provide useful
guidance for compression algorithms, we propose a full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA) method for compressed images of fine-grained levels.
Specifically, the reference images and compressed images are first converted to
$YCbCr$ color space. The gradient features are extracted from regions that are
sensitive to compression artifacts. Then we employ the Log-Gabor transformation
to further analyze the texture difference. Finally, the obtained features are
fused into a quality score. The proposed method is validated on the
fine-grained compression image quality assessment (FGIQA) database, which is
especially constructed for assessing the quality of compressed images with
close bit rates. The experimental results show that our metric outperforms
mainstream FR-IQA metrics on the FGIQA database. We also test our method on
other commonly used compression IQA databases and the results show that our
method obtains competitive performance on the coarse-grained compression IQA
databases as well.

utilities of players on a network and weights on the links that connect
players. The welfare-maximizing joint intervention exhibits the following
properties: (a) when the planner's budget is moderate (so that optimal
interventions are interior), the change in weight on any link connecting a pair
of players is proportional to the product of eigen-centralities of the pair;
(b) when the budget is sufficiently large, the optimal network takes a simple
form: It is either a complete network under strategic complements or a complete
balanced bipartite network under strategic substitutes. We show that the
welfare effect of joint intervention is shaped by the principal eigenvalue,
while the distributional effect is captured by the dispersion of the
corresponding eigenvalues, i.e., the eigen-centralities. Comparing joint
intervention in our setting with single intervention solely on the standalone
marginal utilities, as studied by Galeotti et al. (2020), we find that joint
intervention always yields a higher aggregate welfare, but may lead to greater
inequality, which highlights a possible trade-off between the welfare and
distributional impacts of joint intervention.

to shed light on their particle acceleration and emission mechanisms. We report
results from a four-day coordinated multi-wavelength campaign on the

AstroSAT, BVRI photometry with the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), and TeV
data from FACT to explore short-term multi-wavelength variability in this HBL.
The X-ray continuum is rapidly variable on time-scales of tens of ks.
Fractional variability amplitude increases with energy across the synchrotron
hump, consistent with previous studies; we interpret this observation in the
context of a model with multiple cells whose emission spectra contain cutoffs
that follow a power-law distribution. We also performed time-averaged and
time-resolved (time-scales of 6 ks) spectral fits; a broken power-law model
fits all spectra well; time-resolved spectral fitting reveals the usual
hardening when brightening behaviour. Intra-X-ray cross correlations yield
evidence for the 0.6-0.8 keV band to likely lead the other bands by an average
of 4.6 +- 2.6 ks, but only during the first half of the observation. The source
displayed minimal night-to-night variability at all wavebands thus precluding
significant interband correlations during our campaign. The broadband SED is
modeled well with a standard one-zone leptonic model, yielding jet parameters
consistent with those obtained from previous SEDs of this source.

tracers of past events and can be used to disentangle merger remnants from
stars that formed in the main galaxy. The merger history of the Milky Way is
generally understood to be particularly easy to study in the stellar halo. The
advent of the ESA astrometric satellite Gaia has enabled the detection of
completely new structures in the halo such as the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage.
However, simulations also show that mergers may be important for the build-up
of the cool stellar disks. Combining elemental abundances for 100 giant branch
stars from APOGEE DR17 and astrometric data from Gaia we use elemental
abundance ratios to find an hitherto unknown, old stellar component in the cool

the accreted red giant stars in the disk. These stars allows us to date the

However, both discovering what data is in a data lake and exploring related
data sets can take significant effort, as a data lake can contain an
intimidating amount of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose the use of
schema inference to support the interpretation of the data in the data lake. If
a data lake is to support a schema-on-read paradigm, understanding the existing
schema of relevant portions of the data lake seems like a prerequisite. In this
paper, we make use of approximate indexes that can be used for data discovery
to inform the inference of a schema for a data lake, consisting of entity types
and the relationships between them. The specific approach identifies candidate
entity types by clustering similar data sets from the data lake, and then
relationships between data sets in different clusters are used to inform the
identification of relationships between the entity types. The approach is
evaluated using real-world data repositories, to identify where the proposal is
effective, and to inform the identification of areas for further work.

during design and operations studies. Starting in the early 2000s, searching
for better beam dynamics configurations became synonymous with heuristic
optimization methods in the accelerator physics community. Genetic algorithms
and particle swarm optimization are currently the most widely used. These
algorithms can take thousands of simulation evaluations to find optimal
solutions for one machine prototype. For large facilities such as the Linac
Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and others, this equates to a limited exploration
of many possible design configurations. In this paper, the LCLS-II
photoinjector is optimized with three optimization algorithms. All
optimizations were started from both a uniform random and Latin hypercube
sample. In all cases, the optimizations started from Latin hypercube samples
outperformed optimizations started from uniform samples. All three algorithms
were able to optimize the photoinjector, with the model-based methods
approximating the Pareto front in fewer simulation evaluations. This work, in
combination with previous optimization observations, indicates objective
penalties have a strong impact on the efficiency of such methods. In general,
we recommend heuristic methods for initial optimizations and model-based
methods when information about the objective space is available.

Current state-of-the-art methods for room boundary detection using microphone
measurements typically focus on a two-dimensional setting, causing a model
mismatch when employed in real-life scenarios. Detection of arbitrary
reflectors in three dimensions encounters practical limitations, e.g., the need
for a spherical array and the increased computational complexity. Moreover,
loudspeakers may not have an omnidirectional directivity pattern, as usually
assumed in the literature, making the detection of acoustic reflectors in some
directions more challenging. In the proposed method, a LiDAR sensor is added to
a loudspeaker to improve wall detection accuracy and robustness. This is done
in two ways. First, the model mismatch introduced by horizontal reflectors can
be resolved by detecting reflectors with the LiDAR sensor to enable elimination
of their detrimental influence from the 2D problem in pre-processing. Second, a
LiDAR-based method is proposed to compensate for the challenging directions
where the directive loudspeaker emits little energy. We show via simulations
that this multi-modal approach, i.e., combining microphone and LiDAR sensors,
improves the robustness and accuracy of wall detection.

conversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health

discussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these
elements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper,
the aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain
knowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset
after annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference
summaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel
counseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three
independent modules. First, to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, it
filters utterances utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while
the second and third modules aim to classify counseling components. At last, we
propose a problem-specific Mental Health Information Capture (MHIC) evaluation
metric for counseling summaries. Our comparative study shows that we improve on

comprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of

ConSum generates quality summary. Further, mental health experts validate the
clinical acceptability of the ConSum. Lastly, we discuss the uniqueness in

reduction-of-dimensionality concept, according to which a ligand first binds

then diffuses along this surface until it locates the target. In this work, we
analyse the efficiency of such a scenario and confront it with the efficiency
of a direct search process, in which the target is approached directly from the

single ligand is launched from a fixed or a random position and searches for
the target, and (ii) the case of ""amplified"" signals when $N$ ligands start
either from the same point or from random positions, and the search terminates
when the fastest of them arrives to the target. For such settings, we go beyond
the conventional analyses, which compare only the mean values of the

of FPTs for both scenarios and study its integral characteristic -- the
""survival"" probability of a target up to time $t$. On this basis, we examine
how the efficiencies of both scenarios are controlled by a variety of

(CL) in the context of UDA can help to better separate classes in feature
space. However, in image segmentation, the large memory footprint due to the
computation of the pixel-wise contrastive loss makes it prohibitive to use.
Furthermore, labeled target data is not easily available in medical imaging,
and obtaining new samples is not economical. As a result, in this work, we
tackle a more challenging UDA task when there are only a few (fewshot) or a
single (oneshot) image available from the target domain. We apply a style
transfer module to mitigate the scarcity of target samples. Then, to align the
source and target features and tackle the memory issue of the traditional
contrastive loss, we propose the centroid-based contrastive learning (CCL) and
a centroid norm regularizer (CNR) to optimize the contrastive pairs in both
direction and magnitude. In addition, we propose multi-partition centroid
contrastive learning (MPCCL) to further reduce the variance in the target

improves the segmentation performance by 0.34 of the Dice score on the target

intertwining the d-wave superconducting (DSC) and PDW order parameters allows a

nematicity, each consisting primarily of unidirectional and lattice
commensurate electron-pair density modulations. Further, we demonstrate by
direct imaging that the scattering resonances identifying Zn impurity atom

that the nematic PDW state is pinned by Zn atoms, as was recently proposed

theoretically quantify the advantage of HRISs in notably reducing the amount of

magnetic fields in massive gaseous disks. This GI dynamo may appear in young
circumstellar disks, whose weak ionization challenges other amplification
routes, as well as in active galactic nuclei. Although regarded as a
large-scale dynamo, only local simulations have so far described its kinematic
regime. We study the GI dynamo in global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of
accretion disks, focusing on its kinematic phase. We perform resistive MHD
simulations with the Pluto code for different radiative cooling times and
electrical resistivities. A weak magnetic field seeds the dynamo, and we adopt
mean-field and heuristic models to capture its essence. We recover the same
induction process leading to magnetic field amplification as previously
identified in local simulations. The dynamo is, however, global in nature,
connecting distant annuli of the disk via a large-scale dynamo mode of a fixed
growth rate. This large-scale amplification can be described by a mean-field
model that does not rely on conventional alpha-Omega effects. When varying the
disk parameters we find an optimal resistivity that facilitates magnetic
amplification, whose magnetic Reynolds number, Rm < 10, is substantially
smaller than in local simulations. Unlike local simulations, we find an optimal
cooling rate and the existence of global oscillating dynamo modes. The
nonlinear saturation of the dynamo puts the disk in a strongly magnetized
turbulent state on the margins of the effective range of GI. In our
simulations, the accretion power eventually exceeds the threshold required by

optimality conditions for optimization problems with nonsmooth structure. Based
on the so-called second subderivative of the objective function and of the
indicator function associated with the feasible set, one easily obtains
second-order sufficient optimality conditions of abstract form. In order to
exploit further structure of the problem, e.g., composite terms in the
objective function or feasible sets given as (images of) pre-images of closed
sets under smooth transformations, to make these conditions fully explicit, we
study calculus rules for the second subderivative under mild conditions. To be
precise, we investigate a chain rule and a marginal function rule, which then
also give a pre-image and image rule, respectively. As it turns out, the chain
rule and the pre-image rule yield lower estimates desirable in order to obtain
sufficient optimality conditions for free. Similar estimates for the marginal
function and the image rule are valid under a comparatively mild inner
calmness* assumption. Our findings are illustrated by several examples
including problems from composite, disjunctive, and nonlinear second-order cone
programming.

of the classic problems for WFAs is probability distribution estimation over
sequences of discrete symbols. Although WFAs have been extended to deal with
continuous input data, namely continuous WFAs (CWFAs), it is still unclear how
to approximate density functions over sequences of continuous random variables
using WFA-based models, due to the limitation on the expressiveness of the
model as well as the tractability of approximating density functions via CWFAs.
In this paper, we propose a nonlinear extension to the CWFA model to first
improve its expressiveness, we refer to it as the nonlinear continuous WFAs
(NCWFAs). Then we leverage the so-called RNADE method, which is a well-known
density estimator based on neural networks, and propose the RNADE-NCWFA model.
The RNADE-NCWFA model computes a density function by design. We show that this
model is strictly more expressive than the Gaussian HMM model, which CWFA
cannot approximate. Empirically, we conduct a synthetic experiment using
Gaussian HMM generated data. We focus on evaluating the model's ability to
estimate densities for sequences of varying lengths (longer length than the

detecting anomalies in CXRs in an unsupervised fashion is very promising.
However, almost all of the existing methods consider anomaly detection as a
one-class classification (OCC) problem. They model the distribution of only
known normal images during training and identify the samples not conforming to
normal profile as anomalies in the testing phase. A large number of unlabeled
images containing anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, although
they are easy to obtain in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel
strategy, Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD), utilizing
both known normal images and unlabeled images. The proposed method consists of
two modules. During training, one module takes both known normal and unlabeled
images as inputs, capturing anomalous features from unlabeled images in some
way, while the other one models the distribution of only known normal images.
Subsequently, inter-discrepancy between the two modules, and intra-discrepancy
inside the module that is trained on only normal images are designed as anomaly
scores to indicate anomalies. Experiments on three CXR datasets demonstrate
that the proposed DDAD achieves consistent, significant gains and outperforms

effect in high-voltage GaAs avalanche diodes. The avalanche triggering is
initiated by steep voltage ramp applied to the diode and in-series 50 Ohm load.
After subnanosecond avalanche switching the reversely biased GaAs diode remains
in the conducting state for the whole duration of the applied pulse (dozens of
nanoseconds). There is no indication of the p-n junction recovery that is
commonly expected to develop on the nanosecond scale due to the drift
extraction of non-equilibrium carriers. The diode voltage keeps a constant
value of ~70 V much lower than the stationary breakdown voltage of 400 V.
Numerical simulations reveal that the conducting state is supported by impact
ionization in narrow high-field collapsing Gunn domains as well as in
quasi-stationary cathode and anode ionizing domains. Collapsing Gunn domains
spontaneously appear in the dense electron-hole plasma due to the negative
differential mobility of electrons in GaAs. The effect resembles the lock-on

algorithms which directly optimize the parameters of a reduced model to
approximate a given large-scale model with respect to either the H-infinity or
the H-2 norm. This approach has several benefits. Our parameterization ensures
that the reduced model is again a pH-DAE system and enables a compact
representation of the algebraic part of the large-scale model, which in
projection-based methods often requires a more involved treatment. The direct
optimization is entirely based on transfer function evaluations of the
large-scale model and is therefore independent of the system matrices'

non-adiabatic processes such as radiation cooling and unspecified heating can
significantly affect the dynamics and properties of magnetoacoustic (MA) waves.
To address the co-influence of these factors on the dispersion properties of MA
waves, we considered a single magnetic slab composed of the thermally active
plasma. Using the perturbation theory, we obtained a differential equation that
determines the dynamics of the two-dimensional perturbations. Applying the
assumption of strong magnetic structuring, we derived the dispersion relations
for the sausage and kink MA modes. The numerical solution of the dispersion
relations for the coronal conditions was performed to investigate the interplay
between the non-uniformity and the thermal misbalance. For the heating scenario
considered, it was obtained that the phase speed of both the sausage and kink
slow MA waves is highly affected by the thermal misbalance in the long
wavelength limit. The obtained characteristic timescales of the slow waves
dissipation coincide with the periods of waves observed in the corona.
Simultaneously, the phase speed of the fast waves is not affected by the
thermal misbalance. The geometry of the magnetic structure still remains the
main dispersion mechanism for the fast waves. Our estimation reveals that
dissipation of the fast waves is weaker than dissipation of the slow waves in
the coronal conditions. The obtained results are of importance for using the
magnetoacoustic waves not only as a tool for estimating plasma parameters, but
also as a tool for estimating the non-adiabatic processes.

hypoxic environments through respiration via their mucous body wall and
posterior ciliated hindgut, which they wave above them. However, the change in
collective behavior at different levels of DO is not known. Using a closed-loop
respirometer with flow, we discover that the relative tail reaching activity
flux in low DO is $\sim$75x higher than in the high DO condition. Additionally,
when flow rate is increased to suspend the worm blobs upward, we find that the
average exposed surface area of a blob in low DO is $\sim$1.4x higher than in
high DO. Furthermore, we observe emergent properties that arise when a worm
blob is exposed to extreme DO levels. Here we show that internal stress is
generated when worm blobs are exposed to high DO levels, allowing them to be
physically lifted off from the bottom of a conical container using a serrated
endpiece. Our results demonstrate how both collective behavior and the emergent

(sub-pc - AU) regulating the internal dynamics of each globular cluster (GC).
In this work we present a novel method that combine semi-analytic models of GCS
with fully self-consistent Monte Carlo models to simultaneously evolve large
GCSs. We use the population synthesis code MASinGa and the MOCCA-Survey
Database I to create synthetic GC populations aimed at representing the
observed features of GCs in the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31). Our
procedure enables us to recover the spatial and mass distribution of GCs in
such galaxies, and to constrain the amount of mass that GCs left either in the
halo as dispersed debris, or in the galactic centre, where they can contribute
to the formation of a nuclear star cluster (NSC) and can bring stellar and
possibly intermediate mass black holes there. The final masses reported by our
simulations are of a few order of magnitudes smaller than the observed values.
These differences show that mass build-up of a NSC and central BHs in galaxies
like MW and M31 cannot be solely explained by the infalling GC scenario. This
build-up is likely to depend on the interplay between interactions and mergers
of infalling GCs and gas. The latter can contribute to both in-situ star
formation in the NSC and growth of the central BH.

the popular real-world robotics application of autonomous driving, where
representing the distribution over possible futures of moving agents is
essential for safe and comfortable motion planning. In these models, the choice
of coordinate frames to represent inputs and outputs has crucial trade offs
which broadly fall into one of two categories. Agent-centric models transform
inputs and perform inference in agent-centric coordinates. These models are
intrinsically invariant to translation and rotation between scene elements, are
best-performing on public leaderboards, but scale quadratically with the number
of agents and scene elements. Scene-centric models use a fixed coordinate
system to process all agents. This gives them the advantage of sharing
representations among all agents, offering efficient amortized inference
computation which scales linearly with the number of agents. However, these
models have to learn invariance to translation and rotation between scene
elements, and typically underperform agent-centric models. In this work, we
develop knowledge distillation techniques between probabilistic motion
forecasting models, and apply these techniques to close the gap in performance
between agent-centric and scene-centric models. This improves scene-centric
model performance by 13.2% on the public Argoverse benchmark, 7.8% on Waymo

scene-centric models rank highly in public leaderboards and are up to 15 times
more efficient than their agent-centric teacher counterparts in busy scenes.

functional data analysis and are widely used methods for performing regression
when the covariates are observed random functions coupled with scalar responses
in a wide range of applications. In the existing literature, however, the
construction of associated estimators and the study of their theoretical
properties is invariably carried out on a case-by-case basis for specific
models under consideration. In this work, we provide a unified methodological
and theoretical framework for estimating the index in functional linear and
single-index models; in the later case the proposed approach does not require
the specification of the link function. In terms of methodology, we show that
the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) based functional linear
least-squares estimator, when viewed through the lens of an
infinite-dimensional Gaussian Stein's identity, also provides an estimator of
the index of the single-index model. On the theoretical side, we characterize
the convergence rates of the proposed estimators for both linear and
single-index models. Our analysis has several key advantages: (i) we do not
require restrictive commutativity assumptions for the covariance operator of
the random covariates on one hand and the integral operator associated with the
reproducing kernel on the other hand; and (ii) we also allow for the true index
parameter to lie outside of the chosen RKHS, thereby allowing for index
mis-specification as well as for quantifying the degree of such index
mis-specification. Several existing results emerge as special cases of our
analysis.

transition from antiferromagnetic to charge-ordered ground states. Finally, we
calculate the self-energy of the phonon and capture the impact of charge

technique for explaining black box models. While the impact of data imbalance
on predictive models has been extensively studied, it remains largely unknown
with respect to SHAP-based model explanations. This study sought to investigate
the effects of data imbalance on SHAP explanations for deep learning models,
and to propose a strategy to mitigate these effects. Materials and Methods: We
propose to adjust class distributions in the background and explanation data in
SHAP when explaining black box models. Our data balancing strategy is to
compose background data and explanation data with an equal distribution of
classes. To evaluate the effects of data adjustment on model explanation, we
propose to use the beeswarm plot as a qualitative tool to identify ""abnormal""
explanation artifacts, and quantitatively test the consistency between variable
importance and prediction power. We demonstrated our proposed approach in an
empirical study that predicted inpatient mortality using the Medical
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data and a multilayer

the number of the artifacts in the beeswarm plot, thus mitigating the negative
effects of data imbalance. Additionally, with the balancing strategy, the
top-ranked variables from the corresponding importance ranking demonstrated
improved discrimination power. Discussion and Conclusion: Our findings suggest
that balanced background and explanation data could help reduce the noise in
explanation results induced by skewed data distribution and improve the
reliability of variable importance ranking. Furthermore, these balancing
procedures improve the potential of SHAP in identifying patients with abnormal

cross-modal correlations, there is a growing trend of enhancing demand
forecasting accuracy by learning from multimodal data. These multimodal
forecasting models can improve accuracy but be less practical when different
parts of multimodal datasets are owned by different institutions who cannot
directly share data among them. While various institutions may can not share
their data with each other directly, they may share forecasting models trained
by their data, where such models cannot be used to identify the exact
information from their datasets. This study proposes an Unsupervised Knowledge
Adaptation Demand Forecasting framework to forecast the demand of the target
mode by utilizing a pre-trained model based on data of another mode, which does
not require direct data sharing of the source mode. The proposed framework
utilizes the potential shared patterns among multiple transport modes to
improve forecasting performance while avoiding the direct sharing of data among
different institutions. Specifically, a pre-trained forecasting model is first
learned based on the data of a source mode, which can capture and memorize the
source travel patterns. Then, the demand data of the target dataset is encoded
into an individual knowledge part and a sharing knowledge part which will
extract travel patterns by individual extraction network and sharing extraction
network, respectively. The unsupervised knowledge adaptation strategy is
utilized to form the sharing features for further forecasting by making the
pre-trained network and the sharing extraction network analogous. Our findings
illustrate that unsupervised knowledge adaptation by sharing the pre-trained
model to the target mode can improve the forecasting performance without the
dependence on direct data sharing.

framework that enables multiple clients to collaborate without sharing raw

framework. Prior work has shown that the gradient sharing strategies in
federated learning can be vulnerable to data reconstruction attacks. In
practice, though, clients may not transmit raw gradients considering the high
communication cost or due to privacy enhancement requirements. Empirical
studies have demonstrated that gradient obfuscation, including intentional
obfuscation via gradient noise injection and unintentional obfuscation via
gradient compression, can provide more privacy protection against
reconstruction attacks. In this work, we present a new data reconstruction
attack framework targeting the image classification task in federated learning.
We show that commonly adopted gradient postprocessing procedures, such as
gradient quantization, gradient sparsification, and gradient perturbation, may
give a false sense of security in federated learning. Contrary to prior
studies, we argue that privacy enhancement should not be treated as a byproduct
of gradient compression. Additionally, we design a new method under the
proposed framework to reconstruct the image at the semantic level. We quantify
the semantic privacy leakage and compare with conventional based on image
similarity scores. Our comparisons challenge the image data leakage evaluation
schemes in the literature. The results emphasize the importance of revisiting

explosive devices (IEDs), there has been an increase in blast-induced traumatic
brain injuries (bTBI) among military personnel and civilians. The increased
prevalence of bTBI necessitates bTBI models that result in a properly scaled
injury for the model organism being used. The primary laboratory model for bTBI
is the shock tube, wherein a compressed gas ruptures a thin membrane,
generating a shockwave. To generate a shock wave that is properly scaled from
human to rodent subjects the shock wave must have a short duration and high
peak overpressure while fitting a Friedlander waveform, the ideal
representation of a blast wave. A large variety of factors have been
experimentally characterized in attempts to create an ideal waveform, however
we found current research on the gas composition being used to drive shock wave
formation to be lacking. To better understand the effect the driver gas has on
the waveform being produced, we utilized a previously established murine shock
tube bTBI model in conjunction with several distinct driver gasses. In
agreement with previous findings, helium produced a shock wave most closely
fitting the Friedlander waveform in contrast to the plateau-like waveforms
produced by some other gases. The peak pressure at the exit of the shock tube
and 5 cm from the exit have a strong negative correlation with the density of
the gas being used: helium the least dense gas used produces the highest peak
overpressure. Density of the driver gas also exerts a strong positive effect on
the duration of the shock wave, with helium producing the shortest duration
wave. Due to its ability to produce a Friedlander waveform and produce a
waveform following proper injury scaling guidelines, helium is an ideal gas for
use in shock tube models for bTBI.

necessary component for many applications in the computational sciences, and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved as an excellent tool to
generate these surrogates when parametric fields are present. CNNs are commonly
trained on labeled data based on one-to-one sets of parameter-input and
PDE-output fields. Recently, residual-based convolutional physics-informed
neural network (CPINN) solvers for parametric PDEs have been proposed to build
surrogates without the need for labeled data. These allow for the generation of
surrogates without an expensive offline-phase. In this work, we present an
alternative formulation termed Deep Convolutional Ritz Method (DCRM) as a
parametric PDE solver. The approach is based on the minimization of energy
functionals, which lowers the order of the differential operators compared to
residual-based methods. Based on studies involving the Poisson equation with a
spatially parameterized source term and boundary conditions, we found that CNNs
trained on labeled data outperform CPINNs in convergence speed and
generalization ability. Surrogates generated from DCRM, however, converge
significantly faster than their CPINN counterparts and prove to generalize
faster and better than surrogates obtained from both CNNs trained on labeled
data and CPINNs. This hints that DCRM could make PDE solution surrogates
trained without labeled data possible.

similarity between the positive pairs, and at the same time tend to minimize
the similarity between the negative pairs. However, in general the interplay
between the negative pairs is ignored as they do not put in place special
mechanisms to treat negative pairs differently according to their specific
differences and similarities. In this paper, we present Extended Momentum
Contrast (XMoCo), a self-supervised representation learning method founded upon
the legacy of the momentum-encoder unit proposed in the MoCo family
configurations. To this end, we introduce a cross consistency regularization
loss, with which we extend the transformation consistency to dissimilar images
(negative pairs). Under the cross consistency regularization rule, we argue
that semantic representations associated with any pair of images (positive or
negative) should preserve their cross-similarity under pretext transformations.
Moreover, we further regularize the training loss by enforcing a uniform
distribution of similarity over the negative pairs across a batch. The proposed
regularization can easily be added to existing self-supervised learning
algorithms in a plug-and-play fashion. Empirically, we report a competitive
performance on the standard Imagenet-1K linear head classification benchmark.
In addition, by transferring the learned representations to common downstream
tasks, we show that using XMoCo with the prevalently utilized augmentations can
lead to improvements in the performance of such tasks. We hope the findings of
this paper serve as a motivation for researchers to take into consideration the
important interplay among the negative examples in self-supervised learning.

introducing syntactic inductive biases for deep learning models. We propose two
families of inductive biases, one for constituency structure and another one
for dependency structure. The constituency inductive bias encourages deep
learning models to use different units (or neurons) to separately process
long-term and short-term information. This separation provides a way for deep
learning models to build the latent hierarchical representations from
sequential inputs, that a higher-level representation is composed of and can be
decomposed into a series of lower-level representations. For example, without
knowing the ground-truth structure, our proposed model learns to process
logical expression through composing representations of variables and operators
into representations of expressions according to its syntactic structure. On
the other hand, the dependency inductive bias encourages models to find the
latent relations between entities in the input sequence. For natural language,
the latent relations are usually modeled as a directed dependency graph, where
a word has exactly one parent node and zero or several children nodes. After
applying this constraint to a Transformer-like model, we find the model is
capable of inducing directed graphs that are close to human expert annotations,
and it also outperforms the standard transformer model on different tasks. We
believe that these experimental results demonstrate an interesting alternative
for the future development of deep learning models.

operating close to their limit of stability. Moreover, with the increasing
demand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure
power system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated.
Considering its significance in power system security, it is important to
suggest a different methodology for enhancing the transient stability,
considering uncertainties. Current deterministic industry practices of
transient stability assessment ignore the probabilistic nature of variables
(fault type, fault location, fault clearing time, etc.). These approaches
typically provide a cautious principle and can result in high-priced expansion
projects or operational limits. With the increasing system uncertainties and
widespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong inevitability to
incorporate risk in the traditional transient stability analysis. Accurate
assessment of transient stability in a modern power network is becoming a
strict requirement both in planning and in real-time operation, due to the
increasingly intricate dynamics of a power system. Further, increasing sources
of uncertainty in forecast state and in the reaction to faults highly implies
the implementation of risk-based approach in assessing transient stability.
Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of risk-based transient
stability in power networks and the accompanying research. It is believed that
this review can be an inception for researchers in the domain of power system
planning and security.

along structures embedded within another medium; a mismatch in wavespeeds often
leads to leakage of energy from the waveguide, or interface, into the medium,
which consequently attenuates the guided wave. The accurate and efficient
identification of theoretical solutions for leaky waves is a key requirement
for the choices of modes and frequencies required for non-destructive
evaluation inspection techniques. We choose a typical situation to study: an
elastic waveguide with a fluid on either side. Historically, leaky waves are
identified via root-finding methods that have issues with conditioning, or,
numerical methods` that struggle with the exponential growth of solutions at
infinity. By building upon a spectral collocation method, we show how it can be
adjusted to find exponentially growing solutions, i.e. leaky waves, leading to
an accurate, fast and efficient identification of their dispersion properties.
The key concept required is a mapping, in the fluid region, that allows for
exponential growth of the physical solution at infinity, whilst the mapped
numerical setting decays. We illustrate this by studying leaky Lamb waves in an
elastic waveguide immersed between two different fluids and verify this using
the commercially available software Disperse.

A typical
problem of teleoperation is communication time delay which, together with
actuator saturation and environmental disturbance, can cause a vehicle
deviation from the target trajectory imposed by the human operator who imposes
to the vehicle a steering wheel angle reference and a speed/acceleration
reference. With predictive techniques, time-delay can be accounted at
sufficient extent. But, in presence of disturbances, due to the absence of
instantaneous haptic and visual feedback, human-operator steering command
transmitted to the the vehicle is unaccounted with disturbances observed by the

control, reference trajectory in the form of successive reference poses can be
transmitted instead of steering commands to the vehicle. We introduce this new

  failure to initiate treatment","Changes to Introduction and Abstract, minor changes to Methods",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: A common intercurrent event affecting many trials is when some
participants do not begin their assigned treatment. Many trials use a modified
intention-to-treat (mITT) approach, whereby participants who do not initiate
treatment are excluded from the analysis. However, it is not clear the estimand
being targeted by such an approach or the assumptions necessary for it to be
unbiased.
  Methods: We demonstrate that a mITT analysis which excludes participants who
do not begin treatment is estimating a principal stratum estimand (i.e. the
treatment effect in the subpopulation of participants who would begin
treatment, regardless of which arm they were assigned to). The mITT estimator
is unbiased for the principal stratum estimand under the assumption that the
intercurrent event is not affected by the assigned treatment arm, that is,
participants who initiate treatment in one arm would also do so in the other
arm.
  Results: We identify two key criteria in determining whether the mITT
estimator is likely to be unbiased: first, we must be able to measure the
participants in each treatment arm who experience the intercurrent event, and
second, the assumption that treatment allocation will not affect whether the
participant begins treatment must be reasonable. Most double-blind trials will
satisfy these criteria, and we provide an example of an open-label trial where
these criteria are likely to be satisfied as well.
  Conclusions: A modified intention-to-treat analysis which excludes
participants who do not begin treatment can be an unbiased estimator for the
principal stratum estimand. Our framework can help identify when the
assumptions for unbiasedness are likely to hold, and thus whether modified
intention-to-treat is appropriate or not.

ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale
solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and
implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of
an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns
surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations
address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at
AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and
(moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these
perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs.
Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential
vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common
arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within
the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we
identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor
of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  America has one of the best medical systems in the world. The medical
treatment care options offered by the medical system make it sophisticated.
However, many American patients are not receiving health care on a regular
basis, and at the same time, they cannot afford it. Also, the current medical
system has many flaws such as high medical treatment costs and lack of doctors
to accommodate many patients. This paper presents the principles of medical
artificial intelligence called the knowledge based system. Doctors can remotely
check and monitor their patients health data, medical history, how and what
medical tests were done, and the lab results. The patients have access to
detailed health information online and do not need to make an appointment with
doctors to check their health on a daily basis. One doctor can check many
patients simultaneously online (when medical centers are understaffed) and do
not need to spend a lot of time with patients. Thus, doctors save more money
for patients, because patients will no longer be transporting to medical
centers to receive routine health check-ups. Patients do not need to overpay
for their insurance because they will have access to the knowledge-based
system, and the system will save the patients money to have their health
checked and reduce the number of unnecessary medical exams. This paper
undertakes a brief overview of research work done in a knowledge based system
rule based expert systems in the field of medical practices.

cosmological constant is a regular black hole. The main goal of this manuscript
is to investigate the geometric structures in terms of curvature conditions
admitted by this spacetime. It is found that this spacetime is pseudosymmetric
and possess several kinds of pseudosymmetries. Also, it is a manifold of
pseudosymmetry Weyl curvature and the difference tensor C.R-R.C linearly
depends on the tensors Q(g;C) and Q(S;C). It is interesting to note that such a
spacetime is weakly generalized recurrent manifold and satisfies special
recurrent like structure. Further, it is an Einstein manifold of level 2 and
Roter type. The energy momentum tensor of this spacetime is pseudosymmetric and
finally a worthy comparison between the geometric properties of Bardeen
spacetime and Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime is given.

  Evaluation Methods into an Interactive and Multi-dimensional Benchmark",,,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, Explainable AI (xAI) attracted a lot of attention as various
countries turned explanations into a legal right. xAI allows for improving
models beyond the accuracy metric by, e.g., debugging the learned pattern and
demystifying the AI's behavior. The widespread use of xAI brought new
challenges. On the one hand, the number of published xAI algorithms underwent a
boom, and it became difficult for practitioners to select the right tool. On
the other hand, some experiments did highlight how easy data scientists could
misuse xAI algorithms and misinterpret their results. To tackle the issue of
comparing and correctly using feature importance xAI algorithms, we propose
Compare-xAI, a benchmark that unifies all exclusive functional testing methods
applied to xAI algorithms. We propose a selection protocol to shortlist
non-redundant functional tests from the literature, i.e., each targeting a
specific end-user requirement in explaining a model. The benchmark encapsulates
the complexity of evaluating xAI methods into a hierarchical scoring of three
levels, namely, targeting three end-user groups: researchers, practitioners,
and laymen in xAI. The most detailed level provides one score per test. The
second level regroups tests into five categories (fidelity, fragility,
stability, simplicity, and stress tests). The last level is the aggregated
comprehensibility score, which encapsulates the ease of correctly interpreting
the algorithm's output in one easy to compare value. Compare-xAI's interactive
user interface helps mitigate errors in interpreting xAI results by quickly
listing the recommended xAI solutions for each ML task and their current
limitations. The benchmark is made available at

enthusiasts over the past three years. These currencies are celebrated for
their security and speedy transactions in a modern era of digital commerce.
Bitcoin was the first of these currencies to gain a large advantage over
subsequent iterations. Bitcoin was first conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto who
mentioned the concept of a cryptocurrency in his paper titled Bitcoin. It
featured new concepts such as proof of work and transactions which utilized
hash based encryption. One particular alternative cryptocurrency is known as
Litecoin. Backed by a memory intensive algorithm known as Scrypt, many
cryptocurrency enthusiasts have decided to celebrate this particular coin.
Scrypt expands on Bitcoin's proof of work algorithm by adding the amount of
work it takes to commit a transaction within the Litecoin network. Scrypt
forces more work on the device that is being used to perform the algorithm by
making frequent memory requests. This makes it difficult to create specialized
hardware to create new coins and to commit transactions due to the nature of
memory intensive applications.

  Review of Interstellar [UCM Bachelor Thesis, 2015]","29 pages, in Spanish language, 2015",,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster, Interstellar, has supposed a
revolution not only from a cinematographically viewpoint, but also in the
relation between current spectators and science. The aim of this report is to
analyze some features presented in Interstellar. Basic Newtonian Physics shows
how a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole like Gargantua must travel at
0.25 the speed of light in order to be in a stable orbit. Thus, this orbit is
too far from the black hole to explain the time dilatation observed in Miller's
Planet and an the orbit that could explain such a time dilatation is much more
smaller that Roche's limit. Furthermore, I explain how enormous waves as
Miller's Planet ones could appear by studying the tidal potential created by
Gargantua, obtaining a wave of 200 kilometers high, but better results are
obtained by considering a series of tsunamis in Miller's Planet. Finally, I
present an explanation to Mann's Planet ice-covered landscape in which Snowball
Earth Theory plays a fundamental role. No difficult General Relativity formulas
will be used in order to make easier the comprehension of the research.

$A = l_P^2 \, (4 \ln 2) \, N$, and the associated degrees of freedom are finite
in number and of fermionic nature. We then investigate general aspects of the
entropy, $S_{BH}$, our main focus being black-hole self-similarity. We first
find a two-to-one map between the black hole's configurations and the ordered
partitions of the integer $N$. Hence we construct from there a composition law
between the sub-parts making the whole configuration space. This gives meaning
to black hole self-similarity, entirely within a single description, as a
phenomenon stemming from the well known self-similarity of the ordered
partitions of $N$. Finally, we compare the above to the well-known results on
the subleading (quantum) corrections, that necessarily require different
(quantum) statistical weights for the various configurations.
