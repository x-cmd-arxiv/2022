bijective maps on permutations in which we identify and prove 122 instances of
the homomesy phenomenon. Homomesy occurs when the average value of a statistic
is the same on each orbit of a given map. The maps we investigate include the
Lehmer code rotation, the reverse, the complement, the Foata bijection, and the
Kreweras complement. The statistics studied relate to familiar notions such as
inversions, descents, and permutation patterns, and also more obscure
constructs. Beside the many new homomesy results, we discuss our research
method, in which we used SageMath to search the FindStat combinatorial
statistics database to identify potential homomesies.

science. However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the
transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we
introduce Supervised Optimal Transport (sOT) that formulates a constrained
optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are
prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent
to an $l^1$ penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are
designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the
capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of
traditional OT in color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem
in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion
selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly
applicable to applications in which constrained transport plan is involved and
the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.

However, the time
and expense of obtaining ``gold standard'' human judgments limit the
availability of such data. Most applications incorporate full reference or
other similarity-based metrics (e.g. PESQ) that depend on a clean reference.
Researchers have relied on such metrics to evaluate and compare various
proposed methods, often concluding that small, measured differences imply one
is more effective than another. This paper demonstrates several practical
scenarios where similarity metrics fail to agree with human perception, because
they: (1) vary with clean references; (2) rely on attributes that humans factor
out when considering quality, and (3) are sensitive to imperceptible signal
level differences. In those scenarios, we show that no-reference metrics do not
suffer from such shortcomings and correlate better with human perception. We
conclude therefore that similarity serves as an unreliable proxy for audio
quality.

generalizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks.
However, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based

several inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation
boundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3)
inconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model

Extensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of

has shown greater capabilities in achieving near optimal performance and better
nature to iteratively cooperate with channel decoders. Aiming at real
applications, recent works mainly fall into the category of reducing the
complexity by simplified calculations, at the expense of performance sacrifice.
However, the complexity is still unsatisfactory with exponentially increasing
complexity or required exponentiation operations. Furthermore, due to the
inherent loopy structure, the existing BP detectors persistently encounter
error floor in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, which becomes even
worse with calculation approximation. This work aims at a revised BP detector,
named {Belief-selective Propagation (BsP)} detector by selectively utilizing
the \emph{trusted} incoming messages with sufficiently large \textit{a priori}
probabilities for updates. Two proposed strategies: symbol-based truncation
(ST) and edge-based simplification (ES) squeeze the complexity (orders lower
than the Original-BP), while greatly relieving the error floor issue over a
wide range of antenna and modulation combinations. For the $16$-QAM $8 \times
4$ MIMO system, the $\mathcal{B}(1,1)$ {BsP} detector achieves more than
$4$\,dB performance gain (@$\text{BER}=10^{-4}$) with roughly $4$ orders lower
complexity than the Original-BP detector. Trade-off between performance and
complexity towards different application requirement can be conveniently
obtained by configuring the ST and ES parameters.

imaging technique that allows for three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic
samples with decoupled illumination and detection paths. Although the selective
excitation scheme of such a microscope provides intrinsic optical sectioning
that minimizes out-of-focus fluorescence background and sample photodamage, it
is prone to light absorption and scattering effects, which results in uneven
illumination and striping artifacts in the images adversely. To tackle this
issue, in this paper, we propose a blind stripe artifact removal algorithm in
LSFM, called DeStripe, which combines a self-supervised spatio-spectral graph
neural network with unfolded Hessian prior. Specifically, inspired by the
desirable properties of Fourier transform in condensing striping information
into isolated values in the frequency domain, DeStripe firstly localizes the
potentially corrupted Fourier coefficients by exploiting the structural
difference between unidirectional stripe artifacts and more isotropic
foreground images. Affected Fourier coefficients can then be fed into a graph
neural network for recovery, with a Hessian regularization unrolled to further
ensure structures in the standard image space are well preserved. Since in
realistic, stripe-free LSFM barely exists with a standard image acquisition
protocol, DeStripe is equipped with a Self2Self denoising loss term, enabling
artifact elimination without access to stripe-free ground truth images.
Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DeStripe in
recovering corrupted biomarkers in LSFM with both synthetic and real stripe
artifacts.

demarcates voiced regions using a composite signal composed of different

e.g., quadrupedal robots; the tilt-rotor, a novel type of quadrotor with eight
inputs, is not one of them. While controlling the tilt-rotor relying on
feedback linearization, the tilting angles (inputs) are expected to change
over-intensively, which may not be expected in the application. To help
suppress the intensive change in the tilting angles, a gait plan procedure is
introduced to the tilt-rotor before feedback linearization. The tilting angles
are specified with time in advance by users rather than given by the control
rule. However, based on this scenario, the decoupling matrix in feedback
linearization can be singular for some attitudes, combinations of roll angle
and pitch angle. It hinders the further application of the feedback
linearization. With this concern, Two Color Map Theorem is established to
maximize the acceptable attitude region, where the combinations of roll and
pitch will give an invertible decoupling matrix. That theorem, however,
over-restricts the choice of the tilting angles, which can rule out some
feasible robust gaits. This paper gives the generalized Two Color Map Theorem;
all the robust gaits can be found based on this generalized theorem. The
robustness of three gaits that satisfy this generalized Two Color Map Theorem
(while violating Two Color Map Theorem) are analyzed. The results show that
Generalized Two Color Map Theorem completes the search for the robust gaits for

solar wind speed finding a range from $96-201$ kms$^{-1}$, and PSP measures the
solar wind plasma in situ, observing a radial speed of 219.34 kms$^{-1}$. We
find theoretically and observationally that the solar wind speed accelerates
rapidly within 3.3 -- 4 R$_\odot$, and then increases more gradually with
distance. Similarly, we find that the theoretical solar wind density is
consistent with the remotely and in situ observed solar wind density. The
normalized cross-helicity and normalized residual energy observed by PSP are
0.96 and -0.07, respectively, indicating that the slow solar wind is very
Alfv\'enic. The theoretical NI/slab results are very similar to PSP
measurements, which is a consequence of the highly magnetic field-aligned
radial flow ensuring that PSP can measure slab fluctuations and not 2D.
Finally, we calculate the theoretical 2D and slab turbulence pressure, finding
that the theoretical slab pressure is very similar to that observed by PSP.

operating frequency (hundreds Hertz). Such high rate is unnecessary for most
platforms, specifically for low dynamics AUVs. In this work, a supervised
machine learning based adaptive tuning scheme to select the proper INS step
size is proposed. To that end, a velocity error bound is defined, allowing the
INS/DVL or the INS/GNSS to act in a sub-optimal working conditions, and yet
minimize the computational load. Results from simulations and field experiment
show the benefits of using the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed
framework can be applied to any other fusion scenarios between any type of
sensors or platforms.

nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). This study is made possible thanks to the
recently introduced adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath (adQTB) simulation technique
which computational cost is comparable to classical molecular dynamics. The
flexible Q-AMOEBA model conserves the initial AMOEBA functional form, with an
intermolecular potential including an atomic multipole description of
electrostatic interactions (up to quadrupole), a polarization contribution
based on the Thole interaction model and a buffered 14-7 potential to model van
der Waals interactions. It has been obtained by using a Force Balance fitting
strategy including high-level quantum chemistry reference energies and selected
condensed phase properties targets. The final Q-AMOEBA model is shown to
accurately reproduce both gas phase and condensed phase properties, notably
improving the original AMOEBA water model. This development allows the fine
study of NQEs on water liquid phase properties such as the average H-O-H angle
compared to its gas phase equilibrium value, isotope effects etc... Q-AMOEBA
also provides improved infrared spectroscopy prediction capabilities compared
to AMOEBA03. Overall, we show that the impact of NQEs depends on the underlying
model functional form and on the associated strength of hydrogen bonds. Since
adQTB simulations can be performed at near classical computational cost using
the Tinker-HP package, Q-AMOEBA can be extended to organic molecules, proteins
and nucleic acids opening the possibility for the large scale study of the
importance of NQEs in biophysics.

rarely been studied. In this study, a generalized probabilistic monitoring
model (GPMM) is developed with both random and sequential data. Since GPMM can
be reduced to various probabilistic linear models under specific restrictions,
it is adopted to analyze the connections between different monitoring methods.
Using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of GPMM are
estimated for both random and sequential cases. Based on the obtained model
parameters, statistics are designed for monitoring different aspects of the
process system. Besides, the distributions of these statistics are rigorously
derived and proved, so that the control limits can be calculated accordingly.
After that, contribution analysis methods are presented for identifying faulty

between monitoring models based on classical multivariate methods and their
corresponding probabilistic graphic models is further investigated. The
conclusions of this study are verified using a numerical example and the
Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Experimental results illustrate that the
proposed monitoring statistics are subject to their corresponding
distributions, and they are equivalent to statistics in classical deterministic

different environmental conditions to find applicable configurations for the
suppression of electrical breakdowns in TMBi at room temperature. A simple
glass cell with two electrodes filled with TMBi was constructed and tested
under different operation conditions. Working at the vapour pressure of TMBi at
room temperature of about 40 mbar and electric fields of up to 20 kV/cm in
presence of a small oxygen contamination we found the formation of a discharge
channel in the liquid and a steady increase in the current. Further reduction
of pressure by pumping caused the TMBi to boil and a spontaneous combustion.
Eliminating the oxygen contamination led the TMBi under the same condition to
only decompose. When operating the setup under an argon atmosphere of 1 bar we
did not observe breakdowns of the electrical potential up to field strengths of
20 kV/cm. Still, in presence of a small oxygen contamination fluctuating
currents in the nA range were observed, but no decomposition or combustion. We
conclude from our experiments that TMBi at room temperature in a pure argon

electric field strengths of 20 kV/cm, presumably because the formation of
gaseous TMBi was prevented.

analysis of the Orion B molecular cloud has confirmed that, although turbulent
modes vary locally and at different scales within the cloud, the dominant
solenoidal turbulence is compatible with its low star formation rate. This
evidence points to inter-and intra-cloud fluctuations of the solenoidal modes
being an agent for the variability of star formation efficiency. We present a

hypothesis that solenoidal modes prevent or slow down the collapse of dense
cores. In addition, the relative power in the solenoidal modes of turbulence
(solenoidal fraction) appears to be higher in the Inner Galaxy declining with a
shallow gradient with increasing Galactocentric distance. Outside the Inner
Galaxy, the slowly, monotonically declining values suggest that the solenoidal

Final version, published at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite extensive theoretical work on biologically plausible learning rules,
clear evidence about whether and how such rules are implemented in the brain
has been difficult to obtain. We consider biologically plausible supervised-
and reinforcement-learning rules and ask whether changes in network activity
during learning can be used to determine which learning rule is being used.
Supervised learning requires a credit-assignment model estimating the mapping
from neural activity to behavior, and, in a biological organism, this model
will inevitably be an imperfect approximation of the ideal mapping, leading to
a bias in the direction of the weight updates relative to the true gradient.
Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, requires no credit-assignment model
and tends to make weight updates following the true gradient direction. We
derive a metric to distinguish between learning rules by observing changes in
the network activity during learning, given that the mapping from brain to
behavior is known by the experimenter. Because brain-machine interface (BMI)
experiments allow for precise knowledge of this mapping, we model a
cursor-control BMI task using recurrent neural networks, showing that learning
rules can be distinguished in simulated experiments using only observations
that a neuroscience experimenter would plausibly have access to.

free of any causality problems. However, two issues related to gravitino
propagation were recently uncovered in specific supergravities with nonlinear
supersymmetry. One of them concerns potential acausality/superluminality,
whereas the second one arises from the vanishing of the sound speed at specific
points during inflation. The former is famously related to positivity
constraints on specific EFT operators, derived from dispersion relations on the
energy-growing part of scattering amplitudes, and indeed we show that
subluminality constraints for the gravitino are related via the equivalence
theorem to positivity bounds in low-energy goldstino actions. However, the
former are stronger, in the sense that they apply to functions of the scalar
fields not only in the ground state, but for any field values such as those
scanned by time-dependent solutions, unlike bounds derived from $2\to 2$
scattering amplitudes in the vacuum. We also argue that nontrivial causality
constraints arise only in the case where nonlinear supersymmetry in the matter
sector is encoded into superfield constraints which do not seem to arise from
microscopic two-derivative lagrangians, in particular for the orthogonal
constraint used to build minimal models of inflation in supergravity. This
allows us to propose simple alternatives which maintain the minimality of the
spectra and are causal in all points of the theory parameter space. We also
discuss minimal supergravity models of inflation along these lines.

in protoplanetary disks such as rings and gaps, which do not always correlate

planets could affect the radial drift of dust, it potentially forms these dust
substructures in disks. We investigate the potential of gas flow induced by
low-mass planets to sculpt the rings and gaps in the dust profiles. We first
perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, which resolve the local
gas flow past a planet. We then calculate the trajectories of dust influenced
by the planet-induced gas flow. Finally, we compute the steady-state dust
surface density by incorporating the influences of the planet-induced gas flow
into a one-dimensional dust advection-diffusion model. The outflow of the gas
toward the outside of the planetary orbit inhibits the radial drift of dust,
leading to dust accumulation (the dust ring). The outflow toward the inside of
the planetary orbit enhances the inward drift of dust, causing dust depletion
around the planetary orbit (the dust gap). Under weak turbulence ($\alpha_{\rm
diff}\lesssim10^{-4}$, where $\alpha_{\rm diff}$ is the turbulence strength
parameter), the gas flow induced by the planet with $\gtrsim1\,M_{\oplus}$
(Earth mass) generates the dust ring and gap in the distribution of small dust
grains ($\lesssim1$ cm) with the radial extent of $\sim1\text{--}10$ times gas
scale height around the planetary orbit without creating a gas gap and pressure
bump. The gas flow induced by low-mass, non-gas-gap-opening planets can be
considered a possible origin of the observed dust substructures in disks. Our
results may be helpful to explain the disks whose dust substructures were found
not to correlate with those of the gas.

sarcasm and irony commonly used in vaccine-related discourses, we integrate
into the framework the recent posts of a user's social network neighbours to
help detect the user's genuine attitude. Based on our annotated dataset from
Twitter, the models instantiated from our framework can increase the
performance of attitude extraction by up to 23% compared to state-of-the-art

complex tasks can be quite challenging without a high-fidelity simulation
environment. In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with
simplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL
policy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another
possibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data.
However, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need
impractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage

from limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through
imperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches?
In this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online

well as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O

automatically learn the existence of sub-graph patterns in brain graphs, which
is also the state-of-the-art brain graph representation learning method by this

patterns, which may render the learned representations to be useless for many
cases. In this paper, we propose a new Iso-CapsNet (Isomorphic Capsule Net)
model by introducing the graph isomorphic capsules for effective brain graph
representation learning. Based on the capsule dynamic routing, besides the
subgraph pattern existence confidence scores, Iso-CapsNet can also learn other
sub-graph rich properties, including position, size and orientation, for
calculating the class-wise digit capsules. We have compared Iso-CapsNet with
both classic and state-of-the-art brain graph representation approaches with
extensive experiments on four brain graph benchmark datasets. The experimental
results also demonstrate the effectiveness of Iso-CapsNet, which can
out-perform the baseline methods with significant improvements.

transmission incorporating diffusive behavior, or interactions between

character of reaction-diffusion systems, which allow familiar techniques to be
applied. The focus is largely on the appearance of soliton-like moving fronts
that spread infection to previously uninfected regions. Near threshold
dynamical critical behavior and a degree of universality are revealed.
Extending two of the models to include a simple nonlinearity in the strength of

find the possibility of static coexistence between spatial regions with
different levels of infection and an analogy with first-order transitions in

critical information about their possible sizes, compositions, and evolution
using a recently-derived set of optical constants. The complex indices of
refraction of nano-diamonds and their optical properties (the efficiency
factors Qext, Qsca, Qabs, and Qpr) were used to determine their temperatures,
lifetimes, and drift velocities as a function of their radii (0.5-100 nm),
composition (surface hydrogenation and irradiated states), and distance from
the central stars in circumstellar regions. The nano-diamond temperature
profiles were determined for the stars HR 4049, Elias 1, and HD 97048 in the
optically-thin limit. The results indicate that large nano-diamonds (a = 30 -
100 nm) are the hottest and therefore the least resistant in the inner disc
regions (~ 10-50 AU), while small (a < 10 nm) fully-hydrogenated nano-diamonds
remain significantly cooler in these same regions. We discuss these results
within the context of nano-diamond formation in circumstellar discs. Large
nano-diamonds, being the hottest, are most affected by the stellar radiation

move them out of harm's way. The nano-diamonds that best survive and therefore

scenes are collections of such acoustic events in no specific temporal order.
Given this natural linkage between events and scenes, a common belief is that
the ability to classify events must help in the classification of scenes. This
has led to several efforts attempting to do well on Acoustic Event Tagging
(AET) and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) using a multi-task network.
However, in these efforts, improvement in one task does not guarantee an
improvement in the other, suggesting a tension between ASC and AET. It is
unclear if improvements in AET translates to improvements in ASC. We explore
this conundrum through an extensive empirical study and show that under certain
conditions, using AET as an auxiliary task in the multi-task network
consistently improves ASC performance. Additionally, ASC performance further
improves with the AET data-set size and is not sensitive to the choice of

improvement in ASC performance comes from the regularization effect of using
AET and not from the network's improved ability to discern between acoustic

in the case when the wave packet is Gaussian. We observe and characterize the
propagation of the impurity along the baths and the hopping between them. We
also analyze the dynamics of the bath density and momentum density (i.e. the

Lokshtanov and Saurabh [J.ACM 2019], by establishing a connection between
parameterized approximation and exponential-time approximation algorithms for
monotone subset minimization problems. In a monotone subset minimization
problem the input implicitly describes a non-empty set family over a universe
of size $n$ which is closed under taking supersets. The task is to find a
minimum cardinality set in this family. Broadly speaking, we use approximate
monotone local search to show that a parameterized $\alpha$-approximation
algorithm that runs in $c^k \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k$ is the solution
size, can be used to derive an $\alpha$-approximation randomized algorithm that
runs in $d^n \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $d$ is the unique value in $d \in
(1,1+\frac{c-1}{\alpha})$ such that
$\mathcal{D}(\frac{1}{\alpha}\|\frac{d-1}{c-1})=\frac{\ln c}{\alpha}$ and
$\mathcal{D}(a \|b)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This running time
matches that of Fomin et al. for $\alpha=1$, and is strictly better when
$\alpha >1$, for any $c > 1$. Furthermore, we also show that this result can be
derandomized at the expense of a sub-exponential multiplicative factor in the
running time.
  We demonstrate the potential of approximate monotone local search by deriving
new and faster exponential approximation algorithms for Vertex Cover,
$3$-Hitting Set, Directed Feedback Vertex Set, Directed Subset Feedback Vertex
Set, Directed Odd Cycle Transversal and Undirected Multicut. For instance, we
get a $1.1$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover with running time $1.114^n

consumer behavior but also producer incentives. Producers seek to create
content that will be shown by the recommendation algorithm, which can impact
both the diversity and quality of their content. In this work, we investigate
the resulting supply-side equilibria in personalized content recommender
systems. We model users and content as $D$-dimensional vectors, the
recommendation algorithm as showing each user the content with highest dot
product, and producers as maximizing the number of users who are recommended
their content minus the cost of production. Two key features of our model are
that the producer decision space is multi-dimensional and the user base is
heterogeneous, which contrasts with classical low-dimensional models.
  Multi-dimensionality and heterogeneity create the potential for
specialization, where different producers create different types of content at
equilibrium. Using a duality argument, we derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for whether specialization occurs: these conditions depend on the
extent to which users are heterogeneous and to which producers can perform well
on all dimensions at once without incurring a high cost. Then, we characterize
the distribution of content at equilibrium in concrete settings with two
populations of users. Lastly, we show that specialization can enable producers
to achieve positive profit at equilibrium, which means that specialization can
reduce the competitiveness of the marketplace. At a conceptual level, our
analysis of supply-side competition takes a step towards elucidating how
personalized recommendations shape the marketplace of digital goods, and
towards understanding what new phenomena arise in multi-dimensional competitive
settings.

minimum number of pairwise edge disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs of $G$ so

bp(G) \leq n - \alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$ is the maximum size of an

(ML) models. It proves its value not only in classical ML but also for deep
learning. Ensembles enhance the quality and trustworthiness of ML solutions,
and allow uncertainty estimation. However, they come at a price: training
ensembles of deep learning models eat a huge amount of computational resources.
  A snapshot ensembling collects models in the ensemble along a single training
path. As it runs training only one time, the computational time is similar to
the training of one model. However, the quality of models along the training
path is different: typically, later models are better if no overfitting occurs.
So, the models are of varying utility.
  Our method improves snapshot ensembling by selecting and weighting ensemble
members along the training path. It relies on training-time likelihoods without
looking at validation sample errors that standard stacking methods do.

When $\mathbf{v}$ represents pseudoscalar meson fields, the classical limit
corresponds to $\langle 0|\eta|0\rangle \rightarrow \eta \rightarrow 0$ and
yields the cyclic structure $ U = \left\{ \left[ \tfrac{1}{3} \left( 1 + 2 \cos

tidal disruption, causing periodic flares. Inspired by the recent discovery of
the periodic nuclear transient ASASSN-14ko, a promising candidate for a
repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), we study the tidal deformation of stars
approaching SMBHs on eccentric orbits. With both analytical and hydrodynamics
methods, we show the overall tidal deformation of a star is similar to that in
a parabolic orbit provided that the eccentricity is above a critical value.
This allows one to make use of existing simulation libraries from parabolic
encounters to calculate the mass fallback rate in eccentric TDEs. We find the
flare structures of eccentric TDEs show a complicated dependence on both the
SMBH mass and the orbital period. For stars orbiting SMBHs with relatively
short periods, we predict significantly shorter-lived duration flares than
those in parabolic TDEs, which can be used to predict repeating events if the
mass of the SMBH can be independently measured. Using an adiabatic mass loss
model, we study the flare evolution over multiple passages, and show the
evolved stars can survive many more passages than main sequence stars. We apply
this theoretical framework to the repeating TDE candidate ASASSN-14ko and
suggest that its recurrent flares originate from a moderately massive
($M\gtrsim 1 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), extended ($\approx$ a few $\mathrm{R_\odot}$),
evolved star on a grazing, bound orbit around the SMBH. Future hydrodynamics
simulations of multiple tidal interactions will enable realistic models on the

a fleet of electric autonomous vehicles to provide ride-sharing services for

the classical DARP in two aspects: (i) a weighted-sum objective that minimizes
both total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of
electric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper
presents a highly-efficient labeling algorithm, which is integrated into Column
Generation (CG) to solve the E-ADARP. To handle (i), we introduce a
fragment-based representation of paths. A novel approach is invoked to abstract
fragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality. We then
construct a new graph that preserves all feasible routes of the original graph
by enumerating all feasible fragments, abstracting them to arcs, and connecting
them with each other, depots, and recharging stations in a feasible way. On the
new graph, partial recharging (ii) is tackled exactly by tailored Resource

pave the way for a powerful labeling algorithm that ensures
excess-user-ride-time optimality in label extension. In the computational

(Texture Recovering Image Translation Network): an unsupervised, end-to-end,
stateless sim2real algorithm that leverages the underlying 3D geometry of input
scenes by generating realistic-looking learnable neural textures. By settling
on a particular texture for the objects in a scene, we ensure consistency
between frames statelessly. Unlike previous algorithms, TRITON is not limited
to camera movements -- it can handle the movement of objects as well, making it
useful for downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation.

quasars has been used to derive quasar distances and to build a Hubble diagram
at redshifts up to $z\sim$ 7. This cosmological application is based on the
assumption of independence of the relation on redshift and luminosity. We want
to test the reliability of this hypothesis by studying the spectroscopic
properties of high-redshift quasars in the X-ray and UV bands. We performed a
one-by-one analysis of a sample of 130 quasars at $z>$ 2.5 with high-quality
X-ray and UV spectroscopic observations. We found that not only the X-ray to UV
correlation still holds at these redshifts, but its intrinsic dispersion is as
low as 0.12 dex (previous works reached 0.20$-$0.22 dex). For a sample of
quasars at $z\sim$ 3 with particularly high-quality observations the dispersion
further drops to 0.09 dex, a value entirely accountable for by intrinsic
variability and source geometry effects. The composite spectra of these
quasars, in both the X-rays and the UV, do not show any difference with respect
to the average spectra of quasars at lower redshifts. The absence of any
spectral difference between high- and low-$z$ quasars and the tightness of the
X-ray to UV relation suggests that no evolutionary effects are present in the
relation. Therefore, it can be safely employed to derive quasar distances.
Under this assumption, we obtain a measurement of the luminosity distance at
$z\sim$ 3 with 15 % uncertainty, and in a 4$\sigma$ tension with the
concordance model.

successfully used to characterize light curves as part of a supervised machine
learning framework to classify stellar variability. We explore the behavior of
the multiscale entropy in detail by studying its algorithmic properties in a
stellar variability context and by linking it with traditional astronomical
time series analysis methods. We subsequently use the multiscale entropy as the
basis for an interpretable clustering framework that can distinguish hybrid
pulsators with both p- and g-modes from stars with only p-mode pulsations, such
as $\delta$ Sct stars, or from stars with only g-mode pulsations, such as
$\gamma$ Dor stars. We find that the multiscale entropy is a powerful tool for
capturing variability patterns in stellar light curves. The multiscale entropy
provides insights into the pulsation structure of a star and reveals how short-
and long-term variability interact with each other based on time-domain
information only. We also show that the multiscale entropy is correlated to the
frequency content of a stellar signal and in particular to the near-core
rotation rates of g-mode pulsators. We find that our new clustering framework
can successfully identify the hybrid pulsators with both p- and g-modes in sets
of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars, respectively. The benefit of our
clustering framework is that it is unsupervised. It therefore does not require
previously labeled data and hence is not biased by previous knowledge.

presence of dark radiation in the early Universe is tightly constrained by
current and upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. We update
bounds on MCPs from current measurements of $N_{\rm eff}$ and show that future
CMB experiments will be able to rule out or discover the extended MCP model
invoked to explain the EDGES anomaly. Our analysis of the gauged $B-L$ model
goes beyond previous studies by including quantum-statistical and

density. We also develop a number of approximations and techniques for

an indication of stochastic gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings that
formed during a primordial phase transition near the Grand Unification energy
scale. Unfortunately, known probes of cosmic strings, namely the Cosmic
Microwave Background anisotropies and string lensing of extragalactic galaxies,
are not sensitive enough for low string tensions of $G\mu = 10^{-10}-10^{-7}$
that are needed to explain this putative signal. We show that strong
gravitational lensing of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by cosmic strings is a
potentially unambiguous avenue to probe that range of string tension values.
The image pair of string lensing are expected to have identical magnification
factor and parity, and have a typical time delay of $\sim
10^2\,\,(G\,\mu/10^{-8})^2$ seconds. The unique spectral fingerprint of each
FRB, as well as the possibility to detect correlations in the time series of
the electric field of the radio waves, will enable verification of the string
lensing interpretation. Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations
can spatially resolve the image pair and provide a lower bound on the string
tension based on the image separation. We calculate the FRB lensing rate as a
function of FRB detection number for several different models of the FRB
redshift distribution. We find that a survey detecting $\sim 10^5$ FRBs, in
line with estimates for the detection rate of the forthcoming survey CHORD, can
uncover a strong lensing event for a string tension of $G\mu \simeq 10^{-7}$.
Larger FRB surveys, such as Phase 2 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), have
the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity on the string tension to
$G\mu \simeq 10^{-9}$.

amplitudes with many quantum degrees of freedom. In this paper we sketch a
proposal for a ``hybrid algorithm'' that would use both the full quantum
amplitude and its asymptotic approximation in the relevant regimes. As a first
step towards the algorithm, we derive a new representation of the partition
function where each spin-foam vertex possesses its own coherent data, such that
it can be individually asymptotically approximated. We do this through the
implementation of gluing constraints between vertices, which we study
numerically. We further derive an asymptotic expression for the constraints for
arbitrary boundary data, including data for which there are no critical points.
From this new representation we conjecture an intermediate quasi-geometric
spin-foam regime describing a superposition of semi-classical vertices glued in
a non-matching way via the gluing constraints.

open clusters, we develop an empirical gyrochronology relation of angular
momentum evolution that is valid for stars with ages 10-1000 Myr. Excluding
stars rotating faster than 2 days, which we find are predominantly binaries, we
achieve a typical age precision of ~0.2-0.3 dex and improving at older ages.
Importantly, these empirical relations apply to not only FGK-type stars but
also M-type stars, due to the angular momentum distribution being much
smoother, simpler, continuous and monotonic as compared to the rotation period
distribution. As a result, we are also able to begin tracing in fine detail the

We characterize the stellar variability amplitudes of the cool stars as

fractions. We also identify pulsating variables among the hotter stars in the

scales required to resolve the initiation mechanism are not easily reached in

detonation wave fronts as material undergoes simultaneous compression and
stretching from tidal forces. We consider 0.15 and 0.6 solar mass white dwarf

High spatial resolution elucidates the manner and conditions leading to
thermonuclear detonation, linking the initiation sequence to stellar
composition and tidal strength. All of our models suffer sustained detonations
triggered by a combination of adiabatic compression, mild thermonuclear
preconditioning, and collisional heating, in degrees depending primarily on

$T\sim6.8$ keV. The radio emission shows a rich diversity, having (i) two large
diffuse sources of ultra-steep spectrum (USS), extending to opposite
extremities of the ICM, each associated with an X-ray brightness discontinuity
(cold front), (ii) a bright radio-double of size $\sim55$ kpc coinciding with
the central BCG, and (iii) a diffuse radio source, likely a mini-halo of size
$\sim110$~kpc around the BCG which possesses a huge ellipsoidal stellar halo of

260 Myr) USS sources in a cool-core cluster, makes it a very rare system. These
USS sources are probably radio lobes from a previous episode of jet activity in
the BCG, driven buoyantly towards the outskirts of the X-ray halo, thereby
creating the cold fronts. A deeper radio image of this cluster may provide a

this paper, we introduce BayesCal: a novel solution to the sky-model
incompleteness problem in interferometric calibration, designed to enable high
fidelity data calibration. The BayesCal data model supplements the a priori
known component of the forward model of the sky with a statistical model for
the missing and uncertain flux contribution to the data, constrained by a prior
on the power in the model. We demonstrate how the parameters of this model can
be marginalised out analytically, reducing the dimensionality of the parameter
space to be sampled from and allowing one to sample directly from the posterior
probability distribution of the calibration parameters. Additionally, we show
how physically motivated priors derived from theoretical and measurement-based
constraints on the spectral smoothness of the instrumental gains can be used to
constrain the calibration solutions. In a companion paper, we apply this
algorithm to simulated observations with a HERA-like array and demonstrate that
it enables up to four orders of magnitude suppression of power in spurious

branch stars observed by Gaia and TESS with kinematics suggesting a high
likelihood of extragalactic origin were searched for planet transits. Transit
injection-recovery tests were performed to measure the sensitivity of the TESS
data and completeness of the transit search. Injected signals of planets larger
than Jupiter with orbital periods of 10 days or less were recovered in
$\approx$44% of cases. Although no planet transits were detected in this
sample, we find an upper limit on planet occurrence of 0.52% for hot Jupiters,
consistent with previous studies of planet occurrence around similar host
stars. As stars in the halo tend to be lower metallicity, and short period
giant planet occurrence tends to be strongly correlated with stellar
metallicity, we predict that relative to the Galactic disk population, a
smaller fraction of halo stars will host planets detectable by transit surveys.
Thus, applying the known planet occurrence trends to potential planet detection
around halo stars, we predict $\gtrsim$7,000 stars must be searched with
similar cadence and precision as the stars studied here before a detection of a
planet of extragalactic origin is likely. This may be possible with future data

greater than a few meters in diameter. They are not commonly recognized for

size-dependent tensile fracture, and the role of gravity in lofting spalled

discovered around $\sim 1$ percent of local field stars. The inward migration
necessary to produce HJs may be `low eccentricity', due to torques in the
primordial disc, or `high eccentricity' (HEM). The latter involves exciting
high orbital eccentricity, allowing sufficiently close passages with the host
star to raise circularising tides in the planet. We present an analytic
framework for quantifying the role of dynamical encounters in high density
environments during HEM. We show that encounters can enhance or suppress HEM,
depending on the local stellar density and the initial semi-major axis $a_0$.
For moderate densities, external perturbations can excite large eccentricities
that allow a planet to circularise over the stellar lifetime. At extremely high
densities, these perturbations can instead result in tidal disruption of the
planet, thus yielding no HJ. This may explain the apparent excess of HJs in M67
compared with their local field star abundance versus their apparent deficit in
47 Tuc. Applying our analytic framework, we demonstrate that for an initial
massive planet population similar to the field, the expected HJ occurrence rate
in 47 Tuc is $f_\mathrm{HJ}=2.2\times 10^{-3}$, which remains consistent with
present constraints. Future large (sample sizes $\gtrsim 10^5$) or sensitive
transit surveys of stars in globular clusters are required to refute the
hypothesis that the initial planet population is similar to the solar
neighbourhood average. Non-detection in such surveys would have broad
consequences for planet formation theory, implying planet formation rates in
globular clusters must be suppressed across a wide range of $a_0$.

This has led to a new research direction in parameter-efficient transfer

the same modality (e.g., image understanding) of the pre-trained model. This
creates a limit because in some specific modalities, (e.g., video

enables a pre-trained image model without temporal knowledge to reason about

approximately 20 times fewer updated parameters compared to previous work.
Extensive experiments on video action recognition tasks show that our

  Simulation Results by a Random Walk Model",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Diffusion in a multidimensional energy surface with minima and barriers is a
problem of importance in statistical mechanics and also has wide applications,
such as protein folding. To understand it in such a system, we carry out theory
and simulations of a tagged particle moving on a two-dimensional periodic
potential energy surface, both in the presence and absence of noise. Langevin
dynamics simulations at multiple temperatures are carried out to obtain the
diffusion coefficient of a solute particle. Friction is varied from zero to
large values. Diffusive motion emerges in the limit of long times, even in the
absence of noise, although the trajectory is found to remain correlated over a
long time. This correlation is manifested in correlated returns to the starting
minima following a scattering by surrounding maxima. Noise destroys this
correlation, induces chaos, and increases diffusion at small friction.
Diffusion thus exhibits a non-monotonic friction dependence at the intermediate
value of the damping, ultimately converging to our theoretically predicted
value. The latter is obtained by using the well-established relation between
diffusion and random walk. An excellent agreement is obtained between theory
and simulations in the high friction limit, but not so in the intermediate
regime. The rate of escape from one cell to another is obtained from the
multidimensional rate theory of Langer. We find that enhanced dimensionality
plays an important role. In order to quantify the effects of noise on the
potential-imposed coherence on the trajectories, we calculate the Lyapunov
exponent. At small friction values, the Lyapunov exponent mimics the friction
dependence of the rate.

self-diffusion coefficient. Here we show that in odd-diffusive systems, which
are characterized by diffusion tensors with antisymmetric elements, collisions
surprisingly can enhance the self-diffusion. In these systems, due to an
inherent curving effect, the motion of particles is facilitated, instead of
hindered by collisions leading to a mutual rolling effect. Using a geometric
model, we analytically predict the enhancement of the self-diffusion
coefficient with increasing density. This counterintuitive behaviour is
demonstrated in the archetypal odd-diffusive system of Brownian particles under
Lorentz force. We validate our findings by many body Brownian dynamics
simulations in dilute systems.

are shifted to form a honeycomb lattice together. Initially, the system is in a
layer-polarized Mott insulator at $\nu_T=1$. But with a displacement field, an
equal number of holes and electrons are doped into the two layers respectively
and they form inter-layer exciton condensation. Through mean field theory, we
find p$\pm$ip exciton condensation in a certain parameter regime, which leads
to a Chern insulator with Chern number $C=\pm 1$. The valleys are polarized due
to the kinetic energy instead of interaction. But the polarization in the two
layers can be either the same or opposite depending on small perturbations away
from a symmetric point. As a result, both valley polarized and inter-valley
coherent (IVC) Chern insulator phases are possible. The latter has the same
spin $S_z$ in the two layers.

the Borromean link network onto a lattice representation, we investigate the
percolation threshold of these networks, (the fraction of occupied nodes
required for a giant component), as well as the dissolution properties: the

occupied, slightly higher than the 59.27\% typical of a square lattice.
Compared to the dissolution of Hopf-linked networks, a dissolved Borromean

sequence variations between them. It is a powerful data structure for studying
multiple similar genomes. Sequence-to-graph alignment is an essential step for
the construction and the analysis of pan-genome graphs. However, existing
algorithms incur runtime proportional to the product of sequence length and
graph size, making them inefficient for aligning long sequences against large
graphs. Results: We propose the graph wavefront alignment algorithm (Gwfa), a
new method for aligning a sequence to a sequence graph. Although the worst-case
time complexity of Gwfa is the same as the existing algorithms, it is designed
to run faster for closely matching sequences, and its runtime in practice often
increases only moderately with the edit distance of the optimal alignment. On
four real datasets, Gwfa is up to four orders of magnitude faster than other
exact sequence-to-graph alignment algorithms. We also propose a graph pruning
heuristic on top of Gwfa, which can achieve an additional $\sim$10-fold speedup
on large graphs. Availability: Gwfa code is accessible at

populations in the local disk(s) and the bulge, focusing on minimising possible
systematic effects in the analysis. Methods. The stellar sample consists of 45
bulge and 291 local disk K-giants, observed with high-resolution optical
spectra. The abundances are determined by fitting synthetic spectra using the
SME-code. The disk sample is separated into thin- and thick-disk components
using a combination of abundances and kinematics. The cosmic origin of Mo is
investigated and discussed by comparing with previous published abundances of
Mo and the neutron-capture elements cerium (Ce) and europium (Eu). Results. We
determine reliable Mo abundances for 35 bulge and 282 disk giants with a
typical uncertainty of [Mo/Fe]~0.2 and ~0.1 dex for the bulge and disk,
respectively. Conclusions. We find that the bulge possibly is enhanced in
[Mo/Fe] compared to the thick disk, which we do not observe in either [Ce/Fe]
nor [Eu/Fe]. This might suggest a higher past star-formation rate in the bulge,
however, since we do not observe the bulge to be enhanced in [Eu/Fe], the
origin of the molybdenum enhancement is yet to be constrained. Although, the
scatter is large, we may be observing evidence of the p-process contributing to
the heavy element production in the chemical evolution of the bulge.

Given the null-hypothesis of no active voxels, the alternative hypothesis
states that there is at least one active voxel in a cluster. Hence, the larger
the cluster the less we know about where activation in the cluster is.
Rosenblatt et al. (2018) proposed a post-hoc inference method, All-resolutions
Inference (ARI), that addresses this paradox by estimating the number of active
voxels of any brain region. ARI allows users to choose arbitrary brain regions
and returns a simultaneous lower confidence bound of the true discovery
proportion (TDP) for each of them, retaining control of the family-wise error
rate. ARI does not, however, guide users to regions with high enough TDP. In
this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that outputs all maximal
supra-threshold clusters, for which ARI gives a TDP lower confidence bound that
is at least a chosen threshold, for any number of thresholds that need not be
chosen a priori nor all at once. After a preprocessing step in linearithmic
time, the algorithm only takes linear time in the size of its output. We
demonstrate the algorithm with an application to two fMRI datasets. For both
datasets, we found several clusters whose TDP confidently meets or exceeds a
given threshold in less than a second.

be used to infer the density and density profile of the medium through which
the shock is propagating. In long-duration (core-collapse) GRBs, the
circumstellar medium (CSM) is expected to resemble a wind-blown bubble, with a
termination shock separating the stellar wind and the interstellar medium
(ISM). A long standing problem is that flat density profiles, indicative of the
ISM, are often found at lower radii than expected for a massive star
progenitor. Furthermore, the presence of both wind-like environments at high
radii and ISM-like environments at low radii remains a mystery. In this paper,
we perform a 'CSM population synthesis' with long GRB progenitor stellar
evolution models. Analytic results for the evolution of wind blown bubbles are
adjusted through comparison with a grid of 2D hydrodynamical simulations.
Predictions for the emission radii, ratio of ISM to wind-like environments,
wind and ISM densities are compared with the largest sample of
afterglow-derived parameters yet compiled, which we make available for the
community. We find that high ISM densities around 1000/cm3 best reproduce
observations. If long GRBs instead occur in typical ISM densities of
approximately 1/cm3, then the discrepancy between theory and observations is
shown to persist at a population level. We discuss possible explanations for
the origin of variety in long GRB afterglows, and for the overall trend of CSM
modelling to over-predict the termination shock radius.

computer vision and graphics applications. A main challenge in this task is
that large texture-less areas in typical indoor scenes make existing methods
struggle to produce satisfactory reconstruction results. We propose a new
method, named NeuRIS, for high quality reconstruction of indoor scenes. The key
idea of NeuRIS is to integrate estimated normal of indoor scenes as a prior in
a neural rendering framework for reconstructing large texture-less shapes and,
importantly, to do this in an adaptive manner to also enable the reconstruction
of irregular shapes with fine details. Specifically, we evaluate the
faithfulness of the normal priors on-the-fly by checking the multi-view
consistency of reconstruction during the optimization process. Only the normal
priors accepted as faithful will be utilized for 3D reconstruction, which
typically happens in the regions of smooth shapes possibly with weak texture.
However, for those regions with small objects or thin structures, for which the
normal priors are usually unreliable, we will only rely on visual features of
the input images, since such regions typically contain relatively rich visual
features (e.g., shade changes and boundary contours). Extensive experiments
show that NeuRIS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction quality.

(eC) consists of the thermal response, $\Delta T$, of a material under strain
deformation. In this work, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of
the eC in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are presented over a large temperature span.
The efficiency of the CNTs as solid refrigerators is investigated by simulating
their eC in a model of refrigerator machine running under Otto-like
thermodynamic cycles (two adiabatic expansion/contraction plus two isochoric
heat exchange processes) operating at temperatures, $T_\mbox{O}$, ranging from
300 to 2000 K. The coefficient-of-performance (COP), defined as the ratio of
heat removed from the cold region to the total work performed by the system per
thermodynamic cycle, is calculated for each value of $T_\mbox{O}$. Our results
show a non-linear dependence of $\Delta T$ on $T_\mbox{O}$, reaching a minimum
value of about 30 K for $T_\mbox{O}$ between 500 and 600 K, then growing and
converging to a linear dependence on $T_\mbox{O}$ for large temperatures. The
COP of CNTs is shown to remain about the same and approximately equal to 8.
These results are shown to be weakly depend on CNT diameter and chirality but
not on length. The isothermal entropy change of the CNTs due to the eC is also
estimated and shown to depend non-linearly on $T_\mbox{O}$ values. These
results predict that CNTs can be considered versatile nanoscale solid

allocate limited resources to stochastically-generated sequentially-arriving
requests in order to maximize reward. At each time step, requests are drawn
independently from a distribution that is unknown to the decision maker. Online
resource allocation and its special cases have been studied extensively in the
past, but prior results crucially and universally rely on the strong assumption
that the total number of requests (the horizon) is known to the decision maker
in advance. In many applications, such as revenue management and online
advertising, the number of requests can vary widely because of fluctuations in
demand or user traffic intensity. In this work, we develop online algorithms
that are robust to horizon uncertainty. In sharp contrast to the known-horizon

that is independent of the horizon uncertainty. We introduce a novel
generalization of dual mirror descent which allows the decision maker to
specify a schedule of time-varying target consumption rates, and prove
corresponding performance guarantees. We go on to give a fast algorithm for
computing a schedule of target consumption rates that leads to near-optimal
performance in the unknown-horizon setting. In particular, our competitive
ratio attains the optimal rate of growth (up to logarithmic factors) as the

machine-learned predictions about the horizon which interpolates between the

the innermost regions of the accretion flow in these systems. We present a
time-dependent Comptonisation model that fits the energy-dependent
rms-amplitude and phase-lag spectra of low-frequency QPOs in black-hole (BH)
LMXBs. We model the accretion disc as a multi-temperature blackbody source
emitting soft photons which are then Compton up-scattered in a spherical
corona, including feedback of Comptonised photons that return to the disc. We
compare our results with those obtained with a model in which the seed-photons
source is a spherical blackbody: at low energies the time-averaged, rms and
phase-lag spectra are smoother for the disk-blackbody than for a blackbody,
while at high energies both models give similar spectra. In general, we find
that the rms increases with energy, the slope of the phase-lag spectrum depends
strongly on the feedback, while the minimum-lag energy is correlated with the
disc temperature. We fit the model to a 4.45-Hz type-B QPO in the BH LMXB MAXI
J1438-630 and find statistically-better fits and more compatible parameters
with the steady-state spectrum than those obtained with a blackbody
seed-photons source. Furthermore, we successfully apply the model to the type-C
QPO in the BH LMXB GRS 1915+105, and thus conclude that this
variable-Comptonisation model reproduces the rms and phase-lags of both type B

mechanistically linked to such design features as hierarchical structures,
multiple types of interlocking, and functional gradients. Here, we mimic these
strategies to design efficient soft-hard interfaces using voxel-based
multi-material 3D printing. We designed several types of soft-hard interfaces
with interfacial functional gradients and various types of bio-inspired
interlocking mechanisms. The geometrical designs were based on triply periodic
minimal surfaces (i.e., octo, diamond, and gyroid), collagen-like triple
helices, and randomly distributed particles. We utilized a combination of the
finite element method and experimental techniques, including uniaxial tensile
tests, quad-lap shear tests, and full-field strain measurement using digital
image correlation, to characterize the mechanical performance of different
groups. The analysis of the best performing designs (i.e., the gyroid,
collagen, and particle designs) suggests that smooth interdigitated
connections, compliant gradient transitions, and either decreasing or
constraining the strain concentrations regions between the hard and soft phases
led to simultaneously strong and tough interfaces. Increasing the gradient
length was only beneficial when the resulting interface geometry reduced strain
concentrations (e.g., in collagen and particles). Combining the gyroid-based
architecture with a random distribution of particles yielded the
best-performing soft-hard interface, with strengths approaching the upper limit
of the possible strengths and up to 50% toughness enhancement as compared to
the control group.

an accurate description of nuclear quantum effects. Additionally, we also

ratio (NPR) effects, which are widely used in shock absorbers, disaster
shelters, aerospace applications, etc. Traditional Miura-Ori structures are
made of isotropic materials (Aluminum, Acrylic), whose mechanical properties
like stiffness and NPR are well understood. However, how these responses are
affected by directional materials, like Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)
composites, lacks in-depth understanding. To that end, we study how fiber
directions and arrangements in CFRP composites and Miura-Ori's geometric
parameters control the stiffness and NPR of such structures. Through finite
element analysis, we show that Miura-Ori structures made of CFRP composites can
achieve higher stiffness and Poisson's ratio values than those made of an
isotropic material like Aluminum. Then through regression analysis, we
establish the relationship between different geometric parameters and the
corresponding mechanical responses, which is further utilized to discover the
Miura-Ori structure's optimal shape. We also show that the shear modulus is a
dominant parameter that controls the mechanical responses mentioned above among
the individual composite material properties within the Miura-Ori structure. We
demonstrate that we can optimize the Miura-Ori structure by finding geometric

make such analyses amenable, the microscopic simulations can be replaced by
surrogate models that must be able to handle a wide range of microstructural

where an accurate surrogate model was constructed for microstructures under
varying loading and material parameters using proper orthogonal decomposition
and Gaussian process regression, to treat geometrical parameters. To this end,
a method that transforms different geometries onto a parent domain is
presented. We propose to solve an auxiliary problem based on linear elasticity
to obtain the geometrical transformations. Using these transformations,
combined with the nonlinear microscopic problem, we derive a fast-to-evaluate
surrogate model with the following key features: (1) the predictions of the
effective quantities are independent of the auxiliary problem, (2) the
predicted stress fields fulfill the microscopic balance laws and are periodic,
(3) the method is non-intrusive, (4) the stress field for all geometries can be
recovered, and (5) the sensitivities are available and can be readily used for
optimization and material design. The proposed methodology is tested on several
composite microstructures, where rotations and large variations in the shape of
inclusions are considered. Finally, a two-scale example is shown, where the
surrogate model achieves a high accuracy and significant speed up,

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comprehensive semantic segmentation on renal pathological images is
challenging due to the heterogeneous scales of the objects. For example, on a
whole slide image (WSI), the cross-sectional areas of glomeruli can be 64 times
larger than that of the peritubular capillaries, making it impractical to
segment both objects on the same patch, at the same scale. To handle this
scaling issue, prior studies have typically trained multiple segmentation
networks in order to match the optimal pixel resolution of heterogeneous tissue
types. This multi-network solution is resource-intensive and fails to model the
spatial relationship between tissue types. In this paper, we propose the
Omni-Seg+ network, a scale-aware dynamic neural network that achieves
multi-object (six tissue types) and multi-scale (5X to 40X scale) pathological
image segmentation via a single neural network. The contribution of this paper
is three-fold: (1) a novel scale-aware controller is proposed to generalize the
dynamic neural network from single-scale to multi-scale; (2) semi-supervised
consistency regularization of pseudo-labels is introduced to model the
inter-scale correlation of unannotated tissue types into a single end-to-end
learning paradigm; and (3) superior scale-aware generalization is evidenced by
directly applying a model trained on human kidney images to mouse kidney
images, without retraining. By learning from ~150,000 human pathological image
patches from six tissue types at three different resolutions, our approach
achieved superior segmentation performance according to human visual assessment
and evaluation of image-omics (i.e., spatial transcriptomics). The official
implementation is available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/Omni-Seg.

review, we focus on the greatest common challenges and prospects for
improvement in applications of photo-$z$'s to the next generation of surveys:
  - Gains in $performance$ -- i.e., the precision of redshift estimates for
individual galaxies -- could greatly enhance studies of galaxy evolution and
some probes of cosmology.
  - Improvements in $characterization$ -- i.e., the accurate recovery of
redshift $distributions$ of galaxies in the presence of uncertainty on
individual redshifts -- are urgently needed for cosmological measurements with
next-generation surveys.
  - To achieve both of these goals, improvements in the scope and treatment of
the samples of spectroscopic redshifts which make high-fidelity photo-$z$'s
possible will also be needed.
  For the full potential of the next generation of surveys to be reached, the
characterization of redshift distributions will need to improve by roughly an
order of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, requiring progress
on a wide variety of fronts. We conclude by presenting a speculative evaluation
of how photometric redshift methods and the collection of the necessary
spectroscopic samples may improve by the time near-future surveys are

intervention strategies. Given the stochastic nature of the threats (e.g., the
spread of pandemic influenza, the occurrence of drug overdoses, and the
prevalence of alcohol-related threats), deterministic optimization approaches
may be inappropriate. In this paper, we implement a stochastic optimization
method to address aspects of the 2009 H1N1 and the COVID-19 pandemics, with the
spread of disease modeled by the open source Monte Carlo simulations, FluTE and
Covasim, respectively. Without testing every possible option, the objective of
the optimization is to determine the best combination of intervention
strategies so as to result in minimal economic loss to society. To reach our
objective, this application-oriented paper uses the discrete simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation method (DSPSA), a recursive
simulation-based optimization algorithm, to update the input parameters in the
disease simulation software so that the output iteratively approaches minimal
economic loss. Assuming that the simulation models for the spread of disease
(FluTE for H1N1 and Covasim for COVID-19 in our case) are accurate
representations for the population being studied, the simulation-based strategy
we present provides decision makers a powerful tool to mitigate potential human

states that every graph that does not contain $K_t$ as a minor is properly
$(t-1)$-colorable. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that a natural
extension of Hadwiger's problem to hypergraph coloring exists, and to derive
some first partial results and applications. Generalizing ordinary graph minors
to hypergraphs, we say that a hypergraph $H_1$ is a minor of a hypergraph
$H_2$, if a hypergraph isomorphic to $H_1$ can be obtained from $H_2$ via a
finite sequence of vertex- and hyperedge-deletions, and hyperedge contractions.
We first show that a weak extension of Hadwiger's conjecture to hypergraphs
holds true: For every $t \ge 1$, there exists a finite (smallest) integer
$h(t)$ such that every hypergraph with no $K_t$-minor is $h(t)$-colorable, and
we prove $$\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil \le h(t) \le 2g(t)$$ where
$g(t)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of graphs with no $K_t$-minor.
Using the recent result by Delcourt and Postle that $g(t)=O(t \log \log t)$,
this yields $h(t)=O(t \log \log t)$. We further conjecture that
$h(t)=\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$, i.e., that every hypergraph
with no $K_t$-minor is $\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$-colorable for
all $t \ge 1$, and prove this conjecture for all hypergraphs with independence
number at most $2$. By considering special classes of hypergraphs, the above
additionally has some interesting applications for ordinary graph coloring,
such as:
  -graphs of chromatic number $C k t \log \log t$ contain $K_t$-minors with
$k$-edge-connected branch-sets,
  -graphs of chromatic number $C q t \log \log t$ contain $K_t$-minors with
modulo-$q$-connected branch sets,
  -by considering cycle hypergraphs of digraphs we recover known results on
strong minors in digraphs of large dichromatic number as special cases.

frequency and magnetic field, producing a pattern of optically-detected

suggest significant spin polarization in this system with orientation
selectivity. Unusual excitation intensity dependence is also observed, which
inverts the sign of the ODMR signal for triplet features, but not for quintet.

characterises when an external property of objects can be accessed from within
the internal logic of the base of a fibration. In this paper we consider a
generalisation of definability from properties of objects to structures on
objects, introduced by Shulman under the name local representability.
  We first develop some general theory and show how to recover existing notions
due to B\'{e}nabou and Johnstone as special cases. We give several examples of
definable and non definable notions o structure, focusing on algebraic weak
factorisation systems, which can be naturally viewed as notions of structure on
codomain fibrations. Regarding definability, we give a sufficient criterion for
cofibrantly generated awfs's to be definable, generalising a construction of
the universe for cubical sets, but also including some very different looking
examples that do not satisfy tininess in the internal sense, that exponential
functors have a right adjoint. Our examples of non definability include the
identification of logical principles holding for the interval objects in
simplicial sets and Bezem-Coquand-Huber cubical sets that suffice to show a
certain definition of Kan fibration is not definable.

the image prior to inpainting produces coherent structure, it inherently lacks

optimize the intermediate featuremaps of a network by minimizing a multiscale

multi-qubit gate counts while mapping quantum circuits to restrictive qubit
topologies. Because synthesis algorithms are limited in scalability by their
exponentially growing run time and memory requirements, application to circuits
wider than 5 qubits requires divide-and-conquer partitioning of circuits into
smaller components. In this work, we will explore methods to reduce the depth
(program run time) and multi-qubit gate instruction count of wide (16-100
qubit) mapped quantum circuits optimized with synthesis. Reducing circuit depth
and gate count directly impacts program performance and the likelihood of
successful execution for quantum circuits on parallel quantum machines.
  We present TopAS, a topology aware synthesis tool built with the
\emph{BQSKit} framework that preconditions quantum circuits before mapping.
Partitioned subcircuits are optimized and fitted to sparse qubit subtopologies
in a way that balances the often opposing demands of synthesis and mapping
algorithms. This technique can be used to reduce the depth and gate count of
wide quantum circuits mapped to the sparse qubit topologies of Google and IBM.
Compared to large scale synthesis algorithms which focus on optimizing quantum
circuits after mapping, TopAS is able to reduce depth by an average of 35.2%
and CNOT gate count an average of 11.5% when targeting a 2D mesh topology. When
compared with traditional quantum compilers using peephole optimization and
mapping algorithms from the Qiskit or $t|ket\rangle$ toolkits, our approach is
able to provide significant improvements in performance, reducing CNOT counts
by 30.3% and depth by 38.2% on average.

the sum of powers of the Lipschitz norm of the ANN realization function (with

accurate numerical approximation. It has been shown, however, that a suitable
choice of gauge and constraint addition can be used to prevent their

this knowledge and eradicates these log-terms at leading orders. Because of
their effect on the asymptotic solution space, specific formally singular terms

no power, or it may be misleading: The Blum, Kiefer, Rosenblatt, and other
omnibus classical rank tests do have some local power in any direction other
than those where significant results may be misleading. We also suggest methods
of selective inference in independence testing. Chatterjee's statistics like
Renyi's (1959) also identified functional dependence. We exhibit statistics
which have better power properties than Chatterjee's but also identify
functional dependence.

radio morphology but not total radio power. The motivation of this study is to
determine the X-ray emission mechanism in jets, these being different in FR I
and FR II jets. We detected X-ray jet emission with sufficient SNR in two
blazars viz. PKS 0215+015 and TXS 0730+504. We carried out spectral energy
distribution (SED) modeling of the broad-band emission from the jet regions in
these sources and found that a single synchrotron emission model is ruled out
due to the deep upper limits obtained from HST optical and IR data. The IC- CMB
model can reproduce the X-ray jet emission in both sources although the model
requires extreme jet parameters. Both our sources possess FR II like radio
powers and our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that
radio power is more important than FR morphology in determining the emission
mechanism of X-ray jets.

an expression for the gap as a function of the covariance between the model

data-averaged parameter distribution and the data-averaged loss. We show that
for a large class of model parameter distributions a modified generalization

produced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), along with a few approximations

outflow. These cells form fluid-filled dynamic outpouchings of their basal

reminiscent of cellular blebs, extracellular cytoplasmic protrusions triggered
by local temporary disruption of the contractile actomyosin cortex. Inverse
blebbing has been first observed experimentally during sprouting angiogenesis,
but its underlying physical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identify
giant vacuole formation as inverse blebbing and formulate a biophysical model
of this process. Our model elucidates how cell membrane mechanical properties
affect the morphology and dynamics of giant vacuoles and predicts coarsening
akin to Ostwald ripening between multiple invaginating vacuoles. Our results
are in qualitative agreement with observations from the formation of giant
vacuoles during perfusion experiments. Our model not only elucidates the

  Sparse But Varying Pixels","8 pages","IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters 2022",,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Event cameras continue to attract interest due to desirable characteristics
such as high dynamic range, low latency, virtually no motion blur, and high
energy efficiency. One of the potential applications that would benefit from
these characteristics lies in visual place recognition for robot localization,
i.e. matching a query observation to the corresponding reference place in the
database. In this letter, we explore the distinctiveness of event streams from
a small subset of pixels (in the tens or hundreds). We demonstrate that the
absolute difference in the number of events at those pixel locations
accumulated into event frames can be sufficient for the place recognition task,
when pixels that display large variations in the reference set are used. Using
such sparse (over image coordinates) but varying (variance over the number of
events per pixel location) pixels enables frequent and computationally cheap
updates of the location estimates. Furthermore, when event frames contain a
constant number of events, our method takes full advantage of the event-driven
nature of the sensory stream and displays promising robustness to changes in
velocity. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset
in an outdoor driving scenario, as well as the newly contributed indoor
QCR-Event-VPR dataset that was captured with a DAVIS346 camera mounted on a
mobile robotic platform. Our results show that our approach achieves
competitive performance when compared to several baseline methods on those
datasets, and is particularly well suited for compute- and energy-constrained
platforms such as interplanetary rovers.

Show, on electoral outcomes and attitude polarization in the U.S. We propose a
novel identification strategy that considers the radio space in each county as
a market where multiple stations are competing for listeners' attention. Our
measure of competition is a spatial Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in radio
frequencies. To address endogeneity concerns, we exploit the variation in
competition based on accidental frequency overlaps in a county, conditional on
the overall level of radio frequency competition. We find that counties with
higher exposure to the Rush Limbaugh Show have a systematically higher vote
share for Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.
Combining our county-level Rush Limbaugh Show exposure measure with individual
survey data reveals that self-identifying Republicans in counties with higher
exposure to the Show express more conservative political views, while
self-identifying Democrats in these same counties express more moderate
political views. Taken together, these findings provide some of the first
insights on the effects of contemporary talk radio on political outcomes, both

common types of data used in medical machine learning applications. Such
datasets are often small in size, expensive to collect and annotate, and might
involve privacy issues, which hinders our ability to train large,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for biomedical applications. For
time-series data, the suite of data augmentation strategies we can use to
expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic
properties of the signal. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be
utilized as another data augmentation tool. In this paper, we present TTS-CGAN,
a transformer-based conditional GAN model that can be trained on existing
multi-class datasets and generate class-specific synthetic time-series
sequences of arbitrary length. We elaborate on the model architecture and
design strategies. Synthetic sequences generated by our model are
indistinguishable from real ones, and can be used to complement or replace real
signals of the same type, thus achieving the goal of data augmentation. To
evaluate the quality of the generated data, we modify the wavelet coherence
metric to be able to compare the similarity between two sets of signals, and
also conduct a case study where a mix of synthetic and real data are used to
train a deep learning model for sequence classification. Together with other
visualization techniques and qualitative evaluation approaches, we demonstrate
that TTS-CGAN generated synthetic data are similar to real data, and that our
model performs better than the other state-of-the-art GAN models built for
time-series data generation.

has a pooling layer to transform frame-level to utterance-level features by
calculating statistics over all utterance frames, with equal weighting.
However, self-attentive embeddings perform weighted pooling such that the

variations. Hence, an entropy-based variable frame rate vector is proposed as
an external conditioning vector for the self-attention layer to provide the

five different approaches to conditioning. The best conditioning approach,

Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry plays a major role in
various physical phenomena, from multipole to non-Hermitian physics. For
superconductors, the quantum geometry is clarified to appear in the superfluid
weight, an essential quantity of superconductivity. Although the superfluid
weight was considered to be determined by the Fermi-liquid contribution for a
long time, the geometric contribution is not negligible in some superconductors
such as artificial flat-band systems and monolayer FeSe. While the superfluid
weight is essential for many superconducting phenomena related to the center of
mass momenta of Cooper pairs (CMMCP), the full scope of the quantum geometric
effect on superconductivity remains unresolved. In this paper, we study the
quantum geometric effect on the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state
acquiring a finite CMMCP in equilibrium. As a benchmark, the phase diagrams of
effective models for monolayer FeSe in an in-plane magnetic field are
calculated. In the case of the isotropic $s$-wave pairing, the quantum geometry
stabilizes the BCS state, and a metastable BCS state appears in the high
magnetic field region. In addition, the quantum geometry induces the phase
transition from the FFLO state to the BCS state with increasing temperature. On
the other hand, for the inter-sublattice pairing, the quantum geometry gives a
negative contribution to the superfluid weight; this can induce the FFLO
superconductivity in particular parameter sets.

(LEO-to-MEO, LEO-to-HEO, or LEO-to-GEO). A key aspect of the study performed in
this paper is that the optimal thrusting structure is not assumed to be known a
priori, but is determined as part of the solution process. In order to
determine the optimal thrusting structure, a recently developed bang-bang and
singular optimal control (BBSOC) method is employed together with
multiple-domain Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature collocation. Key results
obtained in this study include not only the number of switches in the optimized
thrust, but also the total impulse. Furthermore, it is found that, as the
maximum allowable thrust acceleration decreases, the total impulse is less than
the total impulse obtained from a previous study where a burn-coast-burn
thrusting structure was assumed a priori. For each type of transfer a
particular value of maximum allowable thrust acceleration is chosen to
highlight in more detail the key features of the optimal solutions. This study
provides improved results over previous studies and provides improved insight

of magic-angle flat bands hosted by moir\'e structures in electronic, photonic
and acoustic systems. On the other hand, bound states in the continuum (BICs)
have also attracted great attention in recent years because of their potential
applications in the field of designing superior optical devices. Here, we
combine these two independent concepts to construct a new optical state in a
twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab, which is called as moir\'e quasi-BIC,
and numerically demonstrate that such an exotic optical state possesses dual
characteristics of moir\'e flat bands and quasi-BICs. To illustrate the
mechanism for the formation of moir\'e flat bands, we develop an effective
model at the center of the Brillouin zone and show that moir\'e flat bands
could be fulfilled by balancing the interlayer coupling strength and the twist
angle around the band edge above the light line. Moreover, by decreasing the
twist angle of moir\'e photonic crystal slabs with flat bands, it is shown that
the moir\'e flat-band mode at the Brillouin center gradually approaches a
perfect BIC, where the total radiation loss from all diffraction channels is
significantly suppressed. To clarify the advantage of moir\'e quasi-BICs,
enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) is numerically proven with a
wide-angle optical source. The efficiency of SHG assisted by designed moir\'e
quasi-BICs can be greatly improved compared with that based on dispersive
quasi-BICs with similar quality factors.

tremendous attention in the fields of nanofluidics due to the slip at the
interface between solid and liquid. The dependence of slip length for water on
the types of supporting substrates and thickness of carbonous layer, which is
critical for applications such as sustainable cooling of electronic devices,
remains unknown. In this paper, using colloidal probe atomic force microscope,
we measured the slip length of water on graphene ls supported by hydrophilic
and hydrophobic substrates, i.e., SiO2 and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS). The
ls on single-layer graphene supported by SiO2 is found to be 1.6~1.9 nm, and by
OTS is 8.5~0.9 nm. With the thickness of few-layer graphene increases to 3~4
layers, both ls gradually converge to the value of graphite (4.3~3.5 nm). Such
thickness dependence is termed slip length translucency. Further, ls is found
to decrease by about 70% with the temperature increases from 300 K to 350 K for
2-layer graphene supported by SiO2. These observations are explained by
analysis based on Green-Kubo relation and McLachlan theory. Our results provide
the first set of reference values for the slip length of water on supported
few-layer graphene. They can not only serve as a direct experimental reference
for solid-liquid interaction, but also provide guideline for the design of
nanofluidics-based devices, for example the thermo-mechanical nanofluidic

reproduction bias for discrete-event human-robot force interaction. We derived
an asymptotic stability condition based on a mathematical bias model and found
that the bias asymptotically stabilizes a human's implicit equilibrium point
far from the implicit equilibrium point and destabilizes the point near the
point. The bias model, convergence of the interaction toward the implicit
equilibrium point, and divergence around the point were consistently verified
via behavioral experiments under three kinds of interactions using three

Nucleosynthesis (BBN), starting just after the inflationary epoch, is not yet
established unanimously. If instead, the universe undergoes a non-standard
cosmological phase, it will alter the Hubble expansion rate significantly and
may also generate substantial entropy through non-adiabatic evolution. This
leads to a thumping impact on the properties of relic species decoupled from
the thermal bath before the revival of the standard radiation domination in the
vicinity of the BBN. In this work, considering the Dirac nature of neutrinos,
we have studied decoupling of ultra-relativistic right-handed neutrinos
($\nu_R$s) in presence of two possible non-standard cosmological phases. While
in both cases we have modified Hubble parameters causing faster expansions in
the early universe, one of the situations predicts a non-adiabatic evolution
and thereby a slower redshift of the photon temperature due to the expansion.
Considering the most general form of the collision term with Fermi-Dirac
distribution and Pauli blocking factors, we have solved the Boltzmann equation
numerically to obtain $\Delta{\rm N}_{\rm eff}$ for the three right-handed
neutrinos. We have found that for a large portion of parameter space, the
combined effect of early decoupling of $\nu_R$ as well as the slower redshift
of photon bath can easily hide the signature of right-handed neutrinos, in
spite of precise measurement of $\Delta{\rm N}_{\rm eff}$, at the next
generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G etc. This however will not be
applicable for the scenarios with only fast expansion.

Char\~ao-D'Abbicco-Ikehata considered in [5] depending on a parameter $\theta
\in (1/2,1)$ and Piske- Char\~ao-Ikehata [26] for small parameter $\theta \in
(0,1/2)$. We derive a leading term (as time goes to infinity) of the solution,
and by using it, a growth and a decay property of the solution itself can be
precisely studied in terms of L^2-norm. An interesting aspect appears in the
case of n = 1, roughly speaking, a small $\theta$ produces a diffusive
property, and a large $\theta$ gives a kind of singularity, expressed by growth
rates.

traditional recommendation since it allows the model training and online
inferring without centralized user data collection. Most existing works assume
that all user devices are available and adequate to participate in the
Federated Learning. However, in practice, the complex recommendation models
designed for accurate prediction and massive item data cause a high computation
and communication cost to the resource-constrained user device, resulting in
poor performance or training failure. Therefore, how to effectively compress
the computation and communication overhead to achieve efficient federated
recommendations across ubiquitous mobile devices remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces split learning into the two-tower
recommendation models and proposes STTFedRec, a privacy-preserving and
efficient cross-device federated recommendation framework. STTFedRec achieves
local computation reduction by splitting the training and computation of the
item model from user devices to a performance-powered server. The server with
the item model provides low-dimensional item embeddings instead of raw item
data to the user devices for local training and online inferring, achieving
server broadcast compression. The user devices only need to perform similarity
calculations with cached user embeddings to achieve efficient online inferring.
We also propose an obfuscated item request strategy and multi-party circular
secret sharing chain to enhance the privacy protection of model training. The
experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that STTFedRec
improves the average computation time and communication size of the baseline
models by about 40 times and 42 times in the best-case scenario with balanced
recommendation accuracy.

candidates of high energy neutrino sources. However, SNe commonly occur in the
universe and a chance coincidence of their detection with a neutrino signal

with neutrino emission. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a
search for $\sim10-100$ TeV neutrino multiple events within a timescale of
$\sim 30$ days coming from the same direction, called neutrino multiplets. We
show that demanding multiplet detection by a $\sim 1$ km$^3$ neutrino telescope
limits distances of detectable neutrino sources, which enables us to identify
source counterparts by multiwavelength observations owing to the substantially
reduced rate of the chance coincidence detection of transients. We apply our
results by constructing a feasible strategy for optical followup observations
and demonstrate that wide-field optical telescopes with a $\gtrsim4$ m dish
should be capable of identifying a transient associated with a neutrino
multiplet. We also present the resultant sensitivity of multiplet neutrino
detection as a function of the released energy of neutrinos and burst rate
density. A model of neutrino transient sources with an emission energy greater
than ${\rm a~few}\times 10^{51}$erg and a burst rate rarer than ${\rm

performance in closed-world learning scenarios, they typically fail to
generalize to unseen categories in dynamic open-world environments, in which
the number of concepts is unbounded. In contrast, human and animal learners
have the ability to incrementally update their knowledge by recognizing and
adapting to novel observations. In particular, humans characterize concepts via
exclusive (unique) sets of essential features, which are used for both
recognizing known classes and identifying novelty. Inspired by natural
learners, we introduce a Sparse High-level-Exclusive, Low-level-Shared feature
representation (SHELS) that simultaneously encourages learning exclusive sets
of high-level features and essential, shared low-level features. The
exclusivity of the high-level features enables the DNN to automatically detect
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, while the efficient use of capacity via sparse
low-level features permits accommodating new knowledge. The resulting approach
uses OOD detection to perform class-incremental continual learning without
known class boundaries. We show that using SHELS for novelty detection results
in statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
approaches over a variety of benchmark datasets. Further, we demonstrate that
the SHELS model mitigates catastrophic forgetting in a class-incremental

like coupling strength. First and foremost, we reveal the essence of PT
stability by improper integral, L'Hospital rule and Taylor expansion theory.
Many controllers established previously for PT stability can be included in our

disconnected, which means that the outer coupling matrices (OCMs) can be

behind in terms of loss and noise tolerance. An important discerning factor
between DV-QKD and CV-QKD is the effect of phase noise, which is known to be

extend the regions at which CV-QKD performs better than DV-QKD. Our analysis
addresses the questions of how phase noise affects DV-QKD and CV-QKD and why
the former has historically performed better in a thermal-loss channel.

These descriptors should be invariant to symmetry operations. Handcrafted

such as unbalanced light conditions, low contrast, occlusion, and mimicry of
aquatic organisms. Under these circumstances, the objects captured by the
underwater camera will become vague, and the generic detectors often fail on
these vague objects. This work aims to solve the problem from two perspectives:
uncertainty modeling and hard example mining. We propose a two-stage underwater
detector named boosting R-CNN, which comprises three key components. First, a
new region proposal network named RetinaRPN is proposed, which provides
high-quality proposals and considers objectness and IoU prediction for
uncertainty to model the object prior probability. Second, the probabilistic
inference pipeline is introduced to combine the first-stage prior uncertainty
and the second-stage classification score to model the final detection score.
Finally, we propose a new hard example mining method named boosting
reweighting. Specifically, when the region proposal network miscalculates the
object prior probability for a sample, boosting reweighting will increase the
classification loss of the sample in the R-CNN head during training, while
reducing the loss of easy samples with accurately estimated priors. Thus, a
robust detection head in the second stage can be obtained. During the inference
stage, the R-CNN has the capability to rectify the error of the first stage to
improve the performance. Comprehensive experiments on two underwater datasets

robustness of our method.

sufficient quantities to account for the proto-solar abundance. For decades,
novae have been proposed as a potential explanation to this 'Galactic Li
problem', and the recent detection of 7Be in the ejecta of multiple nova
eruptions has breathed new life into this theory. In this work, we assess the
viability of novae as dominant producers of Li in the Milky Way. We present the
most comprehensive treatment of novae in a galactic chemical evolution code to
date, testing theoretical- and observationally-derived nova Li yields by
integrating metallicity-dependent nova ejecta profiles computed using the
binary population synthesis code binary c with the galactic chemical evolution
code OMEGA+. We find that our galactic chemical evolution models which use
observationally-derived Li yields account for the proto-solar Li abundance very
well, while models relying on theoretical nova yields cannot reproduce the
proto-solar observation. A brief exploration of physical uncertainties
including single-stellar yields, the metallicity resolution of our nova
treatment, common-envelope physics, and nova accretion efficiencies indicates
that this result is robust to physical assumptions. Scatter within the

of uncertainty, motivating further observations of 7Be in nova ejecta.

gait recognition. We first present the odyssey of gait recognition from
traditional algorithms to deep models, providing explicit knowledge of the
whole workflow of a gait recognition system. Then deep learning for gait
recognition is discussed from the perspective of deep representations and
architecture with an in-depth summary. Specifically, deep gait representations
are categorized into static and dynamic features, while deep architectures
include single-stream and multi-stream architecture. Following our proposed
taxonomy with novelty, it can be beneficial for providing inspiration and
promoting the perception of deep gait recognition. Besides, we also present a
comprehensive summary of all vision-based gait datasets and the performance
analysis. Finally, the article discusses some open issues with significant
potential prospects.

new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this sense, cosmological
applications of supergravity can be the arena for probing outcomes of
supergravity. It is also attractive that supergravity can appear as a
low-energy effective theory of superstrings, a possible candidate of quantum
gravity. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to build inflationary models in
supergravity due to difficulties arising mainly from the extremely constrained
form of supergravity scalar potentials, complicated structure of interaction
terms, and excessive scalar degrees of freedom. These obstructions generally
make it challenging to contrive a desirable inflationary trajectory, perform
the moduli stabilization to obtain the stable de-Sitter phase, and make extra
scalars to be much heavier than the Hubble scale to get single field inflation.
Besides, supergravity predicts many non-renormalizable interactions. It thus
arises as effective field theory (EFT) which can be valid only up to typical
energies $E$ below its ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{cut}$, and up to some
accuracy of $(E/\Lambda_{cut})^n$ that we desire. We note that these
non-renormalizable terms may affect physics during and/or after inflation. From
such points of view, it is very important in supergravity to find the method
for relaxing the scalar potentials, and flexible scalar field dynamics
(particularly for inflaton), and examine self-consistency at the quantum level.
In this thesis, therefore, we construct locally supersymmetric effective field
theories of inflation (with KKLT string background) by taking into account
recently-proposed reformulations of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity that can
enlarge the space of scalar potentials.

quantum noise inherent in quantum measurements. The idea behind it is
intuitive: we first detect and then eliminate quantum noise so that the
classical noise assumption is satisfied and measurement error mitigation works.
In the first stage, inspired by coherence witness in the resource theory of
quantum coherence, we design an efficient method to detect quantum noise. It
works by fitting the difference between two measurement statistics to the
Fourier series, where the statistics are obtained using maximally coherent
states with relative phase and maximally mixed states as inputs. The fitting
coefficients quantitatively benchmark quantum noise. In the second stage, we
design various methods to eliminate quantum noise, inspired by the Pauli
twirling technique. They work by executing randomly sampled Pauli gates before
the measurement device and conditionally flipping the measurement outcomes in
such a way that the effective measurement device contains only classical noise.
We demonstrate the feasibility of the two-stage procedure numerically on Baidu
Quantum Platform. Remarkably, the results show that quantum noise in
measurement devices is significantly suppressed, and the quantum computation
accuracy is substantially improved. We highlight that the two-stage procedure
complements existing measurement error mitigation techniques, and they together
form a standard toolbox for manipulating measurement errors in near-term
quantum devices.

the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).
Despite the success of current prompt-based tuning approaches, two major

utilize the representation power of PLMs, but have not explored their

modules: (1) an entity type label interpretation module automatically learns to
relate type labels to the vocabulary by jointly leveraging few-shot instances

Notwithstanding the widespread interest in Fe3Sn2, crystal twinning,
difficulties in distinguishing surface from bulk states, and a large unit cell
have until now prevented the synchrotron-based spectroscopic observation of
sharply resolved quasiparticles near the Fermi surface which could be
responsible for the anomalous properties appearing at low temperatures for the
material. Here we report microfocused laser-based angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (micro-ARPES), which offers the first look at such quasiparticles.
The high spatial resolution allows individual crystal twin domains to be
examined in isolation, resulting in the discovery of three-fold symmetric
electron pockets at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center, not predicted by early
tight-binding descriptions but in agreement with density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, which also feature Weyl nodes. The quasiparticles in these
pockets have remarkably long mean free paths, and their Fermi surface area is
consistent with reported quantum oscillations. At the same time, though, the
best-defined Fermi surface is reduced at low temperature, and the
quasiparticles generally are marginal in the sense that their wavelength
uncertainty is of order the deviation of the quasiparticle wavelength from the
Fermi vector. We attribute these manifestations of strong electron-electron
interactions to a flat band predicted by our DFT to lie just above the
dispersive bands seen in this experiment. Thus, beyond demonstrating the impact
of twin averaging for ARPES measurements of band structures, our experiments
reveal many-body physics unaccounted for by current theories of metallic kagome

investigate the dynamics of these columns using two-dimensional radiative
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, restricting consideration to
modest accretion rates where the height of the column is low enough that
Cartesian geometry can be employed. The column structure is dynamically
maintained through high-frequency oscillations of the accretion shock at
$\simeq 10-25$~kHz. These oscillations arise because it is necessary to
redistribute the power released at the accretion shock through bulk vertical
motions, both to balance the cooling and to provide vertical pressure support
against gravity. Sideways cooling always dominates the loss of internal energy.
In addition to the vertical oscillations, photon bubbles form in our
simulations and add additional spatial complexity to the column structure. They
are not themselves responsible for the oscillations, and they do not appear to
affect the oscillation period. However, they enhance the vertical transport of
radiation and increase the oscillation amplitude in luminosity. The
time-averaged column structure in our simulations resembles the trends in
standard 1D stationary models, the main difference being that the time-averaged
height of the shock front is lower because of the higher cooling efficiency of
the 2D column shape.

an interactive manner between embedding extractors and clustering algorithms.
Specifically, the framework consists of two highly coupled parts:
clustering-guided recurrent training (CGRT) and truncated beam searching
clustering (TBSC). The CGRT introduces the clustering algorithm into the
training process of embedding extractors, which could provide not only
cluster-aware information for the embedding extractor, but also crucial
parameters for the clustering process afterward. And with these parameters,
which contain preliminary information of the metric space, the TBSC penalizes
the probability score of each cluster, in order to output more accurate
clustering results in online fashion with low latency. With the above

expressive speaker characteristics than conversational speech. It is suspected
that a single embedding vector may only capture averaged and coarse-grained

this work proposes a novel hierarchical speaker representation framework for
SVC, which can capture fine-grained speaker characteristics at different
granularity. It consists of an up-sampling stream and three down-sampling
streams. The up-sampling stream transforms the linguistic features into audio
samples, while one down-sampling stream of the three operates in the reverse
direction. It is expected that the temporal statistics of each down-sampling
block can represent speaker characteristics at different granularity, which
will be engaged in the up-sampling blocks to enhance the speaker modeling.
Experiment results verify that the proposed method outperforms both the LUT and
SRN based SVC systems. Moreover, the proposed system supports the one-shot SVC
with only a few seconds of reference audio.

these non-Gaussian resources reasonably enhances the performance of CV-QKD,

while in the case of TMSV the maximum transmission distance is limited to 47
Km, single-photon subtracted TMSV and zero-photon-catalysed TMSV yield much
higher distance of 73 Km and 152 Km respectively. However, photon loss as a
practical concern in zero-photon-catalysis setup limits the transmission
distance for zero-photon-catalysed TMSV to 36 Km. This makes
single-photon-subtraction on TMSV to be the best choice for entanglement-based
CV-QKD in obtaining large transmission distance. Nonetheless, we note that the
non-Gaussianity does not improve the robustness of entanglement-based CV-QKD

the order increasing). Hence existing approaches only detect limited order
(e.g., combinations of up to four features) beneficial feature interactions,
which may miss beneficial feature interactions with orders higher than the
limitation. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph neural network based model
named HIRS. HIRS is the first work that directly generates beneficial feature
interactions of arbitrary orders and makes recommendation predictions
accordingly. The number of generated feature interactions can be specified to
be much smaller than the number of all the possible interactions and hence, our
model admits a much lower running time. To achieve an effective algorithm, we
exploit three properties of beneficial feature interactions, and propose
deep-infomax-based methods to guide the interaction generation. Our

observations of the [C II] 158um line emission obtained with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These observations allowed us to compare the
spatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission,
model the [C II] line data-cube using 3DBarolo, and measure the [C II]
luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities in the galaxy
subregions. The system is found to be composed of a main central source, a
fainter north extension, and candidate [C II] companions located 10-kpc away.
We find similar rest-frame UV and [C II] spatial distributions, suggesting that
the [C II] emission emerges from the star-forming regions. The agreement
between the UV and [C II] surface brightness radial profiles rules out diffuse,
extended [C II] emission in the main galaxy component. The [C II] velocity map
reveals a velocity gradient in the north-south direction suggesting ordered
motion, as commonly found in rotating-disk galaxies. But higher-resolution
observations would be needed to rule out a compact merger scenario. Our model
indicates a low average velocity dispersion, $\sigma$ < 30 km s$^{-1}$. This
result implies a dispersion lower than the expected value from observations and
semi-analytic models of high redshift galaxies. We argue that COS-2987030247 is
a candidate rotating disk experiencing a short period of stability which will
be possibly perturbed at later times by accreting sources.

logic are powerful techniques for static analysis of computer programs. All of
them have been successfully extended to the quantum setting, but largely
developed in parallel. In this paper, we examine the relationship between these
techniques in the context of verifying quantum while-programs, where the
abstract domain and the set of assertions for quantum states are
well-structured. In particular, we show that any complete quantum abstract
interpretation induces a quantum Hoare logic and a quantum incorrectness logic,
both of which are sound and relatively complete. Unlike the logics proposed in
the literature, the induced logic systems are in a forward manner, making them
more useful in certain applications. Conversely, any sound and relatively
complete quantum Hoare logic or quantum incorrectness logic induces a complete
quantum abstract interpretation. As an application, we are able to show the
non-existence of any sound and relatively complete quantum Hoare logic or
incorrectness logic if tuples of local subspaces are taken as assertions.

precludes entering the phase through a second-order transition, even in three

Including strong FFLO pairing fluctuations within the framework of the

the anisotropy of Fermi surface introduced by an optical lattice makes the FFLO

a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is used to obtain
the VPP's generation and reserve schedule and the opportunity cost of the
energy stored in the battery. The model has an hourly resolution and a
look-ahead period beyond the markets' scheduling horizon and considers the
hourly battery degradation costs as a function of both the depth of discharge
and the discharge rate. Different strategies are evaluated to forecast the
real-time use of the committed secondary regulation reserves. Second, a
deterministic MILP model is used to determine the redispatch of the VPP using
as input the generation and reserve schedule and the VPP's storage opportunity
cost provided by the former model and is executed on an hourly rolling basis.
The results obtained show that the proposed models are effective for the

deep inelastic scattering from the free nucleons are discussed and the results
for the scattering cross sections are presented. The polarization observables
for the leptons and hadrons produced in the final state, in the case of
quasielastic scattering, are also studied. The importance of nuclear medium
effects in the low, intermediate and high energy regions, in the above
processes along with the processes of the coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering,
coherent meson production, and trident production, have been highlighted. In
some cases the results of the cross sections are also given and compared with
the available experimental data as well as with the predictions in the
different theoretical models. This study would be helpful in understanding the
(anti)neutrino interaction cross section with matter in the few GeV energy
region relevant to the next generation experiments like DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande,
and other experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We have
emphasized the need of better theoretical models for some of these processes
for studying the nuclear medium effects in nuclei.

medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies. It is challenging to measure the
properties of the small-scale ISM magnetic fields (magnetic fields at scales
smaller than the turbulence driving scale). Using numerical simulations, we
demonstrate how the second-order rotation measure (RM, which depends on thermal
electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, and magnetic field, $b$) structure function can
probe the properties of small-scale $b$. We then apply our results to
observations of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC). First,
using Gaussian random $b$, we show that the characteristic scale where the RM
structure function flattens is approximately equal to the correlation length of
$b$. We also show that computing the RM structure function with a higher-order
stencil (more than the commonly-used two-point stencil) is necessary to
accurately estimate the slope of the structure function. Then, using Gaussian
random $b$ and lognormal $n_{\rm e}$ with known power spectra, we derive an
empirical relationship between the slope of the power spectrum of $b$, $n_{\rm
e}$, and RM. We apply these results to the SMC and LMC and estimate the
following properties of small-scale $b$: correlation length ($160~\pm 21~{\rm
pc}$ for the SMC and $87~\pm~17~{\rm pc}$ for the LMC), strength ($14~\pm
2~\mu{\rm G}$ for the SMC and $15~\pm 3~\mu{\rm G}$ for the LMC), and slope of
the magnetic power spectrum ($-1.3~\pm~0.4$ for the SMC and $-1.6~\pm~0.1$ for

the outdoor-to-indoor mmWave communication system with the aid of an active

incoming signal from an outdoor base station (BS) to pass through the surface
and be received by the indoor user-equipments (UEs) after shifting its phase
and magnifying its amplitude. Then, the problem of joint precoding of the BS
and active-ITS is investigated to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the
communication system. An efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based
algorithm is developed to solve it with the suboptimal solutions in nearly
closed-forms. In addition, to reduce the size and hardware cost of an
active-ITS, we provide a block-amplifying architecture to partially remove the
circuit components for power-amplifying, where multiple transmissive-type
elements (TEs) in each block share a same power amplifier. Simulations indicate
that active-ITS has the potential of achieving a given performance with much
fewer TEs compared to the passive-ITS under the same total system power
consumption, which makes it suitable for application to the size-limited and
aesthetic-needed scenario, and the inevitable performance degradation caused by
the block-amplifying architecture is acceptable.

  for Medical Image Classification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL), training deep models from decentralized data without
privacy leakage, has drawn great attention recently. Two common issues in FL,
namely data heterogeneity from the local perspective and class imbalance from
the global perspective have limited FL's performance. These two coupling
problems are under-explored, and existing few studies may not be sufficiently
realistic to model data distributions in practical sceneries (e.g. medical
sceneries). One common observation is that the overall class distribution
across clients is imbalanced (e.g. common vs. rare diseases) and data tend to
be agglomerated to those more advanced clients (i.e., the data agglomeration
effect), which cannot be modeled by existing settings. Inspired by real medical
imaging datasets, we identify and formulate a new and more realistic data
distribution denoted as L2 distribution where global class distribution is
highly imbalanced and data distributions across clients are imbalanced but
forming a certain degree of data agglomeration. To pursue effective FL under
this distribution, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework named FedIIC
that calibrates deep models to alleviate bias caused by imbalanced training. To
calibrate the feature extractor part, intra-client contrastive learning with a
modified similarity measure and inter-client contrastive learning guided by
shared global prototypes are introduced to produce a uniform embedding
distribution of all classes across clients. To calibrate the classification
heads, a softmax cross entropy loss with difficulty-aware logit adjustment is
constructed to ensure balanced decision boundaries of all classes. Experimental
results on publicly-available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
FedIIC in dealing with both the proposed realistic modeling and the existing
modeling of the two coupling problems.

voice characteristics. A speaker is verified if his/her voice embedding is
sufficiently similar to the embedding of the claimed speaker. However, such
approaches assume that only a single speaker exists in the input. The presence
of concurrent speakers is likely to have detrimental effects on the
performance. To address SV in a multi-speaker environment, we propose an
end-to-end deep learning-based SV system that detects whether the target
speaker exists within an input or not. First, an embedding is estimated from a
reference utterance to represent the target's characteristics. Second,
frame-level features are estimated from the input mixture. The reference
embedding is then fused frame-wise with the mixture's features to allow
distinguishing the target from other speakers on a frame basis. Finally, the
fused features are used to predict whether the target speaker is active in the

definition for any number of vectors in high dimensional spaces whose metric
matrices are the unit matrices. In fact, we can also define the cross product

integers larger than 1 and m must not be larger than n. In this paper, we give
the definition of the cross product of m vectors in n-dimensional spaces whose
metric matrices are any real symmetric or Hermitian matrices, and put forward
two theorems related to matrices, so as to perfectly explain the geometric

Furthermore, the length of the cross product represents the m-dimensional
volume of the parallel polyhedron spanned by the m vectors, and the absolute
value of each component of the cross product represents each component of the
volume in different directions. Specially, in the high dimensional Euclidean

decomposition of the volume still satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, and the
cross product of n vectors in an n-dimensional space is the determinant of the
square matrix which is formed with these n vectors as row or column vectors. We
also explain the geometric meaning of the determinants of the metric matrices

density in air that is 400 times greater. Conclusively, IPT can transmit more
power than CPT over greater distances in air, but what about other media? This
paper gives an answer on how media, different from air, influence the power
transfer over different distances. First, we analyze theoretically the
capacitive coupling with different media in the gap. Next, we simulate the CPT

enthalpies of many configurations for different lattices in the whole Al-Li-Cu

stable phases in the convex hull. They were fitted with a cluster expansion to
calculate the free energy of the configurations with different compositions as
a function of temperature in the Al-rich region (Al content > 40 at. %) by
means of Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that the ground state phases in
the Al-rich part of the Al-Li-Cu phase diagram were {\alpha}-Al, {\theta}'
(Al2Cu), {\delta}' (Al3Li), {\delta} (AlLi) and T1 (Al6Cu4Li3), while
{\theta}'' (Al3Cu), T1' (Al2CuLi) and Al3Cu2Li were found on the lowest mixing
enthalpy surfaces of their lattices and were metastable. {\alpha}-Al, {\delta}
and T1 are stable phases in the whole temperature range while {\delta}' becomes
metastable at very low temperature and {\theta} (Al2Cu) replaces {\theta}' as
the stable phase at approximately 550 K due to the vibrational entropic
contribution. In addition, the phase diagram in the Al-rich region was built
and it was shown in isothermal sections from 100 K to 900 K. They were in good
agreement with the limited experimental data in the literature and provided new
information regarding the stability, solubility and stoichiometry of the
different phases. This information is important to understand the precipitation
mechanisms during high temperature aging.

correspond to users and edges have a sign that indicates whether an interaction
between users was positive or negative. The arising signed graphs typically
contain a clear community structure in the sense that the graph can be
partitioned into a small number of polarized communities, each defining a
sparse cut and indivisible into smaller polarized sub-communities. We provide a
local clustering oracle for signed graphs with such a clear community
structure, that can answer membership queries, i.e., ""Given a vertex $v$, which
community does $v$ belong to?"", in sublinear time by reading only a small
portion of the graph. Formally, when the graph has bounded maximum degree and
the number of communities is at most $O(\log n)$, then with
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ preprocessing time, our
oracle can answer each membership query in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ time, and it correctly
classifies a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of vertices w.r.t. a set of hidden
planted ground-truth communities. Our oracle is desirable in applications where
the clustering information is needed for only a small number of vertices.
Previously, such local clustering oracles were only known for unsigned graphs;
our generalization to signed graphs requires a number of new ideas and gives a
novel spectral analysis of the behavior of random walks with signs. We evaluate
our algorithm for constructing such an oracle and answering membership queries
on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating its performance in
practice.

multivariate time series forecasting, where the interactions of time series are
described as a graph structure and the variables are represented as the graph
nodes. Along this line, existing methods usually assume that the graph
structure (or the adjacency matrix), which determines the aggregation manner of
graph neural network, is fixed either by definition or self-learning. However,
the interactions of variables can be dynamic and evolutionary in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, the interactions of time series are quite different if
they are observed at different time scales. To equip the graph neural network
with a flexible and practical graph structure, in this paper, we investigate
how to model the evolutionary and multi-scale interactions of time series. In
particular, we first provide a hierarchical graph structure cooperated with the
dilated convolution to capture the scale-specific correlations among time
series. Then, a series of adjacency matrices are constructed under a recurrent
manner to represent the evolving correlations at each layer. Moreover, a
unified neural network is provided to integrate the components above to get the
final prediction. In this way, we can capture the pair-wise correlations and
temporal dependency simultaneously. Finally, experiments on both single-step
and multi-step forecasting tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
the state-of-the-art approaches.

morphoelasticity, which combines solid mechanics and growth, we successively
refine our assumptions to develop a somewhat minimal model of mechanically
regulated spheroid growth that is free from many unphysical and undesirable
behaviours. In doing so, we will see how iterating upon simple models can
provide rigorous guarantees of emergent behaviour, which are often precluded by
existing, more complex modelling approaches. Perhaps surprisingly, we also
demonstrate that the final model considered in this tutorial agrees favourably
with classical experimental results, highlighting the potential for simple
models to provide mechanistic insight whilst also serving as mathematical

physics. Following our previous work, the multi-scale framework based on
gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) and unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method (UGKWP)
for the gas-particle system is firstly extended to the three-dimensional
simulation of the fluidized bed. For the solid particle evolution, different
from the widely-used Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, the UGKWP unifies the
wave (dense particle region) and discrete particle (dilute particle region)
formulation seamlessly according to a continuous variation of particle cell's
Kundsen number ($Kn$). The GKS-UGKWP for the coupled gas-particle evolution
system can automatically become an Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) method in the high
particle collision regime and Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) formulation in the
collisionless particle regime. In the transition regime, the UGKWP can achieve
a smooth transition between the Eulerian and Lagrangian limiting formulation.
More importantly, the weights of mass distributions from analytical wave and
discrete particle are related to the local $Kn$ by $\exp(-1/Kn)$ for wave and
$(1-\exp(-1/Kn))$ for discrete particle. As a result, the UGKWP provides an
optimal modeling for capturing the particle phase in terms of physical accuracy
and numerical efficiency. In the numerical simulation, the UGKWP does not need
any prior division of dilute/dense regions, which makes it suitable for the
fluidized bed problem, where the dilute/transition/dense regions
instantaneously coexist and are dynamically interconvertible. In this paper,
based on the GKS-UGKWP formulation two lab-scale fluidization cases are
simulated in 3D and the simulation results are compared with the experimental
measurements. The typical heterogeneous flow features of the fluidized bed are
well captured and the statistics are in good agreement with experiment data.

and give Python interfaces to boost execution speed; hence, testing these
libraries becomes critical to the project's robustness. One challenge is that
existing approaches use coverage to guide generation, but native libraries run
as black boxes to Python code with no execution information. Another is that
dynamic binary instrumentation reduces testing performance as it needs to
monitor both native libraries and the Python virtual machine.
  To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an automated test case
generation approach that works at the Python code layer. Our insight is that
many path conditions in native libraries are for processing input data
structures through interacting with the VM. In our approach, we instrument the
Python Interpreter to monitor the interactions between native libraries and VM,
derive constraints on the structures, and then use the constraints to guide
test case generation. We implement our approach in a tool named PyCing and
apply it to six widely-used Python projects. The experimental results reveal
that with the structure constraint guidance, PyCing can cover more execution
paths than existing test cases and state-of-the-art tools. Also, with the
checkers in the testing framework Pytest, PyCing can identify segmentation
faults in 10 Python interfaces and memory leaks in 9. Our instrumentation
strategy also has an acceptable influence on testing efficiency.

  Issue 1, Article 2","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/2",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Gradually-typed languages allow typed and untyped code to
interoperate, but typically come with significant drawbacks. In some languages,
the types are unreliable; in others, communication across type boundaries can
be extremely expensive; and still others allow only limited forms of
interoperability. The research community is actively seeking a sound, fast, and
expressive approach to gradual typing.
  Inquiry: This paper describes Static Python, a language developed by
engineers at Instagram that has proven itself sound, fast, and reasonably
expressive in production. Static Python's approach to gradual types is
essentially a programmer-tunable combination of the concrete and transient
approaches from the literature. Concrete types provide full soundness and low
performance overhead, but impose nonlocal constraints. Transient types are
sound in a shallow sense and easier to use; they help to bridge the gap between
untyped code and typed concrete code.
  Approach: We evaluate the language in its current state and develop a model
that captures the essence of its approach to gradual types. We draw upon
personal communication, bug reports, and the Static Python regression test
suite to develop this model.
  Knowledge: Our main finding is that the gradual soundness that arises from a
mix of concrete and transient types is an effective way to lower the
maintenance cost of the concrete approach. We also find that method-based JIT
technology can eliminate the costs of the transient approach. On a more
technical level, this paper describes two contributions: a model of Static
Python and a performance evaluation of Static Python. The process of
formalization found several errors in the implementation, including fatal
errors.
  Grounding: Our model of Static Python is implemented in PLT Redex and tested
using property-based soundness tests and 265 tests from the Static Python
regression suite. This paper includes a small core of the model to convey the
main ideas of the Static Python approach and its soundness. Our performance
claims are based on production experience in the Instagram web server.
Migrations to Static Python in the server have caused a 3.7\% increase in
requests handled per second at maximum CPU load.
  Importance: Static Python is the first sound gradual language whose
piece-meal application to a realistic codebase has consistently improved
performance. Other language designers may wish to replicate its approach,
especially those who currently maintain unsound gradual languages and are
seeking a path to soundness.

of high signal-to-noise UVES spectra. We determined stellar parameters from
Gaia photometry and parallaxes. Chemical abundances were derived using spectrum
synthesis and model atmospheres.Results. We determined chemical abundances of
26 species of 18 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Zr. For several stars, we were able to measure both neutral

number of measurements of Cu for stars at [Fe/H] <= -2.5. The homogeneity of
the sample made it possible to highlight the presence of two Zn-rich stars
([Zn/Fe]~+0.7), one r-rich and the other r-poor. We report the existence of two
branches in the [Zn/Fe] versus [Ni/Fe] plane and suggest that the high [Zn/Fe]
branch is the result of hypernova nucleosynthesis. We discovered two stars with
peculiar light neutron-capture abundance patterns: CES1237+1922 (also known as
BS 16085-0050), which is ~1 dex underabundant in Sr, Y, and Zr with respect to
the other stars in the sample, and CES2250-4057 (also known as HE 2247-4113),
which shows a ~1 dex overabundance of Sr with respect to Y and Zr.Conclusions.
The high quality of our dataset allowed us to measure hardly detectable ions.

manifestations to their birth scenarios, influencing their thermal and magnetic
field evolution. Among the kind of observed neutron stars, radio pulsars
represent by far the largest population of neutron stars. In this paper, we aim
at constraining the observed population of the canonical neutron star period,
magnetic field and spatial distribution at birth in order to understand the
radio and high-energy emission processes in a pulsar magnetosphere. For this
purpose we design a population synthesis method self-consistently taking into
account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere and the magnetic
field decay. We generate a population of pulsars and evolve them from their
birth to the present time, working in the force-free approximation. We assume a
given initial distribution for the spin period, surface magnetic field and
spatial galactic location. Radio emission properties are accounted by the polar
cap geometry, whereas the gamma-ray emission is assumed to be produced within
the striped wind model. We found that a decaying magnetic field gave better
agreement with observations compared to a constant magnetic field model.
Starting from an initial mean magnetic field strength of $B=2.5\times 10^8$~T
with a characteristic decay timescale of $4.6 \times 10^5~$yr, a neutron star
birth rate of $1/70~$yr and a mean initial spin period of 60~ms, we found that
the force-free model satisfactorily reproduces the distribution of pulsars in
the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram with simulated populations of radio-loud, radio-only
and radio quiet gamma-ray pulsars similar to the observed populations.

striking features of the observed primary black hole mass distributions are the
extended tail up to 100M$_\odot$ and an excess of masses at 35M$_\odot$.
Currently, isolated binary population synthesis have difficulty explaining
these features. Using the well-tested BPASS detailed stellar binary evolution
models to determine mass transfer stability, accretion rates, and remnant
masses, we postulate that stable mass transfer with super-Eddington accretion
is responsible for the extended tail. Furthermore, that the excess is not due
to pulsation-pair instability, as previously thought, but due to stable mass
transfer. These systems are able to merge within the Hubble time due to more
stable mass transfer with extreme mass ratios that allows the orbits to shrink
sufficiently to allow for a merger. These finding are at odds with those from
other population synthesis codes but in agreement with other recent studies
using detailed binary evolution models.

vector databases are necessary. In the past three years, through interaction
with our 1200+ industry users, we have sketched a vision for the features that
next-generation vector databases should have, which include long-term
evolvability, tunable consistency, good elasticity, and high performance. We
present Manu, a cloud native vector database that implements these features. It
is difficult to integrate all these features if we follow traditional DBMS
design rules. As most vector data applications do not require complex data
models and strong data consistency, our design philosophy is to relax the data
model and consistency constraints in exchange for the aforementioned features.
Specifically, Manu firstly exposes the write-ahead log (WAL) and binlog as
backbone services. Secondly, write components are designed as log publishers
while all read-only analytic and search components are designed as independent
subscribers to the log services. Finally, we utilize multi-version concurrency
control (MVCC) and a delta consistency model to simplify the communication and
cooperation among the system components. These designs achieve a low coupling
among the system components, which is essential for elasticity and evolution.
We also extensively optimize Manu for performance and usability with

orbits of charged particles must stay on invariant tori of conserved energy in
the moving frame of reference of a wave that propagates along the torus with a
fixed angular phase velocity. In principle, this is true for arbitrary mode
structures in the poloidal plane, but only if the fluctuations are expressed in
terms of potentials $\Phi$ and ${\bf A}$, which satisfy Faraday's law by
definition. Here, we use the physical fields ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf B}$, where
Faraday's law may be violated by errors introduced during the process of
computing or designing the wave field through numerical inaccuracies,
approximations, or gross negligence. Numerical heating caused by noise-like
artifacts on the grid scale can to some extent be reduced via shorter time
steps. In contrast, coherent inconsistencies between ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf B}$
cause spurious acceleration that is independent of time steps or numerical
methods, but can be sensitive to geometry. In particular, we show that secular
acceleration is enhanced when one imposes nonnormal modes that possess strong
up-down asymmetry instead of the usual in-out asymmetry of normal toroidal
(eigen)modes. Our tests are performed for full gyroorbit and guiding center
(GC) models, which give similar results. In addition, we show that $N$-point
gyroaveraging is not a recommendable method to enhance the realism of GC
simulations. Besides breaking conservation laws, $N$-point gyroaveraging in our
example makes the GC results deviate further from the full orbit results,
showing that this method can even give the wrong trend.

system is the usual method of tracking its exceptional points. Although, such a
method is successful for tracking EPs in Markovian systems, it may be
problematic in non-Markovian systems where a closed expression of the effective
Hamiltonian describing the open system may not exist. In this work we provide
an alternative method of tracking EPs in open quantum systems, using an
experimentally measurable quantity, namely the effective decay rate of a qubit.
The quantum system under consideration consists of two non-identical
interacting qubits, one of which is coupled to an external environment. We
develop a theoretical framework in terms of the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation of motion, which provides analytical closed form solutions of the
Laplace transforms of the qubit amplitudes for an arbitrary spectral density of
the boundary reservoir. The link between the peaked structure of the effective
decay rate of the qubit that interacts indirectly with the environment, and the
onset of the quantum Zeno effect, is discussed in great detail revealing the
connections between the latter and the presence of exceptional points. Our
treatment and results have in addition revealed an intricate interplay between
non-Markovian dynamics, quantum Zeno effect and non-Hermitian physics

estimation can yield accurate trajectories without needing ground-truth
training data. However, as they typically use photometric losses, their
performance can degrade significantly when the assumptions these losses make
(e.g. temporal illumination consistency, a static scene, and the absence of
noise and occlusions) are violated. This limits their use for e.g. nighttime
sequences, which tend to contain many point light sources (including on dynamic
objects) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in darker image regions. In this
paper, we show how to use a combination of three techniques to allow the
existing photometric losses to work for both day and nighttime images. First,
we introduce a per-pixel neural intensity transformation to compensate for the
light changes that occur between successive frames. Second, we predict a
per-pixel residual flow map that we use to correct the reprojection
correspondences induced by the estimated ego-motion and depth from the
networks. And third, we denoise the training images to improve the robustness
and accuracy of our approach. These changes allow us to train a single model
for both day and nighttime images without needing separate encoders or extra
feature networks like existing methods. We perform extensive experiments and
ablation studies on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset to demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach for both day and nighttime sequences.

explicit as it is assumed that the model of computation is the RAM (Random
Access Machine) model. However, the RAM model itself is ill-founded in the
literature, with disparate definitions and no unified results.
  The ambition of this paper is to found the RAM model from scratch by
exhibiting a RAM model that enjoys interesting algorithmic properties and the
robustness of its complexity classes, notably LIN, the class of linear-time
computable problems, or the now well-known CONST-DELAY-lin class of enumeration
problems computable with constant delay after linear-time preprocessing,
  The computation model that we define is a RAM whose contents and addresses of
registers are $O(N)$, where $N$ is the size (number of registers) of the input,
and where the time cost of each instruction is 1 (unit cost criterion). The key
to the foundation of our RAM model will be to prove that even if addition is
the only primitive operation, such a RAM can still compute all the basic
arithmetic operations in constant time after a linear-time preprocessing.
Moreover, while the RAM handles only $O(N)$ integers in each register, we will
show that our RAM can handle $O(N^d)$ integers, for any fixed d, by storing
them on $O(d)$ registers and we will have surprising algorithms that computes
many operations acting on these ""polynomial"" integers -- addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponential, integer logarithm, integer square root
(or $c$-th root, for any integer $c$), bitwise logical operations, and, more
generally, any operation computable in linear time on a cellular automaton --

of droplets can trigger an avalanche of coalescence events that propagate
through the entire emulsion. This propagation is found to be stochastic, i.e.
every coalescence event does not necessarily trigger another. To study how the
local probabilistic propagation affects the dynamics of the avalanche, as a
whole, a stochastic agent based model is used. Taking as input, i) how the
droplets are packed (configuration) and ii) a measure of local probabilistic
propagation (experimentally derived; function of fluid and other system
parameters), the model predicts the expected size distribution of avalanches.
In this article, we investigate how droplet configuration affects the avalanche
dynamics. We find the mean size of these avalanches to depend non-trivially on
how droplets are packed together. Large variations in the avalanche dynamics
are observed when droplet packing are different, even when the other system
properties (number of droplets, fluid properties, channel geometry, etc.) are
kept constant. Bidisperse emulsions show less variation in the dynamics and
they are surprisingly more stable than monodisperse emulsions. To get a
systems-level understanding of how a given droplet-configuration either
facilitates or impedes the propagation of an avalanche, we employ a
graph-theoretic analysis, where emulsions are expressed as graphs. We find that
the properties of the underlying graph, namely the mean degree and the
algebraic connectivity, are well correlated with the observed avalanche
dynamics. We exploit this dependence to derive a data-based model that predicts
the expected avalanche sizes from the properties of the graph.

the stock price is very high during both positive and negative EE with
$IE>E_{\mu}+4\sigma,$ where $E_{\mu}$ and $\sigma$ are the mean energy and
standard deviation of energy, respectively. Further, support vector regression
is used to predict the stock price during an EE, with the close price being the
most helpful input than the open-high-low-close (OHLC) inputs. The maximum
prediction accuracy for one step using close price and OHLC prices are 95.98\%

speech insertion task that facilitates arbitrary-length speech insertion and
even full sentence generation. In the proposed paradigm, global and local
factors in speech are explicitly decomposed and separately manipulated to
achieve high speaker similarity and continuous prosody. Specifically, we
proposed to represent the global factors by multiple tokens, which are
extracted by cross-attention operation and then injected back by link-attention
operation. Due to the rich representation of global factors, we manage to
achieve high speaker similarity in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we
introduce a prosody smoothing task to make the local prosody factor
context-aware and therefore achieve satisfactory prosody continuity. We further
achieve high voice quality with an adversarial training stage. In the
subjective test, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
naturalness and similarity. Audio samples can be found at

have been observed in protoplanetary discs with (sub-)millimetre imaging. Here,
we investigate the growth of a planetary embryo in a massive (150M$_\oplus$)
axisymmetric dust trap through dust and gas hydrodynamics simulations. When
accounting for the accretion luminosity of the planetary embryo from pebble
accretion, the thermal feedback on the surrounding gas leads to the formation
of an anticyclonic vortex. Since the vortex forms at the location of the
planet, this has significant consequences for the planet's growth: as dust
drifts towards the pressure maximum at the centre of the vortex, which is
initially co-located with the planet, a rapid accretion rate is achieved, in a
distinct phase of ``vortex-assisted'' pebble accretion. Once the vortex
separates from the planet due to interactions with the disc, it accumulates
dust, shutting off accretion onto the planet. We find that this rapid
accretion, mediated by the vortex, results in a planet containing $\approx$
100M$_\oplus$ of solids. We follow the evolution of the vortex, as well as the
efficiency with which dust grains accumulate at its pressure maximum as a
function of their size, and investigate the consequences this has for the
growth of the planet as well as the morphology of the protoplanetary disc. We
speculate that this extreme formation scenario may be the origin of giant
planets which are identified to be significantly enhanced in heavy elements.

we investigate the near-threshold dynamics of the pseudoscalar quarkonium pairs
in a coupled-channel approach in the di-$\eta_c$ channel. We show that the
Pomeron exchange mechanism should be a general dynamics in the near-threshold
heavy quarkonium pair interactions. In the di-$\eta_c$ channel, a
coupled-channel system involving the di-$\eta_c$, $\eta_c$-$\eta_c(2S)$ and
di-$\eta_c(2S)$ interactions can be established. Their $S$-wave interactions
near threshold via the Pomeron exchange potential can produce near-threshold
resonance poles similar to the di-$J/\psi$, $J/\psi$-$\psi(2S)$ and
di-$\psi(2S)$ coupled channels. Interestingly, we find here that the pole
positions are more shifted to the corresponding thresholds and turn out to be
different from those seen in the di-$J/\psi$ spectrum. Taking into account the
suppression of the heavy quark spin flips in the transitions between two vector
and two pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium systems, the enhancements in the
di-$\eta_c$ spectrum should be different from those seen in the di-$J/\psi$
channel. Experimental study of the di-$\eta_c$ channel should be useful for
disentangling the nature of the fully-heavy tetraquark systems.

not assume that the domains studied are Cauchy-complete with respect to the
Kobayashi distance, as this is hard to establish for domains in $\mathbb{C}^d$,
$d \geq 2$. We study the various ways in which this property controls the
boundary behavior of holomorphic maps. Among these results is a
Carath\'eodory-type extension theorem for biholomorphisms between planar

connections between our visibility property and Gromov hyperbolicity of the

detected by different radio instruments before September 2021. Using the
Anderson--Darling test, we compared the distributions of extra-Galactic
dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm E}$) of non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs and all
FRBs. It was found that the $ DM_{\rm E}$ values of three sub-samples are
log-normally distributed. The $DM_{\rm E}$ of repeaters and non-repeaters were
drawn from a different distribution on basis of the Mann--Whitney--Wilcoxon
test. In addition, assuming that the non-repeating FRBs identified currently
may be potentially repeators, i.e., the repeating FRBs to be universal and
representative, one can utilize the averaged fluence of repeating FRBs as an
indication from which to derive an apparent intensity distribution function
(IDF) with a power-law index of $a_1=$ $1.10\pm 0.14$ ($a_2=$ $1.01\pm 0.16$,
the observed fluence as a statistical variant), which is in good agreement with
the previous IDF of 16 non-repeating FRBs found by Li et al. Based on the above
statistics of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, we propose that both types of
FRBs may have different cosmological origins, spatial distributions and

discovery should be identifiable, meaning that a number of known concepts can
be provably recovered to guarantee reliability of the explanations. As a
starting point, we explicitly make the connection between concept discovery and
classical methods like Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component
Analysis by showing that they can recover independent concepts under
non-Gaussian distributions. For dependent concepts, we propose two novel
approaches that exploit functional compositionality properties of
image-generating processes. Our provably identifiable concept discovery methods
substantially outperform competitors on a battery of experiments including
hundreds of trained models and dependent concepts, where they exhibit up to 29
% better alignment with the ground truth. Our results highlight the strict
conditions under which reliable concept discovery without human labels can be
guaranteed and provide a formal foundation for the domain. Our code is

novel CSI sensing scheme that can significantly reduce the feedback overhead.
Our scheme involves a novel parameter dimension reduction design by exploiting
the spatial consistency of wireless channels among nearby UEs, and a
constrained PR (CPR) formulation that characterizes the feasible region of CSI
by the PMI information. To address the computational challenge due to the
non-convexity and the large number of constraints of CPR, we develop a
two-stage algorithm that firstly identifies and removes inactive constraints,
followed by a fast first-order algorithm. The study is further extended to
multi-carrier systems. Extensive tests over DeepMIMO and QuaDriGa datasets
showcase that our designs greatly outperform existing methods and achieve the

redundant or noisy instances. The problem to be solved is how to select
representative instances from large training data sets without reducing the
accuracy. This work presents a new parallel instance selection algorithm called
Parallel Instance Filtering (PIF). The main idea of the algorithm is to split
the data set into non-overlapping subsets of instances covering the whole data
set and apply a filtering process for each subset. Each subset consists of
instances that have the same nearest enemy. As a result, the PIF algorithm is
fast since subsets are processed independently of each other using parallel
computation. We compare the PIF algorithm with several state-of-the-art
instance selection algorithms on a large data set of 500,000 malicious and
benign samples. The feature set was extracted using static analysis, and it
includes metadata from the portable executable file format. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed instance selection algorithm reduces the
size of a training data set significantly with the only slightly decreased
accuracy. The PIF algorithm outperforms existing instance selection methods
used in the experiments in terms of the ratio between average classification
accuracy and storage percentage.

for the Poisson's equation in the Vlasov-Poisson system that yields a
reduced-order particle-in-cell scheme. This scheme allows a remarkable
reduction in the computational cost of self-consistent kinetic simulations of
Hall thrusters. The formulation of the dimensionality reduction approach,
together with its verification for a general Poisson's problem, is presented.
Moreover, we show the results of several ""quasi-2D"" axial-azimuthal simulations
we performed with the conditions of a well-established 2D3V reference case.
Comparison between the results of the quasi-2D simulations and the reference
case revealed that our method is able to resolve accurately the axial
distributions of the intensive plasma parameters. In addition, the
characteristics of the azimuthal instabilities observed from the quasi-2D
simulation are shown to be closely in line with those reported in the
literature. Accordingly, the reduced-order PIC scheme is verified as a viable,
low-computational-cost alternative to the traditional multi-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations of Hall thrusters.

  Journal on Imaging Sciences (SIIMS)",,,,"stat.CO stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Developing efficient Bayesian computation algorithms for imaging inverse
problems is challenging due to the dimensionality involved and because Bayesian
imaging models are often not smooth. Current state-of-the-art methods often
address these difficulties by replacing the posterior density with a smooth
approximation that is amenable to efficient exploration by using Langevin
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. An alternative approach is based on
data augmentation and relaxation, where auxiliary variables are introduced in
order to construct an approximate augmented posterior distribution that is
amenable to efficient exploration by Gibbs sampling. This paper proposes a new
accelerated proximal MCMC method called latent space SK-ROCK (ls SK-ROCK),
which tightly combines the benefits of the two aforementioned strategies.
Additionally, instead of viewing the augmented posterior distribution as an
approximation of the original model, we propose to consider it as a
generalisation of this model. Following on from this, we empirically show that
there is a range of values for the relaxation parameter for which the accuracy
of the model improves, and propose a stochastic optimisation algorithm to
automatically identify the optimal amount of relaxation for a given problem. In
this regime, ls SK-ROCK converges faster than competing approaches from the
state of the art, and also achieves better accuracy since the underlying
augmented Bayesian model has a higher Bayesian evidence. The proposed
methodology is demonstrated with a range of numerical experiments related to
image deblurring and inpainting, as well as with comparisons with alternative
approaches from the state of the art. An open-source implementation of the
proposed MCMC methods is available from
https://github.com/luisvargasmieles/ls-MCMC.

the recovery of low- to middle-income countries to become reliant on foreign

Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement advocate for more resilient financial
instruments like sovereign catastrophe risk pools. Existing pools, however,
might not fully exploit financial resilience potentials because they were not
designed with the goal of maximizing risk diversification and they pool risk
only regionally. To address this, we introduce a method that forms pools
maximizing risk diversification and which selects countries with low bilateral
correlations or low shares in the pool risk. We apply the method to explore the
benefits of global pooling with respect to regional pooling. We find that
global pooling increases risk diversification, it lowers countries shares in
the pool risk and it increases the number of countries profiting from risk
pooling.

image generation and reconstruction tasks. The principal characteristic of
introspective models is the adversarial learning of VAE, where the encoder
attempts to distinguish between the real and the fake (i.e., synthesized)
images. However, due to the unavailability of an effective metric to evaluate
the difference between the real and the fake images, the posterior collapse and
the vanishing gradient problem still exist, reducing the fidelity of the
synthesized images. In this paper, we propose a new variation of IntroVAE
called Adversarial Similarity Distance Introspective Variational Autoencoder
(AS-IntroVAE). We theoretically analyze the vanishing gradient problem and
construct a new Adversarial Similarity Distance (AS-Distance) using the
2-Wasserstein distance and the kernel trick. With weight annealing on
AS-Distance and KL-Divergence, the AS-IntroVAE are able to generate stable and
high-quality images. The posterior collapse problem is addressed by making
per-batch attempts to transform the image so that it better fits the prior
distribution in the latent space. Compared with the per-image approach, this
strategy fosters more diverse distributions in the latent space, allowing our
model to produce images of great diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AS-IntroVAE on image
generation and reconstruction tasks.

that provides each voter with the option of either voting directly or to
delegate their vote to another voter, i.e., to a representative of their
choice. One of the proposed advantages of liquid democracy is that, in general,
it is assumed that voters will delegate their vote to others that are better
informed, which leads to more informed and better decisions. Considering an
audience from various knowledge domains, we provide an accessible high-level
analysis of a prominent critique of liquid democracy by Caragiannis and Micha.
Caragiannis and Micha's critique contains three central topics: 1. Analysis
using their $\alpha$-delegation model, which does not assume delegation to the
more informed; 2. Novel delegation network structures where it is advantageous
to delegate to the less informed rather than the more informed; and 3. Due to
NP hardness, the implied impracticability of a social network obtaining an
optimal delegation structure. We show that in the real world, Caragiannis and
Micha's critique of liquid democracy has little or no relevance. Respectively,
our critique is based on: 1. The identification of incorrect
$\alpha$-delegation model assumptions; 2. A lack of novel delegation structures
and their effect in a real-world implementation of liquid democracy, which
would be guaranteed with constraints that sensibly distribute voting power; and
3. The irrelevance of an optimal delegation structure if the correct result is
guaranteed regardless. We conclude that Caragiannis and Micha's critique has no
significant negative relevance to the proposition of liquid democracy.

the concurrent recording of the acoustic emission (AE) signals emitted from the

homogeneous distribution of basal dislocation loops that lead to hardening of
the sample as well as strain softening due to dislocation channeling at larger
strains. With the used deformation protocol strain burst sizes were found to be
decreased due to channeling. The concurrently recorded AE events were
correlated with the strain bursts and their analysis provided additional
information of the details of collective dislocation dynamics. It was found
that the rate of AE events decreased significantly upon irradiation, however,
other statistical properties did not change. This was attributed to the
appearance of a new type of plastic events dominated by short-range
dislocation-obstacle interactions that cannot be detected by AE sensors.

We study two notions of convexity for signed tropical numbers called
'TO-convexity' (formerly 'signed tropical convexity') and the novel notion
'TC-convexity'. We derive several separation results for TO-convexity and
TC-convexity. A key ingredient is a thorough understanding of TC-hemispaces -
those TC-convex sets whose complement is also TC-convex. Furthermore, we use
new insights in the interplay between convexity over Puiseux series and its
signed valuation. Remarkably, TC-convexity can be seen as a natural convexity
notion for representing oriented matroids as it is arises from a generalization
of the composition operation of vectors in an oriented matroid.

recently investigated in a systematic way, and it is known to be decidable
under three distinct semantics (state-based, trace-based and tree-based
semantics). Here, we focus on the trace-based semantics, where the main
semantic entities are the infinite execution paths (traces) of the given Kripke
structure, assuming in addition homogeneity in the propositional valuation. We
introduce a quantitative extension of HS over traces, called Difference HS
(DHS) allowing one to express timing constraints on the difference among
interval lengths (durations). The quantitative extension of some modalities
leads immediately to undecidability, so, we investigate the decidability border
for the model checking and satisfiability problems by considering strict
syntactical fragments of DHS. In particular, we identify the maximal decidable
fragment DHSS of DHS proving in addition that the considered problems for the
fragment are at least 2EXPSPACE-hard. Moreover, by exploiting new results on
linear-time hybrid logics, we show that for an equally expressive fragment of
DHSS, the problems are EXPSPACE-complete. Finally, we provide a
characterization of HS over traces by means of the one-variable fragment of a
novel hybrid logic.

system is the $^{40}$Ca nucleus which is excited through the Coulomb
interaction by $^{16}$O. Particle acceleration term in Li\'enard-Wiechert
potential is discussed which, however, has small impact on magnetic field. The
peak energy, strength and width of GDR, temperature, and angular momentum of
$^{40}$Ca as a function of beam energy are investigated. It is found that the
magnetic field enhances the peak energy, strength and width of GDR which is not
only due to the temperature effects but also due to the enhancement of the
angular momentum of nucleus. At beam energy {E} $>$ 200 MeV/nucleon, magnetic
field maintains a constant value for the strength of GDR. The work sheds light
on examining important roles of the magnetic field on nuclear structure in
low-intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions.

(Single Label One-Vs-All) model redefines typical one-vs-all predictive
probabilities to a single label situation, where only one class is the correct
answer. The proposed classifier is confident only if a single class has a high
probability and other probabilities are negligible. Unlike the typical softmax
function, SLOVA naturally detects out-of-distribution samples if the
probabilities of all other classes are small. The model is additionally
fine-tuned with exponential calibration, which allows us to precisely align the
confidence score with model accuracy. We verify our approach on three tasks.
First, we demonstrate that SLOVA is competitive with the state-of-the-art on
in-distribution calibration. Second, the performance of SLOVA is robust under
dataset shifts. Finally, our approach performs extremely well in the detection
of out-of-distribution samples. Consequently, SLOVA is a tool that can be used

systems by probes launched using directed energy is addressed. Multiple probes
are launched with a fixed launch infrastructure, and download of scientific
data occurs following target encounter and data collection. Assuming the
primary goal is to reliably recover a larger volume of collected scientific
data with a smaller data latency (elapsed time from launch to complete recovery
of the data), it is shown that there is an efficient frontier where volume
cannot be increased for a given latency and latency cannot be reduced for a
given volume. For each probe launch, increasing the volume along this frontier
is achieved by increasing the probe mass, which results in a reduced probe
speed. Thus choosing the highest feasible probe speed generally does not
achieve an efficient tradeoff of volume and latency. Along this frontier the
total distance traveled to the completion of data download does not vary
significantly, implying that the download time duration is approximately a
fixed fraction of the launch-to-target transit time. Due to longer propulsion
duration when probe mass is increased, increasing data volume incurs a cost in
the total launch energy expended, but with favorable economies of scale. An
important characteristic of any probe technology is the scaling law that
relates probe mass to transmit data rate, as this affects details of the
efficient frontier.

X-ray AGNs at $\rm z \geq3.5$ selected in three fields with different depths
and observed areas (Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, XMM-XXL North and eFEDS). We
built their spectral energy distributions (SED) using available
multi-wavelength photometry from X-rays up to far-IR. Then, we estimated the
stellar mass, M$_{*}$, and the SFR of the AGNs using the X-CIGALE SED fitting
algorithm. After applying several quality criteria, we ended up with 89 high-z
sources. More than half (55\%) of the X-ray sample have spectroscopic
redshifts. Based on our analysis, our high-z X-ray AGNs live in galaxies with
median $\rm M_{*}=5.6 \times10^{10}~M_\odot$ and $\rm
SFR_{*}\approx240\,M_\odot yr^{-1}$. The majority of the high-z sources
($\sim89$\%) were found inside or above the main sequence (MS) of star-forming
galaxies. Estimation of the normalised SFR, $\rm SFR_{NORM}$, defined as the
ratio of the SFR of AGNs to the SFR of MS galaxies, showed that the SFR of AGNs
is enhanched by a factor of $\sim 1.8$ compared to non-AGN star-forming
systems. Combining our results with previous studies at lower redshifts, we
confirmed that $\rm SFR_{NORM}$ does not evolve with redshift. Using the
specific BHAR (i.e., $\rm L_X$ divided by $\rm M_{*}$), $\rm \lambda _{BHAR}$,
that can be used as a tracer of the Eddington ratio, we found that the bulk of
AGNs that lie inside or above the MS have higher specific accretion rates
compared to sources below the MS. Finally, we found indications that the SFR of

remains roughly constant as a function of M$_*$, in agreement with the SFR of

  Zhang","RAW-GNN: RAndom Walk Aggregation based Graph Neural Network",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-Convolution-based methods have been successfully applied to
representation learning on homophily graphs where nodes with the same label or
similar attributes tend to connect with one another. Due to the homophily
assumption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that these methods use, they
are not suitable for heterophily graphs where nodes with different labels or
dissimilar attributes tend to be adjacent. Several methods have attempted to
address this heterophily problem, but they do not change the fundamental
aggregation mechanism of GCNs because they rely on summation operators to
aggregate information from neighboring nodes, which is implicitly subject to
the homophily assumption. Here, we introduce a novel aggregation mechanism and
develop a RAndom Walk Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (called RAW-GNN)
method. The proposed approach integrates the random walk strategy with graph
neural networks. The new method utilizes breadth-first random walk search to
capture homophily information and depth-first search to collect heterophily
information. It replaces the conventional neighborhoods with path-based
neighborhoods and introduces a new path-based aggregator based on Recurrent
Neural Networks. These designs make RAW-GNN suitable for both homophily and
heterophily graphs. Extensive experimental results showed that the new method
achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of homophily and heterophily
graphs.

central issue in Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a result, many formalisms
have been proposed or adapted so as to consider non-monotonicity, with only a
limited number of works and researchers performing any sort of comparison among
them. A non-monotonic formalism is one that allows the retraction of previous
conclusions or claims, from premises, in light of new evidence, offering some
desirable flexibility when dealing with uncertainty. This research article
focuses on evaluating the inferential capacity of defeasible argumentation, a
formalism particularly envisioned for modelling non-monotonic reasoning. In
addition to this, fuzzy reasoning and expert systems, extended for handling
non-monotonicity of reasoning, are selected and employed as baselines, due to
their vast and accepted use within the AI community. Computational trust was
selected as the domain of application of such models. Trust is an ill-defined
construct, hence, reasoning applied to the inference of trust can be seen as
non-monotonic. Inference models were designed to assign trust scalars to
editors of the Wikipedia project. In particular, argument-based models
demonstrated more robustness than those built upon the baselines despite the
knowledge bases or datasets employed. This study contributes to the body of
knowledge through the exploitation of defeasible argumentation and its
comparison to similar approaches. The practical use of such approaches coupled
with a modular design that facilitates similar experiments was exemplified and
their respective implementations made publicly available on GitHub [120, 121].
This work adds to previous works, empirically enhancing the generalisability of
defeasible argumentation as a compelling approach to reason with quantitative
data and uncertain knowledge.

experimentation faces a practical challenge: the relative reward of different

it may no longer be relevant to minimise regret. We present a solution to
handling non-stationarity that is suitable for deployment at scale, to provide
business operators with automated adaptive optimisation. Our solution aims to
provide interpretable learning that can be trusted by humans, whilst responding
to non-stationarity to minimise regret. To this end, we develop an adaptive
Bayesian learning agent that employs a novel form of dynamic memory. It enables
interpretability through statistical hypothesis testing, by targeting a set
point of statistical power when comparing rewards and adjusting its memory
dynamically to achieve this power. By design, the agent is agnostic to
different kinds of non-stationarity. Using numerical simulations, we compare
its performance against an existing proposal and show that, under multiple
non-stationary scenarios, our agent correctly adapts to real changes in the
true rewards. In all bandit solutions, there is an explicit trade-off between
learning and achieving maximal performance. Our solution sits on a different
point on this trade-off when compared to another similarly robust approach: we
prioritise interpretability, which relies on more learning, at the cost of some
regret. We describe the architecture of a large-scale deployment of automatic
optimisation-as-a-service where our agent achieves interpretability whilst
adapting to changing circumstances.

low-quality ones and usually resorts to facial priors for improving restoration
performance. However, current methods still suffer from two major difficulties:
1) how to derive a powerful network architecture without extensive hand tuning;
2) how to capture complementary information from multiple facial priors in one
network to improve restoration performance. To this end, we propose a Face
Restoration Searching Network (FRSNet) to adaptively search the suitable
feature extraction architecture within our specified search space, which can
directly contribute to the restoration quality. On the basis of FRSNet, we
further design our Multiple Facial Prior Searching Network (MFPSNet) with a
multi-prior learning scheme. MFPSNet optimally extracts information from
diverse facial priors and fuses the information into image features, ensuring
that both external guidance and internal features are reserved. In this way,
MFPSNet takes full advantage of semantic-level (parsing maps), geometric-level
(facial heatmaps), reference-level (facial dictionaries) and pixel-level
(degraded images) information and thus generates faithful and realistic images.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that MFPSNet performs favorably

become one of the most promising biometric features for human identification.
As a fine-grained recognition task, gait recognition is easily affected by many
factors and usually requires a large amount of completely annotated data that
is costly and insatiable. This paper proposes a large-scale self-supervised
benchmark for gait recognition with contrastive learning, aiming to learn the
general gait representation from massive unlabelled walking videos for
practical applications via offering informative walking priors and diverse
real-world variations. Specifically, we collect a large-scale unlabelled gait
dataset GaitLU-1M consisting of 1.02M walking sequences and propose a
conceptually simple yet empirically powerful baseline model GaitSSB.
Experimentally, we evaluate the pre-trained model on four widely-used gait
benchmarks, CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D with or without transfer
learning. The unsupervised results are comparable to or even better than the
early model-based and GEI-based methods. After transfer learning, our method
outperforms existing methods by a large margin in most cases. Theoretically, we
discuss the critical issues for gait-specific contrastive framework and present
some insights for further study. As far as we know, GaitLU-1M is the first

of reconstructing geophysical fields from sparse measurements. Our method
consists of two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the variability of the
physical field as a function of spatial coordinates by approximating its
information entropy through the Conditional PixelCNN network. To calculate the
entropy, a new ordering of a two-dimensional data array (spiral ordering) is
proposed, which makes it possible to obtain the entropy of a physical field
simultaneously for several spatial scales. In the second stage, the entropy of
the physical field is used to initialize the distribution of optimal sensor
locations. This distribution is further optimized with the Concrete Autoencoder
architecture with the straight-through gradient estimator and adversarial loss
to simultaneously minimize the number of sensors and maximize reconstruction
accuracy. Our method scales linearly with data size, unlike commonly used
Principal Component Analysis. We demonstrate our method on the two examples:
(a) temperature and (b) salinity fields around the Barents Sea and the Svalbard
group of islands. For these examples, we compute the reconstruction error of
our method and a few baselines. We test our approach against two baselines (1)
PCA with QR factorization and (2) climatology. We find out that the obtained
optimal sensor locations have clear physical interpretation and correspond to
the boundaries between sea currents.

communication efficiency of model aggregation. However, the
information-theoretic minimum communication cost for a given distortion of
gradient estimators is still unknown. In this paper, we study the fundamental
limit of communication cost of model aggregation in distributed learning from a
rate-distortion perspective. By formulating the model aggregation as a vector
Gaussian CEO problem, we derive the rate region bound and sum-rate-distortion
function for the model aggregation problem, which reveals the minimum
communication rate at a particular gradient distortion upper bound. We also
analyze the communication cost at each iteration and total communication cost
based on the sum-rate-distortion function with the gradient statistics of
real-world datasets. It is found that the communication gain by exploiting the
correlation between worker nodes is significant for SignSGD, and a high
distortion of gradient estimator can achieve low total communication cost in
gradient compression.

extend previous exact studies beyond the one-dimensional limit to ladder

different physical systems, from solid-state to cold atoms. We find a
non-trivial dependence of the conductance of these systems on the chemical
potential of the reservoirs. We then introduce a semi-classical approach that

intuitive and simpler interpretation of transport in quantum stochastic

superfluid density in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ films decreases on the overdoped
side as a linear function of critical temperature T$_c$, which was taken as
evidence for the violation of the Homes' law. We show explicitly that the law
is indeed violated, and as the main reason for violation we find that the
superfluid density in Bo\v{z}ovi\'{c}'s films is suppressed more strongly than
in bulk samples. Based on the existing literature data, we show that the
superfluid density in bulk cuprate samples does not decrease with doping, but
instead tends to saturate on the overdoped side. The result is also supported
by our recent measurement of a heavily overdoped bulk La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$
sample. Moreover, this saturation of superfluid density might not be limited to
cuprates, as we find evidence for similar behavior in two pnictide
superconductor families. We argue that quantum phase fluctuations play an
important role in suppressing the superfluid density in thin films.

object only contains a few pixels. State-of-the-art object detectors do not
provide satisfactory results on tiny objects due to the lack of supervision
from discriminative features. Our key observation is that the Intersection over
Union (IoU) metric and its extensions are very sensitive to the location
deviation of the tiny objects, which drastically deteriorates the quality of
label assignment when used in anchor-based detectors. To tackle this problem,
we propose a new evaluation metric dubbed Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD)
and a new RanKing-based Assigning (RKA) strategy for tiny object detection. The
proposed NWD-RKA strategy can be easily embedded into all kinds of anchor-based
detectors to replace the standard IoU threshold-based one, significantly
improving label assignment and providing sufficient supervision information for
network training. Tested on four datasets, NWD-RKA can consistently improve
tiny object detection performance by a large margin. Besides, observing
prominent noisy labels in the Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images (AI-TOD)
dataset, we are motivated to meticulously relabel it and release AI-TOD-v2 and
its corresponding benchmark. In AI-TOD-v2, the missing annotation and location
error problems are considerably mitigated, facilitating more reliable training

performance achieves 4.3 AP points improvement over state-of-the-art

requirement dramatically reduces the number of parameters to learn for the

much easier than that of SATNet. We also describe a technique for automatically

paper, we consider designing a multicarrier (MC) modulation on delay-Doppler
(DD) plane, to couple the modulated signal with a doubly-selective channel
having DD resolutions. A key challenge for the design of DD plane MC modulation
is to investigate whether a realizable pulse orthogonal with respect to the DD
plane's fine resolutions exists or not. To this end, we first indicate that a
feasible DD plane MC modulation is essentially a type of staggered multitone
modulation. Then, analogous to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, we
propose an orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation,
and design the corresponding transmit pulse. Furthermore, we prove that the
proposed transmit pulse is orthogonal with respect to the DD plane's
resolutions and therefore a realizable DD plane orthogonal pulse does exist.
The orthogonality of this particular pulse significantly eases the derivation
of the ODDM's DD domain channel input-output relation, and yields a channel
matrix with an elegant block-circulant-like structure. We demonstrate that the
ODDM outperforms the OTFS in terms of out-of-band emission and bit error rate,
by achieving perfect coupling between the modulated signal and the DD channel.

Current methods of parameter estimation do not include all physical effects of

typically assumes a power-law relationship between inputs and outputs, we find
that an exponential increase in computing power is needed to get linear
improvements in these outcomes. This helps clarify why the exponential growth
of computing power from Moore's Law has been so important for progress, and why
performance improvements across many domains are becoming economically tenuous
as Moore's Law breaks down.

sector of the vacuum experiences two consecutive crossover transitions
associated with dramatic changes in the zero-temperature dynamics of the vector
W bosons and the scalar Higgs particles, respectively. Above the first
crossover, we observe the appearance of large, inhomogeneous structures
consistent with a classical picture of the formation of W and Z condensates
pierced by vortices. The presence of the W and Z condensates supports the
emergence of the exotic superconducting and superfluid properties induced by a
strong magnetic field in the vacuum. We find evidence that the vortices form a
disordered solid or a liquid rather than a crystal. The second transition
restores the electroweak symmetry. Such conditions can be realized in the
near-horizon region of the magnetized black holes.

mediated by genetic information bridges this barrier, which establishes the
link between macro-morphology and micro-molecular information of mushrooms. The
novel multi-perspective structure is proposed to fuse the feature images from
three branching models, which significantly improves the accuracy of
recognition by about 10% and up to more than 90%. Further, genetic information
is implemented to the mushroom image recognition task by using genetic distance
embeddings as the representation space for predicting image distance and
species identification. Semantic overfitting of traditional classification
tasks and the granularity of fine-grained image recognition are also discussed
in depth for the first time. The generalizability of the model was investigated
in fine-grained scenarios using zero-shot learning tasks, which could predict
the taxonomic and evolutionary information of unseen samples. We presented the
first method to map images to DNA, namely used an encoder mapping image to
genetic distances, and then decoded DNA through a pre-trained decoder, where
the total test accuracy on 37 species for DNA prediction is 87.45%. This study
creates a novel recognition framework by systematically studying the mushroom
image recognition problem, bridging the gap between macroscopic biological

well described via conventional means and could not be explained as an

needed to both describe the results that were obtained and to predict the
samples' other material properties. This process was approached by using the
transfer-matrix method to describe the spectral reflectance based on the
constituent materials, and then the dispersion method was used to find the
composite index of refraction for the samples. The models successfully
described pure Cu but encountered minor difficulties when it came to AlOx, as
such, more research is needed to either properly model non-holomorphic
materials like AlOx with the current algorithm or to find a better model that
can adequately describe both Cu and AlOx. The dispersion model implemented
predicts that the samples, composed of many thin film layers of metal and
dielectric, would display semiconductor-like behavior. Therefore, this
indicates that SALAD's combination of sputtering and ALD permits the generation
of novel metal-dielectric based semiconductors.

even when surface forms of mentions and entities differ. Moreover, our probing
procedure is entirely unsupervised and requires no additional parameters.
Extensive experiments show that our framework sets new state-of-the-art
performance on three benchmarks. We empirically verify that our probing

experiments can give a scope to observe such a Planck-suppressed physics of

Protvino to ORCA (dubbed ""P2O"") with a baseline of 2595 km, is expected to
provide good sensitivities to unresolved issues, especially neutrino mass
ordering. P2O can offer good statistics even with a moderate beam power and
runtime, owing to the very large ($\sim 6$ Mt) detector volume at KM3NeT/ ORCA.
Here we discuss in detail, how the individual LIV parameters affect neutrino
oscillations at P2O and DUNE baselines at the level of probability and derive
analytical expressions to understand interesting degeneracies and other
features. We estimate $\Delta \chi^{2}$ sensitivities to the LIV parameters,
analyzing their correlations among each other, and also with the standard
oscillation parameters. We calculate these results for P2O alone and also carry
out a combined analysis of P2O with DUNE. We point out crucial features in the
sensitivity contours and explain them qualitatively with the help of the
relevant probability expressions derived here. Finally, we estimate constraints
on the individual LIV parameters at $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) intervals
stemming from the combined analysis of P2O and DUNE datasets and highlight the
improvement over the existing constraints. We also find out that the additional

relativistic many-body calculations including the configuration interaction
(CI), linearized coupled-cluster single-doubles (SD) and many-body perturbation
theory (CI+SD), and also the configuration interaction with perturbation theory
(CIPT). Scalar polarizabilities of the ground states and the clock states have
been calculated to determine the black body radiation (BBR) shifts. We have
found that the relative BBR shifts for these transitions range between
10$^{-16}$ $-$ 10$^{-18}$. A linear combination of two clock transition
frequencies allows one to further suppress BBR. Several $5d$ - $6s$
single-electron clock transitions ensure high sensitivity of the transition
frequencies to the variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ and may be
used to search for dark matter producing this variation of $\alpha$. The
enhancement coefficient for $\alpha$ variation reaches $K=8.3$. Six stable
isotopes of Hf and 5 stable isotopes in W allow one to make King plots and
search for new interactions mediated by scalar particles or other mechanisms.

gapless fractonic theories -- is to pedagogically fill in the gaps between the
research on fractons, and an undergraduate physics education (particularly
quantum and statistical mechanics). Some familiarity with classical field
theory is assumed. We will begin this work by reviewing the gauging of the
Ising model to obtain the toric code. Then, following the chronological order
of fracton research, we will establish the gauged spin model picture of gapped
fracton theories. Next (after introducing lattice gauge theory) we will cover
the developments on the tensor gauge theory front in describing gapless fracton
theories. We then explain how conservation of dipole moment is key in the
development of field-theoretic descriptions of fracton models, and conclude by
providing future plans for work on gauging such field theories. Finally, we
point out two more future plans: one being an established theoretical advance
which in fact inspired this work, and the other being exciting experimental
advances in ultracold atomic physics which could lead to the physical
realization of fracton physics. Highlights of this work include: a derivation
of the gauge field dynamics (field strength/curvature) term in the gauging of a
spin system to obtain the toric code, a reduction of the 3 terms of the
Kogut-Susskind lattice QED Hamiltonian to the 2 terms of the toric code, a
proof of the correspondence between the invariance of a gauge field and a
particular Gauss's law constraint in a tensor gauge theory context, a
demonstration that conservation of dipole moment accounts for the same
immobility/fractalization phenomenology that we also show from a gauged spin
model perspective, and proof of the necessity for polynomial shift symmetries
and higher-order spatial derivatives in a Lagrangian in order to have dipole
moment conservation.

number, e.g. by reducing the viscosity of the fluid), the rate of the
dissipation of kinetic energy decreases but does not tend asymptotically to
zero: it levels off to a non-zero constant as smaller and smaller vortical flow
structures are generated. This fundamental property, called the dissipation
anomaly, is sometimes referred to as the zeroth law of turbulence. The question
of what happens in the limit of vanishing viscosity (purely hypothetical in
classical fluids) acquires a particular physical significance in the context of
liquid helium, a quantum fluid which becomes effectively inviscid at low
temperatures achievable in the laboratory. By performing numerical simulations
and identifying the superfluid Reynolds number, here we show evidence for a
superfluid analog to the classical dissipation anomaly. Our numerics indeed
show that as the superfluid Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller
structures are generated on the quantized vortex lines on which the superfluid
vorticity is confined, balancing the effect of weaker and weaker dissipation.

polynomial blow-up rates $O(1/r^N)$ for various quantities, and extend the
results in [5] by the first author and Zhang and the arguments in [3] by the

the estimates of $r\partial_u r$ and $r\partial_v r$ in [5] and prove that the
spacelike singularities where $r(u,v)=0$ are $C^{1,1/3}$ in $(u,v)$

upper bounds of fluid velocity and density for the hard-phase model of the
Einstein-Euler system under irrotational assumption. Near the timelike

rates of the Kretschmann scalar to the exponential Price's law along the event

interest. The dynamic contact angle changes with the capillary number defined
by the contact-line speed, and the correlation also depends on the equilibrium
contact angle measured at the static state. This correlation is usually
required as an input to the traditional solvers based on the Navier-Stokes-like
equations, but it is simulated as an output in the current study using the
lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in a displacement process of two-immiscible
fluids. The macroscopic theory and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation had
shown a linear scaling law for the cosine of dynamic contact angle, which is
also observed in the previous LBM study in a short range of small capillary
numbers and for two neutral wetting conditions. However, our study shows that
this linear scaling law holds in the whole range of capillary numbers and is
universal for all wetting conditions. In a special case of complete wetting
(spreading) with a zero equilibrium contact angle, a thin film of the wetting
fluid occurs when the wettability is very strong, which leads to a hysteresis
that substantial capillary number is required to initiate the deviation of the
dynamic contact angle from its equilibrium state. This observation is
consistent with the previous report on a new mechanism for the static contact
angle hysteresis due to the presence of free liquid films. With an increasing
capillary number, the fluid-fluid interface starts oscillating before
fingering. Different fingering patterns are observed for cases with different
equilibrium contact angles.

high-quality BaZrO$_3$ single crystals grown by the optical floating zone

synapses of the cerebral cortex. In computing practice, STP has been used, but
mostly in the niche of spiking neurons, even though theory predicts that it is
the optimal solution to certain dynamic tasks. Here we present a new type of
recurrent neural unit, the STP Neuron (STPN), which indeed turns out strikingly
powerful. Its key mechanism is that synapses have a state, propagated through
time by a self-recurrent connection-within-the-synapse. This formulation
enables training the plasticity with backpropagation through time, resulting in
a form of learning to learn and forget in the short term. The STPN outperforms
all tested alternatives, i.e. RNNs, LSTMs, other models with fast weights, and
differentiable plasticity. We confirm this in both supervised and reinforcement
learning (RL), and in tasks such as Associative Retrieval, Maze Exploration,
Atari video games, and MuJoCo robotics. Moreover, we calculate that, in
neuromorphic or biological circuits, the STPN minimizes energy consumption
across models, as it depresses individual synapses dynamically. Based on these,
biological STP may have been a strong evolutionary attractor that maximizes
both efficiency and computational power. The STPN now brings these neuromorphic
advantages also to a broad spectrum of machine learning practice. Code is

of changes to a business process on its performance measures. For example, BPS
allows us to estimate what would be the cycle time of a process if we automated
one of its activities. The starting point of BPS is a business process model
annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model). Several studies have
proposed methods to automatically discover BPS models from event logs via
process mining. However, current techniques in this space discover BPS models
that only capture waiting times caused by resource contention or resource
unavailability. Oftentimes, a considerable portion of the waiting time in a
business process is caused by extraneous delays, e.g. a resource waits for the
customer to return a phone call. This paper proposes a method that discovers
extraneous delays from input data, and injects timer events into a BPS model to
capture the discovered delays. An empirical evaluation involving synthetic and
real-life logs shows that the approach produces BPS models that better reflect
the temporal dynamics of the process, relative to BPS models that do not
capture extraneous delays.

tool, broadly used in many applications. Often, the selected (deep)
architectures include many layers, and therefore a large amount of parameters,
which makes training, storage and inference expensive. This motivated a stream
of research about compressing the original networks into smaller ones without
excessively sacrificing performances. Among the many proposed compression
approaches, one of the most popular is \emph{pruning}, whereby entire elements
of the ANN (links, nodes, channels, \ldots) and the corresponding weights are
deleted. Since the nature of the problem is inherently combinatorial (what
elements to prune and what not), we propose a new pruning method based on
Operational Research tools. We start from a natural Mixed-Integer-Programming
model for the problem, and we use the Perspective Reformulation technique to
strengthen its continuous relaxation. Projecting away the indicator variables
from this reformulation yields a new regularization term, which we call the
Structured Perspective Regularization, that leads to structured pruning of the
initial architecture. We test our method on some ResNet architectures applied
to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, obtaining competitive
performances w.r.t.~the state of the art for structured pruning.

  Reward-free RL","Accepted by ICLR 2023",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reward-free reinforcement learning (RF-RL), a recently introduced RL
paradigm, relies on random action-taking to explore the unknown environment
without any reward feedback information. While the primary goal of the
exploration phase in RF-RL is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated model
with minimum number of trajectories, in practice, the agent often needs to
abide by certain safety constraint at the same time. It remains unclear how
such safe exploration requirement would affect the corresponding sample
complexity in order to achieve the desired optimality of the obtained policy in
planning. In this work, we make a first attempt to answer this question. In
particular, we consider the scenario where a safe baseline policy is known
beforehand, and propose a unified Safe reWard-frEe ExploraTion (SWEET)
framework. We then particularize the SWEET framework to the tabular and the
low-rank MDP settings, and develop algorithms coined Tabular-SWEET and
Low-rank-SWEET, respectively. Both algorithms leverage the concavity and
continuity of the newly introduced truncated value functions, and are
guaranteed to achieve zero constraint violation during exploration with high
probability. Furthermore, both algorithms can provably find a near-optimal
policy subject to any constraint in the planning phase. Remarkably, the sample
complexities under both algorithms match or even outperform the state of the
art in their constraint-free counterparts up to some constant factors, proving
that safety constraint hardly increases the sample complexity for RF-RL.

passage problem in the space of cluster configurations. We find the optimal
policy to set the macroscopic field as a function of the observed shape using
dynamic programming. Our results show that the optimal policy is non-unique,
and its degeneracy is mainly related to symmetries shared by the initial shape,
the force and the target shape. The total fraction of shapes for which optimal
choice of the force is non-unique vanishes as the cluster size increases.
Furthermore, the optimal policy exhibits a discrete set of transitions when the
temperature is varied. Each transition leads to a discontinuity in the
derivative of the time to reach with target with respect to temperature. As the
size of the cluster increases, the change in the policy due to temperature
transitions grows like the total number of configurations and a continuum limit
emerges.

propose FuSeBMC v4, a test generator that synthesizes seeds with useful

hybrid fuzzer thereby achieving high C program coverage. FuSeBMC works by first
analyzing and incrementally injecting goal labels into the given C program to
guide BMC and Evolutionary Fuzzing engines. It ranks these goal labels
according to a user-defined strategy. After that, the engines are employed for
an initial period to produce the so-called smart seeds. Finally, the engines
are run again, with these smart seeds as starting seeds, in an attempt to
achieve maximum code coverage / find bugs. During both seed generation and
normal running, coordination between the engines is aided by the Tracer
subsystem. This subsystem carries out additional coverage analysis and updates
a shared memory with information on goals covered so far. Furthermore, the
Tracer evaluates test cases dynamically to convert cases into seeds for
subsequent test fuzzing. Thus, the BMC engine can provide the seed that allows
the fuzzing engine to bypass complex mathematical guards (e.g., input
validation). As a result, we received three awards for participation in the

address such recovery problems, we propose using equivariant generative models

Thereby, we show that signals with unknown orientations can be recovered with

selection effects which bias the observed population of events. Software
injection systems are one method of correcting for these biases by injecting a
mock population of synthetic FRBs directly into the realtime search pipeline.
The injected population may then be used to map intrinsic burst properties onto
an expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), so long as telescope characteristics
such as the beam model and calibration factors are properly accounted for. This
paper presents an injection system developed for the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB). The system
was tested to ensure high detection efficiency, and the pulse calibration
method was verified. Using an injection population of ~85,000 synthetic FRBs,
we found that the correlation between fluence and SNR for injected FRBs was
consistent with that of CHIME/FRB detections in the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We
also noted that the sensitivity of the telescope varied strongly as a function
of the broadened burst width, but not as a function of the dispersion measure.
We conclude that some of the machine-learning based Radio Frequency

injection data to increase sensitivity to wide events, and that planned
upgrades to the presented injection system will allow for determining a more

been used to model various real-world phenomena. However, they are notoriously
difficult to solve to optimality, and there exist only a few approximation
methods for obtaining high-quality solutions. In this study, grid-based
approximations are used in combination with linear programming (LP) models to
generate approximate policies for CPOMDPs. A detailed numerical study is
conducted with six CPOMDP problem instances considering both their finite and
infinite horizon formulations. The quality of approximation algorithms for
solving unconstrained POMDP problems is established through a comparative
analysis with exact solution methods. Then, the performance of the LP-based
CPOMDP solution approaches for varying budget levels is evaluated. Finally, the
flexibility of LP-based approaches is demonstrated by applying deterministic
policy constraints, and a detailed investigation into their impact on rewards
and CPU run time is provided. For most of the finite horizon problems,
deterministic policy constraints are found to have little impact on expected
reward, but they introduce a significant increase to CPU run time. For infinite
horizon problems, the reverse is observed: deterministic policies tend to yield
lower expected total rewards than their stochastic counterparts, but the impact
of deterministic constraints on CPU run time is negligible in this case.
Overall, these results demonstrate that LP models can effectively generate
approximate policies for both finite and infinite horizon problems while
providing the flexibility to incorporate various additional constraints into
the underlying model.

learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This
phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is often difficult to
prevent due to practical constraints, such as the amount of data that can be
stored or the limited computation sources that can be used. Moreover, training
large neural networks, such as Transformers, from scratch is very costly and
requires a vast amount of training data, which might not be available in the
application domain of interest. A recent trend indicates that dynamic
architectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic
forgetting efficiently in continual learning, but this needs complex tuning to
balance the growing number of parameters and barely share any information
across tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks
without significant overhead. In this paper, we validate in the computer vision

attention as a target quantity of machine-learning models. A natural choice to
construct a model that yields transferable and linear-scaling predictions is to
represent the scalar field using a multi-centered atomic basis analogous to
that routinely used in density fitting approximations. However, the
non-orthogonality of the basis poses challenges for the learning exercise, as
it requires accounting for all the atomic density components at once. We devise
a gradient-based approach to directly minimize the loss function of the
regression problem in an optimized and highly sparse feature space. In so
doing, we overcome the limitations associated with adopting an atom-centered
model to learn the electron density over arbitrarily complex datasets,
obtaining extremely accurate predictions. The enhanced framework is tested on
32-molecule periodic cells of liquid water, presenting enough complexity to
require an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. We
show that starting from the predicted density a single Kohn-Sham
diagonalization step can be performed to access total energy components that
carry an error of just 0.1 meV/atom with respect to the reference density
functional calculations. Finally, we test our method on the highly

centered around a few established benchmark suites. Alternatively, they can be
learned from feature and performance data produced during compilation. However,
data-driven compiler optimizations based on machine learning models require
large sets of quality data for training in order to match or even outperform
existing human-crafted heuristics. In static compilation setups, related work
has addressed this problem with iterative compilation. However, a dynamic
compiler may produce different data depending on dynamically-chosen compilation
strategies, which aggravates the generation of comparable data. We propose
compilation forking, a technique for generating consistent feature and
performance data from arbitrary, dynamically-compiled programs. Different
versions of program parts with the same profiling and compilation history are
executed within single program runs to minimize noise stemming from dynamic
compilation and the runtime environment. Our approach facilitates large-scale
performance evaluations of compiler optimization decisions. Additionally,
compilation forking supports creating domain-specific compilation strategies
based on machine learning by providing the data for model training. We
implemented compilation forking in the GraalVM compiler in a
programming-language-agnostic way. To assess the quality of the generated data,
we trained several machine learning models to replace compiler heuristics for
loop-related optimizations. The trained models perform equally well to the
highly-tuned compiler heuristics when comparing the geometric means of
benchmark suite performances. Larger impacts on few single benchmarks range
from speedups of 20% to slowdowns of 17%. The presented approach can be
implemented in any dynamic compiler. We believe that it can help to analyze
compilation decisions and leverage the use of machine learning into dynamic

multi-scale feature fusion promotes local and global coherence and has become a
de facto design principle for networks targeting spatially sensitive tasks,
e.g., HRNet (Sun et al., 2019a) and EfficientDet (Tan et al., 2020). These
networks achieve state-of-the-art results across various computer vision tasks
when paired with high-resolution inputs. However, training them requires
substantial accelerator memory for saving large, multi-resolution activations.
These memory requirements inherently cap the size of neural networks, limiting
improvements that come from scale. Operating across resolution scales, RevSilo
alleviates these issues. Stacking RevSilos, we create RevBiFPN, a fully
reversible bidirectional feature pyramid network. RevBiFPN is competitive with
networks such as EfficientNet while using up to 19.8x lesser training memory
for image classification. When fine-tuned on MS COCO, RevBiFPN provides up to a

characterized by three peaks containing a multitude of broadband arcs or
partial arcs in the time-frequency domain. In general, the arcs are highly
right-hand circularly polarized. During end of the third peak, brief bursts
occur that are significantly elliptically polarized. We present a simple model
that appears to be broadly consistent with the characteristics of the radio
emission from UV Cet. Briefly, the stellar magnetic field is modeled as a
dipole aligned with the rotational axis of the star. The radio emission
mechanism is assumed to be due to the cyclotron maser instability where x-mode
radiation near the electron gyrofrequency is amplified. While the elliptically
polarized bursts may be intrinsic to the source, rather stringent limits are
imposed on the plasma density in the source and along the propagation path. We
suggest that the elliptically polarized radiation may instead be the result of
reflection on an over-dense plasma structure at some distance from the source.
Radio emission from UV~Cet shares both stellar and planetary attributes.

configuration in the superfluid phase, we predict vortex nucleation as the

near-optimal in terms of the synaptic lifetime and we demonstrate that a
network comprising FN-synapses outperforms a comparable EWC network for a small

conductance is desirable which can be achieved by simultaneously using thin
membranes and wide pores. In this paper we demonstrate ICR in micron sized
conical channels in a thin silicon membrane with pore diameters comparable to
the membrane thickness but both much larger than the electrolyte screening
length. We show that for these pores the entrance resistance is not only key to
Ohmic conductance around 0 V, but also for understanding ICR, both of which we
measure experimentally and capture within a single analytic theoretical
framework. The only fit parameter in this theory is the membrane surface
potential, for which we find that it is voltage dependent and its value is
excessively large compared to literature. From this we infer that surface
charge outside the pore strongly contributes to the observed Ohmic conductance
and rectification by a different extent. We experimentally verify this
hypothesis in a small array of pores and find that ICR vanishes due to
pore-pore interactions mediated through the membrane surface, while Ohmic
conductance around 0 V remains unaffected. We find that the pore-pore
interaction for ICR is set by a long-ranged decay of the concentration which
explains the surprising finding that the ICR vanishes for even a sparsely
populated array with a pore-pore spacing as large as 7 $\mu$m.

  Issue 1, Article 1","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/1",,"cs.SE cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The software supply chain is becoming a widespread analogy to designate the
series of steps taken to go from source code published by developers to
executables running on the users? computers. A security vulnerability in any of
these steps puts users at risk, and evidence shows that attacks on the supply
chain are becoming more common. The consequences of an attack on the software
supply chain can be tragic in a society that relies on many interconnected
software systems, and this has led research interest as well as governmental
incentives for supply chain security to rise.
  GNU Guix is a software deployment tool and software distribution that
supports provenance tracking, reproducible builds, and reproducible software
environments. Unlike many software distributions, it consists exclusively of
source code: it provides a set of package definitions that describe how to
build code from source. Together, these properties set it apart from many
deployment tools that center on the distribution of binaries.
  This paper focuses on one research question: how can Guix and similar systems
allow users to securely update their software? Guix source code is distributed
using the Git version control system; updating Guix-installed software packages
means, first, updating the local copy of the Guix source code. Prior work on
secure software updates focuses on systems very different from Guix -- systems
such as Debian, Fedora, or PyPI where updating consists in fetching metadata
about the latest binary artifacts available -- and is largely inapplicable in
the context of Guix. By contrast, the main threats for Guix are attacks on its
source code repository, which could lead users to run inauthentic code or to
downgrade their system. Deployment tools that more closely resemble Guix, from
Nix to Portage, either lack secure update mechanisms or suffer from
shortcomings.
  Our main contribution is a model and tool to authenticate new Git revisions.
We further show how, building on Git semantics, we build protections against
downgrade attacks and related threats. We explain implementation choices. This
work has been deployed in production two years ago, giving us insight on its
actual use at scale every day. The Git checkout authentication at its core is
applicable beyond the specific use case of Guix, and we think it could benefit
to developer teams that use Git.
  As attacks on the software supply chain appear, security research is now
looking at every link of the supply chain. Secure updates are one important
aspect of the supply chain, but this paper also looks at the broader context:
how Guix models and implements the supply chain, from upstream source code to
binaries running on computers. While much recent work focuses on attestation --
certifying each link of the supply chain -- Guix takes a more radical approach:
enabling independent verification of each step, building on reproducible
builds, ""bootstrappable"" builds, and provenance tracking. The big picture shows
how Guix can be used as the foundation of secure software supply chains.

In this work, we focus on UQ of ML models as a preliminary step of ML VVUQ,
more specifically, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) because they are the most widely
used supervised ML algorithm for both regression and classification tasks. This
work aims at quantifying the prediction, or approximation uncertainties of DNNs
when they are used as surrogate models for expensive physical models. Three
techniques for UQ of DNNs are compared, namely Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Deep
Ensembles (DE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Two nuclear engineering
examples are used to benchmark these methods, (1) time-dependent fission gas
release data using the Bison code, and (2) void fraction simulation based on
the BFBT benchmark using the TRACE code. It was found that the three methods
typically require different DNN architectures and hyperparameters to optimize
their performance. The UQ results also depend on the amount of training data
available and the nature of the data. Overall, all these three methods can
provide reasonable estimations of the approximation uncertainties. The
uncertainties are generally smaller when the mean predictions are close to the
test data, while the BNN methods usually produce larger uncertainties than MCD
and DE.

of the user to click on an item, has become increasingly significant in the

automatically extract the user interest from his/her behaviors have achieved
great success. In these work, the attention mechanism is used to select the
user interested items in historical behaviors, improving the performance of the
CTR predictor. Normally, these attentive modules can be jointly trained with
the base predictor by using gradient descents. In this paper, we regard user
interest modeling as a feature selection problem, which we call user interest
selection. For such a problem, we propose a novel approach under the framework
of the wrapper method, which is named Meta-Wrapper. More specifically, we use a
differentiable module as our wrapping operator and then recast its learning
problem as a continuous bilevel optimization. Moreover, we use a meta-learning
algorithm to solve the optimization and theoretically prove its convergence.
Meanwhile, we also provide theoretical analysis to show that our proposed
method 1) efficiencies the wrapper-based feature selection, and 2) achieves
better resistance to overfitting. Finally, extensive experiments on three

calculating the transport coefficient, the shear viscosity, associated with the
effective field theory whose dual is a black hole space-time in bulk. The
correspondence also allows us to compute thermodynamic quantities, in which the
entropy, plays a prominent role when the ratio between the shear
viscosity-to-entropy density is taken. This ratio is conjectured to have a
minimum value of $1/4{\pi}$, in natural units. The main results presented in
this thesis consist of calculating the ratio for two different cases, and then
applying the KSS conjecture - which establishes the minimum value for the ratio
-, to investigate properties associated with the deformed space-time metrics. A
brief review of General Relativity and Black Holes is presented. The so-called
Brane World formalism is introduced, obtaining the equivalent of Einstein's
equations and Black Hole solutions on the brane, which can be seen as
extensions of solutions known in General Relativity. We discuss the formulation
of AdS/CFT correspondence, and how to apply it to compute transport
coefficients. Then applying this knowledge to compute transport coefficients
associated with the solutions constituting an extension of General Relativity.

questions arise, therefore we include two studies related to these
developments. In one we investigate the computation of transport coefficients

  Learning Models in Radiology with Heatmap Generators",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As deep learning is widely used in the radiology field, the explainability of
such models is increasingly becoming essential to gain clinicians' trust when
using the models for diagnosis. In this research, three experiment sets were
conducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the classification performance
while enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through
incorporating heatmap generators during training. All of the experiments used
the dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the
three conditions (""normal"", ""congestive heart failure (CHF)"", and ""pneumonia""),
and numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the
images. The paper (A. Karargyris and Moradi, 2021) that introduced this dataset
developed a U-Net model, which was treated as the baseline model for this
research, to show how the eye-gaze data can be used in multi-modal training for
explainability improvement. To compare the classification performances, the 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of
0.913 (CI: 0.860-0.966). The greatest improvements were for the ""pneumonia"" and
""CHF"" classes, which the baseline model struggled most to classify, resulting
in AUCs of 0.859 (CI: 0.732-0.957) and 0.962 (CI: 0.933-0.989), respectively.
The proposed method's decoder was also able to produce probability masks that
highlight the determining image parts in model classifications, similarly as
the radiologist's eye-gaze data. Hence, this work showed that incorporating
heatmap generators and eye-gaze information into training can simultaneously
improve disease classification and provide explainable visuals that align well
with how the radiologist viewed the chest radiographs when making diagnosis.

enables cross-silo data cooperation in a privacy-preserving manner. While most
research works in VFL focus on linear and tree models, deep models (e.g.,
neural networks) are not well studied in VFL. In this paper, we focus on
SplitNN, a well-known neural network framework in VFL, and identify a trade-off
between data security and model performance in SplitNN. Briefly, SplitNN trains
the model by exchanging gradients and transformed data. On the one hand,
SplitNN suffers from the loss of model performance since multiply parties
jointly train the model using transformed data instead of raw data, and a large
amount of low-level feature information is discarded. On the other hand, a
naive solution of increasing the model performance through aggregating at lower
layers in SplitNN (i.e., the data is less transformed and more low-level
feature is preserved) makes raw data vulnerable to inference attacks. To
mitigate the above trade-off, we propose a new neural network protocol in VFL
called Security Forward Aggregation (SFA). It changes the way of aggregating
the transformed data and adopts removable masks to protect the raw data.
Experiment results show that networks with SFA achieve both data security and
high model performance.

Collecting MDT data in different geographical areas is inefficient and
constrained by the terrain conditions and user presence, hence is not an
adequate technique for dynamic radio environments. In this paper, we study a
generative model for RSRP prediction, exploiting MDT data and a digital twin
(DT), and propose a data-driven, two-tier neural network (NN) model. In the
first tier, environmental information related to user equipment (UE), base
stations (BS) and network key performance indicators (KPI) are extracted
through a variational autoencoder (VAE). The second tier is designed as a
likelihood model. Here, the environmental features and real MDT data features
are adopted, formulating an integrated training process. On validation, our
proposed model that uses real-world data demonstrates an accuracy improvement
of about 20% or more compared with the empirical model and about 10% when
compared with a fully connected prediction network.

image data downlink scheduling problem (D-SIDSP) which combines two interlinked
operations of image data segmentation and image data downlink, in a dynamic
way, and thereby offering additional modelling flexibility and renewed
capabilities. D-SIDSP is formulated as a bi-objective problem of optimizing the
image data transmission rate and the service-balance degree. Harnessing the
power of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS) with a
nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), an adaptive bi-objective
memetic algorithm, ALNS+NSGA-II, is developed to solve D-SIDSP. Results of
extensive computational experiments carried out using benchmark instances are

ALNS+NSGA-II is a viable alternative to solve D-SIDSP more efficiently and
demonstrates superior outcomes based on various performance metrics. The paper

almost all existing algorithms assume that all undirected arcs are homogeneous;
that is, the probability of an arc from nodes a to b is equal to that from
nodes b to a. Therefore, based on MPs, the binary-addition-tree algorithm

problem to overcome the above obstacles in applications. The computational

describes the asymptotic dynamics. Here we report on an exact

identical noise-free oscillators, this reduction corresponds to the

To reduce this performance gap, we investigate the question whether
biologically inspired Hebbian learning is useful for tackling continual

unsupervised setting, where the learner has to build representations without

learning, the network have easily interpretable weights, which might be
essential in critical application such as security or healthcare. We
demonstrate the efficacy of HebbCL in an unsupervised learning setting applied

neuroscience and leverage ideas and theories to create fast and efficient
learning systems. Spiking neuron models are adopted as core processing units in
neuromorphic systems because they enable event-based processing. The
integrate-and-fire (I&F) models are often adopted, with the simple Leaky I&F
(LIF) being the most used. The reason for adopting such models is their
efficiency and/or biological plausibility. Nevertheless, rigorous justification
for adopting LIF over other neuron models for use in artificial learning
systems has not yet been studied. This work considers various neuron models in
the literature and then selects computational neuron models that are
single-variable, efficient, and display different types of complexities. From
this selection, we make a comparative study of three simple I&F neuron models,
namely the LIF, the Quadratic I&F (QIF) and the Exponential I&F (EIF), to
understand whether the use of more complex models increases the performance of
the system and whether the choice of a neuron model can be directed by the task
to be completed. Neuron models are tested within an SNN trained with
Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) on a classification task on the
N-MNIST and DVS Gestures datasets. Experimental results reveal that more
complex neurons manifest the same ability as simpler ones to achieve high
levels of accuracy on a simple dataset (N-MNIST), albeit requiring comparably
more hyper-parameter tuning. However, when the data possess richer
Spatio-temporal features, the QIF and EIF neuron models steadily achieve better
results. This suggests that accurately selecting the model based on the
richness of the feature spectrum of the data could improve the whole system's
performance. Finally, the code implementing the spiking neurons in the
SpykeTorch framework is made publicly available.
