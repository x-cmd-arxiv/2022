large-scale decentralized machine learning applications in multi-agent or
federated environments. To tackle the communication bottleneck, there have been
many efforts to design communication-compressed algorithms for decentralized
nonconvex optimization, where the clients are only allowed to communicate a
small amount of quantized information (aka bits) with their neighbors over a
predefined graph topology. Despite significant efforts, the state-of-the-art
algorithm in the nonconvex setting still suffers from a slower rate of
convergence $O((G/T)^{2/3})$ compared with their uncompressed counterpart,
where $G$ measures the data heterogeneity across different clients, and $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This paper proposes BEER, which adopts
communication compression with gradient tracking, and shows it converges at a
faster rate of $O(1/T)$. This significantly improves over the state-of-the-art
rate, by matching the rate without compression even under arbitrary data
heterogeneity. Numerical experiments are also provided to corroborate our
theory and confirm the practical superiority of BEER in the data heterogeneous

differentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from
the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training

disruptions that propagate along complex SNs can expose the population of
entire regions or even countries to these risks. A lack of both, data and
quantitative methodology, has hitherto hindered us to empirically quantify the
vulnerability of the population to disruptions. Here we develop a data-driven
simulation methodology to locally quantify actual supply losses for the
population that result from the cascading of supply disruptions. We demonstrate
the method on a large food SN of a European country including 22,938 business

the business premises with respect to their criticality for the districts'
population with the proposed systemic risk index, SRIcrit, to identify around
30 premises that -- in case of their failure -- are expected to cause critical
supply shortages in sizable fractions of the population. The new methodology is
immediately policy relevant as a fact-driven and generalizable crisis
management tool. This work represents a starting point for quantitatively
studying SN disruptions focused on the well-being of the population.

eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, EPs have
attracted a lot of attention as a means to enhance the responsivity of sensors,
via the abrupt resonant detuning occurring in their proximity. In many cases,
however, the EP implementation is accompanied by noise enhancement leading to
the degradation of the signal-to-noise performance of the sensor . The excess
noise can be of fundamental nature (due to the eigenbasis collapse) or of
technical nature associated with the use of amplification mechanisms utilized
for the realization of EPs. Here we show, using an EP-based
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric electromechanical accelerometer, that the enhanced
technical noise can be surpassed by the enhanced responsivity to applied
accelerations. The noise due to eigenbasis collapse is mitigated by exploiting
the detuning from a transmission peak degeneracy (TPD), which forms when the
sensor is weakly coupled to transmission lines, as a sensitivity measurant.
These TPDs occur at a frequency and controlled parameters for which the
bi-orthogonal eigen-basis is still complete and are distinct from the EPs of
the $\mathcal{PT}$-sensor. They also show a slightly enhanced detuning rate
compared to the typically utilized EPs. Our device demonstrates a three-fold
signal-to-noise ratio enhancement compared to configurations for which the
system operates away from the TPD.

control applications. Where classical control approaches require a priori
system knowledge, data-driven control approaches like RL allow a model-free
controller design procedure, rendering them emergent techniques for systems
with changing plant structures and varying parameters. While it was already
shown in various applications that the transient control behavior for complex
systems can be sufficiently handled by RL, the challenge of non-vanishing
steady-state control errors remains, which arises from the usage of control
policy approximations and finite training times. To overcome this issue, an
integral action state augmentation (IASA) for actor-critic-based RL controllers
is introduced that mimics an integrating feedback, which is inspired by the
delta-input formulation within model predictive control. This augmentation does
not require any expert knowledge, leaving the approach model free. As a result,
the RL controller learns how to suppress steady-state control deviations much
more effectively. Two exemplary applications from the domain of electrical
energy engineering validate the benefit of the developed method both for
reference tracking and disturbance rejection. In comparison to a standard deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) setup, the suggested IASA extension allows
to reduce the steady-state error by up to 52 $\%$ within the considered

to select a single alternative that approximately minimizes the total distance
from the agents, and the worst-case approximation ratio is termed distortion.
In the case of multiwinner voting, the goal is to select a committee of $k$
alternatives that (approximately) minimizes the total cost to all agents. We
consider the scenario where the cost of an agent for a committee is her
distance from the $q$-th closest alternative in the committee. We reveal a

clean limit of the two-body problem in general relativity, as well as for their
importance as sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. At lowest order,
the smaller body moves along a geodesic of the larger black hole's spacetime.
Post-geodesic effects include the gravitational self force, which incorporates
the backreaction of gravitational-wave emission, and the spin-curvature force,
which arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's
spacetime curvature. In this paper, we describe a method for precisely
computing bound orbits of spinning bodies about black holes. Our analysis
builds off of pioneering work by Witzany which demonstrated how to describe the
motion of a spinning body to linear order in the small body's spin. Exploiting
the fact that in the large mass-ratio limit spinning-body orbits are close to
geodesics and using closed-form results due to van de Meent describing
precession of the small body's spin along black hole orbits, we develop a
frequency-domain formulation of the motion which can be solved very precisely.

orbits which are eccentric and nearly equatorial (i.e., the orbit's motion is
$\mathcal{O}(S)$ out of the equatorial plane), but for which the small body's
spin is arbitrarily oriented. We discuss generic orbits with general small-body
spin orientation in a companion paper. We characterize the behavior of these
orbits and show how the small body's spin shifts the frequencies $\Omega_r$ and
$\Omega_\phi$ which affect orbital motion. These frequency shifts change
accumulated phases which are direct gravitational-wave observables,
illustrating the importance of precisely characterizing these quantities for

orbiting Kerr black holes. Non-spinning test bodies follow geodesics of the
spacetime in which they move. A test body's spin couples to the curvature of
that spacetime, introducing a ""spin-curvature force"" which pushes the body's
worldline away from a geodesic trajectory. The spin-curvature force is an
important example of a post-geodesic effect which must be modeled carefully in
order to accurately characterize the motion of bodies orbiting black holes. One
motivation for this work is to understand how to include such effects in models
of gravitational waves produced from the inspiral of stellar mass bodies into
massive black holes. In this paper's predecessor, we describe a technique for
computing bound orbits of spinning bodies around black holes with a
frequency-domain description which can be solved very precisely. In that paper,
we present an overview of our methods, as well as present results for orbits
which are eccentric and nearly equatorial (i.e., the orbit's motion is no more
than $\mathcal{O}(S)$ out of the equatorial plane). In this paper, we apply
this formulation to the fully generic case -- orbits which are inclined and
eccentric, with the small body's spin arbitrarily oriented. We compute the
trajectories which such orbits follow, and compute how the small body's spin
affects important quantities such as the observable orbital frequencies
$\Omega_r$, $\Omega_\theta$ and $\Omega_\phi$.

large upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) exceeding the Pauli limit, elaborating
a possible unconventional paring mechanism. The present study, together with
our recent work on KMn6Bi5 (Tcmax = 9.3 K), makes AMn6Bi5 (A= Alkali metal) a

new classes are available. Second, they rely on large amount of pixel-level

introduce a novel incremental class learning approach for semantic segmentation
taking into account a peculiar aspect of this task: since each training step
provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the
background class exhibit a semantic shift. Therefore, we revisit the
traditional distillation paradigm by designing novel loss terms which
explicitly account for the background shift. Additionally, we introduce a novel
strategy to initialize classifier's parameters at each step in order to prevent
biased predictions toward the background class. Finally, we demonstrate that
our approach can be extended to point- and scribble-based weakly supervised
segmentation, modeling the partial annotations to create priors for unlabeled
pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive
evaluation on the Pascal-VOC, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

However, the ground truth displacement in real ultrasound data is unknown, and
simulated data exhibits a domain shift compared to the real data and is also
computationally expensive to generate. To resolve this issue, semi-supervised
methods have been proposed wherein the networks pre-trained on computer vision

use consistency between the forward and backward strains as an additional

fine-tuned by our proposed method using experimental phantom data performs well
on in vivo data similar to the network fine-tuned on in vivo data. Our results
also show that the proposed method outperforms current deep learning methods

contributes to the small sample of well characterised young planets. It has an
orbital period of $P\,=\,8.1577080\pm0.0000044$ days, and transits an early K
dwarf star with a mass of $M_\star$ = $ 0.96 \pm 0.04$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of

$T_\mathrm{eff}\,=\,5300\pm100$ K, and a metallicity of $0.36\pm0.06$ dex. By
combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the Tull

we demonstrate how to diagnose activity signals by calculating the
magnitude-squared coherence $\hat{C}^2_{xy}(f)$ between an activity indicator
time series $x_t$ and the radial velocity (RV) time series $y_t$. Since planets
only cause modulation in RV, not in activity indicators, a high value of
$\hat{C}^2_{xy}(f)$ indicates that the signal at frequency $f$ has a stellar
origin. We use Welch's method to measure coherence between activity indicators
and RVs in archival observations of GJ 581, alpha Cen B, and GJ 3998. High
RV-H$\alpha$ coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 b, and high RV-S index
coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 c, indicate that the planets may actually
be stellar signals. We also replicate previous results showing that GJ 581 d
and g are rotation harmonics and demonstrate that alpha Cen B has activity
signals that are not associated with rotation. Welch's power spectrum estimates
have cleaner spectral windows than Lomb-Scargle periodograms, improving our
ability to estimate rotation periods. We find that the rotation period of GJ
581 is 132 days, with no evidence of differential rotation. Welch's method may
yield unacceptably large bias for datasets with $N < 75$ observations and works
best on datasets with $N > 100$. Tapering the time-domain data can reduce the
bias of the Welch's power spectrum estimator, but observers should not apply
tapers to datasets with extremely uneven observing cadence. A software package
for calculating magnitude-squared coherence and Welch's power spectrum
estimates is available on github.

mental fortitude and skills, but the actual act of climbing, and indeed
survival, is largely individualistic. This work studies the effects of the
structure and topology of relationships within climbers on the level of
cooperation and success. It does so using simplicial complexes, where
relationships between climbers are captured through simplexes that correspond
to joint previous expeditions with dimension given by the number of climbers
minus one and weight given by the number of occurrences of the simplex. First,
this analysis establishes the importance of relationships and shows that
chances of failure to summit reduce drastically when climbing with repeat
partners. From a climber-centric perspective, climbers that belong to simplexes
with large dimension were more likely to be successful, across experience
levels. From an expedition-centric perspective, the distribution of
relationships within a group is explored to identify collective human behavior:
from polarized to cooperative. Expeditions containing simplices with large
dimension, and usually low weight, i.e., a large number of people had a small
number of previous joint expeditions, tended to be more cooperative, with more
homogeneity in success amongst climbers. On the other hand, the existence of
small, usually strong, subgroups lead to a polarized style where climbers that
were not a part of the subgroup were less likely to succeed. Lastly, this work
examines the effects of individual features and expedition-wide factors that
may play different roles in individualistic and cooperative expeditions.
Centrality indicates that individual traits of youth and oxygen use while
ascending are strong drivers of success. Of expedition-wide factors, the
expedition size and number of expedition days are found to be strongly
correlated with success rate.

whilst the effect of non-Gaussianity is qualitatively similar to previous

weaken the dependance of PBH constraints on the primordial power spectrum on
the non-Gaussianity parameters, as well as to dramatically weaken constraints
on the non-Gaussianity parameters (and/or PBH abundance) arising from the
non-observation of dark matter isocurvature modes. We also consider the
correlation between the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ and the compaction $C$,

birefringence angle from the Planck data release 4 polarization maps. An axion
field coupled to electromagnetism predicts a nearly frequency-independent
birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu = \beta$, while Faraday rotation from local
magnetic fields and Lorentz violating theories predict a cosmic birefringence
angle that is proportional to the frequency, $\nu$, to the power of some
integer $n$, $\beta_\nu \propto \nu^n$. In this work, we first sample
$\beta_\nu$ individually for each polarized HFI frequency band in addition to
the 70 GHz channel from the LFI. We also constrain a power-law formula for the
birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu=\beta_0(\nu/\nu_0)^n$, with $\nu_0 = 150$ GHz.
For a nearly full-sky measurement, $f_{\text{sky}}=0.93$, we find $\beta_0 =
0.26^{\circ}\pm0.11^\circ$ $(68\% \text{ C.L.})$ and $n=-0.45^{+0.61}_{-0.82}$
when we ignore the intrinsic $EB$ correlations of the polarized foreground
emission, and $\beta_0 = 0.33^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$ and
$n=-0.37^{+0.49}_{-0.64}$ when we use a filamentary dust model for the
foreground $EB$. Next, we use all the polarized Planck maps, including the 30
and 44 GHz frequency bands. These bands have a negligible foreground
contribution from polarized dust emission. We, therefore, treat them
separately. Without any modeling of the intrinsic $EB$ of the foreground, we
generally find that the inclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz frequency bands raises
the measured values of $\beta_\nu$ and tightens $n$. At nearly full-sky, we
measure $\beta_0=0.29^{\circ+0.10^\circ}_{\phantom{\circ}-0.11^\circ}$ and
$n=-0.35^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$. Assuming no frequency dependence, we measure
$\beta=0.33^\circ \pm 0.10^\circ$. If our measurements have effectively
mitigated the $EB$ of the foreground, our constraints are consistent with a
mostly frequency-independent signal of cosmic birefringence.

industry. Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation
languages and were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof. We
qualitatively analysed the responses to find factors that influence the
properties of model transformation languages as well as explanations as to how
exactly they do so. Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of
GPLs, domain specific capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong
influences on how people view properties of model transformation languages.
Moreover, the Choice of MTL, the Use Case for which a transformation should be
developed as well as the Skills of involved stakeholders have a moderating
effect on the influences, by changing the context to consider. There is a broad
body of experience, that suggests positive and negative influences for
properties of MTLs. Our data suggests, that much needs to be done in order to
convey the viability of model transformation languages. Efforts to provide more
empirical substance need to be undergone and lackluster language capabilities
and tooling need to be improved upon. We suggest several approaches for this

impulsive phase of solar flares have recently been studied through their 30 s
evolution with the high resolution of IRIS. Radiative-hydrodynamic flare models
show that these redshifts are generally reproduced by electron-beam generated
chromospheric condensations. The models produce large ambient electron
densities, and the pressure broadening of hydrogen Balmer series should be
readily detected in observations. To accurately interpret upcoming spectral
data of flares with the DKIST, we incorporate non-ideal, non-adiabatic line
broadening profiles of hydrogen into the RADYN code. These improvements allow
time-dependent predictions for the extreme Balmer line wing enhancements in
solar flares. We study two chromospheric condensation models, which cover a
range of electron beam fluxes ($1-5 \times 10^{11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) and
ambient electron densities ($1 - 60 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$) in the flare
chromosphere. Both models produce broadening and redshift variations within 10
s of the onset of beam heating. In the chromospheric condensations, there is
enhanced spectral broadening due to large optical depths at H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$, while the much lower optical depth of the Balmer
series H12$-$H16 provides a translucent window into the smaller electron
densities in the beam-heated layers below the condensation. The wavelength
ranges of typical DKIST/ViSP spectra of solar flares will be sufficient to test
the predictions of extreme hydrogen wing broadening and accurately constrain
large densities in chromospheric condensations.

  Activation Functions","Published as a conference paper at TACAS 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.LO cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The most scalable approaches to certifying neural network robustness depend
on computing sound linear lower and upper bounds for the network's activation
functions. Current approaches are limited in that the linear bounds must be
handcrafted by an expert, and can be sub-optimal, especially when the network's
architecture composes operations using, for example, multiplication such as in
LSTMs and the recently popular Swish activation. The dependence on an expert
prevents the application of robustness certification to developments in the
state-of-the-art of activation functions, and furthermore the lack of tightness
guarantees may give a false sense of insecurity about a particular model. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the problem of
automatically computing tight linear bounds for arbitrary n-dimensional
activation functions. We propose LinSyn, the first approach that achieves tight
bounds for any arbitrary activation function, while only leveraging the
mathematical definition of the activation function itself. Our approach
leverages an efficient heuristic approach to synthesize bounds that are tight
and usually sound, and then verifies the soundness (and adjusts the bounds if
necessary) using the highly optimized branch-and-bound SMT solver, dReal. Even
though our approach depends on an SMT solver, we show that the runtime is
reasonable in practice, and, compared with state of the art, our approach often
achieves 2-5X tighter final output bounds and more than quadruple certified

  ores",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Iron- and steelmaking cause ~7% of the global CO2 emissions, due to the use
of carbon for the reduction of iron ores. Replacing carbon by hydrogen as the
reductant offers a pathway to reduce emissions. However, production of hydrogen
using renewable energy will remain a bottlenecks, because making the annual
crude steel production of 1.8 billion tons sustainable requires a minimum
amount of ~97 million tons of green hydrogen per year. Another fundamental
aspect to make ironmaking sector more sustainable lies in an optimal
utilization of green hydrogen and energy, thus reducing efforts for costly
in-process hydrogen recycling. We therefore demonstrate here how the efficiency
in hydrogen and energy consumption during iron ore reduction can be
dramatically improved by the knowledge-based combination of two technologies:
partially reducing the ore at low temperature via solid-state direct reduction
(DR) to a kinetically defined degree, and subsequently melting and completely
transforming it to iron under a reducing plasma (i.e. via hydrogen plasma
reduction, HPR). Results suggest that an optimal transition point between these
two technologies occurs where their efficiency in hydrogen utilization is
equal. We found that the reduction of hematite through magnetite into wustite
via DR is clean and efficient, but it gets sluggish and inefficient when iron
forms at the outermost layers of the iron ore pellets. Conversely, HPR starts
violent and unstable with arc delocalization, but proceeds smoothly and
efficiently when processing semi-reduced oxides. We performed hybrid reduction
experiments by partially reducing hematite pellets via DR at 700{\deg}C to 38%
global reduction (using a standard thermogravimetry system) and subsequently
transferring them to HPR, conducted with a gas mixture of Ar-10%H2 in an
arc-melting furnace, to achieve conversion into liquid iron.

  2022 proceedings",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D scene graphs have recently emerged as a powerful high-level representation
of 3D environments. A 3D scene graph describes the environment as a layered
graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction
and edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve
as an advanced ""mental model"" for robots, how to build such a rich
representation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes
a real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D
scene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop
real-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as
the robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local Euclidean
Signed Distance Function (ESDF) around the current robot location, extract a
topological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms
using an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second
contribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D
scene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical
descriptors for loop closure detection; our descriptors capture statistics
across layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance to
summary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first
algorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our
approach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all
layers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed Spatial Perception System
into a architecture named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level
perception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on
simulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with
an accuracy comparable with batch offline methods despite running online.

issues, we present a novel approach that either drops a neural network's
initial weights or inverts their respective sign. Put simply, a network is
trained by weight selection and inversion without changing their absolute

sign-inverting the initial weights and follows the findings of the Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis. Through this extension and adaptations of initialization
methods, we achieve a pruning rate of up to 99%, while still matching or
exceeding the performance of various baseline and previous models. Our approach
has two main advantages. First, and most notable, signed Supermask models
drastically simplify a model's structure, while still performing well on given

insights into which weights matter for performance. The code is available on

demonstrate that the BPE could be considered as a proper measure of the total
intrinsic correlation between two subsystems in a mixed state. The total
correlation includes certain crossing correlations which are minimized on some
balance conditions. By constructing a class of purifications from Euclidean
path-integrals, we find that the balanced crossing correlations show
universality and can be considered as the generalization of the Markov gap for
canonical purification. We also test the relation between the BPE and the EWCS
in three-dimensional asymptotically flat holography. We find that the balanced
crossing correlation vanishes for the field theory invariant under BMS$_3$
symmetry (BMSFT) and dual to the Einstein gravity, indicating the possibility
of a perfect Markov recovery. We further elucidate these crossing correlations
as a signature of tripartite entanglement and explain their interpretation in
both AdS and non-AdS holography.

Three standard types of noises are considered: a phase damping, a depolarizing,

entanglement to be restored in an amount proportional to the degree of spatial
indistinguishability. These results elevate sLOCC to a practical framework for

scholarship on Ricci v. DeStefano often deems solutions to this paradox
impossible. Circumventive practices such as the 4/5ths rule further illustrate
tensions between too little action and too much action.
  In this work, we give a powerful way to solve this hiring paradox that tracks
both legal and algorithmic challenges. We unpack the nuances of Ricci v.
DeStefano and extend the legal literature arguing that certain algorithmic
approaches to employment are allowed by introducing the legal practice of
banding to evaluate candidates. We thus show that a bias-aware technique can be
used to diagnose and mitigate ""built-in"" headwinds in the employment pipeline.
We use the machinery of partially ordered sets to handle the presence of
uncertainty in evaluations data. This approach allows us to move away from
treating ""people as numbers"" to treating people as individuals -- a property
that is sought after by Title VII in the context of employment.

necessary conditions to achieve lasing without inversion by calculating the
non-equilibrium steady state solutions of the model at, and between, its

mean-field theory to present a thorough analysis of the lasing phase
transition. In the microscopic case, we exploit the underlying permutation
symmetry of the density matrix to calculate exact solutions for N 3-level

thermodynamic limit as N increases, restoring the sharp non-equilibrium phase
transition in this limit. We demonstrate how the lasing phase transition and
degree of population inversion can be adjusted by simply varying the phase of
the coherent driving field. The high level of quantum control presented by this
microscopic model and the framework outlined here have applications to further
understanding and developing nanophotonic technology.

Recently, Deep Learning (DL) methodologies have demonstrated fast and accurate
performances in data processing and classification tasks across many biomedical
fields. Aim: We aim to review the emerging DL applications in fNIRS studies.
Approach: We first introduce some of the commonly used DL techniques. Then the
review summarizes current DL work in some of the most active areas of this
field, including brain-computer interface, neuro-impairment diagnosis, and
neuroscience discovery. Results: Of the 63 papers considered in this review, 32
report a comparative study of deep learning techniques to traditional machine
learning techniques where 26 have been shown outperforming the latter in terms
of classification accuracy. Additionally, 8 studies also utilize deep learning
to reduce the amount of preprocessing typically done with fNIRS data or
increase the amount of data via data augmentation. Conclusions: The application
of DL techniques to fNIRS studies has shown to mitigate many of the hurdles
present in fNIRS studies such as lengthy data preprocessing or small sample

have a numerical complexity nearly identical to non-robust ones based on
empirical risk minimization. The main idea is simple: while robust learning
with gradient descent requires the computational cost of robustly estimating
the whole gradient to update all parameters, a parameter can be updated
immediately using a robust estimator of a single partial derivative in
coordinate gradient descent. We prove upper bounds on the generalization error
of the algorithms derived from this idea, that control both the optimization

combines nucleons into deuterons at the kinetic freeze-out hypersurface, the
MST identifies the clusters during the different stages of time evolution. We
find that both clustering procedures give very similar results for the deuteron

the free nucleons and other hadrons. Thus, deuterons are not destroyed by

structurally stable with respect to the controller parameters provided that the

this connectivity must solve an under-constrained problem with several
potential solutions due to noise and spatial resolution limitations during
imaging. Previous research has insufficiently evaluated the reproducibility of
the traditional approaches and these approaches have been insufficiently
regularized to increase solution stability. We propose three new measures of
correlative and causal connectivity which incorporate explicit regularization
through a structural connectivity prior from diffusion MRI. These new measures,
which exploit a machine learning formulation for efficient computation, are
evaluated against traditional measures for reproducibility and predictive
power. In particular, correlation, partial correlation, spectral density, and a
novel measure of functional connectivity based on machine learning feature
importance (MLFC) are compared. Additionally, measures of effective
connectivity are compared to two proposed connectivity measures: a machine
learning approach and a Granger-causal approach incorporating a low-dimensional
projection with a diffusion MRI-derived tractography prior. In addition to
reproducibility, we quantify the capacity each measures has to infer three
study participant traits: a physiologic trait, a cognitive trait, and a
combined physiologic and cognitive trait. The proposed measures prove to be
both reproducible and predictive, demonstrating the strong potential for the
proposed connectivity measures to be broadly used in future neuroimaging

verify if the AGB model mass is compatible with independently derived AGB mass.
We selected a sample of 28 Ba stars for which both self-consistent
spectroscopic observation and analysis are available and stellar mass
determinations, via positioning the star on the HR diagram and comparing with
evolutionary tracks. For this sample stars we considered both previously and
recently derived elemental abundances. Then, we performed a detailed comparison
of these s-process elemental abundances to different AGB nucleosynthesis models
from the Monash and the FRUITY theoretical data sets. We simplified the binary
mass transfer by calculating dilution factors to match the [Ce/Fe] value of
each star when using different AGB models, and we then compared the diluted
model abundances to the complete Ba-star abundance pattern. Our comparison
confirms that low mass, non-rotating AGB stellar models with 13C as the main
neutron source are the polluters of the vast majority of the considered Ba
stars. Out of the 28 stars, in 21 cases the models are in good agreement with
both the determined abundances and the independently derived AGB mass, although

models with masses lower than those independently determined. Finally, 4 stars
show much higher first s-process peak abundance values than the model

Although macroeconomists already apply transfer learning when assuming a given

signal restriction and calibrating parameters based on results observed in
other models, to name a few examples, advance in a more systematic transfer
learning strategy in applied macroeconomics is the innovation we are

from different but related domains, a type of transfer learning, helps identify
the business cycle phases when there is no business cycle dating committee and
to quick estimate a economic-based output gap. Next, since deep learning
methods are a way of learning representations, those that are formed by the
composition of multiple non-linear transformations, to yield more abstract
representations, we apply deep learning for mapping low-frequency from
high-frequency variables. The results obtained show the suitability of deep
learning models applied to macroeconomic problems. First, models learned to
classify United States business cycles correctly. Then, applying transfer
learning, they were able to identify the business cycles of out-of-sample

approximation of the negative homogeneous weighted Sobolev norm whose
connection to Wasserstein distance follows from a classic linearization of a
general Monge-Amp\'ere equation. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
provide expository material on this classic linearization of Wasserstein
distance including a quantitative error estimate. Second, we reduce the
computational problem to solving an elliptic boundary value problem involving
the Witten Laplacian, which is a Schr\""odinger operator of the form $H =
-\Delta + V$, and describe an associated embedding. Third, for the case of
probability distributions on the unit square $[0,1]^2$ represented by $n \times
n$ arrays we present a fast code demonstrating our approach. Several numerical

accelerated variant L-Katyusha (Kovalev et al., 2020), are widely used to train
machine learning models.The theoretical and empirical performance of L-SVRG and
L-Katyusha can be improved by sampling observations from a non-uniform
distribution (Qian et al., 2021). However,designing a desired sampling
distribution requires prior knowledge of smoothness constants, which can be
computationally intractable to obtain in practice when the dimension of the
model parameter is high. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive sampling
strategy for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha that can learn the sampling distribution
with little computational overhead, while allowing it to change with iterates,
and at the same time does not require any prior knowledge of the problem
parameters. We prove convergence guarantees for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha for
convex objectives when the sampling distribution changes with iterates. Our
results show that even without prior information, the proposed adaptive
sampling strategy matches, and in some cases even surpasses, the performance of
the sampling scheme in Qian et al. (2021). Extensive simulations support our
theory and the practical utility of the proposed sampling scheme on real data.

rubber calendering process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs when
dealing with inverse and ill-posed problems, which are impractical to be solved
by classical numerical discretization methods. We study the impact of the
placement of the sensors and the distribution of unsupervised points on the
performance of PINNs in a problem of inferring hidden physical fields from some
partial data. We also investigate the capability of PINNs to identify unknown
physical parameters from the measurements captured by sensors. The effect of
noisy measurements is also considered throughout this work. The results of this
paper demonstrate that in the problem of identification, PINNs can successfully
estimate the unknown parameters using only the measurements on the sensors. In
ill-posed problems where boundary conditions are not completely defined, even

Early detection of lung cancer is critical for disease prevention, cure, and
mortality rate reduction. However, existing detection methods on pulmonary
nodules introduce an excessive number of false positive proposals in order to
achieve high sensitivity, which is not practical in clinical situations. In
this paper, we propose the multi-head detection and spatial
squeeze-and-attention network, MHSnet, to detect pulmonary nodules, in order to
aid doctors in the early diagnosis of lung cancers. Specifically, we first
introduce multi-head detectors and skip connections to customize for the
variety of nodules in sizes, shapes and types and capture multi-scale features.
Then, we implement a spatial attention module to enable the network to focus on
different regions differently inspired by how experienced clinicians screen CT
images, which results in fewer false positive proposals. Lastly, we present a
lightweight but effective false positive reduction module with the Linear
Regression model to cut down the number of false positive proposals, without
any constraints on the front network. Extensive experimental results compared
with the state-of-the-art models have shown the superiority of the MHSnet in
terms of the average FROC, sensitivity and especially false discovery rate
(2.98% and 2.18% improvement in terms of average FROC and sensitivity, 5.62%
and 28.33% decrease in terms of false discovery rate and average candidates per

number of candidates generated per scan by 68.11% and the false discovery rate
by 13.48%, which is promising to reduce distracted proposals for the downstream
tasks based on the detection results.

proposed FLoC. The FLoC algorithm assigns users to ""cohorts"" that represent
groups of users with similar browsing behaviors so that ads can be served to
users based on their cohort. In 2022, after testing FLoC in a real world trial,
Google canceled the proposal with little explanation. In this work, we provide
a post-mortem analysis of two critical privacy risks for FloC by applying an
implementation of FLoC to a browsing dataset collected from over 90,000 U.S.
devices over a one year period. First, we show how, contrary to its privacy
goals, FLoC would have enabled cross-site user tracking by providing a unique
identifier for users available across sites, similar to the third-party cookies
FLoC was meant to be an improvement over. We show how FLoC cohort ID sequences
observed over time can provide this identifier to trackers, even with
third-party cookies disabled. We estimate the number of users in our dataset
that could be uniquely identified by FLoC IDs is more than 50% after 3 weeks
and more than 95% after 4 weeks. We also show how these risks increase when
cohort data are combined with browser fingerprinting, and how our results
underestimate the true risks FLoC would have posed in a real-world deployment.
Second, we examine the risk of FLoC leaking sensitive demographic information.
Although we find statistically significant differences in browsing behaviors
between demographic groups, we do not find that FLoC significantly risks
exposing race or income information about users in our dataset. Our
contributions provide insights and example analyses for future approaches that

systems to enable a close monitoring and early detection of developing fault
conditions. The vibration measurements are analyzed to continuously assess the

focuses on gearbox monitoring but is applicable also to other subsystems. The
current state-of-the-art gearbox fault diagnosis algorithms rely on statistical
or machine learning methods based on fault signatures that have been defined by
human analysts. This has multiple disadvantages. Defining the fault signatures
by human analysts is a time-intensive process that requires highly detailed
knowledge of the gearbox composition. This effort needs to be repeated for
every new turbine, so it does not scale well with the increasing number of
monitored turbines, especially in fast growing portfolios. Moreover, fault
signatures defined by human analysts can result in biased and imprecise
decision boundaries that lead to imprecise and uncertain fault diagnosis
decisions. We present a novel accurate fault diagnosis method for
vibration-monitored wind turbine components that overcomes these disadvantages.
Our approach combines autonomous data-driven learning of fault signatures and
health state classification based on convolutional neural networks and
isolation forests. We demonstrate its performance with vibration measurements
from two wind turbine gearboxes. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, our
approach does not require gearbox-type specific diagnosis expertise and is not

naturalness and cultural specificity in the target language. In this work, to
tackle these limitations we propose a novel outline-based annotation process
for multilingual ToD datasets, where domain-specific abstract schemata of
dialogue are mapped into natural language outlines. These in turn guide the
target language annotators in writing a dialogue by providing instructions
about each turn's intents and slots. Through this process we annotate a new
large-scale dataset for training and evaluation of multilingual and
cross-lingual ToD systems. Our Cross-lingual Outline-based Dialogue dataset
(termed COD) enables natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking,
and end-to-end dialogue modelling and evaluation in 4 diverse languages:
Arabic, Indonesian, Russian, and Kiswahili. Qualitative and quantitative
analyses of COD versus an equivalent translation-based dataset demonstrate
improvements in data quality, unlocked by the outline-based approach. Finally,
we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art systems for cross-lingual ToD,
setting reference scores for future work and demonstrating that COD prevents
over-inflated performance, typically met with prior translation-based ToD
datasets.

mortality in patients with acquired and congenital cardiac valve disease.
Image-derived computational modeling of atrioventricular valves has advanced
substantially over the last decade and holds particular promise to inform valve
repair in small and heterogeneous populations which are less likely to be
optimized through empiric clinical application. While an abundance of
computational biomechanics studies have investigated mitral and tricuspid valve
disease in adults, few studies have investigated application to vulnerable
pediatric and congenital heart populations. Further, to date, investigators
have primarily relied upon a series of commercial applications that are neither
designed for image-derived modeling of cardiac valves, nor freely available to
facilitate transparent and reproducible valve science. To address this
deficiency, we aimed to build an open-source computational framework for the
image-derived biomechanical analysis of atrioventricular valves. In the present
work, we integrated an open-source valve modeling platform, SlicerHeart, and an
open-source biomechanics finite element modeling software, FEBio, to facilitate
image-derived atrioventricular valve model creation and finite element
analysis. We present a detailed verification and sensitivity analysis to
demonstrate the fidelity of this modeling in application to 3D
echocardiography-derived pediatric mitral and tricuspid valve models. Our
analyses achieved excellent agreement with those reported in the literature. As
such, this evolving computational framework offers a promising initial
foundation for future development and investigation of valve mechanics, in
particular collaborative efforts targeting the development of improved repairs
for children with congenital heart disease.

revolving around a common center, and show that superradiant instabilities do
occur, on expected timescales and frequency range. Our results provide the
first demonstration that superradiance also occurs for highly asymmetric
systems, and may have a wealth of applications in fluid dynamics and
astrophysics. Extrapolating to astrophysical black holes, our findings indicate
that compact binaries may be used as interesting particle detectors, depositing
a fraction of their energy into putative new fundamental ultralight degrees of

dollars in damage and uprooting communities, ecosystems, and economies.
Accurate extreme precipitation prediction allows more time for preparation and
disaster risk management for such extreme events. In this paper, we focus on
short-term extreme precipitation forecasting (up to a 12-hour ahead-of-time
prediction) from a sequence of sea level pressure and zonal wind anomalies.
Although existing machine learning approaches have shown promising results, the
associated model and climate uncertainties may reduce their reliability. To
address this issue, we propose a self-attention augmented convolution mechanism
for extreme precipitation forecasting, systematically combining attention
scores with traditional convolutions to enrich feature data and reduce the
expected errors of the results. The proposed network architecture is further
fused with a highway neural network layer to gain the benefits of unimpeded
information flow across several layers. Our experimental results show that the
framework outperforms classical convolutional models by 12%. The proposed
method increases machine learning as a tool for gaining insights into the
physical causes of changing extremes, lowering uncertainty in future forecasts.

involves the arg-minimum of another function, appears in many areas of machine
learning. In a large scale empirical risk minimization setting where the number
of samples is huge, it is crucial to develop stochastic methods, which only use
a few samples at a time to progress. However, computing the gradient of the
value function involves solving a linear system, which makes it difficult to
derive unbiased stochastic estimates. To overcome this problem we introduce a
novel framework, in which the solution of the inner problem, the solution of
the linear system, and the main variable evolve at the same time. These
directions are written as a sum, making it straightforward to derive unbiased
estimates. The simplicity of our approach allows us to develop global variance
reduction algorithms, where the dynamics of all variables is subject to
variance reduction. We demonstrate that SABA, an adaptation of the celebrated
SAGA algorithm in our framework, has $O(\frac1T)$ convergence rate, and that it
achieves linear convergence under Polyak-Lojasciewicz assumption. This is the
first stochastic algorithm for bilevel optimization that verifies either of
these properties. Numerical experiments validate the usefulness of our method.

  The new methods allow for us to dispense with many of the assumptions in

on random limsup sets, do not assume Ahlfors regularity. Further, they apply to
any complete metric space. This generality is made possible by the fact that

overcome the $\Omega(\sqrt{\textrm{OPT}})$ lower bound for logistic loss simply

proposed algorithm is the use of the prefix structure to track the process of
mapping text segments to fuzzy properties.
  An important special case of the text segmentation problem is the fuzzy
string matching problem, when adjacent text segments have unit length and,
accordingly, the fuzzy pattern is a sequence of fuzzy properties of text
characters. It is proven that the heuristic segmentation algorithm in this case
finds all text segments that match the fuzzy pattern.
  Finally, we consider the problem of a best segmentation of the entire text
based on a fuzzy pattern, which is solved using the dynamic programming method.

that any quantum device that fails our protocol with probability at most
$\epsilon$ must be poly$(N,\epsilon)$-close to being honest in the appropriate

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stac1755",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Eridanus II (EriII) 'ultra-faint' dwarf has a large ($15\,\text{pc}$) and
low mass ($4.3\times10^3\,\text{M}_\odot$) star cluster (SC) offset from its
centre by $23\pm3\,\text{pc}$ in projection. Its size and offset are naturally
explained if EriII has a central dark matter core, but such a core may be
challenging to explain in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this paper, we revisit
the survival and evolution of EriII's SC, focussing for the first time on its
puzzlingly large ellipticity ($0.31^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$). We perform a suite of
960 direct $N$-body simulations of SCs, orbiting within a range of spherical
background potentials fit to ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy simulations. We
find only two scenarios that come close to explaining EriII's SC. In the first,
EriII has a low density dark matter core (of size $\sim70\,\text{pc}$ and
density $\lesssim2\times10^8\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{kpc}^{-3}$). In this
model, the high ellipticity of EriII's SC is set at birth, with the lack of
tidal forces in the core allowing its ellipticity to remain frozen in for long
times. In the second, EriII's SC orbits in a partial core, with its high
ellipticity owing to its imminent tidal destruction. However, this latter model
struggles to reproduce the large size of EriII's SC, and it predicts
substantial tidal tails around EriII's SC that should have already been seen in
the data. This leads us to favour the cored model. We discuss potential caveats
to these findings, and the implications of the cored model for galaxy formation
and the nature of dark matter.

reduces to the classical $W^{1,\infty}$-topology when restricted to functions
supported away from the shock location. Main difficulties include that
uniformity precludes any use of parabolic regularization to close regularity

the coexistence of nontrivial slow parts with fast shock-layer parts, that the

classical equations of motion for the drift dynamics of electrons' guiding

few experimentally tuneable parameters: the initial energies of the
uncorrelated electrons, relative time delay of injection and the shape of the

antibunching scattering outcomes is presented with a single energy scale

primitives that are impossible classically. For example, quantum
copy-protection allows for a program to be encoded in a quantum state in such a
way that the program can be evaluated, but not copied. Many of these
cryptographic primitives are two-party protocols, where one party, Bob, has
full quantum computational capabilities, and the other party, Alice, is only
required to send random BB84 states to Bob. In this work, we show how such
protocols can generically be converted to ones where Alice is fully classical,
assuming that Bob cannot efficiently solve the LWE problem. In particular, this
means that all communication between (classical) Alice and (quantum) Bob is
classical, yet they can still make use of cryptographic primitives that would
be impossible if both parties were classical. We apply this conversion
procedure to obtain quantum cryptographic protocols with classical
communication for unclonable encryption, copy-protection, computing on
encrypted data, and verifiable blind delegated computation. The key technical
ingredient for our result is a protocol for classically-instructed parallel
remote state preparation of BB84 states. This is a multi-round protocol between
(classical) Alice and (quantum polynomial-time) Bob that allows Alice to
certify that Bob must have prepared $n$ uniformly random BB84 states (up to a
change of basis on his space). Furthermore, Alice knows which specific BB84
states Bob has prepared, while Bob himself does not. Hence, the situation at
the end of this protocol is (almost) equivalent to one where Alice sent $n$

inspiration from social science and biology research, we subsequently implement
a new ""partner choice"" framework to elicit revealed preferences: after playing
an episode with an agent, participants are asked whether they would like to
play the next round with the same agent or to play alone. As with stated
preferences, social perception better predicts participants' revealed

human-agent interaction researchers routinely incorporate the measurement of

when there are time-varying treatment effects and time-varying covariates.
Loosely speaking, the issue is that some covariates are post-treatment
variables because they may be affected by prior treatment status, and
regressing out post-treatment variables causes bias. More precisely, the bias
is due to certain non-confounding latent variables that create colliders in the
causal graph. These latent variables, which we call phantoms, do not harm the
identifiability of the causal effect, but they render naive regression
estimates inconsistent. Motivated by this, we ask: how can we modify regression
methods so that they hold up even in the presence of phantoms? We develop an
estimator for this setting based on regression modeling (linear, log-linear,
probit and Cox regression), proving that it is consistent for the causal effect
of interest. In particular, the estimator is a regression model fit with a
simple adjustment for collinearity, making it easy to understand and implement
with standard regression software. From a causal point of view, the proposed
estimator is an instance of the parametric g-formula. Importantly, we show that
our estimator is immune to the null paradox that plagues most other parametric
g-formula methods.

Observational data indicates that explaining this diversity may require a

models that capture the relevant physics required to explain the galaxy
diversity problem. We focus specifically on a Self-Interacting Dark Matter
(SIDM) model with an isothermal core and two Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models

lead to the formation of an isothermal core in the halo, and is also mostly
insensitive to baryonic feedback processes, which act on longer time-scales.
Using rotation curves from 90 galaxies in the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate
Rotation Curves (SPARC) catalog, we perform a comprehensive model comparison
that addresses issues of statistical methodology from prior works. The best-fit
halo models that we recover are consistent with standard CDM concentration-mass
and abundance matching relations. We find that both the SIDM and
feedback-affected CDM models are better than a CDM model with no feedback in
explaining the rotation curves of low and high surface brightness galaxies in
the sample. However, when compared to each other, there is no strong
statistical preference for either the SIDM or the feedback-affected CDM halo

Kepler planet candidates. The planet-forming environments in these systems
would have literally been shaped by the binary orbits that persist to the

of ~0.1 mas/yr, that test whether the binary orbits tend to be aligned with the
edge-on transiting planet orbits. We rule out randomly-distributed binary
orbits at 4.7$\sigma$, and we show that low mutual inclinations are required to
explain the observed orbital arcs. If the stellar orbits have a field
binary-like eccentricity distribution, then the best match to our observed
orbital arcs is a distribution of mutual inclinations ranging from 0-30

partial and full disruption: for $\beta < \beta_{\rm c}$ a fraction of the star
survives the tidal interaction with the black hole, while for $\beta >

investigations have found $\beta_{\rm c} \simeq 0.9$ -- that results in the
reformation of a stellar core post-disruption that comprises approximately 25\%

self-gravity, which remains important because of the compression of the gas
both near pericenter, where the compression occurs out of the orbital plane,
and substantially after pericenter, where compression is within the plane. We
find that the core forms on a bound orbit about the black hole, and we discuss

duration $\tau_q$ as the time between crossing sSFR thresholds, we find that
$\sim$40% of galaxies quench rapidly with $\tau_q<$1 Gyr, but a substantial
tail of galaxies can take up to 10 Gyr to quench. Furthermore, 29% of galaxies
that left the star forming main sequence (SFMS) more than 2 Gyr ago never fully
quench by $z=0$. While the median $\tau_q$ is fairly constant with epoch, the
rate of galaxies leaving the SFMS increases steadily over cosmic time, with the
rate of slow quenchers being dominant around $z\sim2$ to 0.7. Compared to fast
quenchers ($\tau_q<$1 Gyr), slow-quenching galaxies ($\tau_q>$1 Gyr) were more
massive, had more massive black holes, had larger stellar radii and accreted
gas with higher specific angular momentum (AM) prior to quenching. These
properties evolve little by $z=0$, except for the accreting gas AM for fast
quenchers, which reaches the same high AM as the gas in slow quenchers. By
$z=0$, slow quenchers also have residual star formation in extended gas rings.
Using the expected relationship between stellar age gradient and $\tau_q$ for

field theories via the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) that we have shown
earlier to implement the restrictions imposed by quantum thermodynamics on such
many-body systems. We study an explicit encoding of a logical qubit into two
similar chirally propagating excitations of finite von-Neumann entropy on a
finite temperature background whose erasure can be implemented by an
appropriate inhomogeneous and instantaneous energy-momentum inflow from an
infinite energy memoryless bath due to which the system transits to a thermal
state. Holographically, these fast erasure processes can be depicted by
generalized AdS-Vaidya geometries described previously in which no assumption
of specific form of bulk matter is needed. We show that the quantum null energy
condition gives analytic results for the minimal finite temperature needed for
the deletion which is larger than the initial background temperature in
consistency with Landauer's principle. In particular, we find a simple
expression for the minimum final temperature needed for the erasure of a large
number of encoding qubits. We also find that if the encoding qubits are
localized over an interval shorter than a specific localization length, then
the fast erasure process is impossible, and furthermore this localization
length is the largest for an optimal amount of encoding qubits determined by
the central charge. We estimate the optimal encoding qubits for realistic
protection against fast erasure. We discuss possible generalizations of our

efficiency per free-fall time that also changes by 2 orders-of-magnitude,

of constant, low star formation efficiencies. Our target is a compact, massive
disk galaxy that has SFR 10$\times$ above the $z=0$ main-sequence; Toomre
$Q\approx0.5-0.7$ and high gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{mol}\approx
25$~km~s$^{-1}$). We find that IRAS08 is similar to other rotating, starburst
galaxies from the literature in the resolved

studies we find that distance from the main-sequence is a strong indicator of
the Kennicutt-Schmidt powerlaw slope, with slopes of $N\approx1.6$ for
starbursts from 100-10$^4$~M$_{\odot}$~pc$^{-2}$. Our target is consistent with
a scenario in which violent disk instabilities drive rapid inflows of gas. It

representative of the BBH population observed so far. In addition to inferring
cosmological and mass model parameters, we use dark sirens to test modified

equations on cosmological scales, leading to a different GW luminosity distance
which in some cases can be parametrized by variables $\Xi_0$ and $n$. General
relativity (GR) corresponds to $\Xi_0= 1$. We perform a joint estimate of the

the cosmology, and the modified GW luminosity distance. We use data from the
third LVK observation run and find - for the four mass models and for three SNR

GW signals. Furthermore, all modified gravity parameters have posteriors that
are compatible with the values predicted by GR at the 90% confidence interval.

requires statistical methods such as Bayesian inference in order to be solved.
Current methods employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to infer the
posterior probability of planetary structure parameters for a given exoplanet.
These methods are time consuming since they require the calculation of a large
number of planetary structure models. To speed up the inference process when
characterizing an exoplanet, we propose to use conditional invertible neural
networks (cINNs) to calculate the posterior probability of the internal
structure parameters. cINNs are a special type of neural network which excel in
solving inverse problems. We constructed a cINN using FrEIA, which was then
trained on a database of $5.6\cdot 10^6$ internal structure models to recover
the inverse mapping between internal structure parameters and observable
features (i.e., planetary mass, planetary radius and composition of the host
star). The cINN method was compared to a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. For that we
repeated the characterization of the exoplanet K2-111 b, using both the MCMC
method and the trained cINN. We show that the inferred posterior probability of
the internal structure parameters from both methods are very similar, with the
biggest differences seen in the exoplanet's water content. Thus cINNs are a
possible alternative to the standard time-consuming sampling methods. Indeed,
using cINNs allows for orders of magnitude faster inference of an exoplanet's
composition than what is possible using an MCMC method, however, it still
requires the computation of a large database of internal structures to train
the cINN. Since this database is only computed once, we found that using a cINN
is more efficient than an MCMC, when more than 10 exoplanets are characterized
using the same cINN.

fractional quantum Hall state. We show that the TDOS enhancement in a LL

farther amplified in presence of appropriate choice of non-local interaction
parameters, which is demonstrated through a neat algebraic expression in the
weak interaction limit. We also show that, in the full parameter regime

TDOS for LL junction with ""superconducting"" boundary condition and that of
""non-superconducting charge conserving"" boundary condition (discussed in Phys.

dependence of the proximity induced pair potential and TDOS as a function of
distance $x$ from the junction. We demonstrate that the dependence of the
spatial power law exponent for the `TDOS(x)/TDOS(x -> 0)' and the
`pair-potential(x)/pair-potential(x -> 0)' are distinct function of the various

0.79$\pm$0.03 and an indistinguishability between converted NV photons around
0.9 over the full range of the emission duration, confirming the removal of the

independent control over the nodes, time-multiplexing of control and quantum
signals, and active feedback to stabilize the output frequency. Our results

(GR), the maximum compactness $\mathcal{C}\equiv GM/(Rc^2)$ of a static,

$\mathcal{C}=4/9$. As a corollary, there exists a compactness gap between
perfect fluid stars and black holes (where $\mathcal{C}=1/2$). Here we
generalize Buchdahl's result by introducing the most general equation of state
for elastic matter with constant longitudinal wave speeds and apply it to
compute the maximum compactness of regular, self-gravitating objects in GR. We
show that: (i) the maximum compactness grows monotonically with the
longitudinal wave speed; (ii) elastic matter can exceed Buchdahl's bound and
reach the black hole compactness $\mathcal{C}=1/2$ continuously; (iii) however,
imposing subluminal wave propagation lowers the maximum compactness bound to
$\mathcal{C}\approx0.462$, which we conjecture to be the maximum compactness of
\emph{any} static elastic object satisfying causality; (iv) imposing also
radial stability further decreases the maximum compactness to
$\mathcal{C}\approx 0.389$. Therefore, although anisotropies are often invoked
as a mechanism for supporting horizonless ultracompact objects, we argue that
the black hole compactness cannot be reached with physically reasonable matter

quality of the generated images. We take a different approach, bypassing the

been shown capable of producing high-quality facial images. Because GANs are
characterized by weak controllability, the core of our approach is a method to
discover which directions in latent GAN space are responsible for controlling
facial pose and expression variations. We present a simple pipeline to learn
such directions with the aid of a 3D shape model which, by construction,
already captures disentangled directions for facial pose, identity and

space, our method can be successfully used for the reenactment of real-world

single source image (one-shot) and enabling cross-person reenactment. Our

  Our basic tool are quantum subspace states, defined as $|Col(X)\rangle =
\sum_{S\subset [n], |S|=d} det(X_{S}) |S\rangle$ for matrices $X \in
\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ such that $X^{T} X = I_{d}$, that encode
$d$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We develop two efficient state
preparation techniques, the first using Givens circuits uses the representation
of a subspace as a sequence of Givens rotations, while the second uses
efficient implementations of unitaries $\Gamma(x) = \sum_{i} x_{i} Z^{\otimes
(i-1)} \otimes X \otimes I^{n-i}$ with $O(\log n)$ depth circuits that we term
Clifford loaders.

  patient study",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: Several studies have shown that both respiratory and cardiac
motion can be extracted from the Pilot Tone (PT) signal successfully. However,
most of these studies were performed in healthy volunteers. In addition,
validating PT using ECG as a reference can be problematic because both PT and
ECG tend to be unreliable in patients with arrhythmias. Purpose: We seek to
evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the cardiac and respiratory signals
extracted from PT in patients clinically referred for cardiovascular MRI with
the image-derived signals as the reference. Methods: Twenty-three patients were
scanned on a 1.5 T scanner using balanced steady-state free-precession
real-time (RT) cine sequence. The PT signal was generated by a built-in PT
transmitter integrated within the body array coil. For comparison, commercial
ECG and BioMatrix (BM) respiratory sensor signals were synchronously recorded.
Results: The respiratory motion extracted from PT correlated positively with
the image-derived respiratory signal in all cases and showed a stronger
correlation (absolute coefficient: 0.95+-0.09) than BM (0.72+-0.24). For the
cardiac signal, PT trigger jitter (standard deviation of PT trigger locations
relative to ECG triggers) ranged from 6.6 to 83.3 ms, with a median of 21.8 ms.
The mean absolute difference between the PT and corresponding ECG cardiac cycle
duration was less than 5% of the averaged ECG RR interval for 21 out of 23
patients. Overall, the performance of PT-based trigger extraction was
comparable to that of ECG. We did not observe significant linear dependence
(p>0.28) of PT delay and PT jitter on the patients' BMI or cardiac cycle
duration. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of PT to monitor
both respiratory and cardiac motion in patients clinically referred for
cardiovascular MRI.

sectors because it can improve the network reliability and fault tolerance,
reduce mission completion time through collaboration, and adapt to dynamic

is a challenging task due to their fast node mobility, which results in
frequent link disruptions. Many existing AN-specific mobility-aware schemes
restrictively assume that UAVs fly in straight lines, to reduce the high
uncertainty in the mobility pattern and simplify the calculation of link
lifetime (LLT). Here, LLT represents the duration after which the link between
a node pair terminates. However, the application of such schemes is severely
limited, which makes them unsuitable for practical autonomous ANs.
  In this report, a mathematical framework is described to accurately compute
the \textit{LLT} value for a UAV node pair, where each node flies independently
in a randomly selected smooth trajectory. In addition, the impact of random
trajectory changes on LLT accuracy is also discussed.

studying the hot and energetic Universe. WFI observations of faint, diffuse
sources will be limited by uncertainty in the background produced by
high-energy particles. These particles produce easily identified ""cosmic-ray
tracks"" along with signals from secondary photons and electrons generated by
particle interactions with the instrument. The signal from these secondaries is
identical to the X-rays focused by the optics, and cannot be filtered without
also eliminating these precious photons. As part of a larger effort to
understand the WFI background, we here present results from a study of
background-reduction techniques that exploit the spatial correlation between
cosmic-ray particle tracks and secondary events. We use Geant4 simulations to
generate a realistic particle background, sort this into simulated WFI frames,
and process those frames in a similar way to the expected flight and ground
software to produce a WFI observation containing only particle background. The
technique under study, Self Anti-Coincidence or SAC, then selectively filters
regions of the detector around particle tracks, turning the WFI into its own
anti-coincidence detector. We show that SAC is effective at improving the
systematic uncertainty for observations of faint, diffuse sources, but at the
cost of statistical uncertainty due to a reduction in signal. If sufficient
pixel pulse-height information is telemetered to the ground for each frame,
then this technique can be applied selectively based on the science goals,
providing flexibility without affecting the data quality for other science. The
results presented here are relevant for any future silicon-based pixelated
X-ray imaging detector, and could allow the WFI and similar instruments to
probe to truly faint X-ray surface brightness.

Flexible model selection, i.e., it fits a tensor by assigning its values as a

analysis often assume that the prior distribution is Gaussian. This assumption
is limited for inverse problems aiming to promote sparsity in the parameter

this limitation, we consider a prior normalization technique that transforms
any non-Gaussian (e.g. heavy-tailed) priors into standard Gaussian
distributions, which makes it possible to implement LIS methods to accelerate
MCMC sampling via such transformations. We also rigorously investigate the
integration of such transformations with several MCMC methods for
high-dimensional problems. Finally, we demonstrate various aspects of our
theoretical claims on two nonlinear inverse problems.

to sample with the target policy but only have access to a dataset generated by

often suffer from either significant bias or exponentially large variance. In
this paper, we propose the double Fitted PG estimation (FPG) algorithm. FPG can
work with an arbitrary policy parameterization, assuming access to a
Bellman-complete value function class. In the case of linear value function
approximation, we provide a tight finite-sample upper bound on policy gradient
estimation error, that is governed by the amount of distribution mismatch
measured in feature space. We also establish the asymptotic normality of FPG
estimation error with a precise covariance characterization, which is further
shown to be statistically optimal with a matching Cramer-Rao lower bound.
Empirically, we evaluate the performance of FPG on both policy gradient
estimation and policy optimization, using either softmax tabular or ReLU policy
networks. Under various metrics, our results show that FPG significantly
outperforms existing off-policy PG estimation methods based on importance

We show in this paper that such ratio clipping may not be a good option as it

  In particular, an $h_Q$-gon $\mathbf{V}$ of type $D_n$ is a (centrally)

interesting case is $E_6$, where the (stable) $h_Q$-gon (dodecagon) can be
realized as a pair of planar tiling pattern.

present three approaches to mine news-sharing networks for detecting
information polluters at scale, which is critical to mitigate their impact.
Each hinges on an assumption about how credibility flows in different kinds of
information diffusion networks: the retweet network captures the spread of
misinformation among accounts, the account-source bipartite network focuses on
the credibility of the sources shared by an account, and the news co-sharing
network considers the similarity between content shared by different accounts.
We apply or extend several network centrality and embedding algorithms to
calculate account credibility. We then systematically evaluate these methods on
empirical networks constructed from Twitter data. We find that some of our
proposed extensions of centrality measures work well for retweet and bipartite
networks. Graph embedding can be applied to retweet and co-sharing networks,
where it outperforms centrality-based methods at the cost of higher complexity

and economic damage. Monitoring and understanding urban flooding in the local
scale is a challenging task due to the complicated urban landscape, intricate
hydraulic process, and the lack of high-quality and resolution data. The
emerging smart city technology such as monitoring cameras provides an
unprecedented opportunity to address the data issue. However, estimating the
water accumulation on the land surface based on the monitoring footage is
unreliable using the traditional segmentation technique because the boundary of
the water accumulation, under the influence of varying weather, background, and
illumination, is usually too fuzzy to identify, and the oblique angle and image
distortion in the video monitoring data prevents georeferencing and
object-based measurements. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised
segmentation scheme for surface water extent recognition from the footage of an
oblique monitoring camera. The semi-supervised segmentation algorithm was found
suitable to determine the water boundary and the monoplotting method was
successfully applied to georeference the pixels of the monitoring video for the
virtual quantification of the local drainage process. The correlation and
mechanism-based analysis demonstrates the value of the proposed method in
advancing the understanding of local drainage hydraulics. The workflow and

faint end, ensure that the relative incidence rates of the different objects
are distributed according to their respective luminosity functions, and perform
a thorough modeling of the noise distribution in each filter, by sampling the

impressive results on complex domains, they provide no performance guarantees

Specifically, we study generalization bounds under a linear dependence of the

proposed compounds as oxidizer components and Ideal specific impulse

computed using the NASA CEA software package. To predict the actual delivered

more than two decades. Dual-energy CT (DECT) has shown high accuracy in
estimating electronic density or proton stopping-power maps used in treatment
planning. However, the presence of metal implants introduces severe streaking
artifacts in the reconstructed images, affecting the diagnostic accuracy and
treatment performance. In order to reduce the metal artifacts in DECT, we
introduce a metal-artifact reduction scheme for iterative DECT algorithms. An
estimate is substituted for the corrupt data in each iteration. We utilize
normalized metal-artifact reduction (NMAR) composed with image-domain
decomposition to initialize the algorithm and speed up the convergence. A fully
3D joint statistical DECT algorithm, dual-energy alternating minimization
(DEAM), with the proposed scheme is tested on experimental and clinical helical
data acquired on a Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner. We compared DEAM with
the proposed method to the original DEAM and vendor reconstructions with and
without metal-artifact reduction for orthopedic implants (O-MAR). The
visualization and quantitative analysis show that DEAM with the proposed method
has the best performance in reducing streaking artifacts caused by metallic
objects.

This allows irregular forecasting with arbitrary time-steps. However, the
expressive temporal flexibility often comes with a high sensitivity to noise.
In addition, current methods model measurements and control together, limiting
generalization to different control policies. These properties severely limit
applicability to medical treatment problems, which require reliable forecasting
given high noise, limited data and changing treatment policies. We introduce
the Neural Eigen-SDE algorithm (NESDE), which relies on piecewise linear
dynamics modeling with spectral representation. NESDE provides control over the
expressiveness level; decoupling of control from measurements; and closed-form
continuous prediction in inference. NESDE is demonstrated to provide robust
forecasting in both synthetic and real high-noise medical problems. Finally, we
use the learned dynamics models to publish simulated medical gym environments.

2-satisfiabilty (2-SAT) problems, consisting of upto 18-variables problems, we
analyze the scaling complexity of the quantum annealing algorithm and study the
distributions of the minimum energy gap and the success probability. We extend
the analysis of the standard quantum annealing Hamiltonian by introducing an
additional term, the trigger Hamiltonian, which can be of two types :
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. We use these trigger Hamiltonians to study
their influence on the success probability for solving the selected 2-SAT
problems. We found that although the scaling of the run-time is exponential for
the standard and modified quantum annealing Hamiltonians, the scaling constant
in case of adding the trigger Hamiltonians can be significantly smaller.
Furthermore, certain choices for the trigger Hamiltonian and annealing times
can result in a better scaling than that for simulated annealing. Lastly, we
also use the quantum annealers of D-Wave Systems Inc. to study their
performance in solving the 2-SAT problems and compare it with the simulation

quantum computation stating that arbitrarily long quantum computations can be
performed with a polylogarithmic overhead provided the noise level is below a
constant level. A recent work by Fawzi, Grospellier and Leverrier (FOCS 2018)
building on a result by Gottesman (QIC 2013) has shown that the space overhead
can be asymptotically reduced to a constant independent of the circuit provided
we only consider circuits with a length bounded by a polynomial in the width.
In this work, using a minimal model for quantum fault tolerance, we establish a
general lower bound on the space overhead required to achieve fault tolerance.
  For any non-unitary qubit channel $\mathcal{N}$ and any quantum fault
tolerance schemes against $\mathrm{i.i.d.}$ noise modeled by $\mathcal{N}$, we
prove a lower bound of
$\max\left\{\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})^{-1}n,\alpha_\mathcal{N} \log T\right\}$ on
the number of physical qubits, for circuits of length $T$ and width $n$. Here,
$\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})$ denotes the quantum capacity of $\mathcal{N}$ and
$\alpha_\mathcal{N}>0$ is a constant only depending on the channel
$\mathcal{N}$. In our model, we allow for qubits to be replaced by fresh ones
during the execution of the circuit and we allow classical computation to be
free and perfect. This improves upon results that assumed classical
computations to be also affected by noise, and that sometimes did not allow for
fresh qubits to be added. Along the way, we prove an exponential upper bound on
the maximal length of fault-tolerant quantum computation with amplitude damping

nonzero charges integrating Hamilton's equation can be defined for all
diffeomorphisms acting near the boundary of a subregion in a gravitational
theory. This is done by extending the phase space to include a set of embedding
fields that parameterize the location of the boundary. Because their
construction differs from previous works on extended phase spaces by a
covariant phase space ambiguity, the question arises as to whether the
resulting charges are unambiguously defined. Here, we demonstrate that
ambiguity-free charges can be obtained by appealing to the variational
principle for the subregion, following recent developments on dealing with
boundaries in the covariant phase space. Resolving the ambiguity produces
corrections to the diffeomorphism charges, and also generates additional
obstructions to integrability of Hamilton's equation. We emphasize the fact
that the CLP extended phase space produces nonzero diffeomorphism charges
distinguishes it from previous constructions in which diffeomorphisms are pure
gauge, since the embedding fields can always be eliminated from the latter by a
choice of unitary gauge. Finally, we show that Wald-Zoupas charges, with their
characteristic obstruction to integrability, are associated with a modified
transformation in the extended phase space, clarifying the reason behind
integrability of Hamilton's equation for standard diffeomorphisms.

Accepted at FoSSaCS 2023",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Much work has been done to give semantics to probabilistic programming
languages. In recent years, most of the semantics used to reason about
probabilistic programs fall in two categories: semantics based on Markov
kernels and semantics based on linear operators.
  Both styles of semantics have found numerous applications in reasoning about
probabilistic programs, but they each have their strengths and weaknesses.
Though it is believed that there is a connection between them there are no
languages that can handle both styles of programming.
  In this work we address these questions by defining a two-level calculus and
its categorical semantics which makes it possible to program with both kinds of
semantics. From the logical side of things we see this language as an
alternative resource interpretation of linear logic, where the resource being
kept track of is sampling instead of variable use.

analytic power of such methods. Here we propose an extension of gene set

called gene set proximity analysis (GSPA). Compared with existing methods, GSPA
provides improved ability to identify disease-associated pathways in
disease-matched gene expression datasets, while improving reproducibility of

straightforward, reducing to classical gene set enrichment through a single
user-defined parameter. We apply our method to identify novel drug associations

  function approximation on unknown domains",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in computational science and engineering can be described in
terms of approximating a smooth function of $d$ variables, defined over an
unknown domain of interest $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, from sample data. Here
both the curse of dimensionality ($d\gg 1$) and the lack of domain knowledge
with $\Omega$ potentially irregular and/or disconnected are confounding factors
for sampling-based methods. Na\""{i}ve approaches often lead to wasted samples
and inefficient approximation schemes. For example, uniform sampling can result
in upwards of 20\% wasted samples in some problems. In surrogate model
construction in computational uncertainty quantification (UQ), the high cost of
computing samples needs a more efficient sampling procedure. In the last years,
methods for computing such approximations from sample data have been studied in
the case of irregular domains. The advantages of computing sampling measures
depending on an approximation space $P$ of $\dim(P)=N$ have been shown. In
particular, such methods confer advantages such as stability and
well-conditioning, with $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ as sample complexity. The
recently-proposed adaptive sampling for general domains (ASGD) strategy is one
method to construct these sampling measures. The main contribution of this
paper is to improve ASGD by adaptively updating the sampling measures over
unknown domains. We achieve this by first introducing a general domain
adaptivity strategy (GDAS), which approximates the function and domain of
interest from sample points. Second, we propose adaptive sampling for unknown
domains (ASUD), which generates sampling measures over a domain that may not be
known in advance. Our results show that the ASUD approach consistently achieves
the same or smaller errors as uniform sampling, but using fewer, and often
significantly fewer evaluations.

method of the step-size greatly improves the performance. More precisely, we
maintain a global step-size scale for the update as well as a gain factor for
each coordinate. We adjust the global scale based on the alignment of the

for updating the local gain factors. This type of step-size scale tuning has
been done before with gradient descent updates. In this paper, we update the
step-size scale and the gain variables with exponentiated gradient updates

biological systems, where individuals join the effort in a collective reaction
to avoid being caught by an approaching predator. We study a nonhierarchical
tritrophic system, whose predator-prey interactions are described by the
rock-paper-scissors game rules. We performed a set of spatial stochastic
simulations where organisms of one out of the species can resist predation in a
collective strategy. The drop in predation capacity is local, which means that
each predator faces a particular opposition depending on the prey group size
surrounding it. Considering that the interference in a predator action depends
on the prey's physical and cognitive ability, we explore the role of a
conditioning factor that indicates the fraction of the species apt to perform
the antipredator strategy. Because of the local unbalancing of the cyclic
predator-prey interactions, departed spatial domains mainly occupied by a
single species emerge. Unlike the rock-paper-scissors model with a weak species
because a nonlocal reason, our findings show that if the predation probability
of one species is reduced because individuals face local antipredator response,
the species does not predominate. Instead, the local unbalancing of the
rock-paper-scissors model results in the prevalence of the weak species' prey.
Finally, the outcomes show that local unevenness may jeopardise biodiversity,

uses a predetermined set of internally stabilized states together with
heteroassociation between the internal states and arbitrary external patterns.

their morphological similarity to the human hand holds immense potential to
accelerate robot learning. We propose DexVIP, an approach to learn dexterous
robotic grasping from human-object interactions present in in-the-wild YouTube
videos. We do this by curating grasp images from human-object interaction
videos and imposing a prior over the agent's hand pose when learning to grasp
with deep reinforcement learning. A key advantage of our method is that the
learned policy is able to leverage free-form in-the-wild visual data. As a
result, it can easily scale to new objects, and it sidesteps the standard
practice of collecting human demonstrations in a lab -- a much more expensive
and indirect way to capture human expertise. Through experiments on 27 objects
with a 30-DoF simulated robot hand, we demonstrate that DexVIP compares
favorably to existing approaches that lack a hand pose prior or rely on
specialized tele-operation equipment to obtain human demonstrations, while also
being faster to train. Project page:

constraints put new upper bounds on the plant-model mismatch and the bandwidth
of the DOb, thus limiting the achievable robustness against disturbances and
the phase-lead effect in the inner-loop. Violating the design constraints may
yield severe stability and performance issues in practice; therefore, they
should be considered in tuning the control parameters of the robust motion
controller. This paper also shows that continuous-time analysis methods
fall-short in deriving the fundamental design constraints on the nominal plant
model and the bandwidth of the digital DOb. Therefore, we may observe
unexpected stability and performance issues when tuning the control parameters
of the digital robust motion controllers in the continuous-time domain. To
improve the robust stability and performance of the motion controllers, this
paper explains the fundamental design constraints of the DOb by employing the
generalised continuous and discrete Bode Integral Theorems in a unified
framework. Simulation and experimental results are given to verify the proposed
analysis method.

synthesised by employing a second-order Disturbance Observer (DOb), which
allows us to estimate not only disturbances but also their first and second

using the Brunovsky canonical form transformation and the estimations of

Developers often turn to refactoring when they want to restructure software to
improve its quality without changing its external behavior. Studies show that
small-scale (floss) refactoring is common in industry and can often be
performed by a single developer in short sessions, even though developers do
much of this work manually instead of using refactoring tools. However, some
refactoring efforts are much larger in scale, requiring entire teams and months
of effort, and the role of tools in these efforts is not as well studied. In
this paper, we report on a survey we conducted with developers to understand
large-scale refactoring, its prevalence, and how tools support it. Our results
from 107 industry developers demonstrate that projects commonly go through
multiple large-scale refactorings, each of which requires considerable effort.
While there is often a desire to refactor, other business concerns such as
developing new features often take higher priority. Our study finds that
developers use several categories of tools to support large-scale refactoring
and rely more heavily on general-purpose tools like IDEs than on tools designed
specifically to support refactoring. Tool support varies across the different
activities, with some particularly challenging activities seeing little use of
tools in practice. Our study demonstrates a clear need for better large-scale
refactoring tools and an opportunity for refactoring researchers to make a
difference in industry. The results we summarize in this paper is one concrete
step towards this goal.

constrain the optimization. While deep-learning-based methods have simplified
the optimization by end-to-end training, they fail to generalize well to blurs
unseen in the training dataset. Thus, training image-specific models is
important for higher generalization. Deep image prior (DIP) provides an
approach to optimize the weights of a randomly initialized network with a
single degraded image by maximum a posteriori (MAP), which shows that the
architecture of a network can serve as the hand-crafted image prior. Different
from the conventional hand-crafted image priors that are statistically
obtained, it is hard to find a proper network architecture because the
relationship between images and their corresponding network architectures is
unclear. As a result, the network architecture cannot provide enough constraint
for the latent sharp image. This paper proposes a new variational deep image
prior (VDIP) for blind image deconvolution, which exploits additive
hand-crafted image priors on latent sharp images and approximates a
distribution for each pixel to avoid suboptimal solutions. Our mathematical
analysis shows that the proposed method can better constrain the optimization.

better quality than that of the original DIP on benchmark datasets. The source

constitutive models and remains stable across a wide span of timestep sizes,

same task, or labeled data from a related task -- to learn a given task? This
paper formalizes the question using the theory of reference priors. Reference
priors are objective, uninformative Bayesian priors that maximize the mutual
information between the task and the weights of the model. Such priors enable
the task to maximally affect the Bayesian posterior, e.g., reference priors
depend upon the number of samples available for learning the task and for very
small sample sizes, the prior puts more probability mass on low-complexity
models in the hypothesis space. This paper presents the first demonstration of
reference priors for medium-scale deep networks and image-based data. We
develop generalizations of reference priors and demonstrate applications to two
problems. First, by using unlabeled data to compute the reference prior, we
develop new Bayesian semi-supervised learning methods that remain effective
even with very few samples per class. Second, by using labeled data from the
source task to compute the reference prior, we develop a new pretraining method
for transfer learning that allows data from the target task to maximally affect
the Bayesian posterior. Empirical validation of these methods is conducted on
image classification datasets. Code is available at

self-gravitating system of massive particles, which satisfies all energy
conditions and physically models the gravitational effect of dark matter
distribution around a nonrotating black hole. Using nearly circular bound
orbits of stars, we obtain a simple formula for the precession rate. This
formula explicitly shows that the precession rate is determined by a positive
contribution (i.e., a prograde shift) from the conventional
general-relativistic effect and a negative contribution (i.e., a retrograde
shift) from the local matter density. The four quantities for such an orbit
(i.e., the orbital shift angle, the radial oscillation period, the redshift,
and the star position mapped onto the celestial sphere) determine the local
values of the background model functions. Furthermore, we not only evaluate the
precession rate of nearly circular bound orbits in several specific models but
also simulate several bound orbits with large eccentricity and their periapsis
shifts. The present exact model demonstrates that the retrograde precession
does not mean any exotic central objects such as naked singularities or
wormholes but simply the existence of significant energy density of matters on

structure determination and underlying strain mapping for crystalline materials
is important for many technological applications. Scanning electron
nanodiffraction offers a procedure for identifying and collecting strain maps
with good accuracy and high spatial resolutions. However, the application of
this technique is limited, particularly in thick samples where the electron
beam can undergo multiple scattering, which introduces signal nonlinearities.
Deep learning methods have the potential to invert these complex signals, but
previous implementations are often trained only on specific crystal systems or
a small subset of the crystal structure and microscope parameter phase space.
In this study, we implement a Fourier space, complex-valued deep neural network
called FCU-Net, to invert highly nonlinear electron diffraction patterns into
the corresponding quantitative structure factor images. We trained the FCU-Net
using over 200,000 unique simulated dynamical diffraction patterns which
include many different combinations of crystal structures, orientations,
thicknesses, microscope parameters, and common experimental artifacts. We
evaluated the trained FCU-Net model against simulated and experimental 4D-STEM
diffraction datasets, where it substantially out-performs conventional analysis
methods. Our simulated diffraction pattern library, implementation of FCU-Net,
and trained model weights are freely available in open source repositories, and
can be adapted to many different diffraction measurement problems.

two-dimensional hexagonal golden-mean tiling. We find that the vertex model of
the tiling is bipartite, with a sublattice imbalance of $\sqrt{5}/(6\tau^3)$
(where $\tau$ is the golden mean), and that the non-interacting tight-binding
model gives macroscopically degenerate states at $E=0$. We clarify that each
sublattice has specific types of confined states, which in turn leads to an
interesting spatial pattern in the local magnetizations in the weak coupling
regime. Furthermore, this allows us to analytically obtain the lower bound on
the fraction of the confined states as $(\tau+9)/(6\tau^6)\sim 0.0986$, which
is conjectured to be the exact fraction. These results imply that a
ferrimagnetically ordered state is realized even in the weak coupling limit.
The introduction of the Coulomb interaction lifts the macroscopic degeneracy at
the Fermi level, and induces finite staggered magnetization as well as uniform
magnetization. Likewise, the spatial distribution of the magnetizations
continuously changes with increasing interaction strength. The crossover
behavior in the magnetically ordered states is also addressed in terms of the
perpendicular space analysis.

slowed down near rough solid surfaces and the dynamics at location far from the
interfaces is sped up. In thick films, the mobility gradient normalized by the

normalized gradient of the glass transition temperature is independent of

either a coordinator, who takes action only if enough others do so, or an
anticoordinator, who takes action only if few others do so. Populations
consisting of exclusively one of these types are known to reach an equilibrium,
where every individual is satisfied with her decision. Yet it remains unknown
whether oscillations take place in a population consisting of both types, and
if they do, what features they share. We study a well-mixed population of
individuals, which are either a coordinator or anticoordinator, each associated
with a possibly unique threshold and initialized with the strategy A or B. At
each time, an agent becomes active to update her strategy based on her
threshold: an active coordinator (resp. anticoordinator) updates her strategy
to A (resp. B) if the portion of other agents who have chosen A exceeds (falls
short of) her threshold, and updates to B (resp. A) otherwise. We define the
state of the population dynamics as the distribution over the thresholds of
those who have chosen A. We show that the population can admit several
minimally positively invariant sets, where the solution trajectory oscillates.
We explicitly characterize a class of positively invariant sets, prove their
invariance, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for their
stability. Our results highlight the possibility of non-trivial, complex

  Flood Evacuation","31 pages, 7 figures",,,,"econ.EM stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The decisions of whether and how to evacuate during a climate disaster are
influenced by a wide range of factors, including sociodemographics, emergency
messaging, and social influence. Further complexity is introduced when multiple
hazards occur simultaneously, such as a flood evacuation taking place amid a
viral pandemic that requires physical distancing. Such multi-hazard events can
necessitate a nuanced navigation of competing decision-making strategies
wherein a desire to follow peers is weighed against contagion risks. To better
understand these nuances, we distributed an online survey during a pandemic
surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern
states in the United States with high risk of flooding. In this paper, we
estimate a random parameter logit model in both preference space and
willingness-to-pay space. Our results show that the directionality and
magnitude of the influence of peers' choices of whether and how to evacuate
vary widely across respondents. Overall, the decision of whether to evacuate is
positively impacted by peer behavior, while the decision of how to evacuate is
negatively impacted by peers. Furthermore, an increase in flood threat level
lessens the magnitude of these impacts. These findings have important
implications for the design of tailored emergency messaging strategies.
Specifically, emphasizing or deemphasizing the severity of each threat in a
multi-hazard scenario may assist in: (1) encouraging a reprioritization of
competing risk perceptions and (2) magnifying or neutralizing the impacts of
social influence, thereby (3) nudging evacuation decision-making toward a
desired outcome.

the question to what extent these quasi-2D systems indeed represent 2D systems

hydrodynamic interactions to show that dense quasi-2D colloidal bi-disperse

their 2D counterparts at the same area fraction. This difference is induced by
the additional vertical space in the quasi-2D samples in which the small

particles in the projected trajectories. Surprisingly, this difference in the

characterizes the systems by means of a suitable structural quantity related to
the radial distribution function. This implies that in the two geometries the
relevant physics for glass-formation is essentially identical. Our results
provide not only practical implications on 2D colloidal experiments but also

diffusion constant $D_0$, rotational diffusion rate $D_\theta$, and chirality
of the active particles $\Omega$. It is demonstrated that the particles can
exhibit upstream drift, resulting in a negative $v$, for the optimal parameter
values of $u_0$, $D_\theta$, and $\Omega$. Interestingly, the direction of $v$
can be controlled by tuning these parameters. We observe that for some optimal
values of $u_0$ and $\Omega$, the chiral particles aggregate near a channel
wall, and the corresponding $D_{eff}$ is enhanced. However, for the nonchiral

developing microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices for separating the active

with the EFG community often having to catch up with advances (e.g.,
last-iterate convergence and predictive regret bounds) from the larger NFG
community. In this paper we show that the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights
Update (OMWU) algorithm -- the premier learning algorithm for NFGs -- can be
simulated on the normal-form equivalent of an EFG in linear time per iteration
in the game tree size using a kernel trick. The resulting algorithm, Kernelized
OMWU (KOMWU), applies more broadly to all convex games whose strategy space is
a polytope with 0/1 integral vertices, as long as the kernel can be evaluated
efficiently. In the particular case of EFGs, KOMWU closes several standing gaps
between NFG and EFG learning, by enabling direct, black-box transfer to EFGs of
desirable properties of learning dynamics that were so far known to be
achievable only in NFGs. Specifically, KOMWU gives the first algorithm that
guarantees at the same time last-iterate convergence, lower dependence on the
size of the game tree than all prior algorithms, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$
regret when followed by all players.

typical excursions of the polymer away from the surface scale as $\Delta \sim

from flat to curved geometry of a stretched polymer corresponds to the
crossover from large to short time scales in the KPZ stochastic growth. Thus,

errors. We use this approach to obtain decoding results for both transitive
codes and Reed-Muller codes. We give three kinds of results about linear codes
in general, and transitive linear codes in particular.
  1) We give a tight bound on the weight distribution of every transitive
linear code $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^N$: $\Pr_{c \in C}[|c| = \alpha N] \leq
2^{-(1-h(\alpha)) \mathsf{dim}(C)}$.
  2) We give a criterion that certifies that a linear code $C$ can be decoded
on the binary symmetric channel. Let $K_s(x)$ denote the Krawtchouk polynomial
of degree $s$, and let $C^\perp$ denote the dual code of $C$. We show that
bounds on $\mathbb{E}_{c \in C^{\perp}}[ K_{\epsilon N}(|c|)^2]$ imply that $C$
recovers from errors on the binary symmetric channel with parameter $\epsilon$.
Weaker bounds can be used to obtain list-decoding results using similar
methods. One consequence of our criterion is that whenever the weight
distribution of $C^\perp$ is sufficiently close to the binomial distribution in
some interval around $\frac{N}{2}$, $C$ is resilient to $\epsilon$-errors.
  3) We combine known estimates for the Krawtchouk polynomials with our weight
bound for transitive codes, and with known weight bounds for Reed-Muller codes,
to obtain list-decoding results for both these families of codes. In some
regimes, our bounds for Reed-Muller codes achieve the information-theoretic
optimal trade-off between rate and list size.

high-dimensional nature of video observations. Towards addressing this issue,
we introduce here a new algorithm called Visual Generative Adversarial
Imitation from Observation using a State Observer VGAIfO-SO. At its core,
VGAIfO-SO seeks to address sample inefficiency using a novel, self-supervised
state observer, which provides estimates of lower-dimensional proprioceptive
state representations from high-dimensional images. We show experimentally in
several continuous control environments that VGAIfO-SO is more sample efficient
than other IfO algorithms at learning from video-only demonstrations and can
sometimes even achieve performance close to the Generative Adversarial
Imitation from Observation (GAIfO) algorithm that has privileged access to the
demonstrator's proprioceptive state information.

successful approaches to study the thermodynamics of strongly-correlated

Exceptional accuracy is achieved with a fine-tune process, surpassing the
previous methods including the linearized tensor renormalization group [Phys.

time cost is nearly independent of the target temperature including the
extremely-low temperatures. The proposed idea can be extended to

consequences: While the average time spent searching for parking exceeds dozens
of hours per driver every year in many Western cities, the associated cruising
traffic generates major externalities, by emitting pollutants and contributing
to congestion. However, the laws governing the parking search time remain
opaque in many regards, which hinders any general understanding of the problem
and its determinants. Here, we frame the problem of parking search in a very
generic, but mathematically compact formulation which puts the focus on the
role of the street network and the unequal attractiveness of parking spaces.
This problem is solved in two independent ways, valid in any street network and
for a wide range of drivers' behaviours. Numerically, this is done by means of
a computationally efficient and versatile agent-based model. Analytically, we
leverage the machinery of Statistical Physics and Graph Theory to derive a
generic mean-field relation giving the parking search time as a function of the
occupancy of parking spaces; an expression for the latter is obtained in the
stationary regime. We show that these theoretical results are applicable in toy
networks as well as in complex, realistic cases such as the large-scale street
network of the city of Lyon, France. Taken as a whole, these findings clarify
the parameters that directly control the search time and provide transport
engineers with a quantitative grasp of the parking problem. Besides, they
establish formal connections between the parking issue in realistic settings

human-centric images from a fine-grained perspective. Although end-to-end HOI
detection models thrive, their paradigm of parallel human/object detection and
verb class prediction loses two-stage methods' merit: object-guided hierarchy.
The object in one HOI triplet gives direct clues to the verb to be predicted.
In this paper, we aim to boost end-to-end models with object-guided statistical
priors. Specifically, We propose to utilize a Verb Semantic Model (VSM) and use
semantic aggregation to profit from this object-guided hierarchy. Similarity KL
(SKL) loss is proposed to optimize VSM to align with the HOI dataset's priors.
To overcome the static semantic embedding problem, we propose to generate
cross-modality-aware visual and semantic features by Cross-Modal Calibration
(CMC). The above modules combined composes Object-guided Cross-modal
Calibration Network (OCN). Experiments conducted on two popular HOI detection
benchmarks demonstrate the significance of incorporating the statistical prior
knowledge and produce state-of-the-art performances. More detailed analysis
indicates proposed modules serve as a stronger verb predictor and a more
superior method of utilizing prior knowledge. The codes are available at

for each factor E1, E2. This allows, in particular, to compute the isotropy
classes of any reducible representation, once one knows the decomposition into
irreducible factors and the symmetry classes for the irreducible factors. In
the specific case of the three dimensional orthogonal group O(3), clips between
some types of subgroups of O(3) have already been calculated. However, until

detectors, and trackers, many applications require models that continually
adapt to changing input distributions, changing tasks, and changing
environmental conditions. Indeed, this ability to continuously accrue knowledge
and use past experience to learn new tasks quickly in continual settings is one
of the key properties of an intelligent system. For complex and
high-dimensional problems, simply updating the model continually with standard
learning algorithms such as gradient descent may result in slow adaptation.
Meta-learning can provide a powerful tool to accelerate adaptation yet is
conventionally studied in batch settings. In this paper, we study how
meta-learning can be applied to tackle online problems of this nature,
simultaneously adapting to changing tasks and input distributions and
meta-training the model in order to adapt more quickly in the future. Extending
meta-learning into the online setting presents its own challenges, and although
several prior methods have studied related problems, they generally require a
discrete notion of tasks, with known ground-truth task boundaries. Such methods
typically adapt to each task in sequence, resetting the model between tasks,
rather than adapting continuously across tasks. In many real-world settings,
such discrete boundaries are unavailable, and may not even exist. To address
these settings, we propose a Fully Online Meta-Learning (FOML) algorithm, which
does not require any ground truth knowledge about the task boundaries and stays
fully online without resetting back to pre-trained weights. Our experiments
show that FOML was able to learn new tasks faster than the state-of-the-art
online learning methods on Rainbow-MNIST, CIFAR100 and CELEBA datasets.

possibility that an individual neutron moving through a two-path interferometer

it is important to distinguish between the probability of finding the complete
particle in one of the paths and the distribution of an individual particle
over both paths. We accomplish this distinction by applying a magnetic field in
only one of the paths and observing the exact value of its effect on the
neutron spin in the two output ports of the interferometer. The results show
that individual particles experience a specific fraction of the magnetic field
applied in one of the paths, indicating that a fraction or even a multiple of
the particle was present in the path before the interference of the two paths
was registered. The obtained path presence equals the weak value of the path
projector and is not a statistical average but applies to every individual
neutron, verified by the recently introduced method of feedback compensation.

models of subrecoil-laser-cooled gases. One model is based on a heterogeneous
random walk (HRW), another is an HRW with long-range jumps (the exponential
model), and the other is a mean-field-like approximation of the exponential
model (the deterministic model). All the models show an accumulation of the
momentum at zero in the long-time limit, and a formal steady state cannot be
normalized, i.e., there exists an infinite invariant density. We obtain the
exact form of the infinite invariant density and the scaling function for the
exponential and deterministic models and devise a useful approximation for the
momentum distribution in the HRW model. While the models are kinetically
non-identical, it is natural to wonder whether their ergodic properties share
common traits, given that they are all described by an infinite invariant
density. We show that the answer to this question depends on the type of
observable under study. If the observable is integrable, the ergodic properties
such as the statistical behavior of the time averages are universal as they are
described by the Darling-Kac theorem. In contrast, for non-integrable
observables, the models in general exhibit non-identical statistical laws. This
implies that focusing on non-integrable observables, we discover non-universal
features of the cooling process, that hopefully can lead to a better
understanding of the particular model most suitable for a statistical
description of the process. This result is expected to hold true for many other
systems, beyond laser cooling.

examining the rank characteristics of the subspace spanned by gradients across
epochs (i.e., the gradient-space) in centralized model training, and observe
that this gradient-space often consists of a few leading principal components
accounting for an overwhelming majority (95-99%) of the explained variance.
Motivated by this, we propose the ""Look-back Gradient Multiplier"" (LBGM)
algorithm, which exploits this low-rank property to enable gradient recycling
between model update rounds of federated learning, reducing transmissions of
large parameters to single scalars for aggregation. We analytically
characterize the convergence behavior of LBGM, revealing the nature of the
trade-off between communication savings and model performance. Our subsequent
experimental results demonstrate the improvement LBGM obtains in communication
overhead compared to conventional federated learning on several datasets and
deep learning models. Additionally, we show that LBGM is a general

nonreciprocal hoppings within the nearest $r_d$ neighboring sites are the same.
For the purely off-diagonal model without onsite potentials, the energy
spectrum of the lattice under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) forms an
inseparable loop that intertwines with itself in the complex energy plane and
is characterized by winding numbers ranging from 1 up to $r_d$. The
corresponding spectrum under open boundary conditions (OBCs), which is real in
the nearest neighboring model, will ramify and take the shape of an
$(r_d+1)$-pointed star with all the branches connected at zero energy. If we
further introduce periodic onsite modulations, the spectrum will gradually
divide into multiple separable bands as we vary the parameters. Most
importantly, we find that a different kind of band gap called loop gap can
exist in the PBC spectrum, separating an inner loop from an outer one with each
composed by part of the spectrum. In addition, loop structures also exist in
the OBC spectra of systems with onsite potentials. We further study the
lattices with power-law decaying long-range nonreciprocal hopping and found
that the intertwined loops in the PBC spectrum will be untangled. Finally, we
propose an experimental scheme to realize the long-range nonreciprocal models

also present in the material. Structural instabilities that arise from the edge
stress could drive the relaxation process and dominate the morphological
response of edges in practice. A clear downward shift of the bands at the
narrower ribbons, as indicative of the edge effect, facilitates the separation
of photo-excited carriers (electrons move towards the edge and holes move
towards the interior part of the nanosheet). Moreover, the desorption energy of
the organic molecule can also be much lower at the free edges, making it easier
for functionalization and/or substitution events to take place. The findings

the other large, isolated, eigenvalues indicate collectivity in parts of the

collective motion of the system as a whole, the latter effects are much better

Access to the governing particle interaction law is fundamental for a complete

the particle interaction hidden in many cases. Machine learning methods have
the potential to learn the behavior of interacting particle systems by
combining experiments with data analysis methods. However, most existing
algorithms focus on learning the kinetics at the particle level. Learning
pairwise interaction, e.g., pairwise force or pairwise potential energy,
remains an open challenge. Here, we propose an algorithm that adapts the Graph
Networks framework, which contains an edge part to learn the pairwise
interaction and a node part to model the dynamics at particle level. Different
from existing approaches that use neural networks in both parts, we design a
deterministic operator in the node part that allows to precisely infer the
pairwise interactions that are consistent with underlying physical laws by only
being trained to predict the particle acceleration. We test the proposed
methodology on multiple datasets and demonstrate that it achieves superior
performance in inferring correctly the pairwise interactions while also being
consistent with the underlying physics on all the datasets. The proposed
framework is scalable to larger systems and transferable to any type of
particle interactions, contrary to the previously proposed purely data-driven
solutions. The developed methodology can support a better understanding and
discovery of the underlying particle interaction laws, and hence guide the

reactions and observe conformational changes, while providing information on
both structural and dynamical properties. This makes the accurate prediction of
infrared spectra based on first-principle theories a highly desirable pursuit.
Molecular dynamics simulations have proven to be a particularly powerful
approach for this task, albeit requiring the computation of energies, forces
and dipole moments for a large number of molecular configurations as a function
of time. This explains why highly accurate first principles methods, such as
coupled cluster theory, have so far been inapplicable for the prediction of
fully anharmonic vibrational spectra of large systems at finite temperatures.
Here, we push cutting-edge machine learning techniques forward by using neural
network representations of energies, forces and in particular dipoles to
predict such infrared spectra fully at ""gold standard"" coupled cluster accuracy
as demonstrated for protonated water clusters as large as the protonated water
hexamer, in its extended Zundel configuration. Furthermore, we show that this
methodology can be used beyond the scope of the data considered during the
development of the neural network models, allowing for the computation of
finite-temperature infrared spectra of large systems inaccessible to explicit
coupled cluster calculations. This substantially expands the hitherto existing
limits of accuracy, speed and system size for theoretical spectroscopy and
opens up a multitude of avenues for the prediction of vibrational spectra and
the understanding of complex intra- and intermolecular couplings.

$1$-parameter families of symplectic twist maps
$(f_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon\in \mathbb{R}}$, obtained by perturbing the
generating function of an analytic map $f$ by a family of potentials
$\{\varepsilon G\}_{\varepsilon\in \mathbb{R}}$. Firstly, for an analytic $G$

investigate the topological structure of the set of $\varepsilon\in \mathbb{R}$

  a Graph","21 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The principal ratio of a graph is the ratio of the greatest and least entry
of its principal eigenvector. Since the principal ratio compares the extreme
values of the principal eigenvector it is sensitive to outliers. This can be
problematic for graphs (networks) drawn from empirical data. To account for
this we consider the dispersion of the principal eigenvector (and degree
vector). More precisely, we consider the coefficient of variation of the
aforementioned vectors, that is, the ratio of the vector's standard deviation
and mean. We show how both of these statistics are bounded above by the same
function of the principal ratio. Further this bound is sharp for regular
graphs. The goal of this paper is to show that the coefficient of variation of
the principal eigenvector (and degree vector) can converge or diverge to the
principal ratio in the limit. In doing so we find an example of a graph family
(the complete split graph) whose principal ratio converges to the golden ratio.
We conclude with conjectures concerning extremal graphs of the aforementioned
statistics and interesting properties of the complete split graph.

complex multiscale fluids and then focus on the derivation and analysis of a
new hybrid continuum-kinetic model. In particular, we combine conservation of
mass and momentum for an isentropic macroscopic model with a kinetic
representation of the microscopic behaviour. After introducing a small scale of
interest, we compute the complex stress tensor by means of Irving-Kirkwood
formula. The latter requires an expansion of kinetic distribution around an
equilibrium state and a successive homogenization over the fast in time and
small in space scale dynamics. For a new hybrid continuum-kinetic model the
results of linear stability analysis indicates a conditional stability in the
relevant low-speed regimes and instability for high speed regimes for higher
modes. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed multiscale
model can reflect new phenomena of complex fluids not being present in standard
Newtonian fluids. Consequently, the proposed general technique can be
successfully used to derive new interesting systems combining the macro and

reconsidered in this paper. While the influence of unit size on such collective
measures was already demonstrated a decade ago, institutional ratings based on
this metric can still be found and still impact on the reputations and funding
of many research institutions. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the
fallacy of this approach to collective research-quality assessment in a simple
way, focusing on the h-index in its original form. We show that randomly
reshuffling real scientometric data (varying numbers of citations) amongst
institutions of varying size, while maintaining the volume of their research
outputs, has little effect on their departmental h-index. This suggests that
the relative position in ratings based on the collective h-index is determined
not only by quality (impact) of particular research outputs but by their
volume. Therefore, the application of the collective h-index in its original
form is disputable as a basement for comparison at aggregated levels such as to
research groups, institutions or journals. We suggest a possible remedy for
this failing which is implementable in a manner that is as simple and
understandable as the h-index itself.

detection of the hyperfine interaction (HFI) of Fe, Ti and Cu adatoms using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Previously, we systematically quantified
from first-principles the HFI for the whole series of 3d transition adatoms
(Sc-Cu) deposited on various ultra-thin insulators, establishing the trends of
the computed HFI with respect to the filling of the magnetic s- and d-orbitals
of the adatoms and on the bonding with the substrate. Here we explore the case
of dimers by investigating the correlation between the HFI and the magnetic
state of free standing Fe dimers, single Fe adatoms and dimers deposited on a
bilayer of MgO(001). We find that the magnitude of the HFI can be controlled by
switching the magnetic state of the dimers. For short Fe- Fe distances, the
antiferromagnetic state enhances the HFI with respect to that of the
ferromagnetic state. By increasing the distance between the magnetic atoms, a
transition towards the opposite behavior is observed. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the ability to substantially modify the HFI by atomic control of
the location of the adatoms on the substrate. Our results establish the limits

High-throughput
experimental data and Big Data promise to open new windows on complex systems

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning shows that we still have a poor
conceptual understanding of learning. These applications push statistical
inference into uncharted territories where data is high-dimensional and scarce,
and prior information on ""true"" models is scant if not totally absent. Here we
review recent progress on understanding learning, based on the notion of
""relevance"". The relevance, as we define it here, quantifies the amount of
information that a dataset or the internal representation of a learning machine
contains on the generative model of the data. This allows us to define
maximally informative samples, on one hand, and optimal learning machines on
the other. These are ideal limits of samples and of machines, that contain the
maximal amount of information about the unknown generative process, at a given
resolution (or level of compression). Both ideal limits exhibit critical
features in the statistical sense: Maximally informative samples are
characterised by a power-law frequency distribution (statistical criticality)
and optimal learning machines by an anomalously large susceptibility. The
trade-off between resolution (i.e. compression) and relevance distinguishes the
regime of noisy representations from that of lossy compression. These are
separated by a special point characterised by Zipf's law statistics. This
identifies samples obeying Zipf's law as the most compressed loss-less
representations that are optimal in the sense of maximal relevance. Criticality
in optimal learning machines manifests in an exponential degeneracy of energy
levels, that leads to unusual thermodynamic properties.

events could be affected in future observing runs due to increasing detector
sensitivity. This poses a problem since glitches can affect the estimation of
GW source parameters, including sky localisation, which is crucial to identify
an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. In this paper we present a study that
estimates how much sky localisation is affected by a nearby glitch in low
latency. We injected binary black hole (BBH), binary neutron star (BNS) and
neutron star-black hole (NSBH) signals into data containing three different
classes of glitches: blips, thunderstorms and fast scatterings. The impact of
these glitches was assessed by estimating the number of tile pointings that a
telescope would need to search over until the true sky location of an event is
observed. We found that blip glitches affect the localisation of BBH mergers
the most; in the most extreme cases a BBH event is completely missed even by a
20 deg$^2$ field-of-view (FOV) telescope. Thunderstorm glitches have the
biggest impact on BBH and NSBH events, especially if there is no third
interferometer, while BNS events appear to be not affected. Fast scattering
glitches impact low latency localisation only for NSBH signals. For
two-interferometer network small (FOV=1 deg$^2$) and large (FOV=20 deg$^2$)
telescopes are affected, whereas three-interferometer localisation bias is
small enough not to affect large (FOV=20 deg$^2$) telescopes.

revealing entanglement breakdown using a machine learning technique, which is
known as 'learning by confusion'. We consider a family of quantum states, which
is parameterized such that there is a single critical value dividing states
within this family into separate and entangled. We demonstrate the 'learning by

study the performance of the method for the two-qubit, two-qutrit, and
two-ququart entangled state. In addition, we investigate the properties of the
local depolarization and the generalized amplitude damping channel in the
framework of the confusion scheme. Within our approach and setting the
parameterization of special trajectories, we obtain an entanglement-breakdown
'phase diagram' of a quantum channel, which indicates regions of entangled
(separable) states and the entanglement-breakdown region. Then we extend the
way of using the 'learning by confusion' scheme for recognizing whether an
arbitrary given state is entangled or separable. We show that the developed

(PWAs), a few research studies have recently proposed incorporating a bi-stable

numerical simulations to demonstrate the improved bandwidth of the bi-stable

restoring force influences the effective bandwidth of the absorber. To this
end, we use perturbation methods to obtain an approximate analytical solution
of the nonlinear differential equations governing the complex motion of the
absorber under harmonic wave excitations. The approximate solution is validated
against a numerical solution obtained via direct integration of the equations
of motion. Using a local stability analysis of the equations governing the slow
modulation of the amplitude and phase of the response, the loci of the
different bifurcation points are determined as function of the wave frequency
and amplitude. Those bifurcation points are then used to define an effective
bandwidth of the absorber. The influence of the shape of the restoring force on
the effective bandwidth is also characterized by generating design maps that
can be used to predict the kind of response behavior (small amplitude periodic,
large amplitude periodic, or aperiodic) for any given combination of wave
amplitude and frequency. Such maps are critical towards designing efficient
bi-stable PWAs for known wave conditions.

much higher extinction than the outer shell, implying the presence of large
amounts of dust. The spatial distribution of the emission from the ejecta and
the locus of key line ratios in diagnostic diagrams probe the shock excitation

$2\Omega$ at all wavelengths, where $\Omega$ is the angular frequency of the

connection of a such submanifold defines a tractor connection and then, in this

standard for the induced metric. Finally, the normality condition for this

in terms of a strong relationship between the intrinsic and the extrinsic

complex commonly known as a Coronal Bright Point (CBP). The event is uniquely
recorded in both the imaging and spectroscopic data taken with IRIS. We analyse
IRIS spectroscopic and slit-jaw imaging observations as well as images taken in
the extreme-ultraviolet channels of AIA, and line-of-sight magnetic-field data
from HMI onboard the SDO. We also employ an NLFFF relaxation approach based on
the HMI magnetogram time series. We identify a strong small-scale brightening
as a micro-flare in a CBP. The mini-eruption manifests with the ejection of hot
(CBP loops) and cool (mini-filament) plasma recorded in both the imaging and
spectroscopic data. The micro-flare is preceded by the appearance of an
elongated bright feature in the IRIS slit-jaw 1400 A images located above the
polarity inversion line. The micro-flare starts with an IRIS pixel size
brightening and propagates bi-directionally along the elongated feature. We
detect in both the spectral and imaging IRIS data and AIA data, strong flows
along and at the edges of the elongated feature which we believe represent
reconnection outflows. Both edges of the elongated feature that wrap around the
edges of the erupting MF evolve into a J-type shape creating a sigmoid
appearance. A quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) is identified in the vicinity of the
polarity inversion line by computing the squashing factor Q in different
horizontal planes of the NLFFF model. The QSL reconnection site has the same
spectral appearance as the so-called explosive events identified by strong

would miss contributions from the $\theta$ term due to the differential nature
of the formulation. We first review this quantum mechanical system on $S^1$
that is solvable with both the path integral and the canonical quantization. We
discuss how to construct the quantum effective action including the $\theta$
dependence. Such an explicit calculation poses a subtle question of whether a
Legendre transform is well defined or not for general systems with the sign
problem. We then consider a deformed theory to relax the integral winding by
introducing a wine-bottle potential with the finite depth $\propto g$, so that
the original $S^1$ theory is recovered in the $g\to\infty$ limit. We
numerically solve the energy spectrum in the deformed theory as a function of
$g$ and $\theta$ in the canonical quantization. We test the efficacy of the
simplest local potential approximation (LPA) in the fRG approach and find that
the correct behavior of the ground state energy is well reproduced for small
$\theta$. When the energy level crossing is approached, the LPA flow breaks
down and fails in describing the ground state degeneracy expected from the 't
Hooft anomaly. We finally turn back to the original theory and discuss an
alternative formulation using the Villain lattice action. The analysis with the
Villain lattice at $\theta=\pi$ indicates that the nonlocality of the effective

methods are employed to reconstruct the images; multi-frequency synthesis (MFS)
and the fiducial image-oriented method, where each band is imaged separately
and the frequency dependence is fitted pixel by pixel. We find that the MFS
imaging with the second order of Taylor expansion can reproduce the frequency
dependence of the continuum emission between Bands 3 and 7 in a manner
consistent with previous studies and is a reasonable method to reconstruct the

consistent with the MFS imaging, but with a two times lower resolution. Mock
observations of an intensity model were conducted to validate the images from
the two methods. We find that the MFS imaging provides a high-resolution

particular for visual recognition tasks. However, there are still open problems
among which is the capacity to handle streams of visual information and the
management of class imbalance in datasets. Existing research approaches these
two problems separately while they co-occur in real world applications. Here,
we study the problem of learning incrementally from imbalanced datasets. We
focus on algorithms which have a constant deep model complexity and use a
bounded memory to store exemplars of old classes across incremental states.
Since memory is bounded, old classes are learned with fewer images than new
classes and an imbalance due to incremental learning is added to the initial
dataset imbalance. A score prediction bias in favor of new classes appears and
we evaluate a comprehensive set of score calibration methods to reduce it.
Evaluation is carried with three datasets, using two dataset imbalance
configurations and three bounded memory sizes. Results show that most
calibration methods have beneficial effect and that they are most useful for
lower bounded memory sizes, which are most interesting in practice. As a
secondary contribution, we remove the usual distillation component from the
loss function of incremental learning algorithms. We show that simpler vanilla
fine tuning is a stronger backbone for imbalanced incremental learning
algorithms.

maintaining precision in estimating tilt angle. The method is developed to
explore a pendulum as an inertial measurement sensor and estimates tilt angle
based on dynamics of pendulum and parameter estimation models. Further,

Meanwhile, systolic array has been increasingly competitive on CNNs
acceleration for its high spatiotemporal locality and low hardware overhead.
However, the irregularity of sparsity induces imbalanced workload under the
rigid systolic dataflow, causing performance degradation. Thus, this paper
proposed a systolicarray-based architecture, called Sense, for sparse CNN
acceleration by model-hardware co-design, achieving large performance
improvement. To balance input feature map(IFM) and weight loads across
Processing Element(PE) array, we applied channel clustering to gather IFMs with
approximate sparsity for array computation, and co-designed a load-balancing
weight pruning method to keep the sparsity ratio of each kernel at a certain
value with little accuracy loss, improving PE utilization and overall
performance. Additionally, Adaptive Dataflow Configuration is applied to
determine the computing strategy based on the storage ratio of IFMs and
weights, lowering 1.17x-1.8x DRAM access compared with Swallow and further
reducing system energy consumption. The whole design is implemented on

two training schemes for active learning: (1) the one commonly deployed in deep
active learning using model fine tuning for each iteration and (2) a scheme
which is inspired by transfer learning and exploits generic pre-trained models
and train shallow classifiers for each iteration. Evaluation is run with three
imbalanced datasets. Results show that the proposed active learning method
outperforms competitive baselines. Equally interesting, they also indicate that
the transfer learning training scheme outperforms model fine tuning if features

have access to independent samples from the distribution of data they encounter
at test time. As such, these methods often perform poorly in the face of biased
data, which breaks this assumption. In particular, machine learning models have
been shown to exhibit Clever-Hans-like behaviour, meaning that spurious
correlations in the training set are inadvertently learnt. A number of works
have been proposed to revise deep classifiers to learn the right correlations.
However, generative models have been overlooked so far. We observe that
generative models are also prone to Clever-Hans-like behaviour. To counteract
this issue, we propose to debias generative models by disentangling their
internal representations, which is achieved via human feedback. Our experiments
show that this is effective at removing bias even when human feedback covers

Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes
error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art

In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free.
Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the
Bayes error than several baselines empirically. Experiments using our method
suggest that recently proposed deep networks such as the Vision Transformer may

has not only enabled new applications, but also presented new challenges for
reliable communication with limited resources. In this work, we define a
deceptively simple novel problem that can arise in these scenarios, in which a
set of sensors need to communicate a joint observation. This observation is
shared by a random subset of the nodes, which need to propagate it to the rest
of the network, but coordination is complex: as signaling constraints require
the use of random access schemes over shared channels, each sensor needs to
implicitly coordinate with others with the same observation, so that at least
one of the transmissions gets through without collisions. Unlike existing
medium access control schemes, the goal here is not to maximize total goodput,
but rather to make sure that the shared message gets through, regardless of the
sender. The lack of any signaling, aside from an acknowledgment or lack thereof
from the rest of the network, makes determining the optimal collective
transmission strategy a significant challenge. We analyze this coordination
problem theoretically, prove its hardness, and provide low-complexity
solutions. While a low-complexity clustering-based approach is shown to provide
near-optimal performance in certain special cases, for the general scenarios,
we model each sensor as a multi-armed bandit (MAB), and provide a

in particular for flying and terrestrial robots where the precise estimation of
the position requires motion capture devices (MoCap) or Lidar. In order to
simplify the use of a robotic platform dedicated to research on a wide range of

The method and tool allow a rapid, visual and quantitative evaluation of the
quality of ego-pose sensors and are sensitive to different sources of flaws in
the acquisition chain, ranging from desynchronization of the sensor flows to
misevaluation of the geometric parameters of the robotic platform. Using
computer vision, the information from the sensors is used to calculate the
motion of a semantic scene point through its projection to the 2D image space
of the on-board camera. The deviations of these keypoints from references
created with a semi-automatic tool allow rapid and simple quality assessment of

thin-film plastic and aluminium targets irradiated by a high-intensity pump

relative to the pump pulse, it is possible to follow the evolution of the
plasma as it disintegrates. The high-frequency end of the dispersion provides
information on the line-integrated electron density, whereas lower frequencies
are more affected by the highest density encountered along the path of the

study the evolution of the plasma surface.

following game played by two players, Waiter and Client, on the edges of $K_n$.
Starting with all the edges marked as unclaimed, in each round, Waiter picks
two yet unclaimed edges. Client then chooses one of these edges to be added to
Client's graph, while the other edge is added to Waiter's graph. Waiter wins if
she eventually forces Client to create a $K_k$-factor in Client's graph. If she
does not manage to do that, Client wins.
  For fixed $k$ and large enough $n$, it can be easily shown that Waiter wins
if she plays optimally (in particular, this is an immediate consequence of our
result that for such $n$, Waiter can win quite fast). The question posed by
Clemens et al. is how long the game will last if Waiter aims to win as fast as
she can, Client tries to delay her as much as he can, and they both play
optimally. We denote this optimal number of rounds by
$\tau_{WC}(\mathcal{F}_{n,K_k-\text{fac}},1 ) $. In the present paper, we
obtain the first non-trivial lower bound on this quantity for large $k$.
Together with a simple upper bound following the strategy of Clemens et al.,
this gives $2^{k/3-o(k)}n \leq \tau_{WC}(\mathcal{F}_{n,K_k-\text{fac}},1 )
\leq 2^k\frac{n}{k}+C(k)$, where $C(k)$ is a constant dependent only on $k$ and
the $o(k)$ term is independent of $n$ as well.

closely from a theoretical point of view. Then, a physics-driven kinematical
method was introduced to produce an improved model for dominance space in
soccer. Remaining faithful to the deterministic approach, we extend the
original work by the introduction of (a) an asymmetric influence of the players
in their surrounding area, (b) the frictional forces to the players' motion,
and (c) the simultaneous combination of both effects. The asymmetric influence
is fairly intuitive; players have more control in the direction they are
running than any other direction. The sharper the turn they must make to reach
a point on the pitch, the weaker their control of that point will be. From
simple kinematical laws, this effect can be quantified explicitly. For the
frictional force, a portion comes from air resistance, and so will be
proportional to the square of the player's speed, as is well known from fluid
dynamics. There are no other external frictional forces, but, at the suggestion
of biokinematics, there is an internal frictional force, relating to the
consumption of energy by the muscles, which is proportional to the player's
speed.
  Although these additions are intuitively understood, mathematically they
introduce many analytical complexities. We establish exact analytical solutions
of the dominance areas of the pitch by introducing a few reasonable simplifying
assumptions. Given these solutions the new Voronoi diagrams are drawn for the
publicly available data by Metrica Sports. In general, it is not necessary
anymore for the dominance regions to be convex, they might contain holes, and
may be disconnected. The fastest player may dominate points far away from the
rest of the players.

the message of each node into a self-embedding part for discrimination and a
memory part for propagation. Furthermore, we develop a control mechanism and a
decoupling regularization to control the ratio of absorbing and excluding the
message in the memory for each node. More importantly, our MMP is a general
skill that can work as an additional layer to help improve traditional GNNs
performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets with different homophily
ratios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

A recent method -- the Parametric Neural Network (pNN) -- leverages multiple
signal mass hypotheses as an additional input feature to effectively replace a
whole set of individual classifiers, each providing (in principle) the best
response for the corresponding mass hypothesis. In this work we aim at
deepening the understanding of pNNs in light of real-world usage. We discovered
several peculiarities of parametric networks, providing intuition, metrics, and
guidelines to them. We further propose an alternative parametrization scheme,
resulting in a new parametrized neural network architecture: the AffinePNN;
along with many other generally applicable improvements, like the balanced
training procedure. Finally, we extensively and empirically evaluate our models
on the HEPMASS dataset, along its imbalanced version (called HEPMASS-IMB) we
provide here for the first time, to further validate our approach. Provided
results are in terms of the impact of the proposed design decisions,

hydrocarbons (e.g. CH, C$_2$H, (l- and c-)C$_3$H$_2$, and C$_4$H) in abundances
that may be difficult to understand on the basis of conventional gas-phase
chemical models. Recent experimental results revealed that the
photo-decomposition mechanism of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC) and of
solid hexane releases a range of hydrocarbons into the gas, containing up to 6
C-atoms for the case of HAC decomposition. These findings motivated us to
introduce a new potential input to interstellar chemistry; the ""top-down"" or
degradation scheme, as opposed to the conventional ""build-up"" or synthesis
scheme. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the top-down approach
in diffuse clouds using gas-grain chemical models. In order to examine this
scheme, we derived an expression to account for the formation of hydrocarbons
when HACs are photo-decomposed after their injection from grain mantles. Then,
we calculated the actual formation rate of these species by knowing their
injected fraction (from experimental work) and the average rate of mantle
carbon injection into the ISM (from observations). Our preliminary results are
promising and reveal that the degradation scheme can be considered as an
efficient mechanism for the formation of some simple hydrocarbons in diffuse
clouds. However, an actual proof of the efficiency of this process and its rate
constants would require comprehensive experimental determination.

of predicting such emergent properties after they are fitted to simulation data
in an after-the-fact way. Thus, these predictions are macro-to-macro only.
However, a micro-to-macro model significantly fails to predict correctly, as
does the obvious mesoscopic modeling approach. This suggests that some
macroscopic system properties in a complex dynamic system should be interpreted
as examples of phenomena (properties) arising from ""strong emergence"", due to
the lack of ability to build a consistent micro-to-macro model, that could
explain these phenomena in a before-the-fact way. The root cause for this

formation process, a phenomenon that is usually classified as being of ""weak

vision, benefited from the progress in deep neural networks, resulting in
significantly improved performance. However, deep architectures trained with
gradient-based techniques suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which is the
tendency to forget previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks.
Aiming at devising strategies to counteract this effect, incremental learning
approaches have gained popularity over the past years. However, the first
incremental learning methods for semantic segmentation appeared only recently.
While effective, these approaches do not account for a crucial aspect in
pixel-level dense prediction problems, i.e. the role of attention mechanisms.
To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel attentive feature
distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while accounting for
semantic spatial- and channel-level dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a
{continual attentive fusion} structure, which takes advantage of the attention
learned from the new and the old tasks while learning features for the new
task. Finally, we also introduce a novel strategy to account for the background

demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on

algorithm that leverages the CNN capabilities provided with additional
information about the governing equations of the physical problem. Great
progress has been made in recent years towards reconstructing and
characterizing the spatial distribution of physical variables of interest using
CNNs. In principle, CNNs can represent any continuous mathematical function
with a relatively reduced number of parameters. However, depending on the
complexity imposed by the physical problem, this technique becomes unfeasible.
The present study employs a Physics Informed Neuron Network technique featuring
a data-efficient function approximator. As a proof of concept, the CNN is
trained to retrieve the temperature of a heated channel based on a limited
number of sensors placed at the boundaries of the domain. In this context, the
training data are the temperature fields solutions considering various flows
conditions at steady state, e.g varying the Reynolds and the Prandtl numbers.
Additionally, a demonstration case considering the more complex geometry of a
MSR is also provided.
  Assessment on the performance of the CNN is done by the mean L2 and the
maximum Linf Euclidean norms stemmed from the difference between the actual
solutions and the predictions made by the CNN. Finally, a sensitivity analysis
is carried out such that the robustness of the CNN is tested considering a
potential real application scenario where noise is inevitable. For that, the
original test inputs are overlaid with a normal distribution of random numbers
targeting to mimic different levels of noise in the measurement points.

magnetic field that splits it into two radial zones. In the inner Jet Emitting
Disk (JED), a near equipartition field allows to drive powerful self-collimated
jets, while beyond a transition radius, the disk magnetization is too low and a
Standard Accretion Disk (SAD) is settled. In a series of papers, this hybrid
JED-SAD disk configuration has been shown to successfully reproduce most
multi-wavelength (radio and X-rays) observations, as well as the concurrence
with the LFQPOs for the archetypal source GX 339-4. We first analyze the main
QPO scenarios provided in the literature: 1) a specific process occurring at
the transition radius, 2) the accretion-ejection instability and 3) the
solid-body Lense-Thirring disk precession. We recall their main assumptions and
shed light on some severe theoretical issues that question the capability to
reproduce LF QPOs. We then argue that none of these models could be operating
under the JED-SAD physical conditions. We finally propose an alternative
scenario where LF QPOs would be the disk response to an instability triggered
in the jets, near a magnetic recollimation zone. Such a situation could account
for most Type-C QPO phenomenology and is consistent with the global behavior of
black hole binaries. The calculation of this non-destructive jet instability
remains however to be done. If the existence of this instability is numerically
confirmed, then it could also naturally account for the jet wobbling
phenomenology seen in various accreting sources.

expressions. Therefore accurate AU recognition unlocks unbiaised face
representation which can improve face-based affective computing applications.
From a learning standpoint AU detection is a multi-task problem with strong
inter-task dependencies. To solve such problem, most approaches either rely on
weight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the joint
task distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields
comprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an
arbitrary order into an unordered task set. Crucially, this ordering choice has
been identified as a source of performance variations. In this paper, we
present Multi-Order Network (MONET), a multi-task method with joint task order
optimization. MONET uses a differentiable order selection to jointly learn
task-wise modules with their optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce
warmup and order dropout to enhance order selection by encouraging order
exploration. Experimentally, we first demonstrate MONET capacity to retrieve
the optimal order in a toy environment. Second, we validate MONET architecture
by showing that MONET outperforms existing multi-task baselines on multiple
attribute detection problems chosen for their wide range of dependency
settings. More importantly, we demonstrate that MONET significantly extends
state-of-the-art performance in AU detection.

Most existing methods are in the form of scene-level prediction, without
returning the object classes of different keypoints. In this paper, we propose
the object-centric formulation, which, beyond the conventional setting,
requires further identifying which object each interest point belongs to. With
such fine-grained information, our framework enables more downstream
potentials, such as object-level matching and pose estimation in a clustered
environment. To get around the difficulty of label collection in the real
world, we develop a sim2real contrastive learning mechanism that can generalize
the model trained in simulation to real-world applications. The novelties of
our training method are three-fold: (i) we integrate the uncertainty into the
learning framework to improve feature description of hard cases, e.g.,
less-textured or symmetric patches; (ii) we decouple the object descriptor into
two output branches -- intra-object salience and inter-object distinctness,
resulting in a better pixel-wise description; (iii) we enforce cross-view
semantic consistency for enhanced robustness in representation learning.
Comprehensive experiments on image matching and 6D pose estimation verify the
encouraging generalization ability of our method from simulation to reality.
Particularly for 6D pose estimation, our method significantly outperforms
typical unsupervised/sim2real methods, achieving a closer gap with the fully
supervised counterpart. Additional results and videos can be found at

However, recent advances discovered that different evaluation strategies

analysis of evaluation strategies based on pixel perturbations. Our findings
reveal that the results are strongly affected by information leakage through
the shape of the removed pixels as opposed to their actual values. Using our
theoretical insights, we propose a novel evaluation framework termed Remove and
Debias (ROAD) which offers two contributions: First, it mitigates the impact of
the confounders, which entails higher consistency among evaluation strategies.
Second, ROAD does not require the computationally expensive retraining step and

well-received in the era of big data. However, singular value decomposition
(SVD) is only for order-two data, i.e., matrices. It is necessary to flatten a
higher order input into a matrix or break it into a series of order-two slices
to tackle higher order data such as multispectral images and videos with the
SVD. Higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) extends the SVD and can
approximate higher order data using sums of a few rank-one components. We
consider the problem of generalizing HOSVD over a finite dimensional
commutative algebra. This algebra, referred to as a t-algebra, generalizes the
field of complex numbers. The elements of the algebra, called t-scalars, are
fix-sized arrays of complex numbers. One can generalize matrices and tensors
over t-scalars and then extend many canonical matrix and tensor algorithms,
including HOSVD, to obtain higher-performance versions. The generalization of
HOSVD is called THOSVD. Its performance of approximating multi-way data can be
further improved by an alternating algorithm. THOSVD also unifies a wide range
of principal component analysis algorithms. To exploit the potential of
generalized algorithms using t-scalars for approximating images, we use a pixel
neighborhood strategy to convert each pixel to ""deeper-order"" t-scalar.
Experiments on publicly available images show that the generalized algorithm
over t-scalars, namely THOSVD, compares favorably with its canonical
counterparts.

which several semantically relevant image clusters can be further integrated
into a larger cluster with coarser-grained semantics. Capturing such structures
with image representations can greatly benefit the semantic understanding on
various downstream tasks. Existing contrastive representation learning methods
lack such an important model capability. In addition, the negative pairs used
in these methods are not guaranteed to be semantically distinct, which could
further hamper the structural correctness of learned image representations. To
tackle these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework
called Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding (HCSC). In this framework, a
set of hierarchical prototypes are constructed and also dynamically updated to
represent the hierarchical semantic structures underlying the data in the
latent space. To make image representations better fit such semantic

prototypical contrastive learning via an elaborate pair selection scheme. This
scheme seeks to select more diverse positive pairs with similar semantics and
more precise negative pairs with truly distinct semantics. On extensive

are shown to hold the key for understanding how to develop a first-principles
theory of lateral stirring and lateral stirring surfaces in the oceans embedded
in the study of the full Navier-Stokes equations for compressible seawater.
This theory establishes that it is the existence of thermobaric forces acting
along isopycnal surfaces that makes stirring in seawater fundamentally
different from that in a simple fluid and is the ultimate cause for the
non-existence of neutral surfaces. It also establishes that the `true' neutral
directions are those perpendicular to an APE-based form of the P vector
previously identified by Nycander, contrary to what has been assumed so far.
Where thermobaric forces are small enough to be neglected, our theory
establishes that the Lorenz reference density (LRD) surfaces entering APE
theory are very accurately neutral and represent the relevant definition of
lateral stirring surfaces. Where thermobaric forces are large, however, lateral
stirring becomes strongly coupled with vertical stirring and complicates the
identification of the `right' lateral mixing surfaces. Importantly, rewriting
the momentum balance equations in their thermodynamic form using
Crocco-Vazsonyi theorem and removing the dynamically inert part of the
Bernoulli function proves decisive for obtaining most results. The new results
have important implications for the theory of isopycnal analysis and ocean
mixing parameterisations.

using networks derived by country-level co-occurrences of product pairs, that
is counting how many countries export both. In this work, we compare networks
and machine learning algorithms trained not only on country-level data, but
also on firms, that is something not much studied due to the low availability
of firm-level data. We quantitatively compare the different measures of
relatedness, by using them to forecast the exports at the country and
firm-level, assuming that more related products have a higher likelihood to be
exported in the future. Our results show that relatedness is scale-dependent:
the best assessments are obtained by using machine learning on the same
typology of data one wants to predict. Moreover, we found that while
relatedness measures based on country data are not suitable for firms,
firm-level data are very informative also for the development of countries. In
this sense, models built on firm data provide a better assessment of
relatedness. We also discuss the effect of using parameter optimization and
community detection algorithms to identify clusters of related companies and
products, finding that a partition into a higher number of blocks decreases the
computational time while maintaining a prediction performance well above the

turbulence develops a `thermal equilibrium' spectrum, $\mathcal{E}(k) \propto
k^2$, at large scales. This behaviour presents a puzzle, as it appears to imply
the growth of a non-zero Saffman integral, which would require the longitudinal
velocity correlation function, $\chi(r)$, to satisfy $\chi(r\to \infty)\propto
r^{-3}$. As is well known, the Saffman integral is an invariant of decaying
turbulence, precisely because non-local interactions (i.e., interactions via
exchange of pressure waves) are too weak to generate such correlations. Subject
to certain restrictions on the nature of the forcing, we argue that the same
should be true for forced turbulence. We show that long-range correlations and
a $k^2$ spectrum arise as a result of the turbulent diffusion of linear
momentum, and extend only up to a maximum scale that grows slowly with time.
This picture has a number of interesting consequences. First, if the forcing
generates eddies with significant linear momentum (as in so-called Saffman
turbulence), a thermal spectrum is not reached - instead, a shallower spectrum
develops. Secondly, the energy of turbulence that is forced for a while and
then allowed to decay obeys Saffman's decay laws for a period that is much
longer than the duration of the forcing stage.

analysis of black hole candidate MAXI J1803-298 using an AstroSat observation
on May 11-12, 2021. Four periodic absorption dips with a periodicity of $7.02
\pm 0.18$ hour are detected in the light curve. AstroSat observe the source
when it was undergoing a transition from hard-intermediate state to
soft-intermediate state. Our timing analysis reveals the presence of a sharp
type-C quasi periodic oscillation (QPO) in the power density spectra (PDS) with
an evolving QPO frequency ranging from $5.31 \pm 0.02$ Hz to $7.61\pm 0.09$ Hz.
We investigate the energy dependence of the QPO and do not find this feature in
the PDS above 30 keV. The combined $0.7-80$ keV SXT and LAXPC spectra are
fitted with a model consisting of thermal multi-colour blackbody emission and
Comptonized emission components. We perform time-resolved spectroscopy by
extracting spectra during the dip and non-dip phases of the observation. A
neutral absorber is detected during the dip and non-dip phases though a
signature of an ionized absorber is also present in the dip phases. The
spectral and temporal parameters are found to evolve during our observation. We
estimate the mass function of the system as $f(M) = 2.1-7.2~M_{\odot}$ and the
mass of the black hole candidate in the range of $M_{\rm BH} \sim
3.5-12.5~M_{\odot}$.

been subject of intense discussions for many years. In iron-based
superconductors, the most established probe for electronic-nematic
fluctuations, i.e. the elastoresistivity seems to imply that superconductivity
is reinforced by electronic-nematic fluctuations, since the elastoresistivity
amplitude peaks at or close to optimal $T_C$. However, on the over-doped side
of the superconducting dome, the diminishing elastoresistivity suggests a
negligible importance in the mechanism of superconductivity. Here we introduce
the Nernst coefficient as a genuine probe for electronic nematic fluctuations,
and we show that the amplitude of the Nernst coefficient tracks the
superconducting dome of two prototype families of iron-based superconductors,
namely Rh-doped $BaFe_{2}As_{2}$ and Co-doped $LaFeAsO$. Our data thus provide
fresh evidence that in these systems nematic fluctuations foster the
superconductivity throughout the phase diagram.

and is foundational to automating natural language tasks. For example, if word
embeddings of similar words contain similar values, word similarity can be
readily assessed, whereas judging that from their spelling is often impossible
(e.g. cat /feline) and to predetermine and store similarities between all words
is prohibitively time-consuming, memory intensive and subjective. We focus on
word embeddings learned from text corpora and knowledge graphs. Several
well-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis
by learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec
and GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word
co-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been
unclear. Knowledge graph representation models learn representations both of
entities (words, people, places, etc.) and relations between them, typically by
training a model to predict known facts in a supervised manner. Despite steady
improvements in fact prediction accuracy, little is understood of the latent
structure that enables this.
  The limited understanding of how latent semantic structure is encoded in the
geometry of word embeddings and knowledge graph representations makes a
principled means of improving their performance, reliability or
interpretability unclear. To address this:
  1. we theoretically justify the empirical observation that particular
geometric relationships between word embeddings learned by algorithms such as
word2vec and GloVe correspond to semantic relations between words; and
  2. we extend this correspondence between semantics and geometry to the
entities and relations of knowledge graphs, providing a model for the latent
structure of knowledge graph representation linked to that of word embeddings.

$N_u$. Our experimental setup is realized with a hBN encapsulated graphite

eventually takes the value of equilibrated regime $|N_d - N_u|\kappa_{0}T$. By
contrast, at $\nu = $1/3 and 2/5 (without CP modes), $G_Q$ remains robustly
quantized at $N_d\kappa_{0}T$ independent of the temperature. Thus, measuring

partitions the data by minimizing a graph-cut loss. Since it minimizes the
across-cluster similarity, there is no need to model the distribution within
each cluster. As a result, one reduces the chance of model misspecification,
which is often a risk in mixture model-based clustering. Nevertheless, compared
to the latter, spectral clustering has no direct ways of quantifying the
clustering uncertainty (such as the assignment probability), or allowing easy
model extensions for complicated data applications. To fill this gap, we
propose the Bayesian forest model as a generative graphical model for spectral
clustering. This is motivated by our discovery that the posterior connecting
matrix in a forest model has almost the same leading eigenvectors, as the ones
used by normalized spectral clustering. To induce a distribution for the
forest, we develop a ``forest process'' as a graph extension to the urn
process, while we carefully characterize the differences in the partition
probability. We derive a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for
posterior estimation, and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing

  We develop a novel system, called Verify-Pro, to provide server
authentication using communication protocol dialects, that uses a client-server
architecture based on network protocols for customizing the communication
transactions. For each session, a particular sequence of handshakes will be
used as dialects. So, given the context, with the establishment of a one-time
username and password, we use the dialects as an authentication mechanism for
each request (e.g get filename in FTP) throughout the session, which enforces
continuous authentication. Specifically, we leverage a machine learning
approach on both client and server machines to trigger a specific dialect that
dynamically changes for each request.
  We implement a prototype of Verify-Pro and evaluate its practicality on
standard communication protocols FTP, HTTP & internet of things protocol MQTT.
Our experimental results show that by sending misleading information through
message packets from an attacker at the application layer, it is possible for
the recipient to identify if the sender is genuine or a spoofed one, with a
negligible overhead of 0.536%.

Mm in the solar atmosphere, which create the initial transverse velocity
perturbations. These pulses transfer energy non-linearly to the field aligned
perturbations due to the ponderomotive force. This physical process further
creates the magnetoacoustic shocks followed by quasi-periodic plasma motions in
the solar atmosphere. The field aligned magnetoacoustic shocks move upward
which subsequently cause quasi-periodic rise and fall of the chromospheric
plasma into the overlying corona as a thin and cool spicule-like jets. The
magnitude of the initial applied transverse velocity pulses are taken in the
range of 50-90 km $s^{-1}$. These pulses are found to be strong enough to
generate the spicule-like jets. We analyze the evolution, kinematics and
energetics of these spicule-like jets. We find that the transported mass flux

Meta-regression as well as model-based meta-analysis are extensions of standard
pairwise meta-analysis in which information about study-level covariates and

approach to inference is very attractive in this context, especially when a
meta-analysis is based on few studies only or rare events. In this article, we
present the R package MetaStan which implements a wide range of pairwise and
model-based meta-analysis models.
  A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework is used to describe the
pairwise meta-analysis, meta-regression and model-based meta-analysis models.
Within the GLMM framework, the likelihood and link functions are adapted to
reflect the nature of the data. For example, a binomial likelihood with a logit
link is used to perform a meta-analysis based on datasets with dichotomous
endpoints. Bayesian computations are conducted using Stan via the rstan
interface. Stan uses a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler which belongs to the
family of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Stan implementations are done by
using suitable parametrizations to ease computations.
  The user-friendly R package MetaStan, available on CRAN, supports a wide
range of pairwise and model-based meta-analysis models. MetaStan provides
fitting functions for pairwise meta-analysis with the option of including
covariates and model-based meta-analysis. The supported outcome types are
continuous, binary, and count. Forest plots for the pairwise meta-analysis and
dose-response plots for the model-based meta-analysis can be obtained from the
package. The use of MetaStan is demonstrated through clinical examples.

labels/attributes of users (e.g., political affiliation) given the connectivity
between users (represented by adjacency matrix of a graph). There has been
significant recent progress on understanding the fundamental limits of
community detection when the graph is generated from a stochastic block model
(SBM). Specifically, sharp information theoretic limits and efficient
algorithms have been obtained for SBMs as a function of $p$ and $q$, which
represent the intra-community and inter-community connection probabilities. In
this paper, we study the community detection problem while preserving the
privacy of the individual connections (edges) between the vertices. Focusing on
the notion of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-edge differential privacy (DP), we seek to
understand the fundamental tradeoffs between $(p, q)$, DP budget $(\epsilon,
\delta)$, and computational efficiency for exact recovery of the community
labels.
  To this end, we present and analyze the associated information-theoretic
tradeoffs for three broad classes of differentially private community recovery
mechanisms: a) stability based mechanism; b) sampling based mechanisms; and c)
graph perturbation mechanisms. Our main findings are that stability and
sampling based mechanisms lead to a superior tradeoff between $(p,q)$ and the
privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$; however this comes at the expense of
higher computational complexity. On the other hand, albeit low complexity,
graph perturbation mechanisms require the privacy budget $\epsilon$ to scale as
$\Omega(\log(n))$ for exact recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to study the impact of privacy constraints on the fundamental limits
for community detection.

medical image analysis, which aims to find a unique transformation while
preserving the topology and invertibility of the transformation. Deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded well-suited approaches for
image registration by learning the transformation priors from a large dataset.
The improvement in the performance of these methods is related to their ability
to learn information from several sample medical images that are difficult to
obtain and bias the framework to the specific domain of data. In this paper, we
propose a novel diffeomorphic training-free approach; this is built upon the
principle of an ordinary differential equation.
  Our formulation yields an Euler integration type recursive scheme to estimate
the changes of spatial transformations between the fixed and the moving image
pyramids at different resolutions. The proposed architecture is simple in
design. The moving image is warped successively at each resolution and finally
aligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that at each
resolution, a fully convolutional network (FCN) models a progressive change of
deformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and
optimized for each pair of images from scratch. In comparison to learning-based
methods, the proposed method neither requires a dedicated training set nor
suffers from any training bias. We evaluate our method on three cardiac image
datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art registration accuracy while maintaining desirable
diffeomorphic properties.

a one-to-one correspondence between the source and target images (i.e.,

with this issue, the Metamorphosis model has been proposed. It modifies both
the shape and the appearance of an image to deal with the geometrical and
topological differences. However, the high computational time and load have
hampered its applications so far. Here, we propose a deep residual learning
implementation of Metamorphosis that drastically reduces the computational time

integrate prior knowledge of the localization of topological changes (e.g.,
segmentation masks) that can act as spatial regularization to correctly

for solving the satisfiability problem of propositional logic. Instead of a
simple depth-first backtracking approach, this kind of solver learns the reason
behind occurring conflicts in the form of additional clauses. However, despite
the enormous success of CDCL solvers, there is still only a limited
understanding of what influences the performance of these solvers in what way.
  Considering different measures, this paper demonstrates, quite surprisingly,
that clause learning (without being able to get rid of some clauses) can not
only help the solver but can oftentimes deteriorate the solution process
dramatically. By conducting extensive empirical analysis, we furthermore find
that the runtime distributions of CDCL solvers are multimodal. This
multimodality can be seen as a reason for the deterioration phenomenon
described above. Simultaneously, it also gives an indication of why clause
learning in combination with clause deletion is virtually the de facto standard
of SAT solving, in spite of this phenomenon. As a final contribution, we show
that Weibull mixture distributions can accurately describe the multimodal
distributions. Thus, adding new clauses to a base instance has an inherent
effect of making runtimes long-tailed. This insight provides an explanation as
to why the technique of forgetting clauses is useful in CDCL solvers apart from
the optimization of unit propagation speed.

representativeness in specific applications. Here we formalize the problem of
creating equitable training datasets, and propose a statistical framework for
addressing this problem. We consider a setting where a model builder must
decide how to allocate a fixed data collection budget to gather training data
from different subgroups. We then frame dataset creation as a constrained
optimization problem, in which one maximizes a function of group-specific
performance metrics based on (estimated) group-specific learning rates and
costs per sample. This flexible approach incorporates preferences of
model-builders and other stakeholders, as well as the statistical properties of
the learning task. When data collection decisions are made sequentially, we
show that under certain conditions this optimization problem can be efficiently
solved even without prior knowledge of the learning rates. To illustrate our
approach, we conduct a simulation study of polygenic risk scores on synthetic
genomic data -- an application domain that often suffers from
non-representative data collection. We find that our adaptive sampling strategy
outperforms several common data collection heuristics, including equal and
proportional sampling, demonstrating the value of strategic dataset design for
building equitable models.

  Three Methodological Pitfalls","18 pages, 7 Figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Purpose: Despite the potential of machine learning models, the lack of
generalizability has hindered their widespread adoption in clinical practice.
We investigate three methodological pitfalls: (1) violation of independence
assumption, (2) model evaluation with an inappropriate performance indicator or
baseline for comparison, and (3) batch effect. Materials and Methods: Using
several retrospective datasets, we implement machine learning models with and
without the pitfalls to quantitatively illustrate these pitfalls' effect on
model generalizability. Results: Violation of independence assumption, more
specifically, applying oversampling, feature selection, and data augmentation
before splitting data into train, validation, and test sets, respectively, led
to misleading and superficial gains in F1 scores of 71.2% in predicting local
recurrence and 5.0% in predicting 3-year overall survival in head and neck
cancer as well as 46.0% in distinguishing histopathological patterns in lung
cancer. Further, randomly distributing data points for a subject across
training, validation, and test sets led to a 21.8% superficial increase in F1
score. Also, we showed the importance of the choice of performance measures and
baseline for comparison. In the presence of batch effect, a model built for
pneumonia detection led to F1 score of 98.7%. However, when the same model was
applied to a new dataset of normal patients, it only correctly classified 3.86%
of the samples. Conclusions: These methodological pitfalls cannot be captured
using internal model evaluation, and the inaccurate predictions made by such
models may lead to wrong conclusions and interpretations. Therefore,
understanding and avoiding these pitfalls is necessary for developing
generalizable models.

their controllability remains challenging. One fundamentally missing aspect of
molecular or protein generative models is an inductive bias that can reflect
continuous properties of interest. To that end, we propose the Regression
Transformer (RT), a novel method that abstracts regression as a conditional
sequence modeling problem. This introduces a new paradigm of multitask language
models which seamlessly bridge sequence regression and conditional sequence
generation.
  We thoroughly demonstrate that, despite using a nominal-scale training
objective, the RT matches or surpasses the performance of conventional
regression models in property prediction tasks of small molecules, proteins and
chemical reactions. Critically, priming the same model with continuous
properties yields a highly competitive conditional generative model that
outperforms specialized approaches in a substructure-constrained,
property-driven molecule generation benchmark. Our dichotomous approach is
facilitated by a novel, alternating training scheme that enables the model to
decorate seed sequences by desired properties, e.g., to optimize reaction
yield.
  In sum, the RT is the first report of a multitask model that concurrently
excels at predictive and generative tasks in biochemistry. This finds
particular application in property-driven, local exploration of the chemical or
protein space and could pave the road toward foundation models in material
design.

works have considered exploiting small-scale unlabeled data from the target
domain during the pre-training stage. This data enables self-supervised
pre-training on the target domain, in addition to supervised pre-training on
the source domain. In this paper, we empirically investigate which pre-training
is preferred based on domain similarity and few-shot difficulty of the target

over supervised pre-training becomes large when the target domain is dissimilar
to the source domain, or the target domain itself has low few-shot difficulty.
We further design two pre-training schemes, mixed-supervised and two-stage

CD-FSL, which are supported by extensive experiments and analyses on three

performed via a hypernetwork, learned jointly with a context vector from

environments, such as the received signal strength and channel attenuation, at

interpolative inference based on spatially distributed measurements. In this
tutorial article, after presenting some representative applications of radio
maps, the most prominent radio map estimation methods are discussed. Starting
from simple regression, the exposition gradually delves into more sophisticated
algorithms, eventually touching upon state-of-the-art techniques. To gain
insight into this versatile toolkit, illustrative toy examples will also be
presented.

  medium","CQG in print",,"10.1088/1361-6382/ac5376",,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of radiation by the charged particles of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) when a passing gravitational wave (GW) accelerate them is investigated.
The largest acceleration (taking a charge from rest to a maximum speed which
remains non-relativistic in the rest frame of the unperturbed spacetime) is
found to be limited by the curvature of a propagating spherical gravitational
wavefront. Interesting physics arises from the ensuing emission of radiation
into the warm hot IGM, which to lowest order is a fully ionized hydrogen plasma
with a frozen-in magnetic field $B$. It is found that for a vast majority of
propagation directions, the right-handed polarized radiation can penetrate the
plasma at frequencies below the plasma frequency $\om_p$, provided $\om<\om_b,$
where $\om_b=eB/m_e$ satisfies $\om_b<\om_p$ for typical IGM conditions.
Moreover, the refractive index under such a scenario is $n\gg 1,$ resulting in
an enhanced radiative dissipation of GW energy (relative to the vacuum
scenario), which is more severe for electrons if both charge species are in
thermal equilibrium and accelerated in the same way. The emission by the
electrons then prevails, and is further amplified by coherent addition of
amplitudes within the size one wavelength. The conversion of GWs of
$\lam\gtrsim 5\times 10^{13}$~cm to electromagnetic waves means such GWs can
only propagate a distance $\lesssim 1$~Gpc before being significantly damped by
an IGM B field of $\sim10^{-8}$ G. The low-frequency GWs
\textcolor{black}{targeted by pulsar-timing-arrays} will not survive unless the
IGM magnetic field is much lower than expected. The \textcolor{black}{mHz}
frequency GW inspirals targeted by future \textcolor{black}{space based}
detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna remain intact and can
be detected.

  Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks","12 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-fin.RM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Predicting the bankruptcy risk of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
is an important step for financial institutions when making decisions about
loans. Existing studies in both finance and AI research fields, however, tend
to only consider either the intra-risk or contagion risk of enterprises,
ignoring their interactions and combinatorial effects. This study for the first
time considers both types of risk and their joint effects in bankruptcy
prediction. Specifically, we first propose an enterprise intra-risk encoder
based on statistically significant enterprise risk indicators for its
intra-risk learning. Then, we propose an enterprise contagion risk encoder
based on enterprise relation information from an enterprise knowledge graph for
its contagion risk embedding. In particular, the contagion risk encoder
includes both the newly proposed Hyper-Graph Neural Networks and Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Networks, which can model contagion risk in two different aspects,
i.e. common risk factors based on hyperedges and direct diffusion risk from
neighbors, respectively. To evaluate the model, we collect real-world
multi-sources data on SMEs and build a novel benchmark dataset called SMEsD. We
provide open access to the dataset, which is expected to further promote
research on financial risk analysis. Experiments on SMEsD against twelve
state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model
for bankruptcy prediction.

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac1380",,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the tidal response of a superfluid neutron star in a binary system,
focussing on Newtonian models with superfluid neutrons present throughout the
star's core and the inner crust. Within the two-fluid formalism, we consider
the main aspects that arise from the presence of different regions inside the
star, with particular focus on the various interfaces. Having established the
relevant theory, we determine the tidal excitation of the most relevant
oscillation modes during binary inspiral. Our results suggest that superfluid
physics has a negligible impact on the static tidal deformation. The
overwhelming contribution to the Love number is given by, as for normal matter
stars, the ordinary fundamental mode (f-mode). Strong entrainment, here
described by a phenomenological expression which mimics the large effective
neutron mass expected at the bottom of the crust, is shown to have significant
impact on the superfluid modes, but our results for the dynamical tide are
nevertheless similar to the static limit: the fundamental modes are the ones
most significantly excited by the tidal interaction, with the ordinary f-mode
dominating the superfluid one. We also discuss the strain built up in the
star's crust during binary inspiral, showing that the superfluid f-mode may
(depending on entrainment) reach the limit where the crust breaks, although it
does so after the ordinary f-mode. Overall, our results suggest that the
presence of superfluidity may be difficult to establish from binary neutron
star gravitational-wave signals.

  Application to the Levothyrox Scandal in 2017 on Doctissimo Forum",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social media can be an important source of information facilitating the
detection of new safety signals in pharmacovigilance. Various approaches have
investigated the analysis of social media data using AI such as NLP techniques
for detecting adverse drug events. Existing approaches have focused on the
extraction and identification of Adverse Drug Reactions, Drug-Drug Interactions
and drug misuse. However, non of the works tackled the detection of potential
safety signals by taking into account the evolution in time of relevant
indicators. Moreover, despite the success of deep learning in various
healthcare applications, it was not explored for this task. We propose an
AI-based approach for the detection of potential pharmaceutical safety signals
from patients' reviews that can be used as part of the pharmacovigilance
surveillance process to flag the necessity of an in-depth pharmacovigilance
investigation. We focus on the Levothyrox case in France which triggered huge
attention from the media following the change of the medication formula,
leading to an increase in the frequency of adverse drug reactions normally
reported by patients. Our approach is two-fold. (1) We investigate various
NLP-based indicators extracted from patients' reviews including words and
n-grams frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and
sentiment analysis. (2) We propose a deep learning architecture, named Word
Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN) which trains a CNN on word clouds
extracted from the patients comments. We study the effect of different time
resolutions and different NLP pre-processing techniques on the model
performance. Our results show that the proposed indicators could be used in the
future to effectively detect new safety signals. The WC-CNN model trained on
word clouds extracted at monthly resolution outperforms the others with an
accuracy of 75%.

accounting, stock price, and other numerical hard data reported in P&L
statements or earnings per share reports. Yet, it is well-known that the
decision-makers routinely use soft text-based documents that interpret the hard
data they narrate. Recent advances in computational methods for analyzing
unstructured and soft text-based data at scale offer possibilities for
understanding financial market behavior that could improve investments and
market equity. A critical and ubiquitous form of soft data are earnings calls.
Earnings calls are periodic (often quarterly) statements usually by CEOs who
attempt to influence investors' expectations of a company's past and future
performance. Here, we study the statistical relationship between earnings
calls, company sales, stock performance, and analysts' recommendations. Our
study covers a decade of observations with approximately 100,000 transcripts of
earnings calls from 6,300 public companies from January 2010 to December 2019.
In this study, we report three novel findings. First, the buy, sell and hold
recommendations from professional analysts made prior to the earnings have low
correlation with stock price movements after the earnings call. Second, using
our graph neural network based method that processes the semantic features of
earnings calls, we reliably and accurately predict stock price movements in
five major areas of the economy. Third, the semantic features of transcripts
are more predictive of stock price movements than sales and earnings per share,
i.e., traditional hard data in most of the cases.
