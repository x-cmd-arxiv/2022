  Loss-aware Multi-bit Networks Quantization","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is one of the universal deadly diseases, and
the detection of it in the early stage is a challenging task to tackle.
Recently, deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been employed
widely for the classification of objects. Moreover, it is promising that lots
of networks can be deployed on wearable devices. An increasing number of
methods can be used to realize ECG signal classification for the sake of
arrhythmia detection. However, the existing neural networks proposed for
arrhythmia detection are not hardware-friendly enough due to a remarkable
quantity of parameters resulting in memory and power consumption.
  In this paper, we present a 1-D adaptive loss-aware quantization, achieving a
high compression rate that reduces memory consumption by 23.36 times. In order
to adapt to our compression method, we need a smaller and simpler network. We
propose a 17 layer end-to-end neural network classifier to classify 17
different rhythm classes trained on the MIT-BIH dataset, realizing a
classification accuracy of 93.5%, which is higher than most existing methods.
Due to the adaptive bitwidth method making important layers get more attention
and offered a chance to prune useless parameters, the proposed quantization
method avoids accuracy degradation. It even improves the accuracy rate, which
is 95.84%, 2.34% higher than before. Our study achieves a 1-D convolutional
neural network with high performance and low resources consumption, which is
hardware-friendly and illustrates the possibility of deployment on wearable
devices to realize a real-time arrhythmia diagnosis.

  Independent EEG-Based Emotion Recognition","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  One of the most significant challenges of EEG-based emotion recognition is
the cross-subject EEG variations, leading to poor performance and
generalizability. This paper proposes a novel EEG-based emotion recognition
model called the domain adversarial graph attention model (DAGAM). The basic
idea is to generate a graph to model multichannel EEG signals using biological
topology. Graph theory can topologically describe and analyze relationships and
mutual dependency between channels of EEG. Then, unlike other graph
convolutional networks, self-attention pooling is applied to benefit salient
EEG feature extraction from the graph, which effectively improves the
performance. Finally, after graph pooling, the domain adversarial based on the
graph is employed to identify and handle EEG variation across subjects,
efficiently reaching good generalizability. We conduct extensive evaluations on
two benchmark datasets (SEED and SEED IV) and obtain state-of-the-art results
in subject-independent emotion recognition. Our model boosts the SEED accuracy
to 92.59% (4.69% improvement) with the lowest standard deviation of 3.21%
(2.92% decrements) and SEED IV accuracy to 80.74% (6.90% improvement) with the
lowest standard deviation of 4.14% (3.88% decrements) respectively.

unsupervised SOD methods have been proposed to exploit noisy labels generated
by handcrafted saliency methods. However, it is still difficult to learn
accurate saliency details from rough noisy labels. In this paper, we propose to
learn saliency from synthetic but clean labels, which naturally has higher
pixel-labeling quality without the effort of manual annotations. Specifically,
we first construct a novel synthetic SOD dataset by a simple copy-paste
strategy. Considering the large appearance differences between the synthetic
and real-world scenarios, directly training with synthetic data will lead to
performance degradation on real-world scenarios. To mitigate this problem, we
propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive SOD method to adapt between these
two domains by uncertainty-aware self-training. Experimental results show that
our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art deep unsupervised
SOD methods on several benchmark datasets, and is even comparable to
fully-supervised ones.

that Hecke operators are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson product,

In the literature on topological modular forms, no topological analogue of the
Petersson product is to be found, and it is not known which topological spaces
have the property that their topological cusp forms admit a basis consisting of
eigenforms for the action of Baker's topological Hecke operators. In this note
we define and study a natural topological Petersson product on complexified
topological cusp forms, whose value on a one-point space recovers the classical
Petersson product. We find that the topological Petersson product is usually
degenerate: in particular, if $X$ is a space with nontrivial rational homology
in any positive degree, then the Petersson product on complexified $tcf^*(X)$
is degenerate. Despite $tcf$-cohomology being a stable invariant, the
topological Petersson product is an unstable invariant, vanishing on all
suspensions. Nevertheless, we demonstrate nontriviality of the topological
Petersson product by giving an explicit calculation of the topological
Petersson product on complexified $tcf$-cohomology of the complex projective

is nondegenerate on complexified $tcf$-cohomology of $X$ in a range of

there is a discrepancy in marginal distributions between the general-purpose

direct-transferring of learned representations from a model trained on a

Kalb-Ramond field, where the universe initially contracts through an ekpyrotic
stage having a non-singular bouncing like behaviour, and consequently, it
smoothly transits to an expanding phase. In particular, the KR field has an
interaction with a scalaron field (coming from higher curvature d.o.f) by a
linear coupling. The interaction energy density between the KR and the scalaron
grows faster than $a^{-6}$ during the contraction phase -- which has negligible
effects at the distant past, however as the universe continues to contract,
this interaction energy density gradually grows and plays a significant role to
trigger a non-singular bounce at a minimum value of the scale factor. The
bounce being symmetric and ekpyrotic, the energy density of the bouncing agent
rapidly decreases after the bounce during the expanding phase of the universe,
and consequently the standard Big-Bang cosmology gets recovered. In such
ekpyrotic bounce scenario, we find that the curvature perturbation gets a blue
tilted spectrum over the large scale modes -- not consistent with the Planck
data. To circumvent this problem, we propose an extended scenario where the
ekpyrotic phase is preceded by a quasi-matter dominated pre-ekpyrotic phase,
and re-investigate the perturbation power spectrum. As a result, the primordial
curvature perturbation, at scales that cross the horizon during the
pre-ekpyrotic stage, turns out to be nearly scale invariant that is indeed
consistent with the recent Planck data. The hallmark of the work is that
although the Kalb-Ramond field has negligible footprints at present universe,
it has considerable impacts during early stage of the universe, which in turn
makes the universe's evolution non-singular.

requires to store the Q-function values for all state-action pairs, the number
of which can be extremely large for wireless edge caching. To this end, we
approximate the Q-function by a parameterized function class with a much
smaller dimension, and further design a Q^{+}-Whittle algorithm with linear
function approximation, which is called Q^{+}-Whittle-LFA. We provide a
finite-time bound on the mean-square error of Q^{+}-Whittle-LFA. Simulation
results using real traces demonstrate that Q^{+}-Whittle-LFA yields excellent
empirical performance.

  Data","14 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the methods on matrix-based or bilinear discriminant
analysis (BLDA) have received much attention. Despite their advantages, it has
been reported that the traditional vector-based regularized LDA (RLDA) is still
quite competitive and could outperform BLDA on some benchmark datasets.
Nevertheless, it is also noted that this finding is mainly limited to image
data. In this paper, we propose regularized BLDA (RBLDA) and further explore
the comparison between RLDA and RBLDA on another type of matrix data, namely
multivariate time series (MTS). Unlike image data, MTS typically consists of
multiple variables measured at different time points. Although many methods for
MTS data classification exist within the literature, there is relatively little
work in exploring the matrix data structure of MTS data. Moreover, the existing
BLDA can not be performed when one of its within-class matrices is singular. To
address the two problems, we propose RBLDA for MTS data classification, where
each of the two within-class matrices is regularized via one parameter. We
develop an efficient implementation of RBLDA and an efficient model selection
algorithm with which the cross validation procedure for RBLDA can be performed
efficiently. Experiments on a number of real MTS data sets are conducted to
evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare RBLDA with several closely related
methods, including RLDA and BLDA. The results reveal that RBLDA achieves the
best overall recognition performance and the proposed model selection algorithm
is efficient; Moreover, RBLDA can produce better visualization of MTS data than
RLDA.

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering

orders at $T_{\text{N}_1}=4.7$\,K in a longitudinal spin density wave with
ordered Ce moments along the $b$-axis (i.e. the [0 1 0] crystal direction) and
an incommensurate propagation vector $\textbf{k}=(0,0.43,0$). Below the
lower-temperature transition $T_{\text{N}_2}=4.48$\,K, the propagation vector
locks to the commensurate value $\textbf{k}=(0,0.5,0)$, with a so-called
lock-in transition. Our neutron diffraction study in applied magnetic field

development of a ferromagnetic component at $H=3$\,kOe, followed by a series of

commonly used lowest-order theory, which accounts only for three-phonon
scattering and without phonon renormalization, fails drastically for considered
materials and underpredicts the thermal conductivity by up to a factor of two.
The thermal conductivity decreases for three compounds and increases for five
compounds with the application of higher-order corrections owing to a
contrasting role of four-phonon scattering and phonon stiffening on the
predicted thermal conductivity. Using the higher-order theory, at a temperature
of 300 K, the lowest obtained thermal conductivity is 0.31 W/m-K for BiCsK2 and
three other compounds (SbCsK2, SbRbNa2, and SbRbK2) have thermal conductivities

realized in chromium (Cr)- and/or vanadium (V)-doped TI (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films.
In this work, we synthesize both V- and Cr-doped Bi2Te3 thin films with
controlled dopant concentration using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). By
performing magneto-transport measurements, we find that both systems show an
unusual but yet similar ferromagnetic response with respect to magnetic dopant
concentration, specifically the Curie temperature does not increase
monotonically but shows a local maximum at a critical dopant concentration. Our
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show that the
Cr/V doping introduces hole carriers into Bi2Te3, which consequently move the
chemical potential toward the charge neutral point. In addition, the Cr/V
doping also reduces the spin-orbit coupling of Bi2Te3 which drives it from a
nontrivial TI to a trivial semiconductor. The unusual ferromagnetic response
observed in Cr/V-doped Bi2Te3 thin films is attributed to the
dopant-concentration-induced magnetic exchange interaction, which displays the
evolution from the van Vleck-type ferromagnetism in a nontrivial magnetic TI to
the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-type ferromagnetism in a trivial
diluted magnetic semiconductor. Our work provides insights into the
ferromagnetic properties of magnetically doped TI thin films and facilitates

Specifically, it is shown that despite the large search space and the

of lattice dynamics. Instead of tracking the state of individual lattice sites,
this approach describes the time evolution of the concentrations of different
cluster types. It leads to an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential
equations which must be closed by truncation using a so-called closure
condition. This condition approximates the concentrations of higher-order
clusters in terms of the concentrations of lower-order ones. The pair
approximation is the most common form of closure. Here, we consider its
generalization, termed the ""optimal approximation"", which we calibrate using a
robust data-driven strategy. To fix attention, we focus on a recently proposed
structured lattice model for a nickel-based oxide, similar to that used as
cathode material in modern commercial Li-ion batteries. The form of the
obtained optimal approximation allows us to deduce a simple sparse closure
model. In addition to being more accurate than the classical pair
approximation, this ``sparse approximation'' is also physically interpretable
which allows us to a posteriori refine the hypotheses underlying construction
of this class of closure models. Moreover, the mean-cluster model closed with
this sparse approximation is linear and hence analytically solvable such that
its parametrization is straightforward. On the other hand, parametrization of
the mean-cluster model closed with the pair approximation is shown to lead to
an ill-posed inverse problem.

oscillators are desirable for many tasks, their frequency usually decreases
below the cavity linewidth, significantly limiting the methods that can be used

linear, system by more than one order of magnitude. Furthermore, our theory
predicts that with this approach we can also surpass the standard cooling limit

efficient cooling of a wider range of optomechanical systems, opening new

thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantages on near-term Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable PQC
learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines
instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to
obtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the
number of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of
practical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that
due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients
obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the
training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient
pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then
remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than
large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive
experiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5
classification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate
that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and
4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings
up to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully
obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation
but have much better training scalability. The QOC code is available in the
TorchQuantum library.

pair-correlation function of amorphous silicon ($a$-Si) using ultra-large
atomistic models obtained from Monte Carlo and molecular-dynamics simulations.
The extended-range order manifests itself in the form of radial oscillations,
on the length scale of 20-40 angstrom, which are examined by directly analyzing
the radial distribution of atoms in distant coordination shells and comparing
the same with those from a class of partially-ordered networks of Si atoms and
disordered configurations of crystalline silicon from an information-theoretic
point of view. The study suggests that the extended-range radial oscillations
principally originate from the propagation of radial ordering from the first
few atomic shells to a distance of up to 40 angstrom. The effect of these
oscillations on the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in the structure factor
is addressed by obtaining a semi-analytical expression for the static structure
factor of $a$-Si, and calculating an estimate of the error of the intensity of
the FSDP associated with the truncation of radial information from distant
shells. The results indicate that the extended-range oscillations do not have
any noticeable effects on the position and intensity of the FSDP, which are
primarily determined by the medium-range atomic correlations of up to a length

iterations are proposed for optimizing these parameters, which allows for rapid
estimation of a relatively large number of parameters. We demonstrate that with

direction. Different approaches use Monte Carlo methods to quantify the
statistical significance of a signal, although often lacking an analytical
framework. Here we present two methods to detect and quantify alignment signals
and test their statistical robustness. The first method considers the deviance
of the relative fraction of vector components in the plane perpendicular to a
reference direction with respect to an isotropic distribution. We also derive
the statistical properties and stability of the resulting estimator, and
therefore does not rely on Monte Carlo simulations to assess its statistical
significance. The second method is based on a fit over the residuals of the
empirical cumulative distribution function with respect to that expected for a
uniform distribution, using a small set of harmonic orthogonal functions, which
does not rely on any binning scheme. We compare these methods with others
commonly used in the literature, using Monte Carlo simulations, finding that
the proposed statistics allow the detection of alignment signals with greater
significance.

In practice, it is vital to precisely identify abnormal status of the working

this paper, we propose a multi-pattern adversarial learning one-class
classification framework, which allows us to use both the generator and the
discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient ASD. The core idea is
learning to reconstruct the normal patterns of acoustic data through two
different patterns of auto-encoding generators, which succeeds in extending the
fundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to
distinguishing between regional and local pattern reconstructions. Furthermore,
we present a global filter layer for long-term interactions in the frequency
domain space, which directly learns from the original data without introducing
any human priors. Extensive experiments performed on four real-world datasets
from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets provided by SAMSON
AG, and one existing publicly) for anomaly detection show superior results, and
outperform recent state-of-the-art ASD methods.

many studies have investigated efficient and robust dynamic state estimation

by the lack of DSE methods based on power network's differential-algebraic

order to perform simultaneous estimation of the dynamic and algebraic states of
multi-machine power networks. Specifically, we leverage the DAE dynamics of a
power network around an operating point and combine them with a PMU-based
measurement model capable of capturing bus voltages and line currents. The
proposed $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ observer, which only requires detectability and
impulse observability conditions which are satisfied for various power

points in the first Brillouin zone. When this system is slightly doped, there
exists two closed Fermi surfaces with the same area and the dHvA oscillations
become saw-tooth pattern or inversed saw-tooth pattern for both cases of fixed
electron filling ($\nu$) or fixed chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to
the magnetic field, respectively. By increasing dopings, the system approaches
the Lifshitz transition, where two closed Fermi surfaces are close each other.
Then, we find that the pattern of the dHvA oscillations changes. A jump of the
magnetization appears at the center of the fundamental period and its magnitude
increases in the case of the fixed electron filling, while a jump is separated
into a pair of jumps and its separation becomes large in the case of the fixed
chemical potential. This is due to the lifting of double degeneracy in the
Landau levels. Since this lifting is seen in the two-dimensional Dirac fermion
system with two Dirac points, the obtained results in this study can be applied

current pose predictions from the existing data, which is used to form
predicted surface normal and depth hypotheses, and allows us to then assess the
information gain from a subsequent frame for any candidate viewpoint. Using
this formulation, we implement an active perception pipeline which is evaluated
on a challenging real-world dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that
our active depth acquisition method outperforms two strong baselines for both

Specifically, Amini shows that the face poset of the Voronoi polytope is
isomorphic to the poset of strongly connected orientations of subgraphs. This
answers a question raised by Caporaso and Viviani, and Amini also proves a dual
result for integer cuts. In this paper we generalise Amini's result to regular

spin-orbit coupling (LO-RSOC) -- the situation when the RSOC has the same
magnitude but the opposite sign in two coupled spatially separated layers. We
show that the LO-RSOC results in the loss of spin chirality in the momentum
space, in contrast to the common uniform RSOC. This chirality loss makes it
difficult to experimentally establish whether the LO-RSOC (on the scale of 10
meV) exists, because the band structure is insensitive to it. To solve this
problem, we propose to identify the LO-RSOC either by gating to break the
inversion symmetry or by magnetic field to break the time-reversal symmetry.
Remarkably, we observe the transition between trivial and non-trivial band
topology as the system deviates from the LO Rashba state. Ab inito calculations
suggest that bilayer graphene encapsulated by two monolayers of Au is a
candidate to be a LO Rashba system.

extremely valuable source for monitoring changes occurred on the earth surface.
However, precisely detecting relevant changes in VHR images still remains a
challenge, due to the complexity of the relationships among ground objects. To
address this limitation, a dual neighborhood hypergraph neural network is
proposed in this article, which combines the multiscale superpixel segmentation
and hypergraph convolution to model and exploit the complex relationships.
First, the bi-temporal image pairs are segmented under two scales and fed to a
pre-trained U-net to obtain node features by treating each object under the
fine scale as a node. The dual neighborhood is then defined using the
father-child and adjacent relationships of the segmented objects to construct
the hypergraph, which permits models to represent the higher-order structured
information far more complex than just pairwise relationships. The hypergraph
convolutions are conducted on the constructed hypergraph to propagate the label
information from a small amount of labeled nodes to the other unlabeled ones by
the node-edge-node transform. Moreover, to alleviate the problem of imbalanced
sample, the focal loss function is adopted to train the hypergraph neural
network. The experimental results on optical, SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method comprises better effectiveness
and robustness compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

curve with Dirichlet boundary condition in two dimensions. It is proved that
the periodic curve can be uniquely determined by the near-field measurement
data corresponding to infinitely many incident plane waves with distinct
directions at a fixed frequency. Our proof is based on Schiffer's idea which
consists of two ingredients: i) the total fields for incident plane waves with
distinct directions are linearly independent, and ii) there exist only finitely
many linearly independent Dirichlet eigenfunctions in a bounded domain or in a
closed waveguide under additional assumptions on the waveguide boundary. Based
on the Rayleigh expansion, we prove that the phased near-field data can be
uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data in a bounded domain, with
the exception of a finite set of incident angles. Such a phase retrieval result
leads to a new uniqueness result for the inverse grating diffraction problem

direction determines the quasi-periodicity of the boundary value problem, our
inverse issues are different from the existing results of [Htttlich & Kirsch,

in a nucleus, is a fundamental property of QCD (quantum chromodynamics)
reflecting its internal structure and effective size when it is produced at
high transverse momentum, $Q$. CT has been confirmed in many experiments, such
as semi-exclusive hard electroproduction, $e A \to e' \pi X$ for mesons
produced at $Q^2 > 3 ~ {\rm GeV}^2$. However, a recent JLab (Jefferson
Laboratory) measurement for a proton electroproduced in carbon $e\, {\rm C}\to
e' p X$, where $X$ stands for the inclusive sum of all produced final states,
fails to observe CT at $Q^2$ up to 14.2 GeV$^2$. In this paper, the onset of CT
is determined by comparing the $Q^2$-dependence of the hadronic cross sections
for the initial formation of a small color-singlet configuration using the
generalized parton distributions from holographic light-front QCD. A critical
dependence on the hadron's twist, $\tau$, the number of hadron constituents, is
found for the onset of CT, with no significant effects from the nuclear medium.
This effect can explain the absence of proton CT in the present kinematic range
of the JLab experiment. The proton is predicted to have a ""two-stage"" color
transparency with the onset of CT differing for the spin-conserving (twist-3,
$\tau=3$) Dirac form factor with a higher onset in $Q^2$ for the spin-flip
Pauli (twist-4) form factor. In contrast, the neutron is predicted to have a
""one-stage"" color transparency with the onset at higher $Q^2$ because of the
dominance of its Pauli form factor. The model also predicts a strong dependence
at low energies on the flavor of the quark current coupling to the hadron.

system would be further advantageous in low-resource environments where lack of
government funding for infrastructure maintenance typically entails heightened
risks of potentially fatal vehicular road accidents as a result of inadequate
and infrequent manual inspection of road systems for road hazards. To remedy
this, a recent research initiative organized by the Institute of Electrical and

Detection (""GRDC"") Challenge published in May 2020 a novel 21,041 annotated
image dataset of various road distresses calling upon academic and other
researchers to submit innovative deep learning-based solutions to these road
hazard detection problems. Making use of this dataset, we propose a supervised
object detection approach leveraging You Only Look Once (""YOLO"") and the Faster
R-CNN frameworks to detect and classify road distresses in real-time via a
vehicle dashboard-mounted smartphone camera, producing 0.68 F1-score
experimental results ranking in the top 5 of 121 teams that entered this

limit of Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics with speed change. The Kawasaki part
describes the movement of particles through particle interactions. It is
speeded up in a diffusive space-time scaling. The Glauber part governs the
creation and annihilation of particles. The Glauber part is set to favor two
levels of particle density. It is also speeded up in time, but at a lesser rate
than the Kawasaki part. Under this scaling, a mean-curvature interface flow
emerges, with a homogenized `surface tension-mobility' parameter reflecting
microscopic rates. The interface separates the two levels of particle density.
  Similar hydrodynamic limits have been derived in two recent papers; one where
the Kawasaki part describes simple nearest neighbor interactions, and one where
the Kawasaki part is replaced by a zero-range process. We extend the main
results of these two papers beyond nearest-neighbor interactions. The main
novelty of our proof is the derivation of a `Boltzmann-Gibbs' principle which

the presence of broadband turbulence. The simulations show that these
particularities alter the decay rate of the wake significantly and challenge
the notion of universality -- the idea that far from the body all turbulent
wakes decay at the same rate. The influence of stratification in the wake is
also studied at Froude numbers $Fr=U_\infty/ND=2$ and $10$. The results imply
that the onset of buoyancy effects depends on the wake generator and that the

changes in the dynamics of a system. The transient dynamics is investigated
here in a classic ecological model of a bistable tri-trophic food chain. All
the species in the food chain either coexist or undergoes a partial extinction
with the loss of predator after a transient time that depends upon the initial
density of species populations. The distribution of transient time of
extinction of the predator in response to initial states shows interesting
pattern of inhomogeneity and anisotropy in the basin of predator-fee state.
Precisely, the distribution shows a multimodal character when the initial
points are near the basin boundary, and unimodal at locations far from the
border. The distribution is also anisotropic in the sense that the number of
modes depends on the direction from the basin location. We define two new
metrics, viz., homogeneity index and local isotropic index to characterize the
distinctive features of the distribution. The inhomogeneity of distribution
reduces significantly with resource enrichment, however, a similar change in
anisotropy is relatively low. We try to explain the origin of such multimodal

machine unlearning paradigm. Existing studies of machine unlearning mainly
focus on sample-wise unlearning, such that a learnt model will not expose
user's privacy at the sample level. Yet we argue that such ability of selective
removal should also be presented at the attribute level, especially for the
attributes irrelevant to the main task, e.g., whether a person recognized in a
face recognition system wears glasses or the age range of that person. Through
a comprehensive literature review, it is found that existing studies on
attribute-related problems like fairness and de-biasing learning cannot address
the above concerns properly. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm of
selectively removing input attributes from feature representations which we
name `attribute unlearning'. In this paradigm, certain attributes will be
accurately captured and detached from the learned feature representations at
the stage of training, according to their mutual information. The particular
attributes will be progressively eliminated along with the training procedure
towards convergence, while the rest of attributes related to the main task are
preserved for achieving competitive model performance. Considering the
computational complexity during the training process, we not only give a
theoretically approximate training method, but also propose an acceleration
scheme to speed up the training process. We validate our method by spanning
several datasets and models and demonstrate that our design can preserve model
fidelity and reach prevailing unlearning efficacy with high efficiency. The
proposed unlearning paradigm builds a foundation for future machine unlearning
system and will become an essential component of the latest privacy-related
legislation.

buckling load of circular cylindrical shells under axial compression does not
coincide with the experimental data. Namely, while Koiter's formula predicts
linear dependence of the buckling load $\lambda(h)$ of the shell thickness $h$
($h>0$ is a small parameter), one observes the dependence $\lambda(h)\sim
h^{3/2}$ in experiments; i.e., the shell buckles at much smaller loads for
small thickness. This theoretical prediction failure is believed to be caused
by the so-called sensitivity to imperfections phenomenon (both, shape and
load). Grabovsky and the first author have rigorously proven in [\textit{J.
Nonl. Sci.,} Vol. 26, Iss. 1, pp. 83--119, Feb. 2016], that in the problem of
circular cylindrical shells buckling under axial compression, a small load
twist leads to the buckling load scaling $\lambda(h)\sim h^{5/4},$ while shape
imperfections are likely to result in the scaling $\lambda(h)\sim h^{3/2}.$ In
this work we prove, that in fact the buckling load $\lambda(h)$ of cylindrical
(not necessarily circular) shells under vertical compression depends on the
curvature of the cross section curve. When the cross section is a convex curve
with uniformly positive curvature, then $\lambda(h)\sim h,$ and when the the
cross section curve has positive curvature except at finitely many points, then
$C_1h^{8/5}\leq \lambda(h)\leq C_2h^{3/2}$ for $h$ small thickness $h>0.$

measured in STAR (the Solenoidal Tracker At Relativistic heavy ion collider)
experiments, which opens up a new window in the study of the hottest, least
viscous and most vortical fluid that has ever been produced in the laboratory.
We present a different approach to spin polarization from conventional ones: a
topological realization of spin polarization through quantum vortex formation
in collisions of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). This approach is based on the
observation that the vortex is a topological excitation in a superfluid in
presence of local orbital angular momentum and is an analogue of spin degrees
of freedom. The formation processes of vortices and vortex-antivortex pairs are
investigated by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with a large-scale
parallel algorithm on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to very high precision. In
a rotating environment, the primary vortex with winding number one is stable
against perturbation, which has a minimal energy and fixed orbital angular
momentum (OAM), but the vortices with larger winding numbers are unstable and
will decay into primary vortices through a redistribution of the energy and
vorticity. The injection of OAM can also be realized in non-central collisions
of self-interacting condensates, part of the OAM of the initial state will
induce the formation of vortices through concentration of energy and vorticity
density around topological defects. Different from a hydrodynamical
description, the interference of the wave function plays an important role in
the transport of energy and vorticity, reflecting the quantum nature of the
vortex formation process. The study of the vortex formation may shed light on
the nature of particle spin and spin-orbit couplings in strong interaction
matter produced in heavy-ion collisions.

Why/Where/Fix, a systematic inclusivity debugging process whose inclusivity
fault localization harnesses Information Architecture(IA) -- the way
user-facing information is organized, structured and labeled. We then conducted
a multi-stage qualitative empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of
Why/Where/Fix, using an Open Source Software (OSS) project's infrastructure as

to find inclusivity bugs, localize the IA faults behind them, and then fix the
IA to remove the inclusivity bugs they had found. Our results showed that using
Why/Where/Fix reduced the number of inclusivity bugs that OSS newcomer
participants experienced by 90%.

introduce new challenges, particularly in the realm of user privacy.
Specifically, the way data is collected can pose privacy risks to end users. In
many routing services, a single entity (e.g., the routing service provider)
collects and manages user trajectory data. When it comes to user privacy, these
systems have a central point of failure since users have to trust that this
entity will not sell or use their data to infer sensitive private information.
Unfortunately, in practice many advertising companies offer to buy such data
for the sake of targeted advertisements.
  With this as motivation, we study the problem of using location data for
routing services in a privacy-preserving way. Rather than having users report
their location to a central operator, we present a protocol in which users
participate in a decentralized and privacy-preserving computation to estimate
travel times for the roads in the network in a way that no individuals'
location is ever observed by any other party. The protocol uses the Laplace
mechanism in conjunction with secure multi-party computation to ensure that it
is cryptogrpahically secure and that its output is differentially private.
  A natural question is if privacy necessitates degradation in accuracy or
system performance. We show that if a road has sufficiently high capacity, then
the travel time estimated by our protocol is provably close to the ground truth
travel time. We validate the protocol through numerical experiments which show
that using the protocol as a routing service provides privacy guarantees with
minimal overhead to user travel time.

recommendations to users and help businesses attract potential customers.
Despite their success, recent studies suggest that highly data-driven
recommendations could be impacted by data biases, resulting in unfair outcomes
for different stakeholders, mainly consumers (users) and providers (items).
Most existing fairness-related research works in recommender systems treat user
fairness and item fairness issues individually, disregarding that RS work in a
two-sided marketplace. This paper studies the interplay between (i) the
unfairness of active users, (ii) the unfairness of popular items, and (iii) the
accuracy (personalization) of recommendation as three angles of our study
triangle. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged levels to measure
user fairness based on their activity level. For item fairness, we divide items
into short-head, mid-tail, and long-tail groups and study the exposure of these
item groups into the top-k recommendation list of users. Experimental
validation of eight different recommendation models commonly used for POI
recommendation (e.g., contextual, CF) on two publicly available POI
recommendation datasets, Gowalla and Yelp, indicate that most well-performing
models suffer seriously from the unfairness of popularity bias (provider
unfairness). Furthermore, our study shows that most recommendation models
cannot satisfy both consumer and producer fairness, indicating a trade-off
between these variables possibly due to natural biases in data. We choose the
POI recommendation as our test scenario; however, the insights should be
trivially extendable on other domains.

$R\ln\left( \square\right) R$ and $C_{\kappa\rho\alpha\beta}\ln\left(

$R\ln\left( \square\right) R$, affects the Starobinsky inflation. We consider
the nonlocal term as a small correction to the $R^{2}$ term, and we demonstrate
that the model behaves like a local model in this context. In addition, we show

be considered for vehicle development. Apparent piston travel (APT) and drag
torque are the most representative factors for evaluating braking performance.
In particular, as the two performance factors have a conflicting relationship
with each other, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approach is
required for brake design. However, the computational cost of MDO increases as
the number of disciplines increases. Recent studies on inverse design that use
deep learning (DL) have established the possibility of instantly generating an
optimal design that can satisfy the target performance without implementing an
iterative optimization process. This study proposes a DL-based
multidisciplinary inverse design (MID) that simultaneously satisfies multiple
targets, such as the APT and drag torque of the brake system. Results show that
the proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently
compared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation
and sequential quadratic programming. The MID achieved a similar performance to
the single-disciplinary inverse design in terms of accuracy and computational
cost. A novel design was derived on the basis of results, and the same
performance was satisfied as that of the existing design.

focus on reducing domain divergence in the same model layer. However, the same

domain shifts. To further boost model adaptation performance, we propose a
novel method called Attention-based Cross-layer Domain Alignment (ACDA), which
captures the semantic relationship between the source and target domains across
model layers and calibrates each level of semantic information automatically
through a dynamic attention mechanism. An elaborate attention mechanism is
designed to reweight each cross-layer pair based on their semantic similarity
for precise domain alignment, effectively matching each level of semantic

time-dependent due to various forms of drifts, changes in the number of
clusters, etc. The Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), whose Bayesian
nonparametric nature allows it to adapt its complexity to the data, seems a
natural choice for the streaming-data case. In its classical formulation,
however, the DPMM cannot capture common types of drifts in the data statistics.
Moreover, and regardless of that limitation, existing methods for online DPMM
inference are too slow to handle rapid data streams. In this work we propose
adapting both the DPMM and a known DPMM sampling-based non-streaming inference

monolayer WSe2 at room temperature, which is unexpected in perturbative
nonlinear optics. Together with numerical calculations, our measurements
revealed that the coherent exciton emission reflects the diabatic and adiabatic

  Framework for Connected Component","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image segmentation, which aims to automatically extract anatomical or
pathological structures, plays a key role in computer-aided diagnosis and
disease analysis. Despite the problem has been widely studied, existing methods
are prone to topological errors. In medical imaging, the topology of the
structure, such as the kidney or lung, is usually known. Preserving the
topology of the structure in the segmentation process is of utmost importance
for accurate image analysis. In this work, a novel learning-based segmentation
model is proposed. A {\it topology-preserving segmentation network (TPSN)} is
trained to give an accurate segmentation result of an input image that
preserves the prescribed topology. TPSN is a deformation-based model that
yields a deformation map through a UNet, which takes the medical image and a
template mask as inputs. The main idea is to deform a template mask describing
the prescribed topology by a diffeomorphism to segment the object in the image.
The topology of the shape in the template mask is well preserved under the
diffeomorphic map. The diffeomorphic property of the map is controlled by
introducing a regularization term related to the Jacobian in the loss function.
As such, a topology-preserving segmentation result can be guaranteed.
Furthermore, a multi-scale TPSN is developed in this paper that incorporates
multi-level information of images to produce more precise segmentation results.
To evaluate our method, we applied the 2D TPSN on Ham10000 and 3D TPSN on
KiTS21. Experimental results illustrate our method outperforms the baseline
UNet segmentation model with/without connected-component analysis (CCA) by both
the dice score and IoU score. Besides, results show that our method can produce
reliable results even in challenging cases, where pixel-wise segmentation
models by UNet and CCA fail to obtain accurate results.

Stuart-Landau oscillators under a discrete time-dependent coupling. In this
coupling, the connections among the oscillators are turned ON and OFF in a
systematic manner, having either a symmetric or an asymmetric time interval. We
discover that depending upon the time period and duty cycle of the ON-OFF
intervals, the aging region shrinks drastically in the parameter space,
therefore promoting restoration of oscillatory dynamics from the aging. In the
case of symmetric discrete coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are equal), the
aging zone decreases significantly with the resumption of dynamism with an
increasing time period of the ON-OFF intervals. On the other hand, in the case
of asymmetric coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are not equal), we find that
the ratio of the ON and OFF intervals controls the aging dynamics: the aging
state is revoked more effectively if the interval of the OFF state is greater
than the ON state. Finally, we study the transition in aging using a discrete
pulse coupling: we note that the pulse interval plays a crucial role in
determining the aging region. For all the cases of discrete time-dependent
couplings, the aging regions are shrinking and the rhythmicity gets enhanced in
a controlled manner. Our findings suggest that this type of coupling can act as
a noninvasive way to restore the oscillatory dynamics from an aging state in a
network of coupled oscillators.

  Here we investigate the entanglement spectrum of the long-range XXZ model. We
show that within the critical phase it exhibits a remarkable self-similarity.
  The breakdown of self-similarity and the transition away from a Luttinger
liquid is consistent with renormalization group theory.
  Combining the two, we are able to determine the quantum phase diagram of the
model and locate the corresponding phase transitions. Our results are confirmed
by numerically-exact calculations using tensor-network techniques.
  Moreover, we show that the self-similar rescaling extends to the geometrical
entanglement as well as the Luttinger parameter in the critical phase.
  Our results pave the way to further studies of entanglement properties in
long-range quantum models.

$f_v=a(v-v_c)$ with $v_c$ being the critical velocity. The proportionality
constant $a$ is linearly decreased with a decrease in the obstacle strength,
whereas $v_c$ approaches the speed of sound. When the obstacle size increases,
both $a$ and $v_c$ are decreased. The critical vortex shedding is further
investigated for an oscillating obstacle and found to be consistent with the

  Using Steerable Filters with First- and Second-order Gradients",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Co-registration of multimodal remote sensing images is still an ongoing
challenge because of nonlinear radiometric differences (NRD) and significant
geometric distortions (e.g., scale and rotation changes) between these images.
In this paper, a robust matching method based on the Steerable filters is
proposed consisting of two critical steps. First, to address severe NRD, a
novel structural descriptor named the Steerable Filters of first- and
second-Order Channels (SFOC) is constructed, which combines the first- and
second-order gradient information by using the steerable filters with a
multi-scale strategy to depict more discriminative structure features of
images. Then, a fast similarity measure is established called Fast Normalized
Cross-Correlation (Fast-NCCSFOC), which employs the Fast Fourier Transform
technique and the integral image to improve the matching efficiency.
Furthermore, to achieve reliable registration performance, a coarse-to-fine
multimodal registration system is designed consisting of two pivotal modules.
The local coarse registration is first conducted by involving both detection of
interest points (IPs) and local geometric correction, which effectively
utilizes the prior georeferencing information of RS images to address global
geometric distortions. In the fine registration stage, the proposed SFOC is
used to resist significant NRD, and to detect control points between multimodal
images by a template matching scheme. The performance of the proposed matching
method has been evaluated with many different kinds of multimodal RS images.
The results show its superior matching performance compared with the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the designed registration system also
outperforms the popular commercial software in both registration accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our system is available at

far. In this work, we use the Gamow shell model (GSM) in the coupled-channel
representation (GSM-CC) to study the properties of $^9$Li and the radiative
capture reaction $^8$Li$(n,\gamma)$$^9$Li. In GSM-CC calculations, a
translationally invariant Hamiltonian is used with a finite-range two-body
interaction tuned to reproduce the low-energy spectra of $^{8-9}$Li. In the
calculation of $^8$Li$(n,\gamma)$$^9$Li cross section, all relevant E1, M1, and
E2 transitions from the initial continuum states to the final bound states
${3/2}_1^-$, ${1/2}_1^-$ and the resonance ${5/2}_1^-$ of $^9$Li are included.
The GSM-CC approach reproduces the experimental low-energy spectrum, neutron
emission threshold, and spectroscopic factors in $^9$Li. The calculated
reaction rate is consistent with the experimental upper limit of the reaction
rate obtained in the indirect measurements at stellar energies. The GSM-CC
calculations suggest that the $^8$Li$(n,\gamma)$$^9$Li reaction can reduce
heavy-element production via the main chain

where we obtain the ego-motion by estimating a set of sub-region
transformations and averaging them with a motion voting mechanism, to encourage
the network focusing on representative structures. 2) The inherent alignment
errors, which cannot be eliminated via ego-motion optimization, are
down-weighted in losses based on the 3D point covariance estimations. 3) The
discovered representative structures and learned point covariances are
incorporated in the mapping module to improve the robustness of map
construction. Our two-frame odometry outperforms the previous state of the arts

theory (QT) is not mechanics but probabilistic mechanics. We therefore choose
the theory of statistical ensembles in phase space as starting point for a
reconstruction of QT. These ensembles are described by a probability density
$\rho (q, p, t)$ and an action variable $S (q, p, t)$. Since the state
variables of QT only depend on $q$ and $t$, our first step is to carry out a
projection $p \Rightarrow M (q, t)$ from phase space to configuration space. We
next show that instead of the momentum components $M_{k}$ one must introduce
suitable potentials as dynamic variables. The quasi-quantal theory resulting
from the projection is only locally valid. To correct this failure, we have to
perform as a second step a linearization or randomization, which ultimately
leads to QT. In this work we represent $M$ as an irrotational field, where all
components $M_{k}$ may be derived from a single function $S (q, t)$. We obtain
the usual Schr\""odinger equation for a nonspinning particle. However, space is
three-dimensional and $M$ must be described by $3$ independent functions. In
the fourth work of this series, a complete representation of $M$ will be used,

result. First, we show that in characteristic $0$ every stack of semistable
decorated $G$-bundles admitting a quasiprojective good moduli space can be
written naturally as a $G$-linearized global quotient $Y/G$, so the moduli
problem can be interpreted as a GIT problem. Secondly, we give a proof that the

smooth over any base in characteristic $0$.

prove that, surprisingly, there exist problem instances where the SGD solution

Consequently, it turns out that SGD is not algorithmically stable in any sense,

any other currently known generalization bound technique for that matter (other
than that of its classical analysis). We then continue to analyze the closely
related with-replacement SGD, for which we show that an analogous phenomenon
does not occur and prove that its population risk does in fact converge at the
optimal rate. Finally, we interpret our main results in the context of
without-replacement SGD for finite-sum convex optimization problems, and derive
upper and lower bounds for the multi-epoch regime that significantly improve

[1,1]paracyclophane adsorb up to 6 H2 molecules via Kubas interaction achieving
maximum gravimetric density up to 8.22 wt% and 6.33 wt%, respectively. The
calculated average hydrogen adsorption energy (0.36 eV) is lower than the
chemisorption but higher than the physisorption process. The kinetic
stabilities are verified through the HOMO-LUMO gap and different global
reactive descriptors. ADMP molecular dynamics simulations reveal the
reversibility of adsorbed H2 molecules at sufficiently above the room
temperature and the solidity of host material at 500 K. Average Van't Hoff
desorption temperature for Sc and Y decorated system was calculated to be 439 K

usable hydrogen capacities are found to be 5.92 wt% and 5.87 wt% of hydrogen

another conditional prior for the latent label space. Both types of priors

empirically and theoretically that the novel priors can disentangle
representations even without specific regularizations as in the prior work. The
content prior enables directly sampling diverse content representations from
the content space learned from the seen tasks, and fuse them with the
representations of novel tasks for generating semantically diverse texts in the
low-resource settings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior

that spin is not a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon, as has long been
assumed. Rather, this phenomenon occurs before the transition to QT takes
place, namely in the area of the quasi-classical (here better quasi-quantum)
theory. This borderland between classical physics and QT can be reached within
the framework of our reconstruction by the replacement $p \rightarrow M (q,
t)$, where $p$ is the momentum variable of the particle and $M(q, t)$ is the
momentum field in configuration space. The occurrence of spin, and its special
value $1/2$ , is a consequence of the fact that $M(q,t)$ must have exactly
three independent components $M_{k}(q,t)$ for a single particle because of the
three-dimensionality of space. In the Schr\""odinger equation for a ""particle
with spin zero"", the momentum field is usually represented as a gradient of a
single function $S$. This implies dependencies between the components
$M_{k}(q,t)$ for which no explanation exists. In reality, $M(q,t)$ needs to be
represented by three functions, two of which are rotational degrees of freedom.
The latter are responsible for the existence of spin. All massive structureless
particles in nature must therefore be spin-one-half particles, simply because
they have to be described by $4$ real fields, one of which has the physical
meaning of a probability density, while the other three are required to
represent the momentum field in three-dimensional space. We derive the
Pauli-Schr\""odinger equation, the correct value $g=2$ of the gyromagnetic
ratio, the classical limit of the Pauli-Schr\""odinger equation, and clarify
some other open questions in the borderland between classical physics and QT.

dealing successfully with the general case (heterogeneity across lineages) is
one of the key features of phylogenetic reconstruction methods based on

  The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we present a new weighting system
for quartets (ASAQ) based on algebraic and semi-algebraic tools, thus specially
indicated to deal with data evolving under heterogeneus rates. This method
combines the weights two previous methods by means of a test based on the
positivity of the branch length estimated with the paralinear distance. ASAQ is
statistically consistent when applied to GM data, considers rate and base
composition heterogeneity among lineages and does not assume stationarity nor
time-reversibility. Second, we test and compare the performance of several
quartet-based methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction (namely, Quartet
Puzzling, Weight Optimization and Wilson's method) in combination with ASAQ
weights and other weights based on algebraic and semi-algebraic methods or on
the paralinear distance. These tests are applied to both simulated and real
data and support Weight Optimization with ASAQ weights as a reliable and
successful reconstruction method.

doping affects the BD transition, we have investigated the electronic structure
of single-crystalline thin films of Nd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$NiO$_3$ by synchrotron

we find that the doped holes are localized on one or more Ni sites around the

intact. The effective charge transfer energy ($\Delta$) increases with Ca
concentration and the formation of BD phase is not favored above a critical

that the appearance of BD mode is essential for the MIT and settles a
long-standing debate about the role of structural distortions for the MIT of

is adopted. A fourth-order multi-moment discretization formulation is applied
to solve the governing equations cast in the local curvilinear coordinates on

direction, the height-based terrain-following grid is used to deal with the
topography and a conservative finite difference scheme is adopted for the
spatial discretization. The dynamical core adopts the nonhydrostatic governing
equations. To get around the CFL stability restriction imposed by sound wave
propagation and relatively small grid spacing in the vertical direction, the
dimensional-splitting time integration algorithm using the HEVI

applying the IMEX (implicit-explicit) Runge-Kutta method. The proposed model

with the contention that similar tasks should have the same number of total

neurons are added to the network such that the total number of neurons in each
layer of the network, including the shared representations with previous tasks
and individual task related representation, are equal for all tasks. The
weights that are redundant at the end of training each task are also pruned
through re-initialization, in order to be efficiently utilized in the

planet formation. Their low temperatures ($<$10 K) allow the formation of thick
icy dust mantles, which will be partially preserved in the future
protoplanetary disks, ultimately affecting the chemical composition of
planetary systems. Previous observations have shown that carbon- and
oxygen-bearing species, in particular CO, are heavily depleted in pre-stellar
cores due to the efficient molecular freeze-out onto the surface of cold dust
grains. However, N-bearing species such as NH$_3$ and, in particular, its
deuterated isotopologues, appear to maintain high abundances where CO molecules
are mainly in solid phase. Thanks to ALMA, we present here the first clear
observational evidence of NH$_2$D freeze-out toward the L1544 pre-stellar core,
suggestive of the presence of a""complete-depletion zone"" within a $\simeq$1800
au radius, in agreement with astrochemical pre-stellar core model predictions.
Our state-of-the-art chemical model coupled with a non-LTE radiative transfer
code demonstrates that NH$_2$D becomes mainly incorporated in icy mantles in
the central 2000 au and starts freezing-out already at $\simeq$7000 au.
Radiative transfer effects within the pre-stellar core cause the
NH$_2$D(1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$) emission to appear centrally concentrated, with a
flattened distribution within the central $\simeq$3000 au, unlike the 1.3 mm
dust continuum emission which shows a clear peak within the central
$\simeq$1800 au. This prevented NH$_2$D freeze-out to be detected in previous
observations, where the central 1000 au cannot be spatially resolved.

survey of the Galactic plane, in the course of which the existence of a
significant number of ($\sim$ 78) TeV $\gamma$-ray sources was confirmed, many
of which remain unidentified. HESS J1828-099 is a point-like (Gaussian stand.
dev. $<$ 0.07$^{\circ}$) unidentified source among the 17 confirmed point-like
sources in the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS) catalog. This source is
also unique because it does not seem to have any apparent association with any
object detected at other wavelengths. We investigate the nature and association
of HESS J1828-099 with multi-wavelength observational data. A high mass X-Ray
binary (HMXB) - comprising of pulsar XTE J1829-098 and a companion Be star -
has been observed earlier in the X-ray and infrared bands, 14$'$ away from HESS
J1828-099. With 12 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT $\gamma$-ray data, we explore
the possibility of 4FGL J1830.2-1005 being the GeV counterpart of HESS
J1828-099. Within the RXTE confidence region, a steep spectrum
($\alpha_{radio}$ = - 0.746 $\pm$ 0.284), plausible counterpart is detected in
data from existing radio frequency surveys. In this letter, we probe for the
first time using multi-wavelength data, whether HESS J1828-099, 4FGL
J1830.2-1005 and the HMXB system have a common origin. Our study indicates that
HESS J1828-099 might be a TeV high mass $\gamma$-ray binary source.

intelligent robots. To fulfill the real-time requirements in real-world
applications, it is necessary to efficiently segment the LiDAR scans. Most of
previous approaches directly project 3D point cloud onto the 2D spherical range
image so that they can make use of the efficient 2D convolutional operations
for image segmentation. Although having achieved the encouraging results, the
neighborhood information is not well-preserved in the spherical projection.
Moreover, the temporal information is not taken into consideration in the
single scan segmentation task. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel
approach to semantic segmentation for LiDAR sequences named Meta-RangeSeg,
where a new range residual image representation is introduced to capture the
spatial-temporal information. Specifically, Meta-Kernel is employed to extract
the meta features, which reduces the inconsistency between the 2D range image
coordinates input and 3D Cartesian coordinates output. An efficient U-Net
backbone is used to obtain the multi-scale features. Furthermore, Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM) strengthens the role of range channel and aggregates
features at different levels. We have conducted extensive experiments for
performance evaluation on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. The promising results
show that our proposed Meta-RangeSeg method is more efficient and effective
than the existing approaches. Our full implementation is publicly available at

(STGO) algorithm fused UAVs formation motion planning framework aided by an

the gaussian mixture model (GMM) and transmitted in the swarm. Resampling from
the received GMM contributes to a global map, which is used as the foundation
for consensus. Second, to improve flight safety, an active sensing system is
designed to plan the observation angle of each UAV considering the unknown
field, overlap of the field of view (FOV), velocity direction and smoothness of
yaw rotation, and this planning problem is solved by the distributed particle
swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. Last, for the formation motion planning,
to ensure obstacle avoidance, the formation structure is allowed for affine
transformation and is treated as the soft constraint on the control points of
the B-spline. Besides, the STGO is introduced to avoid local minima. The
combination of GMM communication and STGO guarantees a safe and strict
consensus between UAVs. Tests on different formations in the simulation show
that our algorithm can contribute to a strict consensus and has a success rate
of at least 80% for obstacle avoidance in a dense environment. Besides, the
active sensing system can increase the success rate of obstacle avoidance from
50% to 100% in some scenarios.

the depth of the quench from the liquid into the glass: \emph{simple aging}
($\tau\sim t_w$) applies for quenches close to the critical point of

However, most of the existing models mainly predict the passenger flow on

important to manage multi-traffic modes simultaneously and cooperatively. As an
important component of MaaS, short-term passenger flow prediction for
multi-traffic modes has thus been brought into focus. It is a challenging
problem because the spatiotemporal features of multi-traffic modes are
critically complex. Moreover, the passenger flows of multi-traffic modes
differentiate and fluctuate significantly. To solve these problems, this paper
proposes a multitask learning-based model, called Res-Transformer, for
short-term inflow prediction of multi-traffic modes (subway, taxi, and bus).
Each traffic mode is treated as a single task in the model. The Res-Transformer
consists of two parts: (1) several modified Transformer layers comprising the
conv-Transformer layer and the multi-head attention mechanism, which helps to
extract the spatial and temporal features of multi-traffic modes, (2) the
structure of residual network is utilized to obtain the correlations of
different traffic modes and prevent gradient vanishing, gradient explosion, and
overfitting. The Res-Transformer model is evaluated on two large-scale
real-world datasets from Beijing, China. One is the region of a traffic hub and
the other is the region of a residential area. Experiments are conducted to
compare the performance of the proposed model with several baseline models.
Results prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. This
paper can give critical insights into the short-term inflow prediction for
multi-traffic modes.

features of vascular networks may affect blood-flow dynamics, and to identify
particular characteristics that promote the onset of self-sustained

""redundancy"", in the form of a redundant vessel connecting two main
flow-branches, together with differences in haemodynamic resistance in the
branches, can promote the emergence of oscillatory dynamics. We use existing
mathematical descriptions for blood rheology and haematocrit splitting at
vessel branch-points to construct our flow model; we combine numerical
simulations and stability analysis to study the dynamics of the three-node
network and its relation to the system's multiple steady-state solutions.
While, for the case of equal inlet-pressure conditions, a ""trivial"" equilibrium
solution with no flow in the redundant vessel always exists, we find that it is
not stable when other, stable, steady-state attractors exist. In turn, these
""nontrivial"" steady-state solutions may undergo a Hopf bifurcation into an
oscillatory state. We use the branch diameter ratio, together with the inlet
haematocrit rate, to construct a two-parameter stability diagram that
delineates regimes in which such oscillatory dynamics exist. We show that flow
oscillations in this network geometry are only possible when the branch
diameters are sufficiently different to allow for a sufficiently large flow in
the redundant vessel, which acts as the driving force of the oscillations.
These microstructural properties, which were found to promote oscillatory
dynamics, could be used to explore sources of flow instability in biological
microvascular networks.

dielectrophoretic (DEP) force due to externally applied electrostatic forces
influence the behavior of micron sized particles significantly, in such

forces uniquely influences the behavior of uncharged or mildly charged airborne
particles, distinct from that with their individual influences. Uncharged
particle movements in a numerically fabricated well structured steady vortical
flow between two curved electrode surfaces are analyzed. Vortical air
circulation towards and away from the electrode tip enhances and deteriorates
electrostatic particulate capture on the electrodes, termed as co and counter
directions with respect to the electrostatic force on particles respectively.
Particles in counter vortices under an electric field reveals a rich variety of
unique behaviors due to the interplay of drag, inertia and DEP forces.
Distortion of the vortex structure due to convexity of electrode surfaces
results in an inverse inertial limit cycle trajectory trapping of particles;
with the airborne particles spatially segregated, trapping larger particles
further inside the vortex than the smaller particles.Value of a dimensionless
number $\xi_v$, the ratio of DEP force and particle inertia, represents the
combination of the operating flow and electric field strengths. Inertial
cut-off of particle capture in this configuration abruptly shift to DEP capture
at a critical value of $\xi_v\approx 0.2$, as its value increases. Selective
deposition of particles within a closed range of size and density, emerges due
to the interplay of vortex trapping, inertial expulsion and electrostatic
capture.

time oscillator is a particle model with mass that is on shell. Its internal
time can be treated as a self-adjoint operator. The displaced time and
displaced time rate of the oscillator obey an uncertainty relation resembling
the one between position and momentum, which is different from the usual
energy-time uncertainty relation. In addition, we demonstrate that a matter
field with proper time oscillators satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation. It has
properties of a zero-spin quantum field. The formulations adopted permits a
more symmetrical treatment between time and space in a matter field.

Superluminal Signaling. The criticism is based, among other things, on
arbitrarily postulated statement about invarience of direction of superluminal

of any grounds for such statement and confirms my original proof of the
impossibility of one-way superluminal signaling. The analysis also unveils many
other inconsistencies in the discussed note and shows that all its criticism is
unsubstantiated.

  products for POD-Galerkin and least-squares model reduction of compressible
  flows","preprint",,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Model reduction of the compressible Euler equations based on proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Galerkin orthogonality or least-squares
residual minimization requires the selection of inner product spaces in which
to perform projections and measure norms. The most popular choice is the
vector-valued L2({\Omega}) inner product space. This choice, however, yields
dimensionally-inconsistent reduced-order model (ROM) formulations which often
lack robustness. In this work, we try to address this weakness by studying a
set of dimensionally-consistent inner products with application to the
compressible Euler equations. First, we demonstrate that non-dimensional inner
products have a positive impact on both POD and Galerkin/least-squares ROMs.
Second, we further demonstrate that physics-based inner products based on
entropy principles result in drastically more accurate and robust ROM
formulations than those based on non-dimensional L2({\Omega}) inner products.As
test cases, we consider the following well-known problems: the one-dimensional
Sod shock tube, the two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and
two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence.
