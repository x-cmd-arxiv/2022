system is studied using a variety of nonlinear drivers and compared to previous
results obtained for a purely time-dependent sinusoidal driver [Phys. Plasmas
27, 113701 (2020)]. It is found that a nonlinear driver in the form of a
cnoidal square wave or a travelling wave driver produces a spectral response
that is closer to experimental observations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 085001
(2004)] than that predicted by the simple sinusoidal driver. Using a bispectral
analysis, we also firmly establish that the nature of the nonlinear
oscillations, due to the interaction between the periodic source and the
inherent collective mode of the system, is predominantly governed by a
three-wave mixing process. Furthermore, by studying the variation in the mixing
pattern, from a broad to a sparse frequency spectrum, as a function of the
driver frequency and its functional form, we propose a means of tailoring the
nature of such patterns. Our results could find useful applications in the
experimental interpretation and manipulation of nonlinear wave mixing patterns
in weakly nonlinear and dispersive plasma systems or similar phenomena in
neutral fluids.

accumulation of magnetic energy. However, in this paper we discuss the idea
that filaments will not erupt and will only deform when the stored magnetic
energy is released gradually. Combining high-quality observations from Solar
Dynamics Observatory and other instruments, we present the formation and
immediate deformation of a small filament (F1) in the active region (AR) 12760
on 28-30 April 2020. Before the filament formation, three successive dipoles
quickly emerged with separation motions in the center of AR 12760. Due to the
magnetic interaction between magnetic dipoles and pre-existing positive
polarities, coronal brightenings consequently appeared in the overlying
atmosphere. Subsequently, because of the continuous cancellation of magnetic
flux that happened around the adjacent ends of F1 and another nearby filament
(F2), the magnetic reconections occurred intermittently occurred between F1 and
F2. Finally, F1 lessened in the shear, and F2 became shorter. All the results
show that the formation of F1 was closely associated with intermittent
interactions between the sequence of emerging dipoles and pre-existing magnetic
polarities, and the immediate deformation of F1 was intimately related to
intermittent interactions between F1 and F2. We also suggest that the
intermittent magnetic interactions driven by the continuous magnetic activities
(magnetic-flux emergence, cancellation, and convergence) play an important role
in the formation and deformation of filaments.

greatly reduce the clarity and quality of the scene image. However, most
unsupervised single image deraining methods mainly focus on rain streak removal
by disregarding the fog, which leads to low-quality deraining performance. In
addition, the samples are rather homogeneous generated by these methods and
lack diversity, resulting in poor results in the face of complex rain scenes.
To address the above issues, we propose a novel Asymetric Cycle Generative and
Adversarial framework (ACGF) for single image deraining that trains on both
synthetic and real rainy images while simultaneously capturing both rain
streaks and fog features. ACGF consists of a Rain-fog2Clean (R2C)
transformation block and a Clean2Rain-fog (C2R) transformation block. The
former consists of parallel rain removal path and rain-fog feature extraction
path by the rain and derain-fog network and the attention rain-fog feature
extraction network (ARFE) , while the latter only contains a synthetic rain
transformation path. In rain-fog feature extraction path, to better
characterize the rain-fog fusion feature, we employ an ARFE to exploit the
self-similarity of global and local rain-fog information by learning the
spatial feature correlations. Moreover, to improve the translational capacity
of C2R and the diversity of models, we design a rain-fog feature decoupling and
reorganization network (RFDR) by embedding a rainy image degradation model and
a mixed discriminator to preserve richer texture details in synthetic rain
conversion path. Extensive experiments on benchmark rain-fog and rain datasets
show that ACGF outperforms state-of-the-art deraining methods. We also conduct
defogging performance evaluation experiments to further demonstrate the
effectiveness of ACGF.

decomposition approach. In this new framework, we model input data as unknown
linear transformations of some latent vectors drawn from a polytope. In this
sense, the article considers a semi-structured data model, in which the input
matrix is modeled as the product of a full column rank matrix and a matrix
containing samples from a polytope as its column vectors. The choice of
polytope reflects the presumed features of the latent components and their
mutual relationships. As the factorization criterion, we propose the
determinant maximization (Det-Max) for the sample autocorrelation matrix of the
latent vectors. We introduce a sufficient condition for identifiability, which
requires that the convex hull of the latent vectors contains the maximum volume
inscribed ellipsoid of the polytope with a particular tightness constraint.
Based on the Det-Max criterion and the proposed identifiability condition, we
show that all polytopes that satisfy a particular symmetry restriction qualify
for the PMF framework. Having infinitely many polytope choices provides a form
of flexibility in characterizing latent vectors. In particular, it is possible
to define latent vectors with heterogeneous features, enabling the assignment
of attributes such as nonnegativity and sparsity at the subvector level. The
article offers examples illustrating the connection between polytope choices
and the corresponding feature representations.

quantum non-locality, conspiracy and retro-causation. Such speculations are
rooted in a belief that setting dependence of hidden variables in a
probabilistic model, called a violation of measurement independence, would mean
a violation of experimenters freedom of choice. This belief is unfounded
because it is based on a questionable use of Bayes Theorem and on incorrect
causal interpretation of conditional probabilities. In Bell-local realistic
model, hidden variables describe only photonic beams created by a source, thus
they cannot depend on randomly chosen experimental settings. However, if hidden
variables describing measuring instruments are correctly incorporated into a
contextual probabilistic model a violation of inequalities and an apparent
violation of no-signaling reported in Bell tests can be explained without
evoking quantum nonlocality. Therefore, for us, a violation of Bell-CHSH
inequalities proves only that hidden variables have to depend on settings
confirming contextual character of quantum observables and an active role
played by measuring instruments. Bell thought that he had to choose between
nonlocality and the violation of experimenters freedom of choice. From two bad
choices he chose nonlocality. Today he would probably choose the violation of
statistical independence understood as contextuality.

we describe the development and application of a deep machine learning model
with a U-Net based architecture. Our model, Echofilter, was highly responsive
to the dynamic range of turbulence conditions and sensitive to the fine-scale
nuances in the boundary position, producing an entrained-air boundary line with
an average error of 0.33m on mobile downfacing and 0.5-1.0m on stationary

  Regression",,,,,"math.OC math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, recovering an unknown signal from quadratic measurements has gained
popularity because it includes many interesting applications as special cases
such as phase retrieval, fusion frame phase retrieval, and positive
operator-valued measure. In this paper, by employing the least squares approach
to reconstruct the signal, we establish the non-asymptotic statistical property
showing that the gap between the estimator and the true signal is vanished in
the noiseless case and is bounded in the noisy case by an error rate of
$O(\sqrt{p\log(1+2n)/n})$, where $n$ and $p$ are the number of measurements and
the dimension of the signal, respectively. We develop a gradient regularized
Newton method (GRNM) to solve the least squares problem and prove that it
converges to a unique local minimum at a superlinear rate under certain mild
conditions. In addition to the deterministic results, GRNM can reconstruct the
true signal exactly for the noiseless case and achieve the above error rate
with a high probability for the noisy case. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the GRNM performs nicely in terms of high order of recovery accuracy, faster
computational speed, and strong recovery capability.

problem, $m$ players cooperate to maximize their total reward from $K > m$
arms. However the players cannot communicate and are penalized (e.g. receive no
reward) if they pull the same arm at the same time. We ask whether it is
possible to obtain optimal instance-dependent regret $\tilde{O}(1/\Delta)$
where $\Delta$ is the gap between the $m$-th and $m+1$-st best arms. Such
guarantees were recently achieved in a model allowing the players to implicitly
communicate through intentional collisions.
  Surprisingly, we show that with no communication at all, such guarantees are
not achievable. In fact, obtaining the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/\Delta)$ regret for
some values of $\Delta$ necessarily implies strictly sub-optimal regret in
other regimes. Our main result is a complete characterization of the Pareto
optimal instance-dependent trade-offs that are possible with no communication.
Our algorithm generalizes that of Bubeck, Budzinski, and the second author. As
there, our algorithm succeeds even when feedback upon collision can be
corrupted by an adaptive adversary, thanks to a strong no-collision property.
Our lower bound is based on topological obstructions at multiple scales and is

phenomenon"" in random matrix theory. Specifically, it is possible to construct
pairs of random matrix models such that the limiting eigenvalue distributions
are connected by push-forward under an explicitly constructible map of the
plane to itself. In this paper, we argue that the analogous transformation at
the finite-$N$ level can be accomplished by applying an appropriate heat flow
to the characteristic polynomial of the first model.
  Let the ""second moment"" of a random polynomial $p$ denote the expectation
value of the square of the absolute value of $p.$ We find certain pairs of
random matrix models and we apply a certain heat-type operator to the
characteristic polynomial $p_{1}$ of the first model, giving a new polynomial
$q.$ We prove that the second moment of $q$ is equal to the second moment of
the characteristic polynomial $p_{2}$ of the second model. This result leads to
several conjectures of the following sort: when $N$ is large, the zeros of $q$
have the same bulk distribution as the zeros of $p_{2},$ namely the eigenvalues
of the second random matrix model. At a more refined level, we conjecture that,
as the characteristic polynomial of the first model evolves under the
appropriate heat flow, its zeros will evolve close to the characteristic curves
of a certain PDE. All conjectures are formulated in ""additive"" and
""multiplicative"" forms.
  As a special case, suppose we apply the standard heat operator for time $1/N$
to the characteristic polynomial $p$ of an $N\times N$ GUE matrix, giving a new
polynomial $q.$ We conjecture that the zeros of $q$ will be asymptotically
uniformly distributed over the unit disk. That is, the heat operator converts
the distribution of zeros from semicircular to circular.

\citet{si2020distributional} proposed distributionally robust OPE/L (DROPE/L)
to address this, but the proposal relies on inverse-propensity weighting, whose

increasing penetration of single-phase distributed generation and single-phase

The true definition of the unbalance metric needs phasor measurements of
network voltage and current. However, such phasor measurements are generally
not available in real life and as such approximate definitions are widely used
due to their simplicity. This work aims to compare the true voltage unbalance
definition and approximate unbalance metrics derived from phase voltage
magnitude, as phase voltage magnitudes are commonly measured by digital

simulations are performed for 161 Spanish distribution feeders with R/X ratios

metrics reasonably approximate the true unbalance for higher R/X ratios with a
varying load power factor in a DN. Furthermore, the approximate unbalance
metrics slightly improve for a low DN power factor due to the increase in DN
unbalance. Therefore, the phase magnitude-based unbalance metric can be
utilized for approximating DN unbalance.

  In Proposition 9.5 of loc.cit., it is claimed that this can be done in almost
all cases with only a few exceptions, but no detailed explanation or analysis
is given why this is true or when exactly this is possible. This paper works
out the missing details by examining the relevant determinants and giving a
complete description of the cases in which they are $d$-th powers in
$\mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, it turns out that these determinants are actually
already $1$ in many cases so that one can omit the scaling entirely -
particularly for large $q$, this may save some time in practical computations.

even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the

first-order method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems. To analyze
its iteration complexity, a recent work [arXiv:1901.08511] proposed an
interesting perspective that interprets the optimistic gradient method as an
approximation to the proximal point method. In this paper, we follow this
approach and distill the underlying idea of optimism to propose a generalized
optimistic method, which encompasses the optimistic gradient method as a
special case. Our general framework can handle constrained saddle point
problems with composite objective functions and can work with arbitrary norms
with compatible Bregman distances. Moreover, we also develop an adaptive line
search scheme to select the stepsizes without knowledge of the smoothness
coefficients. We instantiate our method with first-order, second-order and
higher-order oracles and give sharp global iteration complexity bounds. When
the objective function is convex-concave, we show that the averaged iterates of
our $p$-th-order method ($p\geq 1$) converge at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/N^\frac{p+1}{2})$. When the objective function is further
strongly-convex-strongly-concave, we prove a complexity bound of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{L_1}{\mu}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for our first-order method
and a bound of $\mathcal{O}((L_p
D^\frac{p-1}{2}/\mu)^{\frac{2}{p+1}}+\log\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for our
$p$-th-order method ($p\geq 2$) respectively, where $L_p$ ($p\geq 1$) is the
Lipschitz constant of the $p$-th-order derivative, $\mu$ is the strongly-convex
parameter, and $D$ is the initial Bregman distance to the saddle point.
Moreover, our line search scheme provably only requires an almost constant
number of calls to a subproblem solver per iteration on average, making our
first-order and second-order methods particularly amenable to implementation.

finite codes $Y$ which are subsets of $a^* B a^*$, where $a$ is a letter and

this approach need not be applied only to domains where the phenotype is a

such as binary vectors. Such simpler settings make it possible to characterize
expressive encodings theoretically: Across a variety of test problems,
expressive encodings are shown to achieve up to super-exponential convergence
speed-ups over the standard direct encoding. The conclusion is that, across
evolutionary computation areas as diverse as genetic programming,
neuroevolution, genetic algorithms, and theory, expressive encodings can be a
key to understanding and realizing the full power of evolution.

the Function as a Service approach), new challenges arise constantly for

environment that aims to ease application evolution and migration to the new

environment is to enable a more user friendly and abstract function and
workflow creation for complex FaaS applications. To this end, it bypasses
workflow description and function reuse limitations of the current FaaS
platforms, by providing an extendable, pattern-enriched palette of ready-made,
reusable functionality that can be combined in arbitrary ways. The environment
embeds seamless DevOps processes for generating the deployable artefacts (i.e.
functions and images) of the FaaS platform (Openwhisk). Annotation mechanisms
are also available for the developer to dictate diverse execution options or
management guidelines towards the deployment and operation stacks. The
evaluation is based on case studies of indicative scenarios, including
creating, registering and executing functions and flows based on the Node-RED
runtime, embedding of existing legacy code in a FaaS environment, parallelizing
a workload, collecting data at the edge and creating function orchestrators to
accompany the application. For the latter, a detailed argumentation is provided

many fascinating and challenging associated problems. Hex meshes vary in
complexity from structured to unstructured depending on application or domain

adjacent to exactly four hexes. Edges not satisfying this criteria are
considered singular and indicate an unstructured hex mesh. Singular edges join
together into singular curves that either form closed cycles, end on the mesh
boundary, or end at a singular node, a complex junction of more than two
singular curves. While all hex meshes with singularities are unstructured,
those with more complex singular nodes tend to have more distorted elements and
smaller scaled Jacobian values. In this work, we study the topology of singular
nodes. We show that all eight of the most common singular nodes are
decomposable into just singular curves. We further show that all singular
nodes, regardless of edge valence, are locally decomposable. Finally we
demonstrate these decompositions on hex meshes, thereby decreasing their
distortion and converting all singular nodes into singular curves. With this
decomposition, the enigmatic complexity of 3D singular nodes becomes
effectively 2D.

used for both exact and approximate solutions. While approximate learning
scales better with the number of variables, it can be computationally expensive

algorithm that performs parallel sampling on Candidate Parent Sets (CPSs), and
can be viewed as an extension of MINOBS which is a state-of-the-art algorithm
for structure learning from high dimensional data. The modified algorithm,
which we call Parallel Sampling MINOBS (PS-MINOBS), constructs the graph by
sampling CPSs for each variable. Sampling is performed in parallel under the
assumption the distribution of CPSs is half-normal when ordered by Bayesian
score for each variable. Sampling from a half-normal distribution ensures that
the CPSs sampled are likely to be those which produce the higher scores.
Empirical results show that, in most cases, the proposed algorithm discovers
higher score structures than MINOBS when both algorithms are restricted to the

connections and, consequently, systems' robustness is assessed in terms of how
fast their structure fragments into disconnected sub-systems. Yet, this
approach fails to capture how damage hinders the propagation of information
across scales, since system function can be degraded even in absence of
fragmentation -- e.g., pathological yet structurally integrated human brain.
Here, we probe the response to damage of dynamical processes on the top of
complex networks, to study how such an information flow is affected. We find
that removal of nodes central for network connectivity might have insignificant
effects, challenging the traditional assumption that structural metrics alone

completing their learning tasks. This paper presents a systematic framework for
adaptive scaffolding in Betty's Brain, a learning-by-teaching OELE for middle
school science, where students construct a causal model to teach a virtual
agent, generically named Betty. We evaluate the adaptive scaffolding framework
and discuss its implications on the development of more effective scaffolds for
SRL in OELEs. We detect key cognitive/metacognitive inflection points, i.e.,
instances where students' behaviors and performance change as they work on
their learning tasks. At such inflection points, Mr. Davis (a mentor agent) or
Betty (the teachable agent) provide conversational feedback, focused on
strategies to help students become productive learners. We conduct a classroom
study with 98 middle schoolers to analyze the impact of adaptive scaffolds on
students' learning behaviors and performance. Adaptive scaffolding produced
mixed results, with some scaffolds (viz., strategic hints that supported
debugging and assessment of causal models) being generally more useful to
students than others (viz., encouragement prompts). We also note differences in
learning behaviors of High and Low performers after receiving scaffolds.
Overall, our findings suggest how adaptive scaffolding in OELEs like Betty's

performers.

some critical applications, such as autonomous robotic suturing. Solving for
and controlling rope is difficult due to the complexity of rope physics and the
challenge of building fast and accurate models of deformable materials. While
more data-driven approaches have become more popular for finding controllers
that learn to do a single task, there is still a strong motivation for a
model-based method that could be used to solve a large variety of optimization
problems. Towards this end, we introduced compliant, position-based dynamics
(XPBD) to model rope-like objects. Using geometric constraints, the model can
represent the coupling of shear/stretch and bend/twist effects. Of crucial
importance is that our formulation is differentiable, which can solve parameter
estimation problems and improve the matching of rope physics to real-life
scenarios (i.e., the real-to-sim problem). For the generality of rope-like
objects, two different solvers are proposed to handle the inextensible and
extensible effects of varied material stiffness for the rope. We demonstrate
our framework's robustness and accuracy on real-to-sim experimental setups
using the Baxter robot and the da Vinci research kit (DVRK). Our work leads to
a new path for robotic manipulation of the deformable rope-like object taking

redundant relation context due to noisy or low-quality proposals. In fact,
invalid relation context usually indicates underlying scene misunderstanding

novel 3D attention-based relation module (ARM3D). It encompasses object-aware
relation reasoning to extract pair-wise relation contexts among qualified
proposals and an attention module to distribute attention weights towards
different relation contexts. In this way, ARM3D can take full advantage of the
useful relation context and filter those less relevant or even confusing
contexts, which mitigates the ambiguity in detection. We have evaluated the
effectiveness of ARM3D by plugging it into several state-of-the-art 3D object

of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. We
hypothesize that standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize well
to systematic distribution shifts and propose a compositional strategy to
address this. We compare an end-to-end strategy that maps strings to labels
with a compositional strategy that predicts the structure of the deterministic
finite-state automaton (DFA) that accepts the regular language. We
theoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes significantly
better than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement the
compositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict the
intermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empirical
results support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robust
generalization. Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantly
better than the theoretical lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieve

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms applied in small-scale

the growing number of agents. Some swarm intelligence algorithms simulate the
release and utilization mechanism of pheromones to control large-scale agent

in order to solve the large-scale multi-agent coordination problem. Pheromones
released by agents of PooL are defined as outputs of most reinforcement

The pheromone update mechanism can efficiently organize the information of all
agents and simplify the complex interactions among agents into low-dimensional
representations. Pheromones perceived by agents can be regarded as a summary of
the views of nearby agents which can better reflect the real situation of the
environment. Q-Learning is taken as our base model to implement PooL and PooL
is evaluated in various large-scale cooperative environments. Experiments show
agents can capture effective information through PooL and achieve higher

intervention power of the platform, the goal is to enforce balance in the
spread of content (e.g., news articles) among two groups of users through
constraints similar to those imposed by the Fairness Doctrine in the United
States in the past. Groups are characterized by different affiliations (e.g.,
political views) and have different preferences for content. We develop a
stylized framework that models intra- and intergroup content propagation under
homophily, and we formulate the platform's decision as an optimization problem
that aims at maximizing user engagement, potentially under fairness
constraints. Our main notion of fairness requires that each group see a mixture
of their preferred and non-preferred content, encouraging information
diversity. Promoting such information diversity is often viewed as desirable
and a potential means for breaking out of harmful echo chambers. We study the
solutions to both the fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware problems. We prove

However, due to different limitations of those solutions, e.g., template-based

  In this work, we develop a graph attentive neural network model that

methods have strong error detection abilities. Yet, existing KG embedding
methods may not be directly applicable to a PG due to its distinct

joint exploration of both text information and graph structure; (2) PG contains
a large number of attribute triples, in which attribute values are represented

obstacles and velocity obstacles, a distributed optimization problem with
probabilistic chance constraints is formulated for the stochastic multi-agent
system. Consequently, collision-free trajectories are generated under a
prescribed collision risk bound. Due to the existence of probabilistic and
disjunctive constraints, the distributed chance-constrained optimization
problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer program by introducing the binary

possible to execute the motion planning task in the velocity space instead of
the position space, which leads to smoother collision-free trajectories for
multi-agent systems and higher computational efficiency. Moreover, the risk of
potential collisions is bounded with this robust motion planning methodology.
To validate the effectiveness of the methodology, different scenarios for
multiple agents are investigated, and the simulation results clearly show that
the proposed approach can generate high-quality trajectories under a predefined

invaluable in understanding human emotions. Brain signals, though, manifest a
highly complex structure that makes processing and retrieving meaningful
features challenging, particularly of abstract constructs like affect.
Moreover, the performance of learning models is undermined by the limited
amount of available neuronal data and their severe inter-subject variability.
In this paper we extract efficient, personalized affective representations from
EEG signals during music listening. To this end, we employ music signals as a
supervisory modality to EEG, aiming to project their semantic correspondence
onto a common representation space. We utilize a bi-modal framework by
combining an LSTM-based attention model to process EEG and a pre-trained model
for music tagging, along with a reverse domain discriminator to align the
distributions of the two modalities, further constraining the learning process
with emotion tags. The resulting framework can be utilized for emotion
recognition both directly, by performing supervised predictions from either
modality, and indirectly, by providing relevant music samples to EEG input
queries. The experimental findings show the potential of enhancing neuronal
data through stimulus information for recognition purposes and yield insights
into the distribution and temporal variance of music-induced affective
features.

understand the quantum nature of the atom-light interaction. We transform two
kinds of extended quantum Rabi model, anisotropic Rabi model and asymmetric
Rabi model, into rotating frame, and regard them as periodically driven quantum
systems. The analytical solutions of the quasi-energy spectrum as well as the
Floquet modes for both models are constructed by applying the Floquet theory
and the high-frequency expansion, which is applied to the non-stroboscopic
dynamics of physical observables such as atomic inversion, transverse
magnetization, atom-field correlation, etc. For anisotropic Rabi model, the
quasi energy fits well with the numerical results even when the rotating-wave
coupling is in the deep-strong coupling regime $g\simeq\hbar\omega$ if the
counterrotating terms is small enough compared to the driving frequency.
Avoided level crossing may occur for quasi energy with the same parity when the
positive branch spectrum lines for the total excitation number $N$ cross the
negative branch lines for $N+2$, while the high frequency expansion fails to
predict this due to the conservation of the total excitation number.
Furthermore, we present analytical and numerical study of the long-time
evolution of population and figure out the analytical method is credible for
the population dynamics. For asymmetric Rabi model, we find that the external
bias field which breaks the parity symmetry of total excitation number tends to
cluster the upper and lower branches into two bundles, and the detuning induced
gap in the first temporal Brillouin zone shows a quadratic dependence on the
bias. Both models prove that treating the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame by
Floquet theory gives an alternative tool in the study of interaction between
atom and light.

Herein, we report that a network formation process in a dilute system is a

forms a monophase structure at the percolation threshold, eventually separates
into two gel phases in a longer time scale as the network formation progresses.
The dilute hydrogel with GGPS exhibits an unexpected mesoscale co-continuous

of GGPS and a cosmic large-scale structure is analogous, in terms of attractive
interactions in a diluted system driving phase separation. This unique

over-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient
model that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an
attention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial
Propagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation
model (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different
distances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these
parts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion
suppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to
prevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the
computational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the
amount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar
accuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the
performance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms
other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation
by the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2
dataset as well.

SU(2)xU(1) extension of the Abelian Landau-Ginzburg theory, which could be
viewed as an effective theory of ferromagnetic superconductivity made of
spin-up and spin-down doublet Cooper pair. Just like the Abelian
Landau-Ginzburg theory it has the U(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new
ingredient is the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge interaction between the spin doublet
Cooper pair. A remarkable feature of the theory is the mixing between the
photon and the diagonal part of the SU(2) gauge boson. After the mixing it has
massless gauge boson (the massless non-Abelian spinon) and massive gauge boson
(the massive photon), in addition to the massive off-diagonal gauge bosons (the
massive non-Abelian spinons) which induces the spin-flip interaction between
the spin up and down components of the Cooper pair. So, unlike the ordinary
Landau-Ginzburg theory it has a long range interaction mediated by the massless
non-Abelian spinon, which could be responsible for the long range magnetic
order and spin waves observed in ferromagnetic superconductors. The theory is
characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by
the mass of the Higgs field it has two different penetration lengths, the one
fixed by the mass of the photon (which generates the well known Meissner
effect) and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal spinons (which
determines the scale of the spin flip interaction). The non-Abelian structure
of the theory naturally accommodates new topological objects, the non-Abrikosov
quantized spin vortex (as well as the well known Abrikosov vortex) and
non-Abelian spin monopole. We discuss the physical implications of the

Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) or the denoising equation

It tries to
automatically separate instances into coherent subsets. As one of the most

consider the probability of each sample in a possible cluster. To this end,
this paper generalizes k-means to model the distribution of clusters. Our novel
clustering algorithm thus models the distributions of distances to centroids
over a threshold by Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in Extreme Value
Theory (EVT). Notably, we propose the concept of centroid margin distance, use
GPD to establish a probability model for each cluster, and perform a clustering
algorithm based on the covering probability function derived from GPD. Such a
GPD k-means thus enables the clustering algorithm from the probabilistic
perspective. Correspondingly, we also introduce a naive baseline, dubbed as
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) k-means. GEV fits the distribution of the block
maxima. In contrast, the GPD fits the distribution of distance to the centroid
exceeding a sufficiently large threshold, leading to a more stable performance
of GPD k-means. Notably, GEV k-means can also estimate cluster structure and
thus perform reasonably well over classical k-means. Thus, extensive
experiments on synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate that GPD
k-means outperforms competitors. The github codes are released in

lucrative low-cost battery options for large-scale and capacious energy storage
systems, have been garnering tremendous attention in recent years. However, due
to the scarcity of cathode materials that can condone the reversible
re-insertion of the large $\rm K$-ions at feasible capacities, the viability of
$\rm K$-ion batteries has been greatly undercut. In this paper, we explore a
potential cathode material in the $\rm K_2O$-$\rm Fe_2O_3$-$\rm MnO_2$ ternary
phase system, that not only demonstrates reversible $\rm K$-ion reinsertion but
also manifests relatively fast rate capabilities. The titled cathode compound,
$\rm K_{0.4}Fe_{0.5}Mn_{0.5}O_2$, demonstrates a reversible capacity of
approximately $\rm120 $ mAh g$^{-1}$ at $\rm 10$ hours of (dis)charge ($viz.$,
$\rm C/10$ rate) with $ca.$ $\rm 85$% of the capacity being retained at a $\rm
1$ hour of (dis)charge ($\rm 1 C$ rate) which is considered to be good capacity
retention. Additionally, both hard and soft X-rays have been employed to
unravel the mechanism by which $\rm K$-ion is reversibly inserted into $\rm
K_{0.4}Fe_{0.5}Mn_{0.5}O_2$. The results revealed a cumulative participation of
both manganese cations and oxygen anions in $\rm K_{0.4}Fe_{0.5}Mn_{0.5}O_2$
illustrating its potential as a high-capacity $\rm K$-ion battery cathode
material that relies on both anion and cation redox. Further development of
related high-capacity cathode compositions can be anticipated.

task in knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Prediction by
machine learning techniques such as contextual semantic embedding is a
promising direction, but the relevant research is still preliminary especially
for expressive ontologies in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In this paper, we
present a new subsumption prediction method named BERTSubs for classes of OWL
ontology. It exploits the pre-trained language model BERT to compute contextual
embeddings of a class, where customized templates are proposed to incorporate
the class context (e.g., neighbouring classes) and the logical existential
restriction. BERTSubs is able to predict multiple kinds of subsumers including
named classes from the same ontology or another ontology, and existential
restrictions from the same ontology. Extensive evaluation on five real-world
ontologies for three different subsumption tasks has shown the effectiveness of
the templates and that BERTSubs can dramatically outperform the baselines that
use (literal-aware) knowledge graph embeddings, non-contextual word embeddings
and the state-of-the-art OWL ontology embeddings.

solution for the evolution of PBH mass by accretion during this era, subject to
an initial condition. We also obtain an upper bound on the accretion efficiency
$\epsilon$ for $a \sim a_r$, where $a_r$ is the point of transition from the
early de Sitter era to the radiation era. Furthermore, we obtain numerical
solutions for the mass of a hypothetical PBH with initial mass 100 g assumed to
be formed at an epoch when the value of the Hubble parameter was, say, 1
km/s/Mpc. We consider three values of the accretion efficiency,
$\epsilon=0.23,0.5$, and $0.89$ for our study. The analysis reveals that the
mass of the PBH increases rapidly due to the accretion of radiation in the
early stages of its evolution. The accretion continues but its rate decreases
gradually with the evolution of the Universe. Finally, Hawking radiation comes
into play and the rate of evaporation surpasses the accretion rate so that the
PBH mass starts to decrease. As the Universe grows, evaporation becomes the
dominant phenomenon, and the mass of the PBH decreases at a faster rate. As
argued by Debnath and Paul, the evaporated mass of the PBHs might contribute
towards the dark energy budget of the late Universe.

downstream clinical tasks can be reliably performed. Quantifying the impact of
an image on the specific target tasks, also named as task amenability, is
needed. A task-specific IQA has recently been proposed to learn an
image-amenability-predicting controller simultaneously with a target task
predictor. This allows for the trained IQA controller to measure the impact an
image has on the target task performance, when this task is performed using the
predictor, e.g. segmentation and classification neural networks in modern
clinical applications. In this work, we propose an extension to this
task-specific IQA approach, by adding a task-agnostic IQA based on
auto-encoding as the target task. Analysing the intersection between
low-quality images, deemed by both the task-specific and task-agnostic IQA, may
help to differentiate the underpinning factors that caused the poor target task
performance. For example, common imaging artefacts may not adversely affect the
target task, which would lead to a low task-agnostic quality and a high
task-specific quality, whilst individual cases considered clinically
challenging, which can not be improved by better imaging equipment or
protocols, is likely to result in a high task-agnostic quality but a low
task-specific quality. We first describe a flexible reward shaping strategy
which allows for the adjustment of weighting between task-agnostic and
task-specific quality scoring. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed algorithm
using a clinically challenging target task of prostate tumour segmentation on
multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) images, from 850 patients. The
proposed reward shaping strategy, with appropriately weighted task-specific and
task-agnostic qualities, successfully identified samples that need

ionising and photodissociating photons is widely believed to play a central
role in shutting off accretion onto these stars. Understanding whether and how
this occurs is vital for predicting the final masses reached by these stars and
the form of the Pop III stellar initial mass function. To help us better
understand the impact of UV radiation from massive Pop III stars on the gas
surrounding them, we carry out high resolution simulations of the formation and
early evolution of these stars, using the AREPO moving-mesh code coupled with
the innovative radiative transfer module SPRAI. Contrary to most previous
results, we find that the ionising radiation from these stars is trapped in the
dense accretion disk surrounding them. Consequently, the inclusion of radiative
feedback has no significant impact on either the number or the total mass of
protostars formed during the 20 kyr period that we simulate. We show that the
reason that we obtain qualitatively different results from previous studies of
Pop III stellar feedback lies in how the radiation is injected into the
simulation. HII region trapping only occurs if the photons are injected on
scales smaller than the local scale height of the accretion disk, a criterion
not fulfilled in previous 3D simulations of this process. Finally, we speculate
as to whether outflows driven by the magnetic field or by Lyman-alpha radiation
pressure may be able to clear enough gas away from the star to allow the HII
region to escape from the disk.

t-out-of-n redactable signature scheme. This scheme has a signer, n redactors,
a combiner, and a verifier. The signer designates n redactors and a combiner in
advance and generates a signature of a message M. Each redactor decides parts
that he or she wants to remove from the message and generates a piece of
redaction information. The combiner collects pieces of redaction information
from all redactors, extracts parts of the message that more than t redactors
want to remove, and generate a redacted message. We consider the one-time
redaction model which allows redacting signatures generated by the signer only
once. We formalize the one-time redaction t-out-of-n redactable signature
scheme, define security, and give a construction using the pairing based
aggregate signature scheme in the random oracle model.

building block to construct privacy-preserving schemes such as anonymous
credentials, group signatures or ring signatures. However, the security of this
signature scheme relies on the interactive assumption called the LRSW
assumption. Even if the interactive assumptions are proven in the generic group
model or bilinear group model, the concerns about these assumptions arise in a
cryptographic community. This fact caused a barrier to the use of cryptographic
schemes whose security relies on these assumptions. Recently, Pointcheval and
Sanders proposed the modified Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme in CT-RSA
2018. This scheme satisfies the EUF-CMA security under the new q-type
assumption called the Modified-q-Strong Diffie-Hellman-2 (q-MSDH-2) assumption.
However, the size of a q- type assumptions grows dynamically and this fact
leads to inefficiency of schemes. In this work, we revisit the
Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature-based synchronized aggregate signature scheme
in FC 2013. This scheme is one of the most efficient synchronized aggregate
signature schemes with bilinear groups. However, the security of this
synchronized aggregate scheme was proven under the one-time LRSW assumption in
the random oracle model. We give the new security proof for this synchronized
aggregate scheme under the 1-MSDH-2 (static) assumption in the random oracle
model with little loss of efficiency.

salt-driven dielectric decrement beyond weak-coupling (WC) electrostatics. The
WC approximation of prior formalisms is relaxed by treating the salt charges
via a virial expansion. This virial approach enables the explicit inclusion of
the many-body salt-solvent interactions, and directly leads to the
experimentally observed linear decay of the electrolyte permittivity with added
dilute salt. The permittivity formula emerging from our approach indicates that
the reduction of the solvent permittivity is induced by the salt screening of
the polarization charges suppressing the dielectric response of the solvent. By
comparison with experiments, we also show that the salt-dressed permittivity
formula can equally reproduce the attenuation of the electrolyte permittivity
with rising temperature, the thermal decay of the dielectric decrement, and its
intensification with the salt valency. The consistent qualitative agreement of
our theory with this wide range of experimental trends points out the
electrostatic ion-solvent correlations as the primary mechanism behind the
salt-induced dielectric decrement.

of applications, including in-situ soil stabilization. However, the reliability

particular, bacterial growth, bacterial activity, and precipitation kinetics
all depend on temperature. Batch test and microfluidic chip experiments were
performed in this study to investigate the effects of temperature on bacterial
density and activity and the MICP processes occurring at different temperatures
(4-50{\deg}C). Spatial and temporal variations in the formation and development
of calcium carbonate precipitates, including their amount, type, growth rate,
formation, and deformation characteristics, were monitored. Results show that
different types of calcium carbonate precipitates with varying sizes and
quantities were produced by varying the temperature. Low temperature (4{\deg}C)
did not reduce bacterial activity, but limited the final amount of cementation;
low temperature reduced bacterial growth and attachment ratio, as well as
calcium carbonate precipitation rate. High temperature (50{\deg}C) conditions
significantly reduced bacterial activity within a short period of time, whilst
a repeated injection of bacteria before every two injections of cementation
solution increased the final amount of cementation. The findings made from this

mixing-limited reactive transport systems is developed and applied. A key
complication with upscaled models in this setting is that the procedure must
differentiate between interface spreading, driven by the spatially variable
velocity field, and mixing, in which components contact one another and react.
Our model captures the enhanced mixing caused by spreading through use of a
time-dependent effective dispersion term. The early-time behavior of this
dispersion is driven by flow kinematics, while at late times it reaches a
Taylor-dispersion-like limit. The early-time behavior is modeled here using a
very fast (purely advective) particle tracking procedure, while late-time
effects are estimated from scaling arguments. The only free parameter in the
model is the asymptotic effective dispersion. This quantity is determined for a
few cases by calibrating 1D results to reference 2D results. For most cases, it
is estimated using a fit involving a dimensionless grouping of system
variables. Numerical results for bimolecular reaction systems are generated
using a pseudo-spectral approach capable of resolving fronts at high Peclet
numbers. Results are presented for two different types of 2D velocity fields
over a wide range of parameters. The upscaled model is shown to provide highly
accurate results for conversion factor, along with reasonable approximations of
the spatial distribution of reaction occurrence. The model is also shown to be
valid for non-reacting systems, and results for such cases can be used in the
calibration step to achieve computational savings.

constant precoding matrix is applied to a block of symbol slots within a
channel coherence interval, thus significantly reducing the computational costs
over traditional CI-based symbol-level precoding (CI-SLP) as the CI-BLP
optimization problem only needs to be solved once per block. For both PSK and
QAM modulation, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum CI
effect over the block subject to a block- rather than symbol-level power

function of the Lagrange multipliers in closed form. By formulating the dual
problem, the original CI-BLP optimization problem is further shown to be
equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) optimization. Numerical results
validate our derivations, and show that the proposed CI-BLP scheme achieves
improved performance over the traditional CI-SLP method, thanks to the relaxed
power constraint over the considered block of symbol slots.

sophisticated schemes enhancing MG stability can be deployed. However, the
deployment of `smart' assets increases the threat surface. Power systems
possess mechanisms capable of detecting abnormal operations. Furthermore, the
lack of sophistication in attack strategies can render them detectable since
they blindly violate power system semantics. On the other hand, the recent
increase of process-aware rootkits that can attain persistence and compromise
operations in undetectable ways requires special attention. In this work, we
investigate the steps followed by stealthy rootkits at the process level of

aggregation of system-specific information to build a neural network-based

biopolymer network. Here, we computationally explore this issue in-depth by
explicitly modeling three-dimensional biopolymer networks and performing
Langevin dynamics simulations of active diffusion of the self-propelled tracers
therein. We show that the active tracer performs distinct diffusion dynamics
depending on the mesh-to-particle size and P\'eclet number (Pe). When the
particle is smaller than the mesh size, it moves as if in free space with a
decreased mobility depending on the polymer occupation density and Pe. However,
when the particle size is increased to be comparable to the mesh size, the
active particles explore the polymer network using the trapped-and-hopping
mechanism. We study the trapped time distribution, flight length distribution,
the mean-squared displacement, and the long-time diffusivity at varying Pe. If
the particle is larger than the mesh, it captures the collective viscoelastic
dynamics from the polymer network at short times and the simple diffusion of
the total system at large times. Finally, we discuss the scaling behavior of
the long-time diffusivity with Pe, where we find a range of Pe that yields a
nontrivial power law. The latter turns out to arise from a large fluctuation of
trapped, activated tracers in conjugation with responsive polymer networks.

also have implications for the $\sigma_8$ tension between early and late time
probes of matter clustering. The effects of LiMRs on the Cosmic Microwave

investigated extensively. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the
effects of LiMRs on smaller, nonlinear scales using cosmological $N$-body
simulations; focusing on quantities relevant for photometric galaxy surveys.
For most of our study, we use a particular model of nonthermal LiMRs but the
methods developed easily generalize to a large class of models of LiMRs -- we
explicitly demonstrate this by considering the Dodelson-Widrow form of the
velocity distribution. We find that, in general, the effects of LiMR on small
scales are distinct from those of a $\Lambda$CDM universe, even when the value
of $\sigma_8$ is matched between the models. We show that weak lensing
measurements around massive clusters, between $\sim 0.1 h^{-1}$Mpc and $\sim 10
h^{-1}$Mpc, should have sufficient signal-to-noise in future surveys to
distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and LiMR models that are tuned to fit both CMB
data and large (linear) scale structure data at late times. Furthermore, we
find that different LiMR cosmologies which are indistinguishable by
conventional linear probes can be distinguished by these probes if their
velocity distributions are sufficiently different. LiMR models can, therefore,
be best tested and constrained by jointly analyzing data from CMB and late-time
structure formation on both large \textit{and} small scales.

elicits faults undetectable by vibration monitoring alone and enhances the
vibration signal analysis of rotating machines. Optical, magnetic or mechanical
Tachometers are currently state-of-art. Their limitations are they require
line-of-sight, direct access to the rotating object. This paper proposes
RFTacho, a rotation speed measurement \emph{system} that leverages novel
hardware and signal processing algorithms to produce highly accurate readings
conveniently. RFTacho uses RF Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) waves to measure
rotation speed of multiple machines simultaneously with no requirements from
the machine's properties. OAM antennas allow it to operate in high-scattering
environments, commonly found in industries, as they are resilient to
de-polarization compared to linearly polarized antennas. RFTacho achieves this
by using two novel signal processing algorithms to extract the rotation speed
of several rotating objects simultaneously amidst noise arising from
high-scattering environments, non-line-of-sight scenarios and dynamic
environmental conditions with a resolution of $1 rpm$. We test RFTacho on
several real-world machines like fans, motors, air conditioners. Results show
that RFTacho has avg. error of $<0.5\%$ compared to ground truth. We
demonstrate RFTacho's simultaneous multiple-object measurement capability that
other tachometers do not have. Initial experiments show that RFTacho can
measure speeds as high as 7000 rpm (theoretically 60000 rpm) with high
resiliency at different coverage distances and orientation angles, requiring
only 150 mW transmit power while operating in the 5 GHz license-exempt band.
RFTacho is the first RF-based sensing system that combines OAM waves and novel
processing approaches to measure the rotation speed of multiple machines
simultaneously in a non-intrusive way.

early training; (ii) dynamic sparsity, by allowing the sparse subnetwork to
adaptively adjust its connectivity pattern (while sticking to the same sparsity
ratio) throughout training. We find both static and dynamic sparse methods to
yield win-win: substantially shrinking the robust generalization gap and
alleviating the robust overfitting, meanwhile significantly saving training and
inference FLOPs. Extensive experiments validate our proposals with multiple
network architectures on diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and

  Communications using Deep Neural Networks","9 pages; 11 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in a variety of
traditional radiofrequency (RF) problems. Previous work has shown that while
DNN classifiers are typically more accurate than traditional signal processing
algorithms, they are vulnerable to intentionally crafted adversarial
perturbations which can deceive the DNN classifiers and significantly reduce
their accuracy. Such intentional adversarial perturbations can be used by RF
communications systems to avoid reactive-jammers and interception systems which
rely on DNN classifiers to identify their target modulation scheme. While
previous research on RF adversarial perturbations has established the
theoretical feasibility of such attacks using simulation studies, critical
questions concerning real-world implementation and viability remain unanswered.
This work attempts to bridge this gap by defining class-specific and
sample-independent adversarial perturbations which are shown to be effective
yet computationally feasible in real-time and time-invariant. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of these attacks over-the-air across a physical channel using
software-defined radios (SDRs). Finally, we demonstrate that these adversarial
perturbations can be emitted from a source other than the communications
device, making these attacks practical for devices that cannot manipulate their
transmitted signals at the physical layer.

resting-state studies have been used to obtain information about the
spontaneous activations inside the brain. One of the approaches for analysis
and interpretation of resting-state fMRI data require spatially and
functionally homogenous parcellation of the whole brain based on underlying
temporal fluctuations. Clustering is often used to generate functional
parcellation. However, major clustering algorithms, when used for fMRI data,
have their limitations. Among commonly used parcellation schemes, a tradeoff
exists between intra-cluster functional similarity and alignment with
anatomical regions. Approach: In this work, we present a clustering algorithm
for resting state and task fMRI data which is developed to obtain brain
parcellations that show high structural and functional homogeneity. The
clustering is performed by multistage binary k-means clustering algorithm
designed specifically for the 4D fMRI data. The results from this multistage
k-means algorithm show that by modifying and combining different algorithms, we
can take advantage of the strengths of different techniques while overcoming
their limitations. Results: The clustering output for resting state fMRI data
using the multistage k-means approach is shown to be better than simple k-means
or functional atlas in terms of spatial and functional homogeneity. The
clusters also correspond to commonly identifiable brain networks. For task
fMRI, the clustering output can identify primary and secondary activation
regions and provide information about the varying hemodynamic response across
different brain regions. Conclusion: The multistage k-means approach can
provide functional parcellations of the brain using resting state fMRI data.
The method is model-free and is data driven which can be applied to both
resting state and task fMRI.

$\mathscr{P}$-rectifiability in Carnot groups. We say that a Radon measure is
$\mathscr{P}_h$-rectifiable, for $h\in\mathbb N$, if it has positive $h$-lower
density and finite $h$-upper density almost everywhere, and, at almost every
point, it admits a unique tangent measure up to multiples. In this paper we
prove a Marstrand--Mattila rectifiability criterion in arbitrary Carnot groups
for $\mathscr{P}$-rectifiable measures with tangent planes that admit a normal
complementary subgroup. Namely, in this co-normal case, even if a priori the
tangent planes at a point might not be the same at different scales, a
posteriori the measure has a unique tangent almost everywhere.
  Since every horizontal subgroup of a Carnot group has a normal complement,
our criterion applies in the particular case in which the tangents are
one-dimensional horizontal subgroups. Hence, as an immediate consequence of our
Marstrand--Mattila rectifiability criterion and a result of
Chousionis--Magnani--Tyson, we obtain the one-dimensional Preiss's theorem in
the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^1$. More precisely, we show that a Radon
measure $\phi$ on $\mathbb H^1$ with positive and finite one-density with
respect to the Koranyi distance is absolutely continuous with respect to the
one-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^1$, and it is supported on a
one-rectifiable set in the sense of Federer, i.e., it is supported on the
countable union of the images of Lipschitz maps from $A\subseteq \mathbb R$ to
$\mathbb H^1$.

such a model for improving the prediction performance for those stocks. The

called influence network and uses a set of history-based prediction models to
infer plausible initial labels for a subset of the stock nodes in the graph.
Finally, GCNET uses the Graph Convolutional Network algorithm to analyze this
partially labeled graph and predicts the next price direction of movement for
each stock in the graph. GCNET is a general prediction framework that can be
applied for the prediction of the price fluctuations of interacting stocks
