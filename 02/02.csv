exact form of $F$ is not known.
  This article shows that there are large classes of $F$ where almost all $F$
share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces
$\mathcal{F}$ of $C^1$ functions $F:\mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^M$ that satisfy
the following condition: $\mathcal{F}$ has ``almost constant rank'' (ACR) if
there is a constant integer $\rho(\mathcal{F}) \geq 0$ such that
rank$(DF(p))=\rho(\mathcal{F})$ for ``almost every'' $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and
almost every $p\in\mathbb{R}^N$. If the vector space $\mathcal{F}$ is
finite-dimensional, then ``almost every'' is with respect to Lebesgue measure
on $\mathcal{F}$, and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of
prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for
modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions
in $\mathcal{F}$ are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if $\mathcal{F}$
is the set of all functions in a ``structured system'', then $\mathcal{F}$ is
ACR. For each $F$ and $p$, the solution set of $p \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is
  SolSet$(p):= \{x: F(x)=F(p)\}.$ A solution set of $F(p)=c$ is called robust
if it persists despite small changes in $F$ and $c$. The following two global
results are proved for almost every $F$ in an ACR vector space $\mathcal{F}$:
(1) Either the solution set SolSet$(p)$ is robust for almost every $p\in
\mathbb{R}^N$, or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set
SolSet$(p)$ is a $C^\infty$-manifold of dimension $d = N-\rho(\mathcal{F})$. In
particular, $d$ is the same for almost every $F \in \mathcal{F}$.

learning to provide model explicability and data efficiency. It has been used
to learn dynamics, solve inverse problems and facilitate design, and is at its
inception of impact. Current successes have concentrated on general physics
models such as rigid bodies, deformable sheets, etc., assuming relatively
simple structures and forces. Their granularity is intrinsically coarse and
therefore incapable of modelling complex physical phenomena. Fine-grained
models are still to be developed to incorporate sophisticated material
structures and force interactions with gradient-based learning. Following this
motivation, we propose a new differentiable fabrics model for composite
materials such as cloths, where we dive into the granularity of yarns and model
individual yarn physics and yarn-to-yarn interactions. To this end, we propose
several differentiable forces, whose counterparts in empirical physics are
indifferentiable, to facilitate gradient-based learning. These forces, albeit
applied to cloths, are ubiquitous in various physical systems. Through
comprehensive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate our model's
explicability in learning meaningful physical parameters, versatility in
incorporating complex physical structures and heterogeneous materials,
data-efficiency in learning, and high-fidelity in capturing subtle dynamics.

parameterizations of diffusion models that provide increased stability when
using few sampling steps. Second, we present a method to distill a trained

a FID of 3.0 on CIFAR-10 in 4 steps. Finally, we show that the full progressive

This paper introduces a novel approach for solving sequences of closely related

The formal guarantees of the proposed algorithms are established through the

computational experiments, which demonstrate upwards of 75x-improvements over
exact factorization run-times on fully dense matrices with over one million
entries. A significant advantage of the methodology is that the length of any

the size of the inputs without having to resort to greatest common divisor
operations, which are required by and thereby hinder an efficient

In this paper, we present a new 1D method for modelling pebble growth and
chemistry simultaneously. Gas and small dust particles are allowed to diffuse
vertically, connecting chemistry at all elevations of the disk. Pebbles are
assumed to form from the dust present around the midplane, inheriting the
composition of ices at this location. We present the results of this model
after 1 Myr of disk evolution around a 1$M_\odot$ star at various locations
both inside and outside of the CO snowline. We find that for a turbulent disk
($\alpha = 10^{-3}$), CO is depleted from the surface layers of the disk by
roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude, consistent with observations of protoplanetary
disks. This is achieved by a combination of ice sequestration and decreasing UV
opacity, both driven by pebble growth. Further, we find the selective removal
of ice species via pebble growth and sequestration can increase gas phase C/O
ratios to values of approximately unity. However, our model is unable to
produce C/O values of $\sim$1.5-2.0 inferred from protoplanetary disk
observations, implying selective sequestration of ice is not sufficient to
explain C/O ratios $>1$.

gathering pace. Doubling the capacity of Paris-CDG airport has been halted,
even with the upcoming Olympic Games, until hydrogen powered planes can be
used. It is thus timely to work on catalytic selective hydrogen production and
optimise catalyst structure. Over 90 % of all chemical manufacture uses a solid
catalyst. This work describes adsorption of carbon-monoxide (CO) on platinum
thin films, supported by cheap Al(111). CO reacts with water to produce
hydrogen (water-gas shift). Quantum Monte Carlo methods are the only ones
accurate enough to investigate the early steps of this catalysed reaction at
close-packed Pt/Al(111).
  Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the
key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. Since bond-breaking is
poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site
approach is used This work demonstrates a novel Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
methodology.
  The water-gas shift reaction step studied is water addition to CO
pre-adsorbed on a Pt-monolayer supported by Al(111). The water molecule is only
partially dissociated. Its oxygen atom binds to CO giving adsorbed COOH and
Pt-H. This concerted addition is rate-limiting. In subsequent steps, the
adsorbed formate species (with acidic hydrogen) decomposes to carbon dioxide
and, after proton migration to Pt-H, the clean product H$_2$ is obtained.
  The QMC activation barrier found is 64.8 $\pm$ 1.5 kJ/mol. Thus, QMC is shown
to be encouraging for investigating similar catalytic systems.

Testable properties are well understood in the dense model and in the bounded

  We prove that for any proper minor-closed class $\mathcal{G}$, any monotone

can discover appropriate representations capable of harnessing the underlying
symmetries of their inputs is thus crucial in machine learning and
neuroscience. Convolutional neural networks, for example, were designed to
exploit translation symmetry and their capabilities triggered the first wave of
deep learning successes. However, learning convolutions directly from
translation-invariant data with a fully-connected network has so far proven
elusive. Here, we show how initially fully-connected neural networks solving a
discrimination task can learn a convolutional structure directly from their
inputs, resulting in localised, space-tiling receptive fields. These receptive
fields match the filters of a convolutional network trained on the same task.
By carefully designing data models for the visual scene, we show that the
emergence of this pattern is triggered by the non-Gaussian, higher-order local
structure of the inputs, which has long been recognised as the hallmark of
natural images. We provide an analytical and numerical characterisation of the
pattern-formation mechanism responsible for this phenomenon in a simple model
and find an unexpected link between receptive field formation and tensor
decomposition of higher-order input correlations. These results provide a new
perspective on the development of low-level feature detectors in various

robust high-order accurate nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes. The main
strategy is to construct compatible low order finite volume (FV) type
discretizations that allow for convex blending with the high-order variant with
the goal of guaranteeing additional properties, such as bounds on physical
quantities and/or guaranteed entropy dissipation. For an implementation of this
main strategy, four main ingredients are identified that may be combined in a
flexible manner: (i) a nodal high-order DG method on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto
nodes, (ii) a compatible robust subcell FV scheme, (iii) a convex combination
strategy for the two schemes, which can be element-wise or subcell-wise, and
(iv) a strategy to compute the convex blending factors, which can be either
based on heuristic troubled-cell indicators, or using ideas from flux-corrected
transport methods.
  By carefully designing the metric terms of the subcell FV method, the
resulting methods can be used on unstructured curvilinear meshes, are locally
conservative, can handle strong shocks efficiently while directly guaranteeing
physical bounds on quantities such as density, pressure or entropy. We further
show that it is possible to choose the four ingredients to recover existing
methods such as a provably entropy dissipative subcell shock-capturing approach
or a sparse invariant domain preserving approach.
  We test the versatility of the presented strategies and mix and match the
four ingredients to solve challenging simulation setups, such as the KPP

(domains with small holes removed from the interior) is a topic of considerable
current interest. Applications include intracellular diffusive transport and
the spread of pollutants or heat from localized sources. In a previous paper,
we introduced a new method for characterizing the approach to steady-state in
the case of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. This was based on a local measure
of the relaxation rate known as the accumulation time $T(\x)$. The latter was
calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a
combination of matched asymptotics and Green's function methods. We thus
obtained an asymptotic expansion of $T(\x)$ in powers of $\nu=-1/\ln \epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ specifies the relative size of the holes. In this paper, we
develop the corresponding theory for three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. The
analysis is a non-trivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the
singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green's function. In particular, the
asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace
space involves terms of order $O((\epsilon/s)^n)$, where $s$ is the Laplace
variable. These $s$-singularities have to be removed by partial series
resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of $T(\x)$ in powers of
$\epsilon$.

dichalcogenides that, unlike previous proposals involving the Quantum Hall
regime in graphene, requires weaker magnetic fields and does not rely on
interactions. The encapsulation induces strong spin-orbit coupling on the
graphene bilayer, which opens a sizeable gap and stabilizes fragile pairs of

the world consists of nothing but a vast number of partial views of its past.
Each view is associated to an event, and is a representation of the immediate
causal past of that event. These consists mainly of processes that transfer
energy, momentum and other charges to it from its past events.
  There is fundamentally no space or spacetime, just a large number of events,
which are the causes of events to come. This is a development of energetic
causal set theories, developed with Marina Cortes.
  Momentum and energy are fundamental, and are conserved under their
transformation from present events to future events. As a result Minkowski
spacetime emerges, in a way that preserves causal relations. The locality of
events as constructed in the emergent spacetime is a consequence of the
conservation of energy-momentum fundamentally.
  In this paper we propose that the views of events can be represented in terms
of degrees of freedom on punctured two surfaces-each puncture corresponding to
an immediate past event. This opens up to the use of mathematical tools from
twistor theory and the nascent area of celestial spheres. We show that This
makes possible versions of the theory that are relativistically invariant.

  Hyperparameter Optimization for Embedded Feature Selection in
  High-Dimensional Data with Very Small Sample Sizes",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Embedded feature selection in high-dimensional data with very
small sample sizes requires optimized hyperparameters for the model building
process. For this hyperparameter optimization, nested cross-validation must be
applied to avoid a biased performance estimation. The resulting repeated
training with high-dimensional data leads to very long computation times.
Moreover, it is likely to observe a high variance in the individual performance
evaluation metrics caused by outliers in tiny validation sets. Therefore, early
stopping applying standard pruning algorithms to save time risks discarding
promising hyperparameter sets.
  Result: To speed up feature selection for high-dimensional data with tiny
sample size, we adapt the use of a state-of-the-art asynchronous successive
halving pruner. In addition, we combine it with two complementary pruning
strategies based on domain or prior knowledge. One pruning strategy immediately
stops computing trials with semantically meaningless results for the selected
hyperparameter combinations. The other is a new extrapolating threshold pruning
strategy suitable for nested-cross-validation with a high variance of
performance evaluation metrics. In repeated experiments, our combined pruning
strategy keeps all promising trials. At the same time, the calculation time is
substantially reduced compared to using a state-of-the-art asynchronous
successive halving pruner alone. Up to 81.3\% fewer models were trained
achieving the same optimization result.
  Conclusion: The proposed combined pruning strategy accelerates data analysis
or enables deeper searches for hyperparameters within the same computation
time. This leads to significant savings in time, money and energy consumption,

several sinusoidal components (deterministic signal), blended together with
trends and additive noise. The performance of the PQCs is compared against that
of classical bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our
results show that for time series signals consisting of small amplitude noise
variations (up to 40 per cent of the amplitude of the deterministic signal)
PQCs, with only a few parameters, perform similar to classical BiLSTM networks,
with thousands of parameters, and outperform them for signals with higher
amplitude noise variations. Thus, QNNs can be used effectively to model time
series having, at the same time, the significant advantage of being trained
significantly faster than a classical machine learning model in a quantum

  with Type Reporting",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian persuasion studies how an informed sender should partially disclose
information so as to influence the behavior of self-interested receivers. In
the last years, a growing attention has been devoted to relaxing the assumption
that the sender perfectly knows receiver's payoffs. The first crucial step
towards such an achievement is to study settings where each receiver's payoffs
depend on their unknown type, which is randomly determined by a known
finite-supported probability distribution. This begets considerable
computational challenges, as computing a sender-optimal signaling scheme is
inapproximable up to within any constant factor. In this work, we circumvent
this issue by leveraging ideas from mechanism design. In particular, we
introduce a type reporting step in which the receiver is asked to report their
type to the sender, after the latter has committed to a menu defining a
signaling scheme for each possible receiver's type. We prove that, with a
single receiver, the addition of this type reporting stage makes the sender's
computational problem tractable. Then, we extend our framework to settings with
multiple receivers, focusing on the case of no inter-agent externalities and
binary actions. We show that it is possible to find a sender-optimal solution
in polynomial-time by means of the ellipsoid method, given access to a suitable
polynomial-time separation oracle. This can be implemented for supermodular and
anonymous sender's utility functions. As for the case of submodular sender's
utility functions, we first approximately cast the sender's problem into a
linearly-constrained mathematical program whose objective function is the
multi-linear extension of the sender's utility. Then, we show how to find in
polynomial-time an approximate solution to the program by means of a continuous
greedy algorithm. This provides a (1 -1/e)-approximation to the problem.

necessary to extract cardiorespiratory information accurately. Although there
exists several rule-based and Machine-Learning (ML) - based approaches for PPG

this work proposes a lightweight CNN architecture for signal quality assessment
employing a novel Quantum pattern recognition (QPR) technique. The proposed
algorithm is validated on manually annotated data obtained from the University
of Queensland database. A total of 28366, 5s signal segments are preprocessed
and transformed into image files of 20 x 500 pixels. The image files are
treated as an input to the 2D CNN architecture. The developed model classifies
the PPG signal as `good' or `bad' with an accuracy of 98.3% with 99.3%

the proposed framework is validated against the noisy `Welltory app' collected

a novel Spatio-temporal pattern recognition technique improve the system's

automorphisms of groups that outperform CREAM on orders larger than 128.
Similarly, Mitchell et al. take advantage of deep theorems to compute
automorphisms and congruences of completely 0-simple semigroups in a very
efficient manner. However these domains (groups of order above 128 and
completely 0-simple semigroups) are among the very few examples of GAP code
faster than our general purpose package CREAM. For the overwhelming majority of
other classes of algebras, either ours is the first code computing the above

  To get this performance, CREAM uses a mixture of universal algebra algorithms
together with GAP coupled with artificial intelligence theorem proving tools

re-implement Freese's very clever algorithm for computing congruences in

preeclampsia, which can only occur before the `terminal' event of giving birth.
Models that acknowledge semi-competing risks enable investigation of
relationships between covariates and the joint timing of the outcomes, but
methods for model selection and prediction of semi-competing risks in high

cubic theory with a local double copy. We consider the nonlinear sigma model
and the special galileon theory, massless versions of which are known to be
related through the double copy. We show that by performing a Kaluza-Klein
reduction of these theories from five dimensions down to four, a double copy
relation exists between the resulting massive four-dimensional scalar field
theories. This requires the vanishing contribution of new galileon terms
arising in high dimensions. We further explore if other interactions that do
not arise from a dimensional reduction of the nonlinear sigma model could be
double copied and find a new cubic interaction which satisfies the BCJ
relations up to 5-point amplitudes.

first observation of an isoscalar state with exotic quantum numbers

\rightarrow \gamma\eta_1(1855)$ with $\eta_1(1855)\rightarrow\eta\eta'$. Its
mass and width are measured to be (1855$\pm$9$_{-1}^{+6}$)MeV/$c^{2}$ and
(188$\pm$18$_{-8}^{+3}$)MeV, respectively, where the first uncertainties are
statistical and the second are systematic, and its statistical significance is
estimated to be larger than 19$\sigma$.

  Aleksander Madry","Datamodels: Predicting Predictions from Training Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a conceptual framework, datamodeling, for analyzing the behavior
of a model class in terms of the training data. For any fixed ""target"" example
$x$, training set $S$, and learning algorithm, a datamodel is a parameterized
function $2^S \to \mathbb{R}$ that for any subset of $S' \subset S$ -- using
only information about which examples of $S$ are contained in $S'$ -- predicts
the outcome of training a model on $S'$ and evaluating on $x$. Despite the
potential complexity of the underlying process being approximated (e.g.,
end-to-end training and evaluation of deep neural networks), we show that even
simple linear datamodels can successfully predict model outputs. We then
demonstrate that datamodels give rise to a variety of applications, such as:
accurately predicting the effect of dataset counterfactuals; identifying
brittle predictions; finding semantically similar examples; quantifying
train-test leakage; and embedding data into a well-behaved and feature-rich
representation space. Data for this paper (including pre-computed datamodels as
well as raw predictions from four million trained deep neural networks) is
available at https://github.com/MadryLab/datamodels-data .

performed. An isoscalar state with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$,
denoted as $\eta_1(1855)$, has been observed for the first time with
statistical significance larger than 19$\sigma$. Its mass and width are
measured to be (1855$\pm$9$_{-1}^{+6}$)~MeV/$c^{2}$ and
(188$\pm$18$_{-8}^{+3}$)~MeV, respectively. The product branching fraction
${\cal B}(J/\psi$$\rightarrow$$
\gamma\eta_1(1855)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\eta\eta')$ is measured to be (2.70$\pm
0.41 _{-0.35}^{+0.16}) \times$10$^{-6}$. The first uncertainties are
statistical and the second are systematic. In addition, an upper limit on the
branching ratio ${\cal B}(f_0(1710)$$\rightarrow$$\eta\eta')$/${\cal
B}(f_0(1710)$$\rightarrow$$\pi\pi)$ is determined to be $1.61 \times 10^{-3}$
at 90\% confidence level, which lends support to the hypothesis that the
$f_0(1710)$ has a large glueball component.

order magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in circular and elliptical sunspots by
applying both Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) techniques on solar observational data. These techniques
are well documented and validated in the areas of fluid mechanics, hydraulics,
and granular flows, yet are relatively new to the field of solar physics. While
POD identifies modes based on orthogonality in space and it provides a clear
ranking of modes in terms of their contribution to the variance of the signal,
DMD resolves modes that are orthogonal in time. The clear presence of the
fundamental slow sausage and kink body modes, as well as higher order slow
sausage and kink body modes have been identified using POD and DMD analysis of
the chromospheric H$\alpha$ line at 6562.808~{\AA} for both the circular and
elliptical sunspots. Additionally, to the various slow body modes, evidence for
the presence of the fast surface kink mode was found in the circular sunspot.
All the MHD modes patterns were cross-correlated with their theoretically
predicted counterparts and we demonstrated that ellipticity cannot be neglected
when interpreting MHD wave modes. The higher-order MHD wave modes are even more
sensitive to irregularities in umbral cross-sectional shapes, hence this must
be taken into account for more accurate modelling of the modes in sunspots and
pores.

in economics. The considerable flexibility they offer, as well as their
capacity to reproduce a variety of empirically observed behaviours of complex
systems, give them broad appeal, and the increasing availability of cheap
computing power has made their use feasible. Yet a widespread adoption in
real-world modelling and decision-making scenarios has been hindered by the
difficulty of performing parameter estimation for such models. In general,
simulation models lack a tractable likelihood function, which precludes a
straightforward application of standard statistical inference techniques.
Several recent works have sought to address this problem through the
application of likelihood-free inference techniques, in which parameter
estimates are determined by performing some form of comparison between the
observed data and simulation output. However, these approaches are (a) founded
on restrictive assumptions, and/or (b) typically require many hundreds of
thousands of simulations. These qualities make them unsuitable for large-scale
simulations in economics and can cast doubt on the validity of these inference
methods in such scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of two
classes of black-box approximate Bayesian inference methods that have recently
drawn significant attention within the probabilistic machine learning
community: neural posterior estimation and neural density ratio estimation. We
present benchmarking experiments in which we demonstrate that neural network
based black-box methods provide state of the art parameter inference for
economic simulation models, and crucially are compatible with generic
multivariate time-series data. In addition, we suggest appropriate assessment
criteria for future benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures
for economic simulation models.

consumed in the past. If a user happens to be exposed to strongly polarized
content, she might subsequently receive recommendations which may steer her
towards more and more radicalized content, eventually being trapped in what we
call a ""radicalization pathway"". In this paper, we study the problem of
mitigating radicalization pathways using a graph-based approach. Specifically,
we model the set of recommendations of a ""what-to-watch-next"" recommender as a
d-regular directed graph where nodes correspond to content items, links to
recommendations, and paths to possible user sessions. We measure the
""segregation"" score of a node representing radicalized content as the expected
length of a random walk from that node to any node representing non-radicalized
content. High segregation scores are associated to larger chances to get users
trapped in radicalization pathways. Hence, we define the problem of reducing
the prevalence of radicalization pathways by selecting a small number of edges
to ""rewire"", so to minimize the maximum of segregation scores among all
radicalized nodes, while maintaining the relevance of the recommendations. We
prove that the problem of finding the optimal set of recommendations to rewire
is NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate within any factor. Therefore, we turn our
attention to heuristics, and propose an efficient yet effective greedy
algorithm based on the absorbing random walk theory. Our experiments on

combinations of all standardly studied mixer and phase separator Hamiltonians

sexaquark in the physics of compact stars given the stringent constraints on
the equation of state that stem from observations of high mass pulsars and
GW170817 bounds on the compactness of intermediate mass stars. We find that
there is a ""sexaquark dilemma"" (analogous to the hyperon dilemma) for which the
dissociation of the sexaquark in quark matter is a viable solution fulfilling
all present constraints from multi-messenger astronomy. The parameters needed
to model the hybrid star including sexaquarks are in line with parameters of
pre-existing quark- and hadronic-matter models. We find that current
constraints -- tidal deformability in accordance with GW170817 and maximum mass
above the lower limit from PSR J0740+6620 -- can be satisfied two ways: with
early quark deconfinement such that neither sexaquarks nor hyperons are present
in any NS interiors, or with later deconfinement such that a neutron-sexaquark
shell surrounds the inner quark matter core.

thresholds are given by a beta distribution parametrized by two positive shape
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The heterogeneous case can be treated as a
generalized model that reduces to a homogeneous model in special cases. We show

$2^{nd}$ order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics is the shear relaxation time,
inclusion of which solves the causality violation problem in the Navier-Stokes
equation. In phenomenological studies this coefficient has been taken as a
constant and much attention has gone into finding and fixing the shear
viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$. This transport coefficient also
happens to control the non-hydrodynamic mode of the out-of-equilibrium
hydrodynamics theory. It has been predicted that for decreasing system size,
observables become sensitive to variation in shear relaxation time as a result
of increasing dominance of non-hydrodynamic mode, which could potentially
indicate breakdown of hydrodynamics. In this study, we try to test this
prediction in the peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at $2.76$ TeV and Au-Au
collisions at $200$ GeV, with IPGlasma initial condition and
$(2+1)-$Dimensional viscous hydrodynamics. We find that elliptic flow does show
adequate sensitivity to variation in relaxation time for decreasing system

refinement in this value given a way to improve the centrality resolution in

drastically accelerate the discovery of new functional compounds. Towards this
goal, generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) using string and graph
representations have been successfully used to search for novel molecules.
However, these approaches are limited since their representations ignore the
three-dimensional (3D) structure of molecules. In fact, geometry plays an
important role in many applications in inverse molecular design, especially in
drug discovery. Thus, it is important to build models that can generate
molecular structures in 3D space based on property-oriented geometric
constraints. To address this, one approach is to generate molecules as 3D point
clouds by sequentially placing atoms at locations in space -- this allows the
process to be guided by physical quantities such as energy or other properties.
However, this approach is inefficient as placing individual atoms makes the
exploration unnecessarily deep, limiting the complexity of molecules that can
be generated. Moreover, when optimizing a molecule, organic and medicinal
chemists use known fragments and functional groups, not single atoms. We
introduce a novel RL framework for scalable 3D design that uses a hierarchical
agent to build molecules by placing molecular substructures sequentially in 3D
space, thus attempting to build on the existing human knowledge in the field of
molecular design. In a variety of experiments with different substructures, we
show that our agent, guided only by energy considerations, can efficiently
learn to produce molecules with over 100 atoms from many distributions

that one can assign arbitrary color to each pixel. In fact, naive application
of existing methods fails even in simple domains such as MNIST digits, since
one cannot create darker pixels by adding light. We know, however, that the
human visual system can be fooled by optical illusions involving certain
spatial configurations of brightness and contrast. Our key insight is that one
can leverage this behavior to produce high quality images with negligible

brightening surrounding pixels. We propose a novel optimization procedure to

minimal toolkit of physical mechanisms, of which liquid crystal order is the
most prominent example. Yet, experimental and theoretical studies have given so

cosmology. The main effect of massive neutrinos is to suppress the growth of
cosmic structure on small scales. Such growth can be accurately modelled using
cosmological $N$-body simulations, but doing so requires accurate initial
conditions (ICs). There is a trade-off, especially with first-order ICs,
between truncation errors for late starts and discreteness and relativistic
errors for early starts. Errors can be minimized by starting simulations at
late times using higher-order ICs. In this paper, we show that neutrino effects
can be absorbed into scale-independent coefficients in higher-order Lagrangian
perturbation theory (LPT). This clears the way for the use of higher-order ICs
for massive neutrino simulations. We demonstrate that going to higher order
substantially improves the accuracy of simulations. To match the sensitivity of
surveys like DESI and Euclid, errors in the matter power spectrum should be

larger errors, even when starting as early as $z=127$, exceeding 1% at $z=0$

different neutrino masses are more robust than absolute statistics, but still
depend on the choice of ICs. For all statistics considered, we obtain 1%

consistent with the interpolation of segmentation maps of those data. This
method represents a specific type of data-adaptive regularization paradigm
which aids to minimize the overfitting of labelled data under high confidence

quadratic-in-curvature terms that are effective at that scale. Recently it has
also been shown that these terms can UV complete gravity respecting stability

inflation and natural inflation. The first scenario can be considered as the
most economical option as the inflaton is identified with the only known
elementary scalar field in the Standard Model and the near criticality of the
Standard Model is used to remain in the perturbative regime. In the second one
a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson contributes to the inflationary dynamics and its
potential is naturally flat. It is shown that in both scenarios one can restore

Furthermore in a `slow' metal, with Fermi velocity less than the sound

Consequently, significant efforts have gone into systematic surveys of the cold
ISM of the galaxies in the local Universe. This review discusses the resulting
network of scaling relations connecting the atomic and molecular gas masses of
galaxies with their other global properties (stellar masses, morphologies,
metallicities, star formation activity...), and their implications for our
understanding of galaxy evolution. Key take-home messages are as follows: (1)
From a gas perspective, there are three main factors that determine the star
formation rate of a galaxy: the total mass of its cold ISM, how much of that
gas is molecular, and the rate at which any molecular gas is converted into
stars. All three of these factors vary systematically across the local galaxy
population. (2) The shape and scatter of both the star formation main sequence
and the mass-metallicity relation are deeply linked to the availability of
atomic and molecular gas. (3) Future progress will come from expanding our
exploration of scaling relations into new parameter space (in particular the
regime of dwarf galaxies), better connecting the cold ISM of large samples of
galaxies with the environment that feeds them (the circumgalactic medium in
particular), and understanding the impact of these large scales on the
efficiency of the star formation process on molecular cloud scales.

$\lambda_\text{air}$=16498\AA. We also compare the resulting abundance trend
with Ce and Eu abundances for the same stars to analyse the s- and r-process

spectral synthesis. The very same stars have already been analysed using
high-resolution optical spectra using the same method, but the abundance of Yb
was not possible to determine from those spectra due to blending issues for
stars with [Fe/H]>-1. In this present analysis, we utilise the stellar
parameters determined from the optical analysis. We determined the Yb
abundances with an estimated uncertainty for [Yb/Fe] of 0.1 dex. From
comparison, the trend of [Yb/Fe] follows closely the [Eu/Fe] trend and has
clear s-process enrichment in identified s-rich stars. From the comparison,
both the validity of the Yb abundances are ensured, and the theoretical
prediction of a roughly 40/60 s-/r-process contribution to Yb's origin is
supported. These results show that with a careful and detailed analysis of
infrared spectra, reliable Yb abundances can be derived for a wider sample of
cooler giants in the range -1.1<[Fe/H]<0.3. This is promising for further
studies of the production of Yb and for the r-process channel, key for
Galactochemical evolution, in the infrared.

of starlight are arranged in a non-redundant pattern at the entrance of the
combiner so that the signal from each baseline can be separated from one
another in the frequency domain. If the signals from different baselines
overlap in the frequency domain, this can give rise to a systematic error in
the fringe measurements known as baseline crosstalk. In this paper we quantify
crosstalk arising from the combination of atmospheric seeing and beam
propagation over distances of order hundreds of metres. We find that in
idealised conditions atmospheric wavefront errors and beam propagation do not
contribute to crosstalk. However, when aperture stops are included in the
optical beam train we observe that wavefront errors can result in squared
visibility errors arising from crosstalk as high as $\Delta V^{2} =

Galaxy with an energy flux that is comparable to that of TeV-energy gamma rays
and EeV-energy cosmic rays. Neutrinos provide the only unobstructed view of the
cosmic accelerators that power the highest energy radiation reaching us from
the universe. We will review the rationale for building kilometer-scale
neutrino detectors that led to the IceCube project, which transformed a cubic
kilometer of deep transparent natural Antarctic ice into a neutrino telescope
of such a scale. We will summarize the results from the first decade of
operations: the status of the observations of cosmic neutrinos and of their
first identified source, the supermassive black hole TXS 0506+056.
Subsequently, we will introduce the phenomenology associated with cosmic
accelerators in some detail. Besides the search for the sources of Galactic and
extragalactic cosmic rays, the scientific missions of IceCube and similar
instruments under construction in the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Baikal include
the observation of Galactic supernova explosions, the search for dark matter,
and the study of neutrinos themselves. This review resulted from notes created
for summer school lectures and should be accessible to nonexperts.

Measurements from ABRACADABRA and SHAFT already place bounds on GWs, although
the present strain sensitivity is weak. However, we demonstrate that the
sensitivity scaling with the volume of such instruments is significant - faster
than for axions - and so rapid progress will be made in the future. With no
modifications, DMRadio-m$^3$ will have a GW strain sensitivity of $h \sim
10^{-20}$ at 200 MHz. A simple modification of the pickup loop used to readout
the induced magnetic flux can parametrically enhance the GW sensitivity,
particularly at lower frequencies.

Despite being spherically symmetric, $\ell$-boson stars have a (hidden) frame
of reference, used in defining their individual multipolar fields. To assess
the impact of their relative orientation, we perform simulations with different
angles between the axes of the two colliding stars. Additionally, two scenarios
are considered for the colliding stars: that they are composites of either the
same or different scalar fields. Despite some model-specific behaviours, the
simulations generically indicate that: 1) the collision of two sufficiently
(and equally) massive stars leads to black hole formation; 2) below a certain
mass threshold the end result of the evolution is a bound state of the
composite scalar fields, that neither disperses nor collapses into a black hole
within the simulation time; 3) this end product (generically) deviates from
spherical symmetry and the equipartition of the number of bosonic particles
between the different scalar fields composing the initial boson stars is lost,
albeit not dramatically. This last observation indicates, albeit without being
conclusive, that the end result of these collisions belongs to the previously
reported larger family of equilibrium multi-field boson stars, generically
non-spherical, and of which $\ell$-boson stars are a symmetry enhanced point.
We also extract and discuss the waveforms from the collisions studied.

from the active galactic nuclei (AGN), respectively producing photodissociation

SLED) as traced by Herschel, complemented with data from single-dish telescopes
for the low-J lines, and high-resolution ALMA images of the mid-J CO emitting
region. By comparing our results to the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find no
evidence for AGN influence on the cold and low-density gas on kpc-scales. On
nuclear (r = 250 pc) scales, we find weak correlations between the CO line
ratios and either the FUV or X-ray fluxes: this may indicate that neither SF
nor AGN radiation dominates the gas excitation, at least at r = 250 pc. From a
comparison of the CO line ratios with PDR and XDR models, we find that PDRs can
reproduce observations only in presence of extremely high gas densities ($n >
10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). In the XDR case, instead, the models suggest moderate
densities ($n \approx 10^{2-4}$ cm$^{-3}$). We conclude that a mix of the two
mechanisms (PDR for the mid-J, XDR or possibly shocks for the high-J) is
necessary to explain the observed CO excitation in active galaxies.

demonstrate HBAR on the case of inferring a trend in atmospheric CO2 with
incident stellar flux, predicted by the presence of a functioning
carbonate-silicate weathering negative feedback cycle, an assumption upon which
all calculations of the habitable zone (HZ) rest. Using simulated transmission
spectra and JWST-quality observations of rocky planets with H2O, CO2, and N2
bearing atmospheres, we find that the predicted trend in CO2 causes subtle
differences in the spectra of order 10 ppm in the 1-5 um range, underscoring
the challenge inherent to testing this hypothesis. In the limit of highly
precise data (100 stacked transits per planet), we show that our HBAR model is
capable of inferring the population-level parameters that characterize the
trend in CO2, and we demonstrate that the null hypothesis and other simpler
trends can be rejected at high confidence. Although we find that this specific
empirical test of the HZ may be prohibitively challenging in the JWST era, the
HBAR framework developed in this work may find a more immediate usage for the
analysis of gas giant spectra observed with JWST, Ariel, and other upcoming

observed disk population in the Lupus star-forming region are based on
measurements of isotopologues of CO. However, without additional constraints,
the degeneracy between H$_2$ mass and the elemental composition of the gas
leads to large uncertainties in such estimates. Here we explore the gas
compositions of seven disks from the Lupus sample representing a range of
CO-to-dust ratios. With Band 6 and 7 ALMA observations, we measure line
emission for HCO$^+$, HCN, and N$_2$H$^+$. We find a tentative correlation
among the line fluxes for these three molecular species across the sample, but
no correlation with $^{13}$CO or sub-mm continuum fluxes. For the three disks
where N$_2$H$^+$ is detected, we find that a combination of high disk gas
masses and sub-interstellar C/H and O/H are needed to reproduce the observed

scalar-valued. The regression model applied in these settings is the
scalar-on-function regression (SoFR). Most estimation approaches in SoFR assume
that the functional covariates are precisely observed, or the measurement
errors are considered random errors. Violation of this assumption can lead to
both under-estimation of the model parameters and sub-optimal analysis. The

instead of memorizing fixed values of specific activity categories seen during
training. Ideally, the models should look beyond such category-specific biases
and regress the caloric cost in videos depicting activity categories not
explicitly present during training. With this property in mind, Vid2Burn is
accompanied with a cross-category benchmark, where the task is to regress
caloric expenditure for types of physical activities not present during
training. An extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches for video
recognition modified for the energy expenditure estimation task demonstrates
the difficulty of this problem, especially for new activity types at test-time,

  and Administrative Data","Version submitted to JBES in January of 2022",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a large literature on earnings and income volatility in labor
economics, household finance, and macroeconomics. One strand of that literature
has studied whether individual earnings volatility has risen or fallen in the
U.S. over the last several decades. There are strong disagreements in the
empirical literature on this important question, with some studies showing
upward trends, some showing downward trends, and some showing no trends. Some
studies have suggested that the differences are the result of using flawed
survey data instead of more accurate administrative data. This paper summarizes
the results of a project attempting to reconcile these findings with four
different data sets and six different data series--three survey and three
administrative data series, including two which match survey respondent data to
their administrative data. Using common specifications, measures of volatility,
and other treatments of the data, four of the six data series show a lack of
any significant long-term trend in male earnings volatility over the last
20-to-30+ years when differences across the data sets are properly accounted
for. A fifth data series (the PSID) shows a positive net trend but small in
magnitude. A sixth, administrative, data set, available only since 1998, shows
no net trend 1998-2011 and only a small decline thereafter. Many of the
remaining differences across data series can be explained by differences in
their cross-sectional distribution of earnings, particularly differences in the
size of the lower tail. We conclude that the data sets we have analyzed, which
include many of the most important available, show little evidence of any
significant trend in male earnings volatility since the mid-1980s.

and the exciting possibilities offered by connected and autonomous vehicles
(CAVs) are pushing toward the deployment of heterogeneous sensors for tracking
dynamic objects in the automotive environment. Among them, Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are witnessing a surge in popularity as their
application to vehicular networks seem particularly promising. LiDARs can
indeed produce a three-dimensional (3D) mapping of the surrounding environment,
which can be used for object detection, recognition, and topography. These data
are encoded as a point cloud which, when transmitted, may pose significant
challenges to the communication systems as it can easily congest the wireless
channel. Along these lines, this paper investigates how to compress point
clouds in a fast and efficient way. Both 2D- and a 3D-oriented approaches are
considered, and the performance of the corresponding techniques is analyzed in
terms of (de)compression time, efficiency, and quality of the decompressed

in which LiDAR frames are saved, compression methods that are typically applied
for 2D images give equivalent results, if not better, than those specifically
designed for 3D point clouds.

(ISGMR) within the calcium isotope chain report conflicting results. One study
suggests that the monopole resonance energy, and thus the incompressibility of
the nucleus $K_{A}$ increase with mass, which implies that $K_{\tau}$, the
asymmetry term in the nuclear incompressibility, has a positive value. The
other study reports a weak decreasing trend of the energy moments, resulting in
a generally accepted negative value for $K_{\tau}$. An independent measurement
of the central region of the ISGMR in the Ca isotope chain is provided to gain
a better understanding of the origin of possible systematic trends.
Inelastically scattered $\alpha$ particles from a range of calcium targets
($\mathrm{^{40,42,44,48}Ca}$), observed at small scattering angles including
0$^\circ$, were momentum analyzed in the K600 magnetic spectrometer at iThemba
LABS, South Africa. Monopole strengths spanning an excitation-energy range
between 9.5 and 25.5 MeV were obtained using the difference-of-spectra (DoS)
technique. The structure of the $E0$ strength distributions of $^{40,42,44}$Ca
agrees well with the results from the previous measurement that supports a weak
decreasing trend of the energy moments, while no two datasets agree in the case
of $^{48}$Ca. Despite the variation in the structural character of $E0$
strength distribution from different studies, we find for all datasets that the
moment ratios, calculated from the ISGMR strength in the excitation-energy
range that defines the main resonance region, display at best only a weak
systematic sensitivity to a mass increase. Different trends observed in the
nuclear incompressibility are caused by contributions to the $E0$ strength
outside of the main resonance region, and in particular for high excitation
energies.

d_k for k < 13. He found these d_k to be polynomials in certain interesting
""geometric quantites"" arising in the work of Wanless. Each of these quantities
is the number density of isomorphic mappings of some graph into the lattice

propose IFOR, Iterative Flow Minimization for Robotic Object Rearrangement, an
end-to-end method for the challenging problem of object rearrangement for
unknown objects given an RGBD image of the original and final scenes. First, we
learn an optical flow model based on RAFT to estimate the relative
transformation of the objects purely from synthetic data. This flow is then
used in an iterative minimization algorithm to achieve accurate positioning of
previously unseen objects. Crucially, we show that our method applies to
cluttered scenes, and in the real world, while training only on synthetic data.

extraction (SE), which is the task of extracting the speech of a target speaker
from a mixture of interfering speakers with the help of auxiliary information
about the target speaker. Several forms of auxiliary information have been
employed in single-channel SE, such as a speech snippet enrolled from the
target speaker or visual information corresponding to the spoken utterance.
Many SE studies have reported performance improvement compared to speaker
separation (SS) methods with oracle selection, arguing that this is due to the
use of auxiliary information. However, such works have not considered
state-of-the-art SS methods that have shown impressive separation performance.
In this paper, we revise and examine the role of the auxiliary information in
SE. Specifically, we compare the performance of two SE systems (audio-based and
video-based) with SS using a common framework that utilizes the
state-of-the-art dual-path recurrent neural network as the main learning
machine. In addition, we study how much the considered SE systems rely on the
auxiliary information by analyzing the systems' output for random auxiliary
signals. Experimental evaluation on various datasets suggests that the main
purpose of the auxiliary information in the considered SE systems is only to
specify the target speaker in the mixture and that it does not provide
consistent extraction performance gain when compared to the uninformed SS
system.

are increasingly being used in hospital emergency departments (EDs) to improve
patient flow. Before deciding whether such interventions should be adopted, it
is important to understand how split flows causally impact patient flow and
outcomes. We employ causal inference methodology to estimate average causal
effects of a split flow model on time to be roomed, time to disposition after
being roomed, admission decisions, and ED revisits at a large tertiary teaching
hospital that uses a split flow model during certain hours each day. We propose
a regression discontinuity (RD) design to identify average causal effects,
which we formalize with causal diagrams. Using electronic health records data
(n = 21,570), we estimate that split flow increases average time to be roomed
by about 4.6 minutes (95% CI: [2.9,6.2] minutes) but decreases average time to
disposition by 14.4 minutes (95% CI: [4.1,24.7] minutes), leading to an overall
reduction in length of stay. Split flow is also found to decrease admission
rates by 5.9% (95% CI: [2.3%, 9.4%]) but not at the expense of a significant
change in revisit rates. Lastly, we find that the split flow model is
especially effective at reducing length of stay during low congestion levels,
which mediation analysis partly attributes to early task initiation by the
physician assigned to triage.

based merely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Base Stations (BSs), which
does not require any increase in computation complexity at the user devices
with respect to the device standard operations, unlike methods that rely on
time of arrival or angle of arrival information. In the proposed method, the
user to be localized reports the RSS from BSs to a Central Processing Unit

be performed locally at the user. Using estimated pathloss radio maps of the
BSs, LocUNet can localize users with state-of-the-art accuracy and enjoys high
robustness to inaccuracies in the radio maps. The proposed method does not
require pre-sampling of the environment; and is suitable for real-time

  This work proposes a compiler-driven simulation workflow that can model

flexibly represent a wide variety of hardware constructs. We design the Event

we also implement a generic simulation engine to model EQueue programs with
hybrid MLIR dialects representing different abstraction levels. We demonstrate
two case studies of EQueue-implemented accelerators: the systolic array of

simulation is as accurate as a state-of-the-art simulator, while offering
higher extensibility and lower iteration cost via compiler passes. In the

in understanding the basic structural attributes of control systems in
geometric control theory. However, this map does not exists due to the lack of
completeness of flows for general vector fields.
  An appropriate substitute is devised for the exponential map, not by trying
to force flows to be globally defined by any compact assumptions on the
manifold, but by categorical development of spaces of vector fields and flows,
thus allowing for systematic localisation of such spaces. That is to say, we
give a presheaf construction of the exponential map for vector fields with
measurable time-dependence and continuous parameter-dependence in the category
of general topological spaces. Moreover, all manners of regularity in state are
considered, from the minimal locally Lipschitz dependence to holomorphic and
real analytic dependence. Using geometric descriptions of suitable topologies
for vector fields and for local diffeomorphisms, the homeomorphism of the
exponential map is derived by a uniform treatment for all cases of
regularities. Finally, a new sort of continuous dependence is proved, that of
the fixed time local flow on the parameter which plays an important role in the
establishment of the homeomorphism of the exponential map.

structures of the different kinds of heterostructures, focusing in the
properties of the flat-bands, we use Density Functional Theory to study the
possibility of magnetic ground states when placing, through doping, the Fermi

expectation that these heterostructures, after being appropriately hole-doped,
develop a ferromagnetic ground state that seems to require, as in the case of
pristine armchair nanoribbons, the presence of a dispersive band crossing the

registration field more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the
transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic image registration is important
for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility,
smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the
grid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the
neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image
registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly
address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness
regularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a
differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes
exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new
registration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson
reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive
Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a
post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be
placed at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable
framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for a popular deep
learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate it with a dataset
containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can
effectively decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant

making the registration field more diffeomorphic. Our code is available online

cooperative localization, the achievable positioning accuracy strongly strongly
depends on the network geometry. This motivates the problem of planning robot
trajectories in such multi-robot systems in a way that maintains high
localization accuracy. We present potential-based planning methods, where
localizability potentials are introduced to characterize the quality of the
network geometry for cooperative position estimation. These potentials are
based on Cramer Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB) and provide a theoretical lower bound
on the error covariance achievable by any unbiased position estimator. In the
process, we establish connections between CRLBs and the theory of graph
rigidity, which has been previously used to plan the motion of robotic
networks. We develop decentralized deployment algorithms appropriate for large
networks, and we use equality-constrained CRLBs to extend the concept of
localizability to scenarios where additional information about the relative
positions of the ranging sensors is known. We illustrate the resulting robot
deployment methodology through simulated examples and an experiment.

approximation for the rotating stratified Boussinesq system on
three-dimensional tori with arbitrary aspect ratios. The rotation and
stratification parameters are arbitrary and not equal. We obtain global
existence for the proposed nonlinear system for arbitrarily large initial data.
This system is sufficiently accurate, with an important feature of coupling
effects between slow and fast modes. The key to global existence is a sharp
counting of the relevant number of nonlinear interactions. An additional
regularity advantage arises from a careful examination of some mixed type
interaction coefficients. In a wider context, the significance of our near
resonant approach is a delicate balance between the inclusion of more
interacting modes and the improvement of regularity properties, compared to the
well-studied singular limit approach based on exact resonance.

  Recognition","Accepted to ACM IMWUT 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A major bottleneck in training robust Human-Activity Recognition models (HAR)
is the need for large-scale labeled sensor datasets. Because labeling large
amounts of sensor data is an expensive task, unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning techniques have emerged that can learn good features from the data
without requiring any labels. In this paper, we extend this line of research
and present a novel technique called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning
(ColloSSL) which leverages unlabeled data collected from multiple devices worn
by a user to learn high-quality features of the data. A key insight that
underpins the design of ColloSSL is that unlabeled sensor datasets
simultaneously captured by multiple devices can be viewed as natural
transformations of each other, and leveraged to generate a supervisory signal
for representation learning. We present three technical innovations to extend
conventional self-supervised learning algorithms to a multi-device setting: a
Device Selection approach which selects positive and negative devices to enable
contrastive learning, a Contrastive Sampling algorithm which samples positive
and negative examples in a multi-device setting, and a loss function called
Multi-view Contrastive Loss which extends standard contrastive loss to a
multi-device setting. Our experimental results on three multi-device datasets
show that ColloSSL outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised
learning techniques in majority of the experiment settings, resulting in an
absolute increase of upto 7.9% in F_1 score compared to the best performing
baselines. We also show that ColloSSL outperforms the fully-supervised methods
in a low-data regime, by just using one-tenth of the available labeled data in
the best case.

with Neumann boundary conditions by Lasiecka and Triggiani to get the
regularity of solutions to the mixed problem with coupled Robin boundary
conditions. Thus we show the exact boundary controllability of the system, and
by a method of compact perturbation, we obtain the non-exact boundary
controllability of the system with fewer boundary controls on some special

us to construct a global system of linear algebraic equations that only relies
on the finite element infrastructure of the lower dimensional subdomains

four distinctive test cases. The first test case is a Poisson equation posed in

many regulatory processes including spatiotemporal patterning in tissues by
promoting alternate cell fates between neighboring cells. At the multicellular
level, this ""lateral inhibition"" principle leads to checkerboard patterns of
Sender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates
cell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at
the cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model
stochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two
different noise types - shot and white - for a multicell system. The results
show that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell
lattice toward more checkerboard like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate
transition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide
enough perturbation to facilitate ""proofreading"" of disordered patterns and
cause cells to switch to their correct ordered state. Conversely, high noise
can override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to
switching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with
spin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system
to escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard
pattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered
base of attraction.

demand for radio frequency spectrum. To address this issue, a technology that
has received a lot of attention is In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD). The interest in
IBFD systems stems from its capability to simultaneously transmit and receive
data in the same frequency. Cancelling the self interference (SI) from the
transmitter to the collocated receiver plays a pivotal role in the performance
of the system. There are two types of SI cancellation (SIC) approaches, passive
and active. In this research, the focus is on active cancellation and, in
particular, SIC in the digital domain. Among the direct and backscattered SI,
the former has been studied for a long time; therefore, the backscatter is
considered in this research and two SIC approaches are analyzed. The first
achieves SIC through beamforming. This requires knowing the angle of the
received SI to put the beam null-space in this direction. The second method
removes SI by employing an Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Using an ANN,
there is no need to know the direction of the SI. The neural network is trained
with pilots which results in the network being able to separate the desired
signal from the SI at the receiver. Bayesian Neural Networks show the
importance of the weights and assign a parameter that facilitates ignoring the
less significant ones. Through comparative simulations we demonstrate that the
ANN-based SIC achieves equivalent bit error rate performance as two beamforming
methods.

disordered and the velocity noise is broad band. Under commensurate conditions,
multi-step depinning transitions appear and the skyrmion Hall angle is zero at
low drives but becomes finite at higher drives, while incommensurate fillings
have a single depinning transition. As the Magnus force increases,
commensuration velocity peaks cross over to dips, and new directional locking
angles appear. At large Magnus forces, particularly at commensurate fillings, a
velocity boost can occur in which the skyrmion moves faster than the applied
drive due to the alignment of the Magnus-induced velocity with the driving
direction. Increase the Magnus force can produce regimes of enhanced pinning
when the skyrmion is forced to move along a non-symmetry direction of the
periodic pinning array. This is in contrast to systems with random pinning,
where increasing the Magnus force generally reduces the pinning effect. We
demonstrate these dynamics for both square and triangular substrates, and map
out the different regimes as a function of filling fraction, pinning force, and
the strength of the Magnus force in a series of dynamic phase diagrams.

open clusters shows the effect of age on those mechanisms. We have obtained
spectra of both Li and Be in main-sequence stars in NGC 752 at high spectral
resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios with HIRES on the Keck I telescope.
In order to make meaningful comparisons with other clusters, we have determined
the stellar parameters on a common scale. We have found abundances of Li and Be
by spectral synthesis techniques. NGC 752 is twice the age of the well-studied
Hyades cluster. We find that 1) The Li dip centered near 6500 K is wider in NGC
752, having expanded toward cooler temperatures; 2) The Be dip is deeper in the
older NGC 752; 3) The Li ""peak"" near 6200 K is lower by about 0.3 dex; 4)
Although there is little Be depletion in the cooler stars, it is possible that
Be may be lower in NGC 752 than in the Hyades; 5) The Li content in both
clusters declines with decreasing temperature, but there is less Li in NGC 752
at a given temperature by $\sim$0.4 dex. These differences are consistent with
the transport of the light-element nuclei below the surface convection zone as
predicted by theory. That connection to rotational spin-down is indicated by
the pattern of rotation with temperature in the two clusters.

structure of the system as well as the necessity of the conditions of

synchronization by the compact perturbation method and then give the dynamics
of the asymptotic orbit. Various applications are given for the system of wave

the system of Kirchhoff plate with distributed feedback. Some open questions

for solving option pricing problems. However in both methods there is a
trade-off between accuracy and speed of computation, both of which are
important in applications. We introduce a new method, the MC-Tree method, that
combines the MC method with the binomial tree method. It employs a mixing
distribution on the tree parameters, which are restricted to give prescribed
mean and variance. For the family of mixing densities proposed here, the
corresponding compound densities of the tree outcomes at final time are
obtained. Ideally the compound density would be (after a logarithmic
transformation of the asset prices) Gaussian. Using the fact that in general,
when mean and variance are prescribed, the maximum entropy distribution is
Gaussian, we look for mixing densities for which the corresponding compound
density has high entropy level. The compound densities that we obtain are not
exactly Gaussian, but have entropy values close to the maximum possible
Gaussian entropy. Furthermore we introduce techniques to correct for the
deviation from the ideal Gaussian pricing measure. One of these (distribution
correction technique) ensures that expectations calculated with the method are
taken with respect to the desired Gaussian measure. The other one
(bias-correction technique) ensures that the probability distributions used are
risk-neutral in each of the trees. Apart from option pricing, we apply our
techniques to develop an algorithm for calculation of the Credit Valuation

particular, like the LP-based algorithm of Zhang & Sandholm (2022), the size of
our representation scales with the amount of information uncommon to the team;
in fact, using linear programming on top of our TB-DAG to solve for a team
correlated equilibrium in an adversarial team games recovers almost exactly
their algorithm. Unlike that paper, however, our representation explicitly
exposes the structure of the decision space, which is what enables the
aforementioned game-theoretic techniques. Further, owing to a new and tighter
definition of public information for a team, our representation can be
exponentially tighter than that of Zhang & Sandholm (2022) in some cases.

drivable areas as well as identify specific types of soil for sample
collection. The latest Martian terrain segmentation methods rely on supervised
learning which is very data hungry and difficult to train where only a small
number of labeled samples are available. Moreover, the semantic classes are
defined differently for different applications (e.g., rover traversal vs.
geological) and as a result the network has to be trained from scratch each
time, which is an inefficient use of resources. This research proposes a
semi-supervised learning framework for Mars terrain segmentation where a deep
segmentation network trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images is
transferred to the task of terrain segmentation trained on few labeled images.
The network incorporates a backbone module which is trained using a contrastive
loss function and an output atrous convolution module which is trained using a
pixel-wise cross-entropy loss function. Evaluation results using the metric of
segmentation accuracy show that the proposed method with contrastive
pretraining outperforms plain supervised learning by 2%-10%. Moreover, the
proposed model is able to achieve a segmentation accuracy of 91.1% using only
161 training images (1% of the original dataset) compared to 81.9% with plain

a higher energy input in a model, corresponding to a larger luminosity, results

present Verint Intent Manager (VIM), an analysis platform that combines
unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to help analysts quickly surface
and organize relevant user intentions from conversational texts. For the
initial exploration of data we make use of a novel unsupervised and
semi-supervised pipeline that integrates the fine-tuning of high performing
language models, a distributed k-NN graph building method and community
detection techniques for mining the intentions and topics from texts. The
fine-tuning step is necessary because pre-trained language models cannot encode
texts to efficiently surface particular clustering structures when the target
texts are from an unseen domain or the clustering task is not topic detection.
For flexibility we deploy two clustering approaches: where the number of
clusters must be specified and where the number of clusters is detected
automatically with comparable clustering quality but at the expense of
additional computation time. We describe the application and deployment and
demonstrate its performance using BERT on three text mining tasks. Our
experiments show that BERT begins to produce better task-aware representations
using a labeled subset as small as 0.5% of the task data. The clustering
quality exceeds the state-of-the-art results when BERT is fine-tuned with
labeled subsets of only 2.5% of the task data. As deployed in the VIM
application, this flexible clustering pipeline produces high quality results,
improving the performance of data analysts and reducing the time it takes to
surface intentions from customer service data, thereby reducing the time it
takes to build and deploy IVAs in new domains.

algorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which
consists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was in
possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the
distinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is not
in play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step that
combines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with the
laws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automatically
generated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show
that in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$
detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers.
Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data
can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and
exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data

such as e.g. a cancer cell, there is still no simple way known to determine the
optimal route in sufficiently complex environments. Here we develop a machine
learning-based approach that allows us, for the first time, to determine the
asymptotically optimal path of a self-propelled agent which can freely steer in
complex environments. Our method hinges on policy gradient-based deep
reinforcement learning techniques and, crucially, does not require any reward
shaping or heuristics. The presented method provides a powerful alternative to
current analytical methods to calculate optimal trajectories and opens a route
towards a universal path planner for future intelligent active particles.

biased when unmeasured spatial confounding exists. Some exposures are
continuous yet dependent on a binary variable (e.g., level of a contaminant

unmeasured spatial confounding may vary by spatial patterns for both continuous

score (GPS) matching method for such settings, referred to as conditional GPS
(CGPS)-based spatial matching (CGPSsm). A motivating example is to investigate
the association between proximity to refineries with high petroleum production
and refining (PPR) and stroke prevalence in the southeastern United States.
CGPSsm matches exposed observational units (e.g., exposed participants) to
unexposed units by their spatial proximity and GPS integrated with spatial
information. GPS is estimated by separately estimating PS for the binary status
(exposed vs. unexposed) and CGPS on the binary status. CGPSsm maintains the
salient benefits of PS matching and spatial analysis: straightforward
assessments of covariate balance and adjustment for unmeasured spatial
confounding. Simulations showed that CGPSsm can adjust for unmeasured spatial
confounding. Using our example, we found positive association between PPR and
stroke prevalence. Our R package, CGPSspatialmatch, has been made publicly

potentially confound the inference of astrophysical signals. Current
calibration uncertainties are well described by a Gaussian process. I exploit
this description to analytically examine the impact of calibration uncertainty.
I derive closed-form expressions for the conditioned likelihood of the
calibration error given the observed data and an astrophysical signal
(astrophysical calibration) as well as for the marginal likelihood for the data
given a signal (integrated over the calibration uncertainty). I show that
calibration uncertainty always reduces search sensitivity and the amount of
information available about astrophysical signals. Additionally, calibration
uncertainty will fundamentally limit the precision to which loud signals can be
constrained, a crucial factor when considering the scientific potential of
proposed third-generation interferometers. For example, I estimate that with
$1\%$ uncertainty in the detector response's amplitude and phase, one will only
be able to measure the leading-order tidal parameter ($\tilde\Lambda$) for a
1.4+1.4$\,M_\odot$ system to better than $\pm 1$ ($\sim 0.2\%$ relative
uncertainty) for signals with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 10^4$. At this
signal-to-noise ratio, calibration uncertainty increases
$\sigma_{\tilde\Lambda}$ by a factor of $2$ compared to stationary Gaussian
noise alone. Furthermore, 1\% calibration uncertainty limits the precision to
always be $\sigma_{\tilde\Lambda} \gtrsim 0.5$. I also show how to best select
the frequencies at which calibration should be precisely constrained in order
to minimize the information lost about astrophysical parameters. It is not
necessary to constrain the calibration errors to be small at all frequencies to
perform precise astrophysical inference for individual signals.

the data to perform kernel selection (which leads to a loss in test power), and
rather maximises the test power over a collection of kernels. We provide
non-asymptotic guarantees on the power of KSDAgg: we show it achieves the
smallest uniform separation rate of the collection, up to a logarithmic term.
For compactly supported densities with bounded model score function, we derive
the rate for KSDAgg over restricted Sobolev balls; this rate corresponds to the
minimax optimal rate over unrestricted Sobolev balls, up to an iterated
logarithmic term. KSDAgg can be computed exactly in practice as it relies
either on a parametric bootstrap or on a wild bootstrap to estimate the
quantiles and the level corrections. In particular, for the crucial choice of
bandwidth of a fixed kernel, it avoids resorting to arbitrary heuristics (such
as median or standard deviation) or to data splitting. We find on both

concept that quantum entanglement, harnessed by current quantum communication
systems, does not necessarily rely on a physical relay medium. In modern
quantum communication networks, this trusted relay infrastructure is (1)
susceptible to security attacks, (2) limited by the channel capacity, (3)
subject to decoherence loss, and (4) expensive to set up. The instantaneous and
faster-than-light activities of quantum entanglement occurring in quantum
communication have suggested guidance by some non-locality nature. On the
contrary, neither ground nor space-relays have shown or been demonstrated to
embody it. It is proposed in this paper that the non-locality nature of quantum
theory governs quantum entanglement; elementary particles, components of a
universal quantum body, can achieve remote entanglement regardless of a
physical medium or spatial proximity. Evidence and theory supporting remote
entanglement in superconducting quantum systems (entanglement fidelities for
communication in particular) are presented. One such particle, the photon,
representing a basic unit of quantum information, qubit $|\psi\rangle = \alpha
|0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$, consists of real continuous values in complex
numbers $(\alpha, \beta)$ with infinite precision. These values $(\alpha,

as a promising method for the production of benchmark-level simulations of
medium to large-sized molecules, due to its accuracy and favorable polynomial
scaling with system size. Unfortunately the memory footprint of standard energy
evaluation algorithms are non-trivial, which can significantly impact timings
on graphical processing units (GPUs) where memory is limited. Previous attempts
to reduce scaling by taking advantage of the low rank structure of the
Coulombic integrals have been successful, but are significantly limited by high
prefactors, rendering the utility limited to very large systems. Here, we
present a complementary, cubic scaling route to reduce memory and computational
scaling based on the low rank of the Coulombic interactions between localized
orbitals, focusing on the application to phaseless AFQMC. We show that the
error due to this approximation, which we term Localized Orbital AFQMC

prior existing approach, spectral initialization, draws a sample from the
initialization distribution for the full-rank setting and then optimally
approximates the full-rank initialization parameters in the Frobenius norm with
a pair of low-rank initialization matrices via singular value decomposition.
Our method is inspired by the insight that approximating the function
corresponding to each layer is more important than approximating the parameter
values. We provably demonstrate that there is a significant gap between these
two approaches for ReLU networks, particularly as the desired rank of the
approximating weights decreases, or as the dimension of the inputs to the layer
increases (the latter point holds when the network width is super-linear in
dimension). Along the way, we provide the first provably efficient algorithm
for solving the ReLU low-rank approximation problem for fixed parameter rank
$r$ -- previously, it was unknown that the problem was computationally
tractable to solve even for rank $1$. We also provide a practical algorithm to
solve this problem which is no more expensive than the existing spectral
initialization approach, and validate our theory by training ResNet and

networks are more human perceptually-aligned than non-robust networks via image
manipulations. Despite appearing closer to human visual perception, it is
unclear if the constraints in robust DNN representations match biological
constraints found in human vision. Human vision seems to rely on
texture-based/summary statistic representations in the periphery, which have
been shown to explain phenomena such as crowding and performance on visual
search tasks. To understand how adversarially robust
optimizations/representations compare to human vision, we performed a
psychophysics experiment using a set of metameric discrimination tasks where we
evaluated how well human observers could distinguish between images synthesized
to match adversarially robust representations compared to non-robust
representations and a texture synthesis model of peripheral vision (Texforms).
We found that the discriminability of robust representation and texture model
images decreased to near chance performance as stimuli were presented farther
in the periphery. Moreover, performance on robust and texture-model images
showed similar trends within participants, while performance on non-robust
representations changed minimally across the visual field. These results
together suggest that (1) adversarially robust representations capture
peripheral computation better than non-robust representations and (2) robust
representations capture peripheral computation similar to current
state-of-the-art texture peripheral vision models. More broadly, our findings
support the idea that localized texture summary statistic representations may
drive human invariance to adversarial perturbations and that the incorporation
of such representations in DNNs could give rise to useful properties like
adversarial robustness.

on top of taxes and transfers. I characterize optimal redistribution for a
government with three policy instruments -- labor income taxes and transfers,
corporate income taxes, and a minimum wage -- using an empirically grounded
model of the labor market with positive firm profits. A minimum wage can
increase social welfare when it increases the average post-tax wages of
low-skill labor market participants and when corporate profit incidence is
large. When chosen together with taxes, the minimum wage can help the
government redistribute efficiently to low-skill workers by preventing firms
from capturing low-wage income subsidies such as the EITC and from enjoying
high profits that cannot be redistributed via corporate taxes due to capital
mobility in unaffected industries. Event studies show that the average US
state-level minimum wage reform over the last two decades increased average
post-tax wages of low-skilled labor market participants and reduced corporate
profits in affected industries, namely low-skill labor-intensive services. A
sufficient statistics analysis implies that US minimum wages typically remain
below their optimum under the current tax and transfer system.

the advantages of less inference cost and a simpler model architecture.

poses, facial expressions, in a unified framework, so that it can be employed

spending more resources on worse-performing strategies due to their fixed

a generalized von Mangoldt surface of revolution if the cut locus of each point

a meridian for this surface. In this article, we give sufficient conditions for
a surface of revolution $(R^2, dr^2+m(r)^2d\theta^2)$ to be a generalized von

a ReLU network yields a representation cost that reflects a complex interplay
between the alignment and sparsity of ReLU units. Specifically, using a neural

interpolating function that is constant in directions perpendicular to a

cornerstone of modern machine-learning practice. To mitigate overfitting, trees
are typically regularized by a variety of techniques that modify their
structure (e.g. pruning). We introduce Hierarchical Shrinkage (HS), a post-hoc
algorithm that does not modify the tree structure, and instead regularizes the
tree by shrinking the prediction over each node towards the sample means of its
ancestors. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a single regularization
parameter and the number of data points in each ancestor. Since HS is a
post-hoc method, it is extremely fast, compatible with any tree growing
algorithm, and can be used synergistically with other regularization
techniques. Extensive experiments over a wide variety of real-world datasets
show that HS substantially increases the predictive performance of decision
trees, even when used in conjunction with other regularization techniques.
Moreover, we find that applying HS to each tree in an RF often improves
accuracy, as well as its interpretability by simplifying and stabilizing its
decision boundaries and SHAP values. We further explain the success of HS in
improving prediction performance by showing its equivalence to ridge regression
on a (supervised) basis constructed of decision stumps associated with the
internal nodes of a tree. All code and models are released in a full-fledged

the radial distribution of GCs predicted in simple Monte Carlo models with that
of a sample of $38$ spectroscopically confirmed GCs plus 17 GC candidates,
associated mainly to low-luminosity dSph galaxies. If dark matter haloes follow
an NFW profile, the observed number of off-center GCs at projected distances
less than one half the galaxy effective radius is significantly higher than

starting GC distances. As a result of the short sinking timescale for GCs in
the central regions, the radial distribution of GCs is expected to evolve
significantly during the next 1-2 Gyr. However, dark matter haloes with cores
of size comparable to the galaxy effective radii can lead to a slow orbital
in-spiral of GCs in the central regions of these galaxies, providing a simple
solution to the timing problem. We also examine any indication of mass

  Species in Yeast Cells",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with each other and play
an important role in cell signaling networks. Based on the existing
mathematical models, we develop an age-dependent feedback control model to
simulate the interaction. The model consists of three subsystems: cytosolic
calcium dynamics, ROS generation from the respiratory chain in mitochondria,
and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In the model, we hypothesized that ROS
induces calcium release from the yeast endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus,
and vacuoles, and that ROS damages calmodulin and calcineurin by oxidizing
them. The dependence of calcium uptake by Vcx1p on ATP is incorporated into the
model. The model can approximately reproduce the log phase calcium dynamics.
The simulated interaction between the cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial ROS
shows that an increase in calcium results in a decrease in ROS initially (in
log phase), but the increase-decrease relation is changed to an
increase-increase relation when the cell is getting old. This could accord with
the experimental observation that calcium diminishes ROS from complexes I and
III of the respiratory chain under normal conditions, but enhances ROS when the
complex formations are inhibited. The model predicts that the subsystem of the
calcium regulators Pmc1p, Pmr1p, and Vex1p is stable, controllable, and
observable. These structural properties of the dynamical system could
mathematically confirm that cells have evolved delicate feedback control
mechanisms to maintain their calcium homeostasis.

while accurately predicting IoU is still a challenging problem. We argue that
the complex definition of IoU and feature misalignment make it difficult to
predict IoU accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled IoU
Regression (DIR) model to handle these problems. The proposed DIR decouples the
traditional localization confidence metric IoU into two new metrics, Purity and
Integrity. Purity reflects the proportion of the object area in the detected
bounding box, and Integrity refers to the completeness of the detected object
area. Separately predicting Purity and Integrity can divide the complex mapping
between the bounding box and its IoU into two clearer mappings and model them
independently. In addition, a simple but effective feature realignment approach
is also introduced to make the IoU regressor work in a hindsight manner, which
can make the target mapping more stable. The proposed DIR can be conveniently
integrated with existing two-stage detectors and significantly improve their
performance. Through a simple implementation of DIR with HTC, we obtain 51.3%

Composite films of polyaniline and cellulose acetate, exhibiting
chemo-mechanical actuation upon exposure to gaseous acetone, were tested in the
headspaces above multiple solutions containing acetone, ethanol, and water to
gauge response sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability. The bending of the
films in response to exposures to these environments was tracked by an
automatic video processing code, which was found to out-perform an
off-the-shelf deep neural network-based tracker. Using principal component
analysis, we showed that the film bending is low dimensional with over 90% of
the shape changes being captured with just two parameters. We constructed
forward models to predict shape changes from the known exposure history and
found that a linear model can explain 40% of the observed variance in film tip
angle changes. We constructed inverse models, going from third order fits of
shape changes to acetone concentrations where about 45% of the acetone
variation and about 30% of ethanol variation are captured by linear models, and
non-linear models did not perform substantially better. This suggests there is
sufficient sensitivity and inherent selectivity of the films. These models,
however, provide evidence for substantial hysteretic or long-time-scale
responses of the PANI films, seemingly due to the presence of water. Further

central coordination introduces significant additional difficulties in the
convergence analysis. Even for a stochastic game with identical interest, there
can be multiple Nash Equilibria (NEs), which disables proof techniques that
rely on the existence of a unique global optimum. Moreover, the softmax
parameterization introduces non-NE policies with zero gradient, making it
difficult for gradient-based algorithms in seeking NEs. In this paper, we study
the finite time convergence of decentralized softmax gradient play in a special
form of game, Markov Potential Games (MPGs), which includes the identical
interest game as a special case. We investigate both gradient play and natural
gradient play, with and without $\log$-barrier regularization. The established
convergence rates for the unregularized cases contain a trajectory-dependent
constant that can be arbitrarily large, whereas the $\log$-barrier
regularization overcomes this drawback, with the cost of slightly worse
dependence on other factors such as the action set size. An empirical study on
an identical interest matrix game confirms the theoretical findings.

  Classification and Detection","Preprint version for ICASSP 2022, Singapore",,,,"cs.SD cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Audio classification is an important task of mapping audio samples into their
corresponding labels. Recently, the transformer model with self-attention
mechanisms has been adopted in this field. However, existing audio transformers
require large GPU memories and long training time, meanwhile relying on
pretrained vision models to achieve high performance, which limits the model's
scalability in audio tasks. To combat these problems, we introduce HTS-AT: an
audio transformer with a hierarchical structure to reduce the model size and
training time. It is further combined with a token-semantic module to map final
outputs into class featuremaps, thus enabling the model for the audio event
detection (i.e. localization in time). We evaluate HTS-AT on three datasets of
audio classification where it achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
AudioSet and ESC-50, and equals the SOTA on Speech Command V2. It also achieves
better performance in event localization than the previous CNN-based models.
Moreover, HTS-AT requires only 35% model parameters and 15% training time of
the previous audio transformer. These results demonstrate the high performance
and high efficiency of HTS-AT.

  Conference (EUSIPCO 2022)",,,,"eess.SP eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for independent vector analysis
optimizes a separation matrix $W = [w_1, \ldots, w_m]^h \in \mathbb{C}^{m
\times m}$ by minimizing a surrogate function of the form $\mathcal{L}(W) =
\sum_{i = 1}^m w_i^h V_i w_i - \log | \det W |^2$, where $m \in \mathbb{N}$ is
the number of sensors and positive definite matrices $V_1,\ldots,V_m \in
\mathbb{C}^{m \times m}$ are constructed in each MM iteration. For $m \geq 3$,
no algorithm has been found to obtain a global minimum of $\mathcal{L}(W)$.
Instead, block coordinate descent (BCD) methods with closed-form update
formulas have been developed for minimizing $\mathcal{L}(W)$ and shown to be
effective. One such BCD is called iterative projection (IP) that updates one or
two rows of $W$ in each iteration. Another BCD is called iterative source
steering (ISS) that updates one column of the mixing matrix $A = W^{-1}$ in
each iteration. Although the time complexity per iteration of ISS is $m$ times
smaller than that of IP, the conventional ISS converges slower than the current
fastest IP (called $\text{IP}_2$) that updates two rows of $W$ in each
iteration. We here extend this ISS to $\text{ISS}_2$ that can update two
columns of $A$ in each iteration while maintaining its small time complexity.
To this end, we provide a unified way for developing new ISS type methods from
which $\text{ISS}_2$ as well as the conventional ISS can be immediately
obtained in a systematic manner. Numerical experiments to separate reverberant
speech mixtures show that our $\text{ISS}_2$ converges in fewer MM iterations
than the conventional ISS, and is comparable to $\text{IP}_2$.

operate in the real world where they will be surrounded by human-driven

possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that
follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the
behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major
challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and
individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and
aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them
in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are
expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy
and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned
challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and
reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn
the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social
utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying
altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe
action space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of
AVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs

the auto repair and damage assessment industry. The domain has several
application areas ranging from car assessment companies such as car rentals and

vehicle assessment, the damage can take any form including scratches, minor and
major dents to missing parts. More often, the assessment area has a significant
level of noise such as dirt, grease, oil or rush that makes an accurate
identification challenging. Moreover, the identification of a particular part
is the first step in the repair industry to have an accurate labour and part
assessment where the presence of different car models, shapes and sizes makes
the task even more challenging for a machine-learning model to perform well. To
address these challenges, this research explores and applies various instance
segmentation methodologies to evaluate the best performing models.
  The scope of this work focusses on two genres of real-time instance
segmentation models due to their industrial significance, namely SipMask and
Yolact. These methodologies are evaluated against a previously reported car
parts dataset (DSMLR) and an internally curated dataset extracted from local
car repair workshops. The Yolact-based part localization and segmentation
method performed well when compared to other real-time instance mechanisms with
a mAP of 66.5. For the workshop repair dataset, SipMask++ reported better

operations on real numbers are performed exactly, without the introduction of

about the subtleties of representing real numbers. We propose a new
axiomatization of the real numbers in a dependent type theory with the goal of
extracting certified exact real computation programs from constructive proofs.
Our formalization differs from similar approaches, in that we formalize the
reals in a conceptually similar way as some mature implementations of exact
real computation. Primitive operations on reals can be extracted directly to
the corresponding operations in such an implementation, producing more
efficient programs. We particularly focus on the formalization of partial and
nondeterministic computation, which is essential in exact real computation.
  We prove the soundness of our formalization with regards of the standard
realizability interpretation from computable analysis and show how to relate
our theory to a classical formalization of the reals. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our theory by implementing it in the Coq proof assistant and
present several natural examples. From the examples we have automatically
extracted Haskell programs that use the exact real computation framework AERN

challenge of modeling complex interactions between the inputs. In this work, we
propose a novel yet simple approach that entails exploiting the graph data
structure to model the underlying relationship between variables, i.e.,
variables as nodes and interactions defined by edges. Then, a variational graph
autoencoder is used to naturally take the interactions into account. We first
provide empirical evidence of the existence of such graph structures and then
suggest a joint framework of graph structure learning and latent space
optimization to adaptively search for optimal graph connectivity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method shows remarkable performance, exceeding the
existing approaches with significant computational efficiency for a number of
synthetic and real-world tasks.

  For the forecast, I used a quantile regression forest approach using the
solar variables provided by the Bureau of Meterology of Australia (BOM) and
many of the weather variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasting (ECMWF).
  Groups of buildings and all of the solar instances were trained together as
they were observed to be closely correlated over time. Other variables used
included Fourier values based on hour of day and day of year, and binary
variables for combinations of days of the week.
  The start dates for the time series were carefully tuned based on phase 1 and
cleaning and thresholding was used to reduce the observed error rate for each
time series.
  For the optimization, a four-step approach was used using the forecast
developed. First, a mixed-integer program (MIP) was solved for the recurring
and recurring plus once-off activities, then each of these was extended using a
mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP).
  The general strategy was chosen from one of two (""array"" from the ""array"" and
""tuples"" approaches) while the specific step improvement strategy was chosen
from one of five (""no forced discharge"").

In particular, the temperature of the coronal plasma has been difficult to
constrain for large samples of AGN, as constraints require high quality
broadband X-ray spectral coverage extending above 10 keV in order to measure
the high energy cutoff, which provides constraints on the combination of
coronal optical depth and temperature. We present constraints on the coronal

significant correlation between the coronal cutoff energy and accretion
parameters such as the Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We also do not find
a statistically significant correlation between the X-ray photon index,
$\Gamma$, and Eddington ratio. This calls into question the use of such

ontology of symbols representing relevant concepts of the application domain.
These symbols are then used to represent the knowledge of the domain. This
representation should be \emph{elaboration tolerant}, in the sense that it
should be convenient to modify it to take into account new knowledge or
requirements. Unfortunately, current formalisms require a significant rewrite
of that representation when the new knowledge is about the \emph{concepts}
themselves: the developer needs to ""\emph{reify}"" them. This happens, for
example, when the new knowledge is about the number of concepts that satisfy
some conditions. The value of expressing knowledge about concepts, or
""intensions"", has been well-established in \emph{modal logic}. However, the
formalism of modal logic cannot represent the quantifications and aggregates
over concepts that some applications need.
  To address this problem, we developed an extension of first order logic that
allows referring to the \emph{intension} of a symbol, i.e., to the concept it
represents. We implemented this extension in IDP-Z3, a reasoning engine for
FO($\cdot$) (aka FO-dot), a logic-based knowledge representation language. This
extension makes the formalism more elaboration tolerant, but also introduces
the possibility of syntactically incorrect formula. Hence, we developed a
guarding mechanism to make formula syntactically correct, and a method to
verify correctness. The complexity of this method is linear with the length of
the formula.
  This paper describes these extensions, how their relate to intensions in
modal logic and other formalisms, and how they allowed representing the

Concretely, we create a Retrieve-and-Fill (RAF) architecture comprised of (1) a
retrieval module which ranks the best scenario given an utterance and (2) a
filling module which imputes spans into the scenario to create the frame. Our
model is modular, differentiable, interpretable, and allows us to garner extra

provides a crucial clue for establishing the $J^{P(C)}=1^{-(+)}$ hybrid nonet.
Based on the flux tube model picture, the production and decay mechanisms for
the $J^{P(C)}=1^{-(+)}$ hybrid nonet in the $J/\psi$ radiative decays into two
pseudoscalar mesons are investigated. In the $I=0$ sector, we find that the
SU(3) flavor octet and singlet mixing is non-negligible and apparently deviates
from the flavor ideal mixing. Since only signals for one isoscalar

schemes of the nonet structure in which $\eta_1(1855)$ can be either the higher
or lower mass state that strongly couples to $\eta\eta'$. Possible channels for
detecting the multiplets are suggested. In particular, a combined analysis of
the hybrid production in $J/\psi\to VH$, where $V$ and $H$ stand for the light
vector mesons and $1^{-(+)}$ hybrid states, may provide further evidence for
this nonet structure and finally establish these mysterious exotic species in

However, simulation samples velocity only at particle locations that leads to
information loss when projecting particle fields onto structured grid. Here we
extract two-point statistics without field projection. These statistics, i.e.
correlation, structure, dispersion functions in real space and spectrum
functions in Fourier space, are modeled on both small and large scales.
Kinematic relations between statistical measures are developed for
incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. The nature of dark
matter flow is identified by these relations. Much more complex than
incompressible flow, peculiar velocity of dark matter flow is of constant
divergence on small scale and irrotational on large scale. Incompressible and
constant divergence flow share same kinematic relations for even order
correlations. The limiting correlation of velocity $\rho_L=1/2$ on the smallest
scale ($r=0$) is a unique feature of collisionless flow ($\rho_L=1$ for
incompressible flow). Assuming gravity is the only interaction and no radiation
produced, this leads to an increase in particle mass converted from kinetic
energy upon ""annihilation"". On large scale, transverse velocity correlation has
an exponential form $T_2\propto e^{-r/r_2}$ with a comoving scale
$r_2$=21.3Mpc/h that maybe related to the size of sound horizon. All other
correlation, structure, dispersion and spectrum functions for velocity,
density, and potential are derived analytically from kinematic relations for
irrotational flow. On small scale, structure function follows one-fourth law of
$S^l_2\propto r^{1/4}$. All other statistical measures can be derived for
constant divergence flow. Vorticity is negatively correlated for scale $r$
between 1 and 7Mpc/h. Divergence is negatively correlated for $r$>30Mpc/h that
leads to negative density correlation.

turn to an optimization problem from the flight scheduling domain. The authors
compare the performance of such common gradient-free heuristic search
algorithms and propose variants of GAs. The Iterated Chaining (IC) method is
also introduced, building upon traditional chaining techniques by triggering
multiple local searches instead of the singular action of a mutation operator.
The authors will show that the use of multiple local searches can improve
performance on local stochastic searches, providing ample opportunity for
application to a host of other problem domains. It is observed that the
proposed GA variants have the least average cost across all benchmarks
including the problem proposed and IC algorithm performs better than its
constituents.

predominately to the peak feature at about -0.3 eV in tunneling conductance

Thus, finding a benchmark that could be used to measure fair income

is constructed based on the concepts of procedural justice, distributive
justice, and authority's power in professional sports where it is widely agreed

of fair rules, individual and/or team performance, and luck in line with
no-envy principle of fair allocation. Using the World Bank data, this study
demonstrates how the benchmark could be used to quantitatively gauge whether,
for a given value of the Gini index, the income shares by quintile of a country
are the fair shares or not, and if not, what fair income shares by quintile of
that country should be. Knowing this could be useful for those involved in
setting targets for the Gini index and the fair income shares that are
appropriate for the context of each country before formulating policies toward
achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 10 and other SDGs.

changes in the cavity refractive index (VO2 in the conducting state). In the
first state, the low loss regime enables to adjust the cavity length and easily
optimize the resonances due to the Fabry-Perot (FP) effect in the Si plates and

damping the FP oscillations in the plates, promotes the onset of a comb-like

model incorporates global structural symmetries and atomic relaxation effects,
benefits from the use of helical coordinates to specify the electronic fields,
and makes use of a specialized data generation process that solves the
symmetry-adapted equations of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory in these
coordinates. Using armchair single wall carbon nanotubes as a prototypical
example, we demonstrate the use of the model to predict the fields associated
with the ground state electron density and the nuclear pseudocharges, when
three parameters - namely, the radius of the nanotube, its axial stretch, and
the twist per unit length - are specified as inputs. Other electronic
properties of interest, including the ground state electronic free energy, can
then be evaluated with low-overhead post-processing, typically to chemical
accuracy. We also show how the nuclear coordinates can be reliably determined
from the pseudocharge field using a clustering based technique. Remarkably,
only about 120 data points are found to be enough to predict the three
dimensional electronic fields accurately, which we ascribe to the symmetry in
the problem setup, the use of low-discrepancy sequences for sampling, and
presence of intrinsic low-dimensional features in the electronic fields. We

$\tau\to e\gamma$, $\tau\to \mu\gamma$ in the three-loop radiative seesaw model
proposed by Krauss, Nasri, and Trodden. In this model, the relevant coupling
constants are larger for the heavier scalars that run inside loop diagrams to
generate the appropriate magnitude of neutrino masses. Imposing a criterion
that all the coupling constants must be small enough to be treated
perturbatively, we find an upper bound on the mass of one of the scalars. By
combining it with neutrino mass parameters, we derive lower bounds on the
branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating processes. In a case with the
inverted mass ordering and best-fit neutrino oscillation parameters, one of the
lower bounds is $\text{Br}(\mu\to e\gamma)>1.1\times 10^{-13}$, which is within
the reach of the MEG~II experiment.

In this paper, we present our tool-supported approach CiRA (Conditionals in

feasibility of CiRA in a case study with three industry partners. In our study,
out of 578 manually created test cases, 71.8 % can be generated automatically.

partial correlation, graphical models and autoregressive representations are
encoded in the inverse of its spectral density matrix. This is not true for
nonstationary time series, where the pertinent information lies in the inverse
infinite dimensional covariance matrix operator associated with the
multivariate time series. This necessitates the study of the covariance of a
multivariate nonstationary time series and its relationship to its inverse. We
show that if the rows/columns of the infinite dimensional covariance matrix
decay at a certain rate then the rate (up to a factor) transfers to the
rows/columns of the inverse covariance matrix. This is used to obtain a
nonstationary autoregressive representation of the time series and a
Baxter-type bound between the parameters of the autoregressive infinite
representation and the corresponding finite autoregressive projection. The
aforementioned results lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis of
locally stationary time series. In particular, we show that smoothness
properties on the covariance matrix transfer to (i) the inverse covariance (ii)
the parameters of the vector autoregressive representation and (iii) the
partial covariances. All results are set up in such a way that the constants

field theory whose main results are condensed into the celebrated
Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg (KLN) theorem. In this paper, we consider
mass-suppressed corrections to the leading (i.e. double-logarithmic) IR
divergences in the context of spontaneously broken gauge theories. We work in a
simplified theoretical set-up based on the spontaneously broken $U'(1)\otimes
U(1)$ gauge group. We analyze, at the one-loop level and including
mass-suppressed terms, the double-logarithmic corrections to the decay channels
of a hypothetical heavy $Z'$ gauge boson coupled to light chiral fermions and
mixed with a light massive $Z$ gauge boson. Limited to this theoretical
framework, only final state IR corrections are relevant. We find that full
exploitation of the KLN theorem requires non-trivial combinations of various
decay channels in order to get rid of the mass-suppressed IR corrections. Based
on this observation we show that, starting from any two-body decay of the heavy
$Z'$ gauge boson, the cancellation of the mass-suppressed double-logarithmic
corrections requires the sum over the full decay width (thus enforcing the
inclusion of final states which are na\""{\i}vely unrelated to the starting
one). En route, we prove a number of technical results that are relevant for
the computation of mass-suppressed double-logarithms of IR origin. Our results
are relevant for models that enlarge the Standard Model by adding a heavy $Z'$.

using the transfer matrix and linear renormalization group methods. In the
standard version (with the same only NN interactions in both legs) such a
ladder exhibits very interesting behavior - a frustration driven extremely
sharp phase crossover at finite temperature which resembles a phase transition,
impossible in one dimension. It is shown that in all considered cases with
different interactions in each leg (assymetric ladder), with NNN interactions
and in the presence of small external field such a crossover takes place when
the point at which the effective interleg coupling vanishes coincides with the
point at which the interleg correlation function exhibits an inflection point
accompanied by the specific heat maximum. A hypothesis is formulated that to
describe an abrupt change in political view of the people it is not necessary
to resort to a concept of a phase transition, controversial for social systems.
In some cases, this phenomenon can be understood as a phase crossover triggered
by the level of frustration. The source of this frustration is proposed as an
internal conflict between two areas of attitudes of the society members,
personal and economic, which are shaped by personality traits possibly modified
by life experience.

their operating lifetime, or lose financial support. Therefore, repowering
comes to the fore. However, social acceptance and land use restrictions have
been under constant change since the initial expansions, which makes less area
available for new turbines, even on existing sites. For the example of Germany,
this study assesses the repowering potential for onshore wind energy in high
detail, on the basis of regionally differentiated land eligibility criteria.
The results show that under the given regional criteria, repowering will
decrease both operating capacity and annual energy yield by roughly 40\,\%
compared to the status quo. This is because around half of the wind turbines
are currently located in restricted areas, given newly enacted exclusion
criteria. Sensitivity analyses on the exclusion criteria show that the minimum
distance to discontinuous urban fabric is the most sensitive criterion in
determining the number of turbines that can be repowered. As regulations on
this can vary substantially across different regions, the location-specific
methodology chosen here can assess the repowering potential more realistically
than existing approaches.

information retrieval. Existing methods typically rely on frequency-domain
representations to estimate the sung frequencies. However, this design does not
lead to human-level performance in the perception of melody information for
both tone (pitch-class) and octave. In this paper, we propose TONet, a
plug-and-play model that improves both tone and octave perceptions by
leveraging a novel input representation and a novel network architecture.
First, we present an improved input representation, the Tone-CFP, that
explicitly groups harmonics via a rearrangement of frequency-bins. Second, we
introduce an encoder-decoder architecture that is designed to obtain a salience
feature map, a tone feature map, and an octave feature map. Third, we propose a
tone-octave fusion mechanism to improve the final salience feature map.
Experiments are done to verify the capability of TONet with various baseline
backbone models. Our results show that tone-octave fusion with Tone-CFP can
significantly improve the singing voice extraction performance across various
datasets -- with substantial gains in octave and tone accuracy.

fork rebalancing, revamping holder-sensor fixation, and electrode
reconfiguration. Mass rebalancing allows the tuning fork to recover the
frequency and regain high Q-factor values up to 10E4 in air and up to 4 x 10E4

Combined with the soft wires, reconfigured electrodes provide electrical access
to the chip-like probe without intervening in the force-sensing signal.

Euclidean costs for $N$ discrete probability measures has recently attracted
considerable attention, in part because of the correspondence of its solutions
with Wasserstein-$2$ barycenters, which have many applications in data science.
In general, this problem is NP-hard, calling for practical approximative
algorithms. While entropic regularization has been successfully applied to
approximate Wasserstein barycenters, this loses the sparsity of the optimal
solution, making it difficult to solve the MOT problem directly in practice
because of the curse of dimensionality. Thus, for obtaining barycenters, one
usually resorts to fixed-support restrictions to a grid, which is, however,
prohibitive in higher ambient dimensions $d$. In this paper, after analyzing
the relationship between MOT and barycenters, we present two algorithms to
approximate the solution of MOT directly, requiring mainly just $N-1$ standard
two-marginal OT computations. Thus, they are fast, memory-efficient and easy to
implement and can be used with any sparse OT solver as a black box. Moreover,
they produce sparse solutions and show promising numerical results. We analyze
these algorithms theoretically, proving upper and lower bounds for the relative
approximation error.

estimate how much information the random variable $Y$ holds about the random
variable $X$. One way to define the mutual information is by comparing the
joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ with the product of the marginals through the
KL-divergence. If the two distributions are close to each other there will be
almost no leakage of $X$ from $Y$ since the two variables are close to being
independent. In the discrete setting the mutual information has the nice
interpretation of how many bits $Y$ reveals about $X$ and if $I(X;Y)=H(X)$ (the
Shannon entropy of $X$) then $X$ is completely revealed. However, in the
continuous case we do not have the same reasoning. For instance the mutual
information can be infinite in the continuous case. This fact enables us to try
different metrics or divergences to define the mutual information. In this
paper, we are evaluating different metrics or divergences such as
Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence, Wasserstein distance, Jensen-Shannon
divergence and total variation distance to form alternatives to the mutual
information in the continuous case. We deploy different methods to estimate or
bound these metrics and divergences and evaluate their performances.

nanomorphology complexity that is based on the deviation from the average
symmetry of surfaces. We present the methodology for its calculation and the
validation of its performance, using a series of synthetic surfaces where the
proposed complexity measure obtains a maximum value at the most heterogeneous
morphologies between the fully ordered and fully random cases. Additionally, we
measure the complexity of experimental micro and nanostructured surfaces

empiricism, in that it is naturalistic, such that it may only be temporary and
does not automatically apply to all other unobservables (or even just to all
other astronomical unobservables, as with Hacking's anti-realism). The argument
is illustrated with the analogy of the much longer history of the concept of a

relevant ways that of the early concept of genes.

taking into account linear effects of peculiar motions. By means of a Markov

infeasible to test using the entire group. Hence, it is standard practice to

invariance under its subgroups.
  We illustrate this in a generalized location model and obtain more powerful

a subgroup-invariance test is consistent for lower signal-to-noise ratios than
a test based on a random sample. For the special case of a normal location

reliable theoretical predictions, capable of describing experimental
measurements. This is traditionally done either by analytic resummation methods
or by parton shower (PS) Monte Carlo (MC) methods. In this talk we present the
Parton Branching (PB) MC method to obtain QCD collider predictions based on
Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization. The PB provides evolution
equations for TMD Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) which, upon fitting TMD
PDFs to experimental data, can be used in TMD MC event generators. We present
the basic concepts of the method and illustrate its applications to collider
measurements focusing on Drell-Yan (DY) lepton-pair production in different
kinematic ranges, from fixed-target to LHC energies. We discuss the latest
developments of the method concentrating especially on the matching of
next-to-leading-order (NLO) TMD evolution with MC-at-NLO calculations of NLO
matrix elements.

photometric observations from TESS sectors 24 and 25 together with 73

g/cm$^{-3}$. Due to the apparent brightness of the host star (J=8.7 mag) and
its small size, GJ 3929 b is a promising target for atmospheric
characterisation with the JWST. Additionally, the radial velocity data show
evidence for another planet candidate with $P_{[c]} = 14.303 +/- 0.035$ d,

because of their high mobility and low cost in serving as temporary aerial base

networks. To protect user privacy while avoiding detection by a warden, we
investigate a jammer-aided UAV covert communication system, which aims to
maximize the user's covert rate with optimized transmit and jamming power. The
UAV is equipped with multi-antennas to serve multi-users simultaneously and
enhance the Quality of Service. By considering the general composite fading and
shadowing channel models, we derive the exact probability density (PDF) and
cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the signal-to-interference-plusnoise
ratio (SINR). The obtained PDF and CDF are used to derive the closed-form
expressions for detection error probability and covert rate. Furthermore, the
covert rate maximization problem is formulated as a Nash bargaining game, and
the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) is introduced to investigate the negotiation
among users. To solve the NBS, we propose two algorithms, i.e., particle swarm
optimization-based and joint twostage power allocation algorithms, to achieve
covertness and high data rates under the warden's optimal detection threshold.
All formulated problems are proven to be convex, and the complexity is
analyzed. The numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical
performance analysis and show the effectiveness and success of achieving the

fundamental question: can non-adaptive methods like SGD enjoy similar benefits?
In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by proposing
to achieve both robust and memory-efficient training via the following general
recipe: (1) modify the architecture and make it scale invariant, i.e. the scale
of parameter doesn't affect the output of the network, (2) train with SGD and
weight decay, and optionally (3) clip the global gradient norm proportional to
weight norm multiplied by $\sqrt{\tfrac{2\lambda}{\eta}}$, where $\eta$ is
learning rate and $\lambda$ is weight decay. We show that this general approach
is robust to rescaling of parameter and loss by proving that its convergence
only depends logarithmically on the scale of initialization and loss, whereas
the standard SGD might not even converge for many initializations. Following
our recipe, we design a scale invariant version of BERT, called SIBERT, which
when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT
trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and ~100 for ISM. Except for the inner
regions, the GDR in IC2165 is nearly the same as in such AGB stars, indicating
that most dust grains withstand the harsh radiation field without being
destroyed. The gas and dust mass distributions concentrated in the equatorial
plane may be related to the nonisotropic mass loss during the AGB phase and
nebula shaping. The spatial distributions of electron densities/temperatures
and ionic/elemental abundances were investigated herein. We determined 13
elemental abundances using PSF-matched spatially integrated multiwavelength
spectra extracted from the same aperture. Their values are consistent with

introduces regularization, which is needed to solve the ill-posed problem and
reduces overfitting the data. In practice, however, this often results in a
suboptimal posterior temperature, and the full potential of the Bayesian
approach is not being exploited. In POTOBIM, we optimize both the parameters of
the prior distribution and the posterior temperature with respect to
reconstruction accuracy using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process
regression. Our method is extensively evaluated on four different inverse tasks
on a variety of modalities with images from public data sets and we demonstrate
that an optimized posterior temperature outperforms both non-Bayesian and

O-type stars on their parent molecular clouds and the triggering of formation
of future generation of stars. We study the infrared bubble S111 created by the
embedded massive stellar cluster G316.80-0.05. A significant fraction of gas in
shells created due to the compression of the ambient medium by expanding
bubbles is photodissociated by the stellar radiation. The kinematics of the
shells are thus best studied using spectroscopic observations of singly ionized
carbon, the most dominant species. We have used the velocity-resolved maps of
the $^2{\rm P}_{3/2}\rightarrow ^2{\rm P}_{1/2}$ transition of [C II] at 158
micron, the J=2-1 transition of 13CO and C18O, and the J=1-0 transition of
HCO^+ to study the rim of the bubble S111 that partly coincides with the
southern part of the infrared dark ridge G316.75. The [C II] spectra
conclusively show evidence of a shell expanding with a moderate velocity of ~7
km/s, which amounts to a kinetic energy that is ~0.5-40 times the thermal
energy of the H II region. The pressure causing the expansion of the H II
region arises mainly from the hydrogen ionization and the dust-processed
radiation. Among the far-infrared sources located in the compressed shells, we
find the core G316.7799-0.0942 to show broad spectral features consistent with
outflow activity and conclude that it is a site of active star formation. Based
on the age of the H II region we conclude that this expanding H II region is
responsible for the triggering of the current star formation activity in the
region.

where models should not discriminate their results based on race, gender, or
other protected groups. This is especially crucial for models affecting very
sensitive topics, like interview hiring or recidivism prediction. Fairness is
not commonly studied for regression problems compared to binary classification
problems; hence, we present a simple, yet effective method based on
normalisation (FaiReg), which minimises the impact of unfairness in regression
problems, especially due to labelling bias. We present a theoretical analysis
of the method, in addition to an empirical comparison against two standard
methods for fairness, namely data balancing and adversarial training. We also
include a hybrid formulation (FaiRegH), merging the presented method with data
balancing, in an attempt to face labelling and sample biases simultaneously.
The experiments are conducted on the multimodal dataset First Impressions (FI)
with various labels, namely personality prediction and interview screening
score. The results show the superior performance of diminishing the effects of
unfairness better than data balancing, also without deteriorating the
performance of the original problem as much as adversarial training.

thereby enhancing the T$_c$. The role of occupancy at the non-magnetic sites is
examined by contrasting with the case of Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$.

models usually fail to recover sharp edges present in the high-resolution (HR)
images for the reason that the model tends to give a statistical average of
potential HR solutions. During our research, we observe that gradient maps of
images generated by the models trained with the L1 or L2 loss have
significantly lower variance than the gradient maps of the original
high-resolution images. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above issue
by introducing a structure-enhancing loss function, coined Gradient Variance
(GV) loss, and generate textures with perceptual-pleasant details.
Specifically, during the training of the model, we extract patches from the
gradient maps of the target and generated output, calculate the variance of
each patch and form variance maps for these two images. Further, we minimize
the distance between the computed variance maps to enforce the model to produce
high variance gradient maps that will lead to the generation of high-resolution
images with sharper edges. Experimental results show that the GV loss can
significantly improve both Structure Similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise

proposed scheme with simultaneous diagonalization (SD) decomposes the MIMO
channel matrices of the users into scalar channels via higher-order generalized
singular value decomposition for the common message (CM) and block
diagonalization (BD) for the private messages, thereby enabling low-complexity
element-by-element successive interference cancellation (SIC) and decoding at
the receivers. Furthermore, the proposed SD MIMO-RSMA overcomes a critical
limitation in RSMA systems, whereby the achievable rate of the CM is restricted
by the users with weak effective MIMO channel for the CM, by excluding a subset
of users from decoding the CM. We formulate a non-convex weighted sum rate
(WSR) optimization problem for SD MIMO-RSMA and solve it via successive convex
approximation to obtain a locally optimal solution. Our simulation results
reveal that, for both perfect and imperfect CSI, the proposed SD MIMO-RSMA with
user exclusion outperforms baseline MIMO-RSMA schemes and linear BD precoding.

resulting from the evaporation-induced velocity jump at the interface. The
smeared mass source term approach incorporated in this work guarantees greater

evaporation at room temperature) are implemented in the i-CLSVoF. Corresponding
numerical benchmark cases (dam break, droplet relaxation and droplet
evaporation subjected to different evaporation models) are conducted to
validate the surface tension and the evaporation models. Good agreement between
the numerical and corresponding analytical solutions is found. The model
developed in this work shows convincing performance in modelling

We show, taking as an example Bermudan swaptions, that callable interest rate

discount bonds. The static portfolio composition is obtained by regressing the
target option's value using an interpretable, artificial neural network.
Leveraging on the approximation power of neural networks, we prove that the
hedging error can be arbitrarily small for a sufficiently large replication
portfolio. A direct, a lower bound, and an upper bound estimator for the
risk-neutral Bermudan swaption price is inferred from the hedging algorithm.
Additionally, closed-form error margins to the price statistics are determined.
We practically demonstrate the hedging and pricing performance through several

in the gapless dispersions in the band structure formed by the three lowest

applied to this optical dice lattice, the original spectral characteristics
could be changed, forming three gapped quasi-energy bands in the quasi-energy
Brillouin zone. The topological phase diagram containing the Chern number of
the lowest quasi-energy band shows that when the hopping strengths of the
nearest-neighboring hoppings are isotropic, the system persists in the
topologically non-trivial phases with Chern number $C=2$ within a wide range of
the driving strength. Accompanied by the anisotropic nearest-neighboring
hopping strengths, a topological phase transition occurs, making Chern number
change from $C=2$ to $C=1$. This transition is further verified by our
analytical method. Our theoretical work implies that it is feasible to realize
the non-trivially topological characteristics of optical dice lattices by
applying the periodic shaking, and that topological phase transition can be
observed by independently tuning the strength of a type of nearest-neighbor
hopping.

interest in viewing videos from soccer games continues to grow. In this
respect, it is important to provide game summaries and highlights of the main
game events. However, annotating and producing events and summaries often
require expensive equipment and a lot of tedious, cumbersome, manual labor.
Therefore, automating the video production pipeline providing fast game
highlights at a much lower cost is seen as the ""holy grail"". In this context,
recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have shown great
potential. Still, state-of-the-art approaches are far from being adequate for
practical scenarios that have demanding real-time requirements, as well as
strict performance criteria (where at least the detection of official events
such as goals and cards must be 100% accurate). In addition, event detection
should be thoroughly enhanced by annotation and classification, proper
clipping, generating short descriptions, selecting appropriate thumbnails for
highlight clips, and finally, combining the event highlights into an overall
game summary, similar to what is commonly aired during sports news. Even though
the event tagging operation has by far received the most attention, an
end-to-end video production pipeline also includes various other operations
which serve the overall purpose of automated soccer analysis. This challenge
aims to assist the automation of such a production pipeline using AI. In
particular, we focus on the enhancement operations that take place after an

theory and practice. In this paper, we highlight a further computational
difficulty when it comes to solving bilevel problems with continuous but
nonconvex lower levels. Even if the lower-level problem is solved to
$\varepsilon$-feasibility regarding its nonlinear constraints for an
arbitrarily small but positive $\varepsilon$, the obtained bilevel solution as
well as its objective value may be arbitrarily far away from the actual bilevel
solution and its actual objective value. This result even holds for bilevel
problems for which the nonconvex lower level is uniquely solvable, for which
the strict complementarity condition holds, for which the feasible set is
convex, and for which Slater's constraint qualification is satisfied for all
feasible upper-level decisions. Since the consideration of
$\varepsilon$-feasibility cannot be avoided when solving nonconvex problems to
global optimality, our result shows that computational bilevel optimization
with continuous and nonconvex lower levels needs to be done with great care.
Finally, we illustrate that the nonlinearities in the lower level are the key
reason for the observed bad behavior by showing that linear bilevel problems
behave much better at least on the level of feasible solutions.

for data protection into software systems. Objective: We present an approach to
decrease privacy risks during agile software development by automatically
detecting privacy-related information in the context of user story
requirements, a prominent notation in agile Requirement Engineering (RE).
Methods: The proposed approach combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
linguistic resources with deep learning algorithms to identify privacy aspects

the semantic and syntactic structure of the text. This information is then
processed by a pre-trained convolutional neural network, which paved the way

proposed approach by performing an empirical study with a dataset of 1680 user

different layers: the hard core of a nanoparticle and the soft corona of
grafted polymers on the surface. It is predicted that PGNPs with these two
distinct layers will have similar behaviors as star polymers and hard spheres.
The interaction between PGNPs strongly depend upon their grafting density and
the length of the grafted polymer chains, N. Thus, PGNP may exhibit
polymorphism. Moreover, it is expected that crystals made from PGNPs will be
structurally tough due to the entanglement of grafted polymers. The crystal
polymorph of PGNP is explored using molecular dynamics simulations. We
succeeded in finding FCC/HCP and BCC crystals depending on the length of the
grafted polymer chain. When N is small, PGNPs behave like hard spheres. The
crystals formed are arranged in FCC/HCP structure, much like the phase
transition observed in an Alder transition. When N is large enough, the
increase in the free energy of grafted polymers can no longer be neglected.
Thus, the crystals formed in these systems are arranged in BCC structure, which
has a lower density than FCC/HCP. When N is not too small or large, FCC/HCP
structures are observed when the concentration of PGNPs is low, but a phase
transition occurs when the concentration of PGNPs becomes higher with the
compression of the system. Again, the increase in free energy of grafted
polymers can no longer be neglected and the crystals arrange themselves in a
BCC structure. Also, it can be revealed that the lattice spacing of PGNP
crystals can be controlled easily and widely by the chain length. These results
should play an important role in many future simulations and experimental

establish an efficient mapping between training data and configuration

to explore millions of polaron configurations for two different systems, oxygen

the ML-aided search correctly individuates the ground-state polaron patterns,
proposes polaronic configurations not visited in the training and can be used

Quantitatively similar asymmetries in Hawkes parameters are found across all

441-465, 1987), which applied to weakly inertial particles, to particles of
arbitrary inertia, and the new theoretical result revealed the role that
different scales play in the preferential sweeping mechanism that leads to
enhanced particle settling in turbulent flows. Monchaux & Dejoan (Phys. Rev.
Fluids, 2, 104302, 2017) showed using direct numerical simulations (DNS) that
while for low particle loading the effect of two-way coupling (2WC) on the
global flow statistics is weak, 2WC enables the particles to drag the fluid in
their vicinity down with them, significantly enhancing their settling, and they
argued that 2WC suppresses the preferential sweeping mechanism. We explore this
further by considering the impact of 2WC on the contribution made by eddies of
different sizes on the particle settling. In agreement with Monchaux & Dejoan,
we show that even for low loading, 2WC strongly enhances particle settling, and
we show how 2WC modifies the contribution from different flow scales. However,
contrary to their study, we show that preferential sweeping remains important
in 2WC flows. In particular, for both 1WC and 2WC flows, the settling
enhancement due to turbulence is dominated by contributions from particles in
straining regions of the flow, but for the 2WC case, the particles in these
regions also drag the fluid down with them, leading to an enhancement of their
settling compared to the 1WC case.

is generally possible to correlate the heat maps with the anisotropy of the

are treated as particles and electrons as an inertial fluid, have begun to
attract a significant interest recently. Hybrid-kinetic models describe both
ion- and electron scale processes by ignoring electron kinetic effects so that
they are computationally much less demanding compared to fully kinetic plasma
models. Hybrid-kinetic codes solve either the Vlasov equation for the ions
(Eulerian Vlasov-hybrid codes) or the equations of motion of the ions as
macro-particles (Lagrangian Particle-in-Cell (PIC)-hybrid codes). They consider
the inertia of the electron fluid using different approximations. We check the
validity of these approximations by employing our recently massively
parallelized three-dimensional PIC-hybrid code CHIEF which considers the
electron inertia without any of the common approximations. In particular we
report the results of simulations of two-dimensional collisionless plasma
turbulence. We conclude that the simulation results obtained using
hybrid-kinetic codes which use approximations to describe the electron inertia
need to be interpreted with caution. We also discuss the parallel scalability

calculation and emotion recognition tasks, where participants answered after
referring to the answers of an AI agent, a human, or a social robot. During the
experiment, the participants rated their trust levels in their partners. As a
result, trust in the social robot was basically neither similar to that in the
AI agent nor in the human and instead settled between them. The results showed
a possibility that manipulating anthropomorphic features would help assist
human users in appropriately calibrating trust in an agent.

  Review","72 pages",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Melody extraction is a vital music information retrieval task among music
researchers for its potential applications in education pedagogy and the music
industry. Melody extraction is a notoriously challenging task due to the
presence of background instruments. Also, often melodic source exhibits similar
characteristics to that of the other instruments. The interfering background
accompaniment with the vocals makes extracting the melody from the mixture
signal much more challenging. Until recently, classical signal processing-based
melody extraction methods were quite popular among melody extraction
researchers. The ability of the deep learning models to model large-scale data
and the ability of the models to learn automatic features by exploiting spatial
and temporal dependencies inspired many researchers to adopt deep learning
models for melody extraction. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review
the up-to-date data-driven deep learning approaches for melody extraction from
polyphonic music. The available deep models have been categorized based on the
type of neural network used and the output representation they use for
predicting melody. Further, the architectures of the 25 melody extraction
models are briefly presented. The loss functions used to optimize the model
parameters of the melody extraction models are broadly categorized into four
categories and briefly describe the loss functions used by various melody
extraction models. Also, the various input representations adopted by the
melody extraction models and the parameter settings are deeply described. A
section describing the explainability of the block-box melody extraction deep
neural networks is included. The performance of 25 melody extraction methods is
compared. The possible future directions to explore/improve the melody
extraction methods are also presented in the paper.

to be deployed in difficult areas with limited room for instrumentation, e.g.,
narrow tunnels. To address this limitation, we have developed a portable muon
detector (muoscope) based on glass Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) with an
active area of 16 $\times$ 16 cm$^{2}$. The specific design goals taken into

explore the bias induced transformations that underpin the functionality of
broad classes of devices and functional materials from batteries and memristors

materials require probing the mechanisms of these transformations on the
nanometer scale as a function of the broad range of control parameters such as
applied potential and time, often leading to experimentally intractable
scenarios. At the same time, often the behaviors of these systems are
understood within potentially competing theoretical models, or hypotheses.
Here, we develop a hypothesis list that covers the possible limiting scenarios
for the domain growth, including thermodynamic, domain wall pinning, and
screening limited. We further develop and experimentally implement the
hypothesis driven automated experiment in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy,
autonomously identifying the mechanisms of the bias induced domain switching.

experiments with relatively low dimensional control parameter space and for
which the possible competing models of the system behavior that ideally cover

necessarily a reliable estimate of the average outcome for an individual over

somehow aim at stable estimates of the cause that will generalize to new
individuals in the long run. Therefore, the valid analysis must extract an
ergodic stationary measure from fluctuating physiological data. So the
challenge is to extract statistical estimates that may describe or quantify
some of this nonergodicity (i.e., of the raw measured data) without themselves
(i.e., the estimates) being nonergodic. We show that traditional linear
statistics such as the standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV),

measure the polarization of X-ray emission from tens of astronomical sources.
Its focal plane detectors are based on the Gas Pixel Detector, which measures
the polarization by imaging photoelectron tracks in a gas mixture and
reconstructing their initial directions. The quality of the single track, and
then the capability of correctly determining the original direction of the
photoelectron, depends on many factors, e.g., whether the photoelectron is
emitted at low or high inclination with respect to the collection plane or the
occurrence of a large Coulomb scattering close to the generation point. The
reconstruction algorithm used by IXPE to obtain the photoelectron emission
direction, also calculates several properties of the shape of the tracks which
characterize the process. In this paper we compare several such properties and
identify the best one to weight each track on the basis of the reconstruction
accuracy. We demonstrate that significant improvement in sensitivity can be
achieved with this approach and for this reason it will be the baseline for

This approach offers a unique platform for all-carbon electronic devices but
requires careful optimization of the growth conditions to match structural
requirements for successful device integration, with GNR length being the most
critical parameter. In this work, we study the growth, characterization, and
device integration of 5-atom wide armchair GNRs (5-AGNRs), which are expected
to have an optimal band gap as active material in switching devices. 5-AGNRs
are obtained via on-surface synthesis under ultra-high vacuum conditions from
Br- and I-substituted precursors. We show that the use of I-substituted
precursors and the optimization of the initial precursor coverage quintupled
the average 5-AGNR length. This significant length increase allowed us to
integrate 5-AGNRs into devices and to realize the first field-effect transistor
based on narrow bandgap AGNRs that shows switching behavior at room
temperature. Our study highlights that optimized growth protocols can
successfully bridge between the sub-nanometer scale, where atomic precision is
needed to control the electronic properties, and the scale of tens of
nanometers relevant for successful device integration of GNRs.

linear systems, and its basic idea is to estimate the system parameter matrices
by projecting them into a subspace related to input and output. However, most
of the existing subspace methods cannot have the statistic performance
guaranteed since the lack of closed-form expression of the estimation.
Meanwhile, traditional subspace methods cannot deal with the uncertainty of the
noise, and thus stable identification results cannot be obtained. In this
paper, we propose a novel improved subspace method from the perspective of
input design, which guarantees the consistent and stable identification results
with the minimum variance. Specifically, we first obtain a closed-form
estimation of the system matrix, then analyze the statistic performance by
deriving the maximum identification deviation. This identification deviation
maximization problem is non-convex, and is solved by splitting it into two
sub-problems with the optimal solution guaranteed. Next, an input design method
is proposed to deal with the uncertainty and obtain stable identification
results by minimizing the variance. This problem is formulated as a constrained
min-max optimization problem. The optimal solution is obtained from
transforming the cost function into a convex function while ensuring the safety
constraints through the method of predictive control. We prove the consistency
and the convergence of the proposed method. Simulation demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method.

done with hierarchical models, that is, models that consider intra-subject and

medical studies often takes values in nonlinear manifolds. Here, as a first
step, geodesic hierarchical models have been developed that generalize the
linear ansatz by assuming that time-induced intra-subject variations occur
along a generalized straight line in the manifold. However, this is often not
the case (e.g., periodic motion or processes with saturation). We propose a
hierarchical model for manifold-valued data that extends this to include trends
along higher-order curves, namely B\'ezier splines in the manifold. To this

the improved version of the isolation forest algorithm. Unlike the isolation
forest algorithm, the RCF algorithm has the power of determining whether the
real-time input has anomaly by inserting the input in the constructed tree
network. There have been developed various RCF algorithms including Robust RCF
(RRCF) with which the cutting procedure is adaptively chosen probabilistically.
The RRCF algorithm shows better performance than the isolation forest as the
cutting dimension is decided based on the geometric range of the data. The
overall data structure is, however, not considered in the adaptive cutting
algorithm with the RRCF algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new RCF
algorithm, so-called the weighted RCF (WRCF) algorithm. In order to introduce
the WRCF, we first introduce a new geometric measure, a density measure which
is crucial for the construction of the WRCF. We provide various mathematical
properties of the density measure. The proposed WRCF also cuts the tree network
adaptively, but with the consideration of the denseness of the data. The

classical theory has a linear relationship with the elastic scattering factor
at the quasi-static velocity limit, whereas the reference FE and
self-consistent (SC) results generally exhibit a quadratic relationship. As
supported by the results of 90 materials, such order difference also extends to
the attenuation and phase velocity, leading to larger differences between the
classical theory and the FE results for more strongly scattering materials.
Alternatively, two approximate models are proposed to achieve more accurate
calculations by including an additional quadratic term. One model uses
quadratic coefficients from quasi-static SC velocity fits and is thus
symmetry-specific, while the other uses theoretically-determined coefficients
and is valid for any individual material. These simple models generally deliver
more accurate attenuation and phase velocity (particularly the second model)
than the classical theory, especially for strongly scattering materials.
However, the models are invalid for the attenuation of materials with negative

datasets. Specifically, we train a neural network on the simple yet intricate
task of predicting the temporal distance between atmospheric fields from
distinct but nearby times. We demonstrate that training with this task on ERA5
reanalysis leads to internal representations capturing intrinsic aspects of
atmospheric dynamics. We do so by introducing a data-driven distance metric for
atmospheric states. When employed as a loss function in other machine learning
applications, this Atmodist distance leads to improved results compared to the
classical $\ell_2$-loss. For example, for downscaling one obtains higher
resolution fields that match the true statistics more closely than previous
approaches and for the interpolation of missing or occluded data the AtmoDist
distance leads to results that contain more realistic fine scale features.
Since it is derived from observational data, AtmoDist also provides a novel

of time, then this favors the shift back to the energetically favorable
crystalline phase. With the growing interest in next generation data storage
technology for photonic and neuromorphic computing, the research into
understanding and improving the properties of GST alloys has also been
rekindled. In this term paper we hope to investigate and gain a deeper
understanding and appreciation of the kinetics and underlying atomistic
mechanism of this phase transition from c-GST to a-GST and vice-versa which is

and conditional Zwanzig projection techniques and use it to derive a
Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) for a general interacting many-body system.
The resulting GLE includes i) explicitly the potential of mean force (PMF) that
describes the equilibrium distribution of the system in the chosen space of
reaction coordinates, ii) a random force term that explicitly depends on the
initial state of the system, and iii) a memory friction contribution that
splits into two parts: a part that is linear in the past reaction-coordinate
velocity and a part that is in general non-linear in the past reaction
coordinates but does not depend on velocities. Our hybrid scheme thus combines
all desirable properties of the Zwanzig and Mori projection schemes. The
non-linear memory friction contribution is shown to be related to correlations
between the reaction-coordinate velocity and the random force. We present a
numerical method to compute all parameters of our GLE, in particular, the
non-linear memory friction function and the random force distribution, from a
trajectory in reaction coordinate space. We apply our method to the
dihedral-angle dynamics of a butane molecule in water obtained from atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations. For this example, we demonstrate that
non-linear memory friction is present and that the random force exhibits
significant non-Gaussian corrections. We also present the derivation of the GLE
for multidimensional reaction coordinates that are general functions of all
positions in the phase space of the underlying many-body system; this
corresponds to a systematic coarse-graining procedure that preserves not only
the correct equilibrium behavior but also the correct dynamics of the
coarse-grained system.

requires assessment of ischemic stroke and bleeding risks. However, risk
stratification schemas such as CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED have modest predictive
capacity for patients with AF. Machine learning (ML) techniques may improve
predictive performance and support decision-making for appropriate
antithrombotic therapy. We compared the performance of multilabel ML models
with the currently used risk scores for predicting outcomes in AF patients.
Materials and Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 9670 patients,
mean age 76.9 years, 46% women, who were hospitalized with non-valvular AF, and
had 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke and major
bleeding admission. The secondary outcomes were all-cause death and event-free
survival. The discriminant power of ML models was compared with clinical risk
scores by the area under the curve (AUC). Risk stratification was assessed
using the net reclassification index. Results Multilabel gradient boosting
machine provided the best discriminant power for stroke, major bleeding, and
death (AUC = 0.685, 0.709, and 0.765 respectively) compared to other ML models.
It provided modest performance improvement for stroke compared to CHA2DS2-VASc
(AUC = 0.652), but significantly improved major bleeding prediction compared to
HAS-BLED (AUC = 0.522). It also had a much greater discriminant power for death
compared with CHA2DS2-VASc (AUC = 0.606). Also, models identified additional
risk features (such as hemoglobin level, renal function, etc.) for each
outcome. Conclusions Multilabel ML models can outperform clinical risk
stratification scores for predicting the risk of major bleeding and death in
non-valvular AF patients.

integration times, the probability of failure (Pfail) is determined by the
integrated jitter power up to a critical frequency, which we verify by
comparing the results of an analytical model to those of Monte Carlo
simulations. Jitter above the critical frequency leads to a loss of correlation
between integration windows and decreases Pfail for both, 1d (radial) and 2d
(radial and tangential) jitter, as long as the RMS jitter amplitude does not
exceed the beam diameter. In the opposite limit of fast scans and short
integration times, emergent correlations between jitter fluctuations on two
adjacent scanning tracks also decrease Pfail. The analytical model is
additionally used to assess the effect of multiple overlapping tracks and the
impact of target drifts in the uncertainty plane.

of financial assets in large part and they continue to occur from time to time
surprisingly. In order to discover features of the financial network, the
pairwise interaction of stocks has been considered in many research, but the
existence of the strong correlation of stocks and their collective behavior in
crisis made us address higher-order interactions. Hence, in this study, we
investigate financial networks by triplet interaction in the framework of
balance theory. Due to detecting the contribution of higher-order interactions
in understanding the complex behavior of stocks we take the advantage of the
orders parameters of the higher-order interactions. Looking at real data of
financial market obtained from $S\&P500$ through the lens of balance theory for
the quest of network structure in different periods of time near and far from
crisis reveals the existence of a structural difference of the network that
corresponds to different periods of time. Here, we address two well-known
crises the Great regression (2008) and the Covid-19 recession (2020). Results
show an ordered structure forms on-crisis in the financial network while stocks
behave independently far from a crisis. The formation of the ordered structure
of stocks in crisis makes the network resistant against disorder. The
resistance of the ordered structure against applying a disorder (temperature)
can measure the crisis strength and determine the temperature at which the
network transits. There is a critical temperature, $T_{c}$, in the language of
statistical mechanics and mean-field approach which above, the ordered
structure destroys abruptly and a first-order phase transition occurs. The
stronger the crisis, the higher the critical temperature.

employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism

open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a

probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used

persistent. Discrimination in job vacancies can be explicit by directly
referring to demographic memberships of candidates. More implicit forms of
discrimination are also present that may not always be illegal but still
influence the diversity of applicants. Explicit written discrimination is still
present in numerous job vacancies, as was recently observed in the Netherlands.
Current efforts for the detection of explicit discrimination concern the
identification of job vacancies containing potentially discriminating terms
such as ""young"" or ""male"". However, automatic detection is inefficient due to
low precision: e.g. ""we are a young company"" or ""working with mostly male
patients"" are phrases that contain explicit terms, while the context shows that
these do not reflect discriminatory content.
  In this paper, we show how machine learning based computational language
models can raise precision in the detection of explicit discrimination by
identifying when the potentially discriminating terms are used in a
discriminatory context. We focus on gender discrimination, which indeed suffers
from low precision when filtering explicit terms. First, we created a data set
for gender discrimination in job vacancies. Second, we investigated a variety
of computational language models for discriminatory context detection. Third,
we evaluated the capability of these models to detect unforeseen discriminating
terms in context. The results show that machine learning based methods can
detect explicit gender discrimination with high precision and help in finding
new forms of discrimination. Accordingly, the proposed methods can
substantially increase the effectiveness of detecting job vacancies which are
highly suspected to be discriminatory. In turn, this may lower the
discrimination experienced at the start of the recruitment process.

visibility and remote accessibility is the Internet of Things (IoT). Rapid
deployment of this application can significantly transform the health, housing,
and power (distribution and generation) sectors, etc. It has considerably
changed the power sector regarding operations, services optimization, power
distribution, asset management and aided in engaging customers to reduce energy
consumption. Despite its societal opportunities and the benefits it presents,
the power generation sector is bedeviled with many security challenges on the
critical infrastructure. This review discusses the security challenges posed by
IoT in power generation and critical infrastructure. To achieve this, the
authors present the various IoT applications, particularly on the grid
infrastructure, from an empirical literature perspective. The authors concluded
by discussing how the various entities in the sector can overcome these
security challenges to ensure an exemplary future IoT implementation on the
power critical infrastructure value chain.

  Modeling","Accepted at ICLR 2023. Camera ready version",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised learning has significantly improved the performance of many
NLP tasks. However, how can self-supervised learning discover useful
representations, and why is it better than traditional approaches such as
probabilistic models are still largely unknown. In this paper, we focus on the
context of topic modeling and highlight a key advantage of self-supervised
learning - when applied to data generated by topic models, self-supervised
learning can be oblivious to the specific model, and hence is less susceptible
to model misspecification. In particular, we prove that commonly used
self-supervised objectives based on reconstruction or contrastive samples can
both recover useful posterior information for general topic models.
Empirically, we show that the same objectives can perform on par with posterior
inference using the correct model, while outperforming posterior inference
using misspecified models.

  from Unstructured Electronic Health Records","24 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI)
systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural
language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key
technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there
are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical
domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions
of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical
language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize
unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical
language model - GatorTron - using >90 billion words of text (including >82
billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on
5 clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation
extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and
medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of
parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these
NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110
million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve 5 clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6%
and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to
medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery. The GatorTron models are

  Molecular Properties","25 pages including 6-page Supporting Information",,,,"physics.chem-ph cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The graph neural network (GNN) has been a powerful deep-learning tool in
chemistry domain, due to its close connection with molecular graphs. Most GNN
models collect and update atom and molecule features from the fed atom (and, in
some cases, bond) features, which are basically based on the two-dimensional
(2D) graph representation of 3D molecules. Correspondingly, the adjacency
matrix, containing the information on covalent bonds, or equivalent data
structures (e.g., lists) have been the main core in the feature-updating
processes, such as graph convolution. However, the 2D-based models do not
faithfully represent 3D molecules and their physicochemical properties,
exemplified by the overlooked field effect that is a ""through-space"" effect,
not a ""through-bond"" effect. The GNN model proposed herein, denoted as MolNet,
is chemically intuitive, accommodating the 3D non-bond information in a
molecule, with a noncovalent adjacency matrix $\bf{\bar A}$, and also
bond-strength information from a weighted bond matrix $\bf{B}$. The noncovalent
atoms, not directly bonded to a given atom in a molecule, are identified within
5 $\unicode{x212B}$ of cut-off range for the construction of $\bf{\bar A}$, and
$\bf{B}$ has edge weights of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 for single, aromatic, double, and
triple bonds, respectively. Comparative studies show that MolNet outperforms
various baseline GNN models and gives a state-of-the-art performance in the
classification task of BACE dataset and regression task of ESOL dataset. This
work suggests a future direction of deep-learning chemistry in the construction
of deep-learning models that are chemically intuitive and comparable with the
existing chemistry concepts and tools.
