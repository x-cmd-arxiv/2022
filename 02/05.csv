of research has focused on improving existing methods using supervised methods,

this study, a reinforcement learning model is introduced that can outperform
existing models through a semi-supervised approach. The main novelty of the
proposed method lies in the introduction of a semi-supervised hard attention

and separated from the non-informative parts of the data. A model's accuracy is
improved by removing redundant data and focusing on useful visual information
in a higher resolution. Implementing hard attention mechanisms using
semi-supervised reinforcement learning algorithms eliminates the need for
attention annotations in video violence datasets, thus making them readily

safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a

  Combining our reduction with a deep result proved by Banaszczyk via convex

and EST, will dramatically improve on current capabilities for simultaneous
multi-line polarimetric observations in a wide range of wavelength bands, from
the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. As a result, there will be an
increasing demand for fast diagnostic tools, i.e., inversion codes, that can
infer the physical properties of the solar atmosphere from the vast amount of
data these observatories will produce. The advent of substantially larger
apertures, with the concomitant increase in polarimetric sensitivity, will
drive an increased interest in observing chromospheric spectral lines.
Accordingly, pertinent inversion codes will need to take account of line
formation under general non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) conditions.
Several currently available codes can already accomplish this, but they have a
common practical limitation that impairs the speed at which they can invert
polarised spectra, namely that they employ numerical evaluation of the
so-called response functions to changes in the atmospheric parameters, which
makes them less suitable for the analysis of very large data volumes. Here we
present DeSIRe (Departure coefficient aided Stokes Inversion based on Response
functions), an inversion code that integrates the well-known inversion code SIR
with the NLTE radiative transfer solver RH. The DeSIRe runtime benefits from
employing analytical response functions computed in local thermodynamic
equilibrium (through SIR), modified with fixed departure coefficients to
incorporate NLTE effects in chromospheric spectral lines. This publication
describes the operating fundamentals of DeSIRe and describes its behaviour,
robustness, stability, and speed. The code is ready to be used by the solar
community and is being made publicly available.

efficiently expels the remaining gas and reduces the final cluster mass by a

rate. It is becoming clear that providing robust guarantees on systems that use
neural networks is very important, especially in safety-critical applications.
A trained neural network's sensitivity to adversarial attacks is one of its
greatest shortcomings. To provide robust guarantees, one popular method that
has seen success is to bound the activation functions using equality and
inequality constraints. However, there are numerous ways to form these bounds,
providing a trade-off between conservativeness and complexity. Depending on the
complexity of these bounds, the computational time of the optimisation problem
varies, with longer solve times often leading to tighter bounds. We approach
the problem from a different perspective, using sparse polynomial optimisation
theory and the Positivstellensatz, which derives from the field of real
algebraic geometry. The former exploits the natural cascading structure of the
neural network using ideas from chordal sparsity while the later asserts the
emptiness of a semi-algebraic set with a nested family of tests of
non-decreasing accuracy to provide tight bounds. We show that bounds can be
tightened significantly, whilst the computational time remains reasonable. We
compare the solve times of different solvers and show how the accuracy can be

Due to class imbalance in the sensitive attribute observed in the datasets, ML
models are unfair on minority subgroups identified by a sensitive attribute,
such as race and sex. In-processing fairness algorithms ensure model
predictions are independent of sensitive attribute. Furthermore, ML models are
vulnerable to attribute inference attacks where an adversary can identify the
values of sensitive attribute by exploiting their distinguishable model
predictions. Despite privacy and fairness being important pillars of
trustworthy ML, the privacy risk introduced by fairness algorithms with respect
to attribute leakage has not been studied. We identify attribute inference
attacks as an effective measure for auditing blackbox fairness algorithms to
enable model builder to account for privacy and fairness in the model design.
We proposed Dikaios, a privacy auditing tool for fairness algorithms for model
builders which leveraged a new effective attribute inference attack that
account for the class imbalance in sensitive attributes through an adaptive
prediction threshold. We evaluated Dikaios to perform a privacy audit of two
in-processing fairness algorithms over five datasets. We show that our
attribute inference attacks with adaptive prediction threshold significantly
outperform prior attacks. We highlighted the limitations of in-processing
fairness algorithms to ensure indistinguishable predictions across different
values of sensitive attributes. Indeed, the attribute privacy risk of these
in-processing fairness schemes is highly variable according to the proportion
of the sensitive attributes in the dataset. This unpredictable effect of
fairness mechanisms on the attribute privacy risk is an important limitation on
their utilization which has to be accounted by the model builder.

tropical cyclone (TC) satellite imagery signal an upcoming rapid intensity
change event. To address this question, we propose a new nonparametric test of
association between a time series of images and a series of binary event
labels. We ask whether there is a difference in distribution between (dependent
but identically distributed) 24-h sequences of images preceding an event versus
a non-event. By rewriting the statistical test as a regression problem, we
leverage neural networks to infer modes of structural evolution of TC
convection that are representative of the lead-up to rapid intensity change
events. Dependencies between nearby sequences are handled by a bootstrap
procedure that estimates the marginal distribution of the label series. We
prove that type I error control is guaranteed as long as the distribution of
the label series is well-estimated, which is made easier by the extensive
historical data for binary TC event labels. We show empirical evidence that our
proposed method identifies archetypes of infrared imagery associated with
elevated rapid intensification risk, typically marked by deep or deepening core
convection over time. Such results provide a foundation for improved forecasts
of rapid intensification.

quadratic-exponential functional (QEF) is considered as a risk-sensitive
performance criterion for a finite fragment of the network over a bounded time

The local representation of each sample models non-stationarity over time with

iterative self knowledge distillation (ISKD) to train lightweight pothole
classifiers. Designed to improve both the teacher and student models over time
in knowledge distillation, ISKD outperforms the state-of-the-art self knowledge
distillation method on three pothole classification datasets across four

distillation should be done iteratively instead of just once. The accuracy
relation between the teacher and student models shows that the student model
can still benefit from a moderately trained teacher model. Implying that better
teacher models generally produce better student models, our results justify the
design of ISKD. In addition to pothole classification, we also demonstrate the
efficacy of ISKD on six additional datasets associated with generic
classification, fine-grained classification, and medical imaging application,
which supports that ISKD can serve as a general-purpose performance booster
without the need of a given teacher model and extra trainable parameters.

phenomena occurring in viscoelastic fractures. However, in some cases,
conflicting results are obtained despite the use of similar theoretical models.
For this reason, we try to shed light on the effects that long and short-range
adhesion has on the pull-off force in the contact of viscoelastic media by
exploiting a recently developed numerical model. We find that, in the limit of
long-range adhesion, the unloading velocity has little effect on the pull-off
force, which is close to the value predicted by Bradley for rigid bodies. In
such case, the detachment process is characterized by a uniform bond-breaking
of the contact area, and viscous dissipation involves the bulk material. For
medium(short)-range adhesion, the pull-off force is instead a monotonic
increasing function of the pulling velocity and, at high speeds, reaches a
plateau that is a function of the adiabatic surface energy. In this case, the
detachment process is similar to the opening of a circular crack, and viscous
dissipation is localized at the contact edge.

tSZ-like distortion in the CIB. Focusing on the CIB monopole, we use a halo
model approach to calculate both the CIB signal and the Compton-$y$ field that
generates the distortion. We self-consistently account for the redshift
co-evolution of the CIB and Compton-$y$ fields: they are (partially) sourced by
the same dark matter halos, which introduces new aspects to the calculation as
compared to the CMB case. We find that the inverse-Compton distortion to the
CIB monopole spectrum has a positive (negative) peak amplitude of $\approx 4$
Jy/sr ($\approx -5$ Jy/sr) at 2260 GHz (940 GHz). In contrast to the usual tSZ
effect, the distortion to the CIB spectrum has two null frequencies, at
approximately 196 GHz and 1490 GHz. We perform a Fisher matrix calculation to
forecast the detectability of this new distortion signal by future experiments.
$\textit{PIXIE}$ would have sufficient instrumental sensitivity to detect the
signal at $4\sigma$, but foreground contamination reduces the projected
signal-to-noise by a factor of $\approx 70$. A future ESA Voyage 2050
spectrometer could detect the CIB distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ significance,

impacts of infrequent and extreme events. Using data on the four sectors of the
U.S. financial industry from 1996 to 2011, we uncover two key empirical
findings. First, disregarding the effect of the tail dependence factor leads to
a downward bias in the measurement of systemic risk, especially during weak

for benchmarking and improving low light restoration (LLR) algorithms. While
several LLR algorithms exist, the subjective perception of the restored images
has been much less studied. Challenges in capturing aligned low light and
well-lit image pairs and collecting a large number of human opinion scores of
quality for training, warrant the design of unsupervised (or opinion unaware)
no-reference (NR) QA methods. This work studies the subjective perception of
low light restored images and their unsupervised NR QA. Our contributions are
two-fold. We first create a dataset of restored low light images using various
LLR methods, conduct a subjective QA study and benchmark the performance of
existing QA methods. We then present a self-supervised contrastive learning
technique to extract distortion aware features from the restored low light
images. We show that these features can be effectively used to build an opinion
unaware image quality analyzer. Detailed experiments reveal that our
unsupervised NR QA model achieves state-of-the-art performance among all such
quality measures for low light restored images.

necessary conditions to protect privacy, including: preventing over-fitting and
adding some amount of randomness. However, we also show that such a na\""ive LTU

unique data set, the Spanish Survey of Household Finance (EFF). We propose a
theoretical model in which households, given a fixed investment in housing,
allocate their net wealth across bank time deposits, stocks, and mortgage.
Besides considering housing as an indivisible and illiquid asset that restricts
the portfolio choice decision, we take into account the financial constraints
that households face when they apply for external funding. For every
representative household in the EFF we solve this theoretical problem and
obtain the theoretically optimal portfolio that is compared with households'
actual choices. We find that households significantly underinvest in stocks and
deposits while the optimal and actual mortgage investments are alike.
Considering the three types of financial assets at once, we find that the
households headed by highly financially sophisticated, older, retired, richer,

well-designed technology that flexibly adapts to the person's dynamically

applications involves training algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural

overcome technical challenges associated with training CNNs, several research
communities have recently developed platforms that incorporate DL in
easy-to-use interfaces. We review key characteristics of four AI-powered
platforms -- Wildlife Insights (WI), MegaDetector (MD), Machine Learning for
Wildlife Image Classification (MLWIC2), and Conservation AI -- including data
management tools and AI features. We also provide R code in an open-source
GitBook, to demonstrate how users can evaluate model performance, and
incorporate AI output in semi-automated workflows. We found that species
classifications from WI and MLWIC2 generally had low recall values (animals
that were present in the images often were not classified to the correct
species). Yet, the precision of WI and MLWIC2 classifications for some species
was high (i.e., when classifications were made, they were generally accurate).
MD, which classifies images using broader categories (e.g., ""blank"" or

classifiers were not accurate enough to automate image processing, DL could be
used to improve efficiencies by accepting classifications with high confidence

analysis and model are extended to squeezed vacuum states of open systems,
adding the decoherence effects of damping and dephasing. To increase
experimental relevance, the regime of strong damping is considered. These
effects are investigated, yielding similar asymptotic results for the behavior
of these effects in the large squeezing regime. Combining these results, it is
shown that a weak nonlinearity as compared to damping may be improved by
increasing the squeezing of the initial state. It is also shown that this may

Janus particles, a special class of heterogeneous colloids, might be utilized
as an effective surface-active agent to control the assembly and interfacial
rheology of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Experiments: Using a custom-built
interfacial stress rheometer, we explore the effect of Janus particle additives
on the interfacial rheology and microscopic structure of particle-laden fluid
interfaces. Findings: We find that the addition of a small amount of
platinum-polystyrene (Pt-PS) Janus particles within a monolayer of PS colloids
(1:40 number ratio) can lead to more than an order-of-magnitude increase in
surface moduli with enhanced elasticity, which greatly improves the stability
of the interface. This drastic change in interfacial rheology is associated
with the formation of local particle clusters surrounding each Janus particle.
We further explain the origin of local particle clusters by considering the
interparticle interactions at the interface. Our experiments reveal the effect
of local particle structures on the macroscopic rheological behaviors of
particle monolayers and demonstrate a new way to tune the microstructure and

basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function,
from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of
the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in
GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that
zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This
demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem.
Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing
gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we
show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the
state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.

control class, which is known to guarantee the so-called robust positive
expectation (RPE) property. That is, the expected cumulative trading gain-loss
function is guaranteed to be positive for a broad class of stock price
processes. This fact attracts many new extensions and ramifications to the SLS
theory. However, it is arguable that ""systematic"" way to select an optimal
decision variable that is robust in the RPE sense is still unresolved. To this
end, we propose a modified SLS control structure, which we call the {double
linear feedback control scheme}, that allows us to solve the issue above for
stock price processes involving independent returns. In this paper, we go
beyond the existing literature by not only deriving explicit expressions for
the expected value and variance of cumulative gain-loss function but also
proving various theoretical results regarding {robust positive expected growth}
and {monotonicity}. Subsequently, we propose a new {robust optimal gain
selection problem} that seeks a solution maximizing the expected trading
gain-loss subject to the prespecified standard deviation {and} RPE constraints.
Under some mild conditions, we show that the optimal solution exists and is
unique. Moreover, a simple graphical approach that allows one to systematically
determine the optimal solution is also proposed. Finally, some numerical and
empirical studies using historical price data are also provided to support our
theory.

rarer. Brown dwarf--brown dwarf pairs are typically difficult to resolve
because they often have very small separations. Using brown dwarfs discovered
with data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) via the Backyard
Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, we inspected other, higher
resolution, sky surveys for overlooked cold companions. During this process we
discovered the brown dwarf binary system CWISE J0146$-$0508AB, which we find
has a very small chance alignment probability based on the similar proper
motions of the components of the system. Using follow-up near-infrared
spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES, we determined component spectral types of L4 and
L8 (blue), making CWISE J0146$-$0508AB one of only a few benchmark systems with
a blue L dwarf. At an estimated distance of $\sim$40 pc, CWISE J0146$-$0508AB
has a projected separation of $\sim$129 AU, making it the widest separation
brown dwarf pair found to date. We find that such a wide separation for a brown
dwarf binary may imply formation in a low-density star-forming region.

must hold on all levels of organization, independent on the nature of the
system. An open question in science is how complex systems self-organize to
produce emergent structures and properties, a branch of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. It has long been known that there is a quantity-quality
transition in natural systems. This is to say that the properties of a system
depend on its size. More recently, this has been termed the size-complexity
rule, which means that to increase their size, systems must increase their
complexity, and that to increase their complexity they must grow in size. This
rule goes under different names in different disciplines and systems of
different nature, such as the area-speciation rule, economies of scale, scaling
relations (allometric) in biology and for cities, and many others. We apply the
size-complexity rule to stars to compare them with other complex systems in
order to find universal patterns of self-organization independent of the
substrate. Here, as a measure of complexity of a star, we are using the degree
of grouping of nucleons into atoms, which reduces nucleon entropy, increases
the variety of elements, and changes the structure of the star. As seen in our
previous work, complexity, using action efficiency, is in power law
proportionality of all other characteristics of a complex system, including its
size. Here we find that, as for the other systems studied, the complexity of
stars is in a power law proportionality with their size - the bigger a system
is, the higher its level of complexity is - despite differing explosion
energies and initial metallicities from simulations and data, which confirms
the size-complexity rule and our model.

state and therefore a dynamic program (DP) that decomposes this dynamic
optimization problem, and equivalently a Bellman fixed-point equation to
evaluate capacity of this channel. We do so by defining a common belief on
private messages and private beliefs of the two senders, and using this common
belief as state of the system. We further show that this DP can be further
reduced to a DP with state as the common belief on just the messages. This
provides a single letter characterization of the capacity of this channel.

challenging to be reproduced due to issues like randomness in the software

many of them are either too intrusive or can only work for a specific usage

reproducible DL models. Our approach includes three main parts: (1) a set of
general criteria to thoroughly evaluate the reproducibility of DL models for
two different domains, (2) a unified framework which leverages a
record-and-replay technique to mitigate software-related randomness and a

into the disk, changing the course of dust migration. Our proof-of-concept,
two-dimensional, vertically-averaged simulations show that the combination of
radiation pressure, shadowing, and gas drag can produce a net outward
migration, or recession, of the dust component of the disk. The recession speed
of the inner disk edge is on the order of $10^{-5}$ times Keplerian speed in
our parameter space, which is faster than the background viscous flow, assuming
a Shakura & Sunyaev viscosity alpha $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. This speed, if
sustained over the lifetime of the disk, can result in a dust cavity as large
as tens of au.

hosting mostly active, dust-obscured star-forming galaxies to quiescent,
passive galaxies. To account for these undetected galaxies, we measure the
total light emerging from GALEX/NUV stacks of galaxy clusters between
z=0.5-1.6. Combined with existing measurements from Spitzer, WISE, and
Herschel, we study the average UV through far-infrared (IR) spectral energy
distribution (SED) of clusters. From the SEDs, we measure the total stellar
mass and amount of dust-obscured and unobscured star-formation arising from all
cluster-member galaxies, including the low mass population. The relative
fraction of unobscured star-formation we observe in the UV is consistent with
what is observed in field galaxies. There is tentative evidence for lower than
expected unobscured star-formation at z~0.5, which may arise from rapid
redshift evolution in the low mass quenching efficiency in clusters reported by
other studies. Finally, the GALEX data places strong constraints on derived
stellar-to-halo mass ratios at z<1 which anti-correlate with the total halo
mass, consistent with trends found from local X-ray observations of clusters.
The data exhibit steeper slopes than implementations of the cluster
star-formation efficiency in semi-analytical models.

modeled the surface brightness distribution of 91 massive galaxies at redshift
$0.14<z\leq 1$ in the wavelength range $0.5-1.6$ $\mu$m, deriving the
uncontaminated spectral energy distributions of their bulges and disks
separately. This spectrophotometric decomposition allows us to compare the
stellar populations properties of each component in individual galaxies. We
find that the majority of massive galaxies ($\sim85\%$) builds inside-out,
growing their extended stellar disk around the central spheroid. Some bulges
and disks could start forming at similar epochs, but these bulges grow more
rapidly than their disks, assembling $80\%$ of their mass in $\sim0.7$ Gyr and
$\sim3.5$ Gyr, respectively. Moreover, we infer that both older bulges and
older disks are more massive and compact than younger stellar structures. In
particular, we find that bulges display a bimodal distribution of mass-weighted
ages, i.e., they form in two waves. In contrast, our analysis of the disk
components indicates that they form at $z\sim1$ for both first and second-wave
bulges. This translates to first-wave bulges taking longer in acquiring a
stellar disk ($5.2$ Gyr) compared to second-wave less-compact spheroids ($0.7$
Gyr). We do not find distinct properties (e.g., mass, star formation timescale,
and mass surface density) for the disks in both types of galaxies. We conclude
that the bulge mass and compactness mainly regulate the timing of the stellar
disk growth, driving the morphological evolution of massive disk galaxies.

profitable tools for the investigation of the high-redshift galaxies in the
early Universe. Being one of the brightest cooling lines in the rest-frame
far-infrared regime of star-forming galaxies, it has been successfully
exploited as a tracer of star-formation rate (SFR) in local sources. The
picture is more complex at higher redshifts, where its usability in this
context is still under investigation. Recent results from the ALMA Large
Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey suggest that there
is no (or weak) evolution of the L$\mathrm{_{[CII]}}$-SFR relation up to
$z\sim6$ but their reliability is hampered by the presence of a large
population of [CII] non-detected galaxies. In this work, we characterize the
population of [CII] non-detections in ALPINE. By stacking their ALMA spectra,
we obtain a signal detected at $\sim5.1\sigma$, resulting in a [CII] luminosity
of $\mathrm{log(L_\mathrm{[CII]}}/\mathrm{L_{\odot}})$ $\sim7.8$. When
combining this value with those from the [CII] detections, we find a
$\mathrm{L_{[CII]}}$-SFR relation with a slope $b=1.14\pm0.11$, in agreement
within the uncertainties both with the linear relation found in the local
Universe, and with the previous findings from ALPINE at $z\sim5$. This suggests
that the [CII] line can be considered a good tracer of star formation up to the
distant Universe. Finally, we show that the galaxies of our sample that most
deviate from the observed L$_\mathrm{[CII]}$-SFR relation could suffer from a
less precise redshift estimation, perhaps artificially reducing their [CII]
luminosity. In this respect, we claim that there is no evidence in favour of a
deficit of [CII] content in high-z galaxies, in contrast with earlier studies.

study, we present the spontaneous generation and external magnetic
field-induced manipulation of an optical vortex and antivortex. A
gradient-thickness optical cavity (GTOC) consisting of an Al/SiO2/Ni/SiO2
multilayer structure realised the distinct transition between the trivial and
non-trivial topological phases, depending on the magneto-optic effects of the
Ni layer. In the non-trivial topological phase, the mathematical singularities
generating the optical vortex and antivortex pair in the reflected light
existed in the generalised parameter space of the thicknesses of the top and
bottom SiO2 layers, which is bijective to the real space of the GTOC. Coupled
with the magnetisation, the optical vortex and antivortex in the GTOC
experienced an effective spin-orbit interaction and showed topology-dependent
dynamics under external magnetic fields. We expect that field-induced

into a spheroid dominated early-type galaxy. Recent high-resolution simulations
have instead shown that, under some circumstances, rotation disks can be
preserved during the merging process or rapidly regrown after coalescence. Our
goal is to analyze in detail the ionised gas kinematics in a sample of ULIRGs
to infer the incidence of gas rotational dynamics in late-stage interacting
galaxies and merger remnants. We analysed MUSE data of a sample of 20 nearby
(z<0.165) ULIRGs, as part of the ""Physics of ULIRGs with MUSE and ALMA"" (PUMA)
project. We found that 27% individual nuclei are associated with kpc-scale
disk-like gas motions. The rest of the sample displays a plethora of gas
kinematics, dominated by winds and merger-induced flows, which make the
detection of rotation signatures difficult. On the other hand, the incidence of
stellar disk-like motions is ~2 times larger than gaseous disks, as the former
are probably less affected by winds and streams. The eight galaxies with a
gaseous disk present relatively high intrinsic gas velocity dispersion (sigma =
30-85 km/s), rotationally-supported motions (with gas rotation velocity over
velocity dispersion vrot/sigma > 1-8), and dynamical masses in the range
(2-7)x1e10 Msun. By combining our results with those of local and high-z disk
galaxies from the literature, we found a significant correlation between sigma
and the offset from the main sequence (MS), after correcting for their
evolutionary trends. Our results confirm the presence of kpc-scale rotating
disks in interacting galaxies and merger remnants, with an incidence going from
27% (gas) to ~50% (stars). The ULIRGs gas velocity dispersion is up to a factor
of ~4 higher than in local normal MS galaxies, similar to high-z starbursts as
presented in the literature.

vital interest. In this regard, the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) is a
quantitative measure of the entanglement spreading process. Particular interest
concerns the propagation of quantum correlations in the lattice systems, {\it
e.g.}, spin chains. In a seminal paper D. A. Roberts, D. Stanford and L.
Susskind, J. High Energy Phys. 03, 051, (2015) the concept of the OTOC's radius
was introduced. The radius of the OTOC defines the front line reached by the
spread of entanglement. Beyond this radius operators commute. In the present
work, we propose a model of two nanomechanical systems coupled with two
Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins. Oscillators are coupled to each other
directly while NV spins are not. Therefore, the correlation between the NV
spins may arise only through the quantum feedback exerted from the first NV
spin to the first oscillator and transferred from the first oscillator to the
second oscillator via the direct coupling. Thus nonzero OTOC between NV spins
quantifies the strength of the quantum feedback. We show that NV spins cannot
exert quantum feedback on classical nonlinear oscillators. We also discuss the
inherently quantum case with a linear quantum harmonic oscillator indirectly
coupling the two spins and verify that in the classical limit of the
oscillator, the OTOC vanishes.

parameter in MATBG. We show that the pairing order parameter can always be
split into a trivial channel and an Euler obstructed channel in all gauges for
the normal-state basis, generalizing the previously-studied channel splitting
in the Chern gauge. The nonzero normal-state Euler numbers require the pairing
gap function of the Euler obstructed channel to have zeros, while the trivial
channel can have a nonvanishing pairing gap function. When the pairing is
spontaneously nematic, we find that a sufficiently-dominant Euler obstructed
channel with two zeros typically leads to nodal superconductivity. Under the
approximation of exactly-flat bands, we find that the mean-field
zero-temperature superfluid weight is generally bounded from below, no matter
whether the Euler obstructed channel is dominant or not, generalizing the
previously-derived bound for the uniform s-wave pairing. We numerically verify

This paper presents one of the first studies of the black hole shadow of
non-Kerr black holes when the illumination source is an accretion disk. In
particular, the ability of current and future very long baseline interformeters
to estimate the physical parameters of the black hole spacetime and accretion
disk is investigated using two different parametrized black hole metrics that
encode a number of possible deviations from Kerr. Both the full shadow image
and the individual subrings of the shadow are analyzed as the higher order
subrings are weakly dependent on the disk physics and may be a more viable
observable for studying the spacetime. The results suggest that with current
telescope capabilities and any future earth-based telescopes it will be quite
difficult to place strong constraints on departures from the Kerr spacetime,
primarily due to the low resolution and strong degeneracies between the
spacetime parameters. More optimistically, space-based interferometers may be
capable of testing the Kerr nature of black holes and general relativity to
comparable or better precision than is currently possible with other
observations.

settings. First, when a target sparse representation is known, in which case we
present a near-complete answer based on drawing independent random samples from

dissipation is central to determining key properties such as the rate and
yield. Of particular interest are cases where two potential energy surfaces
cross at features known as conical intersections (CIs), resulting in
nonadiabatic dynamics that may promote ultrafast and highly efficient reactions
when rovibrational damping is present. A prominent chemical reaction that
involves a CI is the cis-trans isomerization reaction in rhodopsin, which is
crucial to vision. CIs in real molecular systems are typically investigated via
optical pump-probe spectroscopy, which has demanding spectral bandwidth and
temporal resolution requirements, and where precise control of the environment
is challenging. A complementary approach for understanding chemical reactions
is to use quantum simulators that can provide access to a wider range of
observables, though thus far combining strongly interacting linear
(rovibrational) and nonlinear (electronic) degrees of freedom with engineered
dissipation has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we create a tunable CI in a
hybrid qubit-oscillator circuit QED processor and simultaneously track both a
reactive wave-packet and electronic qubit in the time-domain. We identify
dephasing of the electronic qubit as the mechanism that drives wave-packet
branching along the reactive coordinate in our model. Furthermore, we directly
observe enhanced branching when the wave-packet passes through the CI. Thus,
the forces that influence a chemical reaction can be viewed as an effective
measurement induced dephasing rate that depends on the position of the
wave-packet relative to the CI. Our results set the groundwork for more complex
simulations of chemical dynamics, offering deeper insight into the role of
dissipation in determining macroscopic quantities of interest such as the
quantum yield of a chemical reaction.

investigating the structure and evolution of stars in the advanced phases of
evolution. With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ~40 have
determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is
small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of
red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar
binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection
towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a
red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently,
the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few
stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic
binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant
primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions Kepler,
K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE
(BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were
previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search
strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting
oscillating giants up to 26000days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of
He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar
evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known
oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an
ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies. While for non-eclipsing
binaries the inclination is unknown, such a seismically well-characterized
sample will be a treasure trove in combination with Gaia astrometric orbits for
binary~systems.

Methods: We developed and evaluated our pipeline on chest CT images of 1,431
randomly selected National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants. A dataset
of 451 CT scans with volumetric liver segmentations of expert readers was used
for training a deep learning model. For testing, in an independent dataset of
980 CT scans hepatic attenuation was manually measured by an expert reader on
three cross-sectional images at different hepatic levels by selecting three
circular regions of interest. Additionally, 100 randomly selected cases of the
test set were volumetrically segmented by expert readers. Hepatic steatosis on
the test set was defined as mean hepatic attenuation of < 40 Hounsfield unit.
Spearman correlation was conducted to analyze liver fat quantification accuracy
and the Cohen's Kappa coefficient was calculated for hepatic steatosis
prediction reliability. Results: Our pipeline demonstrated strong performance
and achieved a mean dice score of 0.970 for the volumetric liver segmentation.
The spearman correlation of the liver fat quantification was 0.954 (P <0.0001)
between the automated and expert reader measurements. The cohen's kappa
coefficient was 0.875 for automatic assessment of hepatic steatosis.
Conclusion: We developed a fully automatic deep learning-based pipeline for the

retinal vascular topology -- that is, how different vessels are connected to
each other -- given a single color fundus image. Determining this connectivity
is very challenging because vessels cross each other in a 2D image, obscuring
their true paths. We quantitatively validated the usefulness of our extraction
method by using it to achieve comparable state-of-the-art results in retinal
artery-vein classification. Our proposed approach works as follows: We first
segment the retinal vessels using our previously developed state-of-the-art
segmentation method. Then, we estimate an initial graph from the extracted
vessels and assign the most likely blood flow to each edge. We then use a
handful of high-level operations (HLOs) to fix errors in the graph. These HLOs
include detaching neighboring nodes, shifting the endpoints of an edge, and
reversing the estimated blood flow direction for a branch. We use a novel cost
function to find the optimal set of HLO operations for a given graph. Finally,
we show that our extracted vascular structure is correct by propagating
artery/vein labels along the branches. As our experiments show, our
topology-based artery-vein labeling achieved state-of-the-art results on three
datasets: DRIVE, AV-WIDE, and INSPIRE. We also performed several ablation
studies to separately verify the importance of the segmentation and AV labeling
steps of our proposed method. These ablation studies further confirmed that our
graph extraction pipeline correctly models the underlying vascular anatomy.

expertise and understanding can slow development or result in more defects. To
date, most reviewer recommendation systems rely primarily on historical file
change and review information; those who changed or reviewed a file in the past
are the best positioned to review in the future. We posit that while these
approaches are able to identify and suggest qualified reviewers, they may be
blind to reviewers who have the needed expertise and have simply never
interacted with the changed files before. Fortunately, at Microsoft, we have a
wealth of work artifacts across many repositories that can yield valuable
information about our developers. To address the aforementioned problem, we
present CORAL, a novel approach to reviewer recommendation that leverages a
socio-technical graph built from the rich set of entities (developers,
repositories, files, pull requests (PRs), work items, etc.) and their
relationships in modern source code management systems. We employ a graph
convolutional neural network on this graph and train it on two and a half years
of history on 332 repositories within Microsoft. We show that CORAL is able to
model the manual history of reviewer selection remarkably well. Further, based
on an extensive user study, we demonstrate that this approach identifies
relevant and qualified reviewers who traditional reviewer recommenders miss,
and that these developers desire to be included in the review process. Finally,
we find that ""classical"" reviewer recommendation systems perform better on
smaller (in terms of developers) software projects while CORAL excels on larger
projects, suggesting that there is ""no one model to rule them all.""

automatically identifying SATD from other sources such as commit messages and

investigate the SATD keywords and relations between SATD in different sources.
The findings indicate, among others, that: 1) SATD is evenly spread among all

the number of shared SATD keywords, followed by commit messages, and then
followed by code comments; 3) there are four kinds of relations between SATD

methods are widely used (often interchangeably) by prior studies to derive
feature importance ranks from a defect classifier. However, different feature
importance methods are likely to compute different feature importance ranks
even for the same dataset and classifier. Hence such interchangeable use of
feature importance methods can lead to conclusion instabilities unless there is
a strong agreement among different methods. Therefore, in this paper, we
evaluate the agreement between the feature importance ranks associated with the
studied classifiers through a case study of 18 software projects and six
commonly used classifiers. We find that: 1) The computed feature importance
ranks by CA and CS methods do not always strongly agree with each other. 2) The
computed feature importance ranks by the studied CA methods exhibit a strong
agreement including the features reported at top-1 and top-3 ranks for a given
dataset and classifier, while even the commonly used CS methods yield vastly
different feature importance ranks. Such findings raise concerns about the
stability of conclusions across replicated studies. We further observe that the
commonly used defect datasets are rife with feature interactions and these
feature interactions impact the computed feature importance ranks of the CS
methods (not the CA methods). We demonstrate that removing these feature
interactions, even with simple methods like CFS improves agreement between the
computed feature importance ranks of CA and CS methods. In light of our
findings, we provide guidelines for stakeholders and practitioners when
performing model interpretation and directions for future research, e.g.,
future research is needed to investigate the impact of advanced feature

linear mapping from the velocities of these chosen dynamic DOFs to the
velocities of the remaining quasistatic DOFs. We then use this mapping to
derive reduced equations of motion involving only the dynamic DOFs. We also
derive a novel stabilization term that enables us to use complex nonlinear

subspace approaches, ConJac gives exactly the same configuration as the full

many highly dynamic systems, where the underlying connectivity structure is
non-stationary and is mostly unobserved. Using a static model in these
situations may result in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, modeling changes
in graph structure with time can provide information about the system whose
applications go beyond classification. Most work of this type does not learn
effective connectivity and focuses on cross-correlation between nodes to
generate undirected graphs. An undirected graph is unable to capture direction
of an interaction which is vital in many fields, including neuroscience. To
bridge this gap, we developed dynamic effective connectivity estimation via
neural network training (DECENNT), a novel model to learn an interpretable
directed and dynamic graph induced by the downstream classification/prediction
task. DECENNT outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five different
tasks and infers interpretable task-specific dynamic graphs. The dynamic graphs

estimating the SM parameters from a set of conventional diffusion MRI (dMRI)
measurements is ill-conditioned. Multidimensional dMRI helps resolve the
estimation degeneracies, but there remains a need for clinically feasible
acquisitions that yield robust parameter maps. Here we find optimal
multidimensional protocols by minimizing the mean-squared error of machine
learning-based SM parameter estimates for two 3T scanners with corresponding
gradient strengths of $40$ and $80\,\unit{mT/m}$. We assess intra-scanner and
inter-scanner repeatability for 15-minute optimal protocols by scanning 20
healthy volunteers twice on both scanners. The coefficients of variation all SM
parameters except free water fraction are $\lesssim 10\%$ voxelwise and $1-4

outcomes are similar to those of conventional diffusion tensor imaging, our

supervised learning for forecasting -- their distributions evolve over time,
rendering the conventional training and model selection procedures suboptimal.
In this paper, we propose a novel method, Self-Adaptive Forecasting (SAF), to
modify the training of time-series forecasting models to improve their
performance on forecasting tasks with such non-stationary time-series data. SAF
integrates a self-adaptation stage prior to forecasting based on `backcasting',
i.e. predicting masked inputs backward in time. This is a form of test-time
training that creates a self-supervised learning problem on test samples before
performing the prediction task. In this way, our method enables efficient
adaptation of encoded representations to evolving distributions, leading to
superior generalization. SAF can be integrated with any canonical
encoder-decoder based time-series architecture such as recurrent neural
networks or attention-based architectures. On synthetic and real-world datasets
in domains where time-series data are known to be notoriously non-stationary,
such as healthcare and finance, we demonstrate a significant benefit of SAF in
improving forecasting accuracy.

in uncertain environments. However, the control policies trained for an RL
agent crucially depend on user-defined, state-based reward functions. Poorly
designed rewards can lead to policies that do get maximal rewards but fail to
satisfy desired task objectives or are unsafe. There are several examples of
the use of formal languages such as temporal logics and automata to specify
high-level task specifications for robots (in lieu of Markovian rewards).
Recent efforts have focused on inferring state-based rewards from formal
specifications; here, the goal is to provide (probabilistic) guarantees that
the policy learned using RL (with the inferred rewards) satisfies the
high-level formal specification. A key drawback of several of these techniques
is that the rewards that they infer are sparse: the agent receives positive
rewards only upon completion of the task and no rewards otherwise. This
naturally leads to poor convergence properties and high variance during RL. In
this work, we propose using formal specifications in the form of symbolic
automata: these serve as a generalization of both bounded-time temporal
logic-based specifications as well as automata. Furthermore, our use of
symbolic automata allows us to define non-sparse potential-based rewards which
empirically shape the reward surface, leading to better convergence during RL.
We also show that our potential-based rewarding strategy still allows us to
obtain the policy that maximizes the satisfaction of the given specification.

  Bandits",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we consider the problem of regret minimization for logistic
bandits. The main challenge of logistic bandits is reducing the dependence on a
potentially large problem dependent constant $\kappa$ that can at worst scale
exponentially with the norm of the unknown parameter $\theta_{\ast}$. Abeille
et al. (2021) have applied self-concordance of the logistic function to remove
this worst-case dependence providing regret guarantees like
$O(d\log^2(\kappa)\sqrt{\dot\mu T}\log(|\mathcal{X}|))$ where $d$ is the
dimensionality, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\dot\mu$ is the variance of the
best-arm. This work improves upon this bound in the fixed arm setting by
employing an experimental design procedure that achieves a minimax regret of
$O(\sqrt{d \dot\mu T\log(|\mathcal{X}|)})$. Our regret bound in fact takes a
tighter instance (i.e., gap) dependent regret bound for the first time in
logistic bandits. We also propose a new warmup sampling algorithm that can
dramatically reduce the lower order term in the regret in general and prove
that it can replace the lower order term dependency on $\kappa$ to
$\log^2(\kappa)$ for some instances. Finally, we discuss the impact of the bias
of the MLE on the logistic bandit problem, providing an example where $d^2$
lower order regret (cf., it is $d$ for linear bandits) may not be improved as
long as the MLE is used and how bias-corrected estimators may be used to make
it closer to $d$.

resolved images of the supermassive black holes at the centre of our galaxy and

of black hole accretion flows on event horizon scales. In this work, we predict
spectral index maps of both M87* and Sgr A* by applying the general
relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) code IPOLE to a suite of general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We analytically show that
the spectral index increases with increasing magnetic field strength, electron
temperature, and optical depth. Consequently, spectral index maps grow more
negative with increasing radius in almost all models, since all of these
quantities tend to be maximised near the event horizon. Additionally, photon
ring geodesics exhibit more positive spectral indices, since they sample the
innermost regions of the accretion flow with the most extreme plasma
conditions. Spectral index maps are sensitive to highly uncertain plasma
heating prescriptions (the electron temperature and distribution function).
However, if our understanding of these aspects of plasma physics can be
tightened, even the spatially unresolved spectral index around 230 GHz can be
used to discriminate between models. In particular, Standard and Normal
Evolution (SANE) flows tend to exhibit more negative spectral indices than
Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) flows due to differences in the characteristic
magnetic field strength and temperature of emitting plasma.

direct estimate of the energy dissipation rate. The global and scale-by-scale
energy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations. We show that
the global internal energy increase and the temperature enhancement of each
species are directly tracked by the pressure-strain interaction. The
incompressive part of the pressure-strain interaction dominates over its
compressive part in all simulations considered. The scale-by-scale energy
balance is quantified by scale filtered Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a kinetic
plasma approach, and the lag dependent von K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation, an
approach based on fluid models. We find that the energy balance is exactly
satisfied across all scales, but the lack of a well-defined inertial range
influences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the
inertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation to
estimating dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the
scale separation in the system is not clearly defined. In contrast, the
pressure-strain interaction balances exactly the dissipation rate at kinetic
scales regardless of the scale separation.

pre-provisioning techniques were still little explored. Preprovisioning implies
the prior allocation of resources in the network for the transport and
protection of future connection demands, while the provisioning implies the
allocation of resources when the demand arrives in the network. Applying
preprovisioning reduces the downtime experienced by a connection after a
failure, which will reduce unavailability and potentially avoid penalties for
violation of Service Level Agreements (SLA) established with client networks.

departure times.
  We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning

estimation followed by certainty equivalent control but with judicious use of
the always admit policy so that learning doesn't stall. We prove that for all
service rates, the proposed policy asymptotically learns to take the optimal
action. Further, we also present finite-time regret guarantees for our scheme.

where all information about test nodes (i.e., users and items) is available

many real-world applications where data comes in continuously as a stream of
new edges and nodes, and one has to update model predictions incrementally to
reflect the latest state. To fully capitalize on the newly available data in
the stream, recent graph-based recommendation models would need to be
repeatedly retrained, which is infeasible in practice.
  In this paper, we study the graph-based streaming recommendation setting and
propose a compositional recommendation model -- Lightweight Compositional
Embedding (LCE) -- that supports incremental updates under low computational
cost. Instead of learning explicit embeddings for the full set of nodes, LCE
learns explicit embeddings for only a subset of nodes and represents the other
nodes {\em implicitly}, through a composition function based on their
interactions in the graph. This provides an effective, yet efficient, means to
leverage streaming graph data when one node type (e.g., items) is more amenable
to static representation. We conduct an extensive empirical study to compare
LCE to a set of competitive baselines on three large-scale user-item
recommendation datasets with interactions under a streaming setting. The
results demonstrate the superior performance of LCE, showing that it achieves
nearly skyline performance with significantly fewer parameters than alternative

  NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and
time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to
both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer
high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability
to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory
on both sides.
  This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field.
  Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid
neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled
differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series);
and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models
capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex
high-dimensional distributions).
  Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible
differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations,
Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via
regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models,
differentiable optimisation).

logical expressions consisting of logical variables and basic logical
operations (AND, OR, and NOT). More specifically, Noan learns the logical
variables as vector embeddings and learns each logical operation as a neural
module. In this way, the model builds computational graph integrating neural

agents that have been trained on similar source domains. For example, recent
research focus within this space has been placed on knowledge transfer between
tasks that have different transition dynamics and reward functions; however,
little focus has been placed on knowledge transfer between tasks that have
different action spaces. In this paper, we approach the task of transfer
learning between domains that differ in action spaces. We present a reward
shaping method based on source embedding similarity that is applicable to
domains with both discrete and continuous action spaces. The efficacy of our
approach is evaluated on transfer to restricted action spaces in the Acrobot-v1
and Pendulum-v0 domains. A comparison with two baselines shows that our method
does not outperform these baselines in these continuous action spaces but does
show an improvement in these discrete action spaces. We conclude our analysis
with future directions for this work.

retinal models to accurately simulate Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) responses.
The goal of retinal prostheses is to enable blind individuals to solve complex,
reallife visual tasks. In this paper, we introduce the functional assessment
(FA) of retinal models, which describes the concept of evaluating the
performance of retinal models on visual understanding tasks. We present a
machine learning method for FA: we feed traditional machine learning
classifiers with RGC responses generated by retinal models, to solve object and
digit recognition tasks (CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Imagenette). We
examined critical FA aspects, including how the performance of FA depends on
the task, how to optimally feed RGC responses to the classifiers and how the
number of output neurons correlates with the model's accuracy. To increase the
number of output neurons, we manipulated input images - by splitting and then
feeding them to the retinal model and we found that image splitting does not
significantly improve the model's accuracy. We also show that differences in
the structure of datasets result in largely divergent performance of the
retinal model (MNIST and Fashion MNIST exceeded 80% accuracy, while CIFAR-10
and Imagenette achieved ~40%). Furthermore, retinal models which perform better
in standard evaluation, i.e. more accurately predict RGC response, perform
better in FA as well. However, unlike standard evaluation, FA results can be
straightforwardly interpreted in the context of comparing the quality of visual
perception.

neural network applied to spatial coordinates, have proven to be remarkably
effective for optimizing, compressing, and generating 3D geometry. Although
these representations are easy to fit, it is not clear how to best evaluate
geometric queries on the shape, such as intersecting against a ray or finding a
closest point. The predominant approach is to encourage the network to have a
signed distance property. However, this property typically holds only
approximately, leading to robustness issues, and holds only at the conclusion
of training, inhibiting the use of queries in loss functions. Instead, this
work presents a new approach to perform queries directly on general neural
implicit functions for a wide range of existing architectures. Our key tool is
the application of range analysis to neural networks, using automatic
arithmetic rules to bound the output of a network over a region; we conduct a
study of range analysis on neural networks, and identify variants of affine
arithmetic which are highly effective. We use the resulting bounds to develop
geometric queries including ray casting, intersection testing, constructing
spatial hierarchies, fast mesh extraction, closest-point evaluation, evaluating
bulk properties, and more. Our queries can be efficiently evaluated on GPUs,
and offer concrete accuracy guarantees even on randomly-initialized networks,
enabling their use in training objectives and beyond. We also show a
preliminary application to inverse rendering.

problem in terms of spatial evolution equations. The technique is used to
examine the effect of localized periodic actuation at a given temporal
frequency, based on an experimental set-up in which an active large-scale is
introduced into the outer layer of a turbulent boundary layer. First, the
large-scale structures associated with the phase-locked modal velocity field
obtained from spatial input-output analysis are shown to closely match those
computed based on hot-wire measurements. The approach is then used to further
investigate the response of the boundary layer to the synthetically generated
large-scale. A quadrant trajectory analysis indicates that the spatial
input-output response produces shear stress distributions consistent with those
in canonical wall-bounded turbulent flows in terms of both the order and types
of events observed. The expected correspondence between the dominance of
different quadrant behavior and actuation frequency is also observed. These
results highlight the promise of a spatial input-output framework for analyzing
the formation and streamwise evolution of structures in actuated wall-bounded

is critical to the success of wireless D2D communications. Most of the
traditional scheduling schemes only consider the maximum throughput or fairness
of the system and do not consider the freshness of information. In this paper,
we propose a novel D2D links scheduling scheme to optimize an age of
information (AoI) and throughput jointly scheduling problem when D2D links
transmit packets under the last-come-first-serve policy with packet-replacement
(LCFS-PR). It is motivated by the fact that the maximum throughput scheduling
may reduce the activation probability of links with poor channel conditions,
which results in terrible AoI performance. Specifically, We derive the
expression of the overall average AoI and throughput of the network under the
spatio-temporal interfering queue dynamics with the mean-field assumption.
Moreover, a neural network structure is proposed to learn the mapping from the
geographic location to the optimal scheduling parameters under a stationary
randomized policy, where the scheduling decision can be made without estimating
the channel state information(CSI) after the neural network is well-trained. To
overcome the problem that implicit loss functions cannot be back-propagated, we
derive a numerical solution of the gradient. Finally, numerical results reveal
that the performance of the deep learning approach is close to that of a local
optimal algorithm which has a higher computational complexity. The trade-off
curve of AoI and throughput is also obtained, where the AoI tends to infinity
when throughput is maximized.

high-dimensional, noisy inputs (e.g., webcam images of eye gaze) can be
challenging, especially when it involves inferring the user's desired action in
the absence of a natural 'default' interface. Reinforcement learning from
online user feedback on the system's performance presents a natural solution to
this problem, and enables the interface to adapt to individual users. However,
this approach tends to require a large amount of human-in-the-loop training
data, especially when feedback is sparse. We propose a hierarchical solution
that learns efficiently from sparse user feedback: we use offline pre-training
to acquire a latent embedding space of useful, high-level robot behaviors,
which, in turn, enables the system to focus on using online user feedback to
learn a mapping from user inputs to desired high-level behaviors. The key
insight is that access to a pre-trained policy enables the system to learn more
from sparse rewards than a na\""ive RL algorithm: using the pre-trained policy,
the system can make use of successful task executions to relabel, in hindsight,
what the user actually meant to do during unsuccessful executions. We evaluate
our method primarily through a user study with 12 participants who perform
tasks in three simulated robotic manipulation domains using a webcam and their
eye gaze: flipping light switches, opening a shelf door to reach objects
inside, and rotating a valve. The results show that our method successfully
learns to map 128-dimensional gaze features to 7-dimensional joint torques from
sparse rewards in under 10 minutes of online training, and seamlessly helps
users who employ different gaze strategies, while adapting to distributional

formulate the OOD problem on graphs and develop a new invariant learning
approach, Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization (EERM), that facilitates
graph neural networks to leverage invariance principles for prediction. EERM
resorts to multiple context explorers (specified as graph structure editers in
our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize the variance of risks from
multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables the model to extrapolate
from a single observed environment which is the common case for node-level

who are infected by a disease spread over a network, exploiting correlation
among network nodes provides fundamental opportunities in reducing the number
of tests needed. We model and analyze group testing on $n$ correlated nodes
whose interactions are specified by a graph $G$. We model correlation through
an edge-faulty random graph formed from $G$ in which each edge is dropped with
probability $1-r$, and all nodes in the same component have the same state. We
consider three classes of graphs: cycles and trees, $d$-regular graphs and
stochastic block models or SBM, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the number
of tests needed to identify the defective nodes. Our results are expressed in
terms of the number of tests needed when the nodes are independent and they are
in terms of $n$, $r$, and the target error. In particular, we quantify the
fundamental improvements that exploiting correlation offers by the ratio
between the total number of nodes $n$ and the equivalent number of independent
nodes in a classic group testing algorithm. The lower bounds are derived by
illustrating a strong dependence of the number of tests needed on the expected
number of components. In this regard, we establish a new approximation for the
distribution of component sizes in ""$d$-regular trees"" which may be of
independent interest and leads to a lower bound on the expected number of
components in $d$-regular graphs. The upper bounds are found by forming dense
subgraphs in which nodes are more likely to be in the same state. When $G$ is a
cycle or tree, we show an improvement by a factor of $log(1/r)$. For grid, a
graph with almost $2n$ edges, the improvement is by a factor of ${(1-r)
\log(1/r)}$, indicating drastic improvement compared to trees. When $G$ has a
larger number of edges, as in SBM, the improvement can scale in $n$.

which ValueDice is closely related to BC that performs well as mentioned.

optical systems. It is a challenge to experimentally produce SMs with a
required temporal separation in mode-locked fiber lasers. Here, we propose and
realize an experimental scenario for harnessing SM dynamics in a laser setup.
In particular, we tailor SMs in a mode-locked laser controlled by second-order
group-velocity dispersion and dispersion losses: the real part of dispersion
maintains the balance between the dispersion and nonlinearity, while the
dispersion loss determines the balance of gain and losses. The experimental
results demonstrate that the dispersion loss makes it possible to select
desired values of the temporal separation (TS) in bound pairs of SMs in the
system. Tunability of the SM's central wavelength and the corresponding
hysteresis are addressed too. The demonstrated regime allows us to create
multiple SMs with preselected values of the TS and central wavelength, which
shows the potential of our setup for the design of optical data-processing
schemes.

base samples to inadequate novel samples. Despite extensive research in recent
years, FSL is still not yet able to generate satisfactory solutions for a wide
range of real-world applications. To confront this challenge, we study the FSL
problem from a geometric point of view in this paper. One observation is that
the widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in the
feature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance in
computational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Starting
from the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporates
cluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for space
subdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiple
stages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric and
nonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation and
surrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level,
transformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble.
Our CIVD-based workflow enables us to achieve new state-of-the-art results on
mini-ImageNet, CUB, and tiered-ImagenNet datasets, with ${\sim}2\%{-}5\%$
improvements upon the next best. To summarize, CIVD provides a mathematically
elegant and geometrically interpretable framework that compensates for extreme
data insufficiency, prevents overfitting, and allows for fast geometric
ensemble for thousands of individual VD. These together make FSL stronger.

temporospatial patterns of EEG signals using convolutional neural networks

statistical characteristics of visual images depart radically from EEG signals,
a natural question arises whether an alternative network architecture exists
apart from CNNs. To address this question, we propose a novel geometric deep
learning (GDL) framework called Tensor-CSPNet, which characterizes spatial
covariance matrices derived from EEG signals on symmetric positive definite
(SPD) manifolds and fully captures the temporospatiofrequency patterns using
existing deep neural networks on SPD manifolds, integrating with experiences
from many successful MI-EEG classifiers to optimize the framework. In the
experiments, Tensor-CSPNet attains or slightly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art performance on the cross-validation and holdout scenarios in
two commonly-used MI-EEG datasets. Moreover, the visualization and

gas-phase abundances of volatiles enhanced up to two orders of magnitude at
ice-lines, while the outer disk becomes depleted of dust. Disks with decreasing
accretion rates gradually cool, which draws in icelines closer to the star. At
<~1 au, advective models yield water-rich gas with C/O ratios <~ 0.1, which may
be inherited by atmospheres of planets forming here via IOPF. For planetary
interiors built by pebble accretion, IOPF predicts volatile-poor compositions.
However, advectively-enhanced volatile mass fractions of ~10% can occur at the

distributed learning tasks, and this critically limits scalability and
convergence speed in wireless communications applications. In this paper, we
devise a Gradient Descent method with Sparsification and Error Correction
(GD-SEC) to improve the communications efficiency in a general worker-server
architecture. Motivated by a variety of wireless communications learning
scenarios, GD-SEC reduces the number of bits per communication from worker to
server with no degradation in the order of the convergence rate. This enables
larger-scale model learning without sacrificing convergence or accuracy. At
each iteration of GD-SEC, instead of directly transmitting the entire gradient
vector, each worker computes the difference between its current gradient and a
linear combination of its previously transmitted gradients, and then transmits
the sparsified gradient difference to the server. A key feature of GD-SEC is
that any given component of the gradient difference vector will not be
transmitted if its magnitude is not sufficiently large. An error correction
technique is used at each worker to compensate for the error resulting from
sparsification. We prove that GD-SEC is guaranteed to converge for strongly
convex, convex, and nonconvex optimization problems with the same order of
convergence rate as GD. Furthermore, if the objective function is strongly
convex, GD-SEC has a fast linear convergence rate. Numerical results not only
validate the convergence rate of GD-SEC but also explore the communication bit
savings it provides. Given a target accuracy, GD-SEC can significantly reduce
the communications load compared to the best existing algorithms without
slowing down the optimization process.

efficiently learn the temporal, spatial and frequency correlations of downlink

propose the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) distance, a notion of distance between
labeled measure Markov chains (LMMCs), of which labeled graphs are special
cases. The WL distance is polynomial time computable and is also compatible
with the WL test in the sense that the former is positive if and only if the WL
test can distinguish the two involved graphs. The WL distance captures and
compares subtle structures of the underlying LMMCs and, as a consequence of
this, it is more discriminating than the distance between graphs used for
defining the state-of-the-art Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel.
Inspired by the structure of the WL distance we identify a neural network
architecture on LMMCs which turns out to be universal w.r.t. continuous
functions defined on the space of all LMMCs (which includes all graphs) endowed

caused by software vulnerabilities have been increasing in recent years.
However, software vulnerabilities detection is still heavily relying on code
review done by experts, and how to automatedly detect software vulnerabilities
is an open problem so far. In this paper, we propose a novel solution named
GraphEye to identify whether a function of C/C++ code has vulnerabilities,
which can greatly alleviate the burden of code auditors. GraphEye is originated
from the observation that the code property graph of a non-vulnerable function
naturally differs from the code property graph of a vulnerable function with
the same functionality. Hence, detecting vulnerable functions is attributed to
the graph classification problem.GraphEye is comprised of VecCPG and GcGAT.
VecCPG is a vectorization for the code property graph, which is proposed to
characterize the key syntax and semantic features of the corresponding source
code. GcGAT is a deep learning model based on the graph attention graph, which
is proposed to solve the graph classification problem according to VecCPG.
Finally, GraphEye is verified by the SARD Stack-based Buffer Overflow,
Divide-Zero, Null Pointer Deference, Buffer Error, and Resource Error datasets,
the corresponding F1 scores are 95.6%, 95.6%,96.1%,92.6%, and 96.1%

analogous statement for the free energy of a quantum oscillator linearly
coupled to a passive heat bath consisting of an infinite number of independent
harmonic oscillators. We explicitly demonstrate that the free energy of the
Brownian oscillator can be expressed in the form $F(T) = \langle f(\omega,T)

oscillator. The overall averaging process involves two distinct averages: the
first one is over the canonical ensemble for the bath oscillators, whereas the
second one signifies averaging over the entire bath spectrum of frequencies
from zero to infinity. The latter is performed over a relevant probability
distribution function $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ which can be derived from the
knowledge of the generalized susceptibility encountered in linear response
theory. The effect of different dissipation mechanisms is also exhibited. We
find two remarkable consequences of our results. First, the quantum counterpart

rapidity are widely recognized as excellent channels to access the proton
structure at small-x. In this regime, to describe nucleons structure, it is
necessary to use kT-unintegrated distributions. In particular, at large
transverse momenta, the x-evolution of the so-called unintegrated gluon
distribution is driven by the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equation, within
the framework of the high-energy factorization (HEF). Recent analyses on the
diffractive electroproduction of \rho mesons have corroborated the underlying
assumption that the small-size dipole scattering mechanism is at work, thus
validating the use of the HEF formalism. Nonetheless, a significant sensitivity
of polarized cross sections to intermediate values of the meson transverse
momenta, where, in the case of inclusive emissions, a description at the hand
of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization starts to be the most
appropriate framework, has been observed. In this work, we will review the

Then, we derive novel score matching objectives tailored for the proposed
diffusion process to estimate the gradient of the joint log-density with
respect to each component, and introduce a new solver for the system of SDEs to
efficiently sample from the reverse diffusion process. We validate our graph
generation method on diverse datasets, on which it either achieves
significantly superior or competitive performance to the baselines. Further

the benefits of latent intents and leverage them effectively for

paradigm that leverages a latent intent variable into SR. The core idea is to
learn users' intent distribution functions from unlabeled user behavior
sequences and optimize SR models with contrastive self-supervised learning
(SSL) by considering the learned intents to improve recommendation.
Specifically, we introduce a latent variable to represent users' intents and
learn the distribution function of the latent variable via clustering. We
propose to leverage the learned intents into SR models via contrastive SSL,
which maximizes the agreement between a view of sequence and its corresponding
intent. The training is alternated between intent representation learning and
the SR model optimization steps within the generalized expectation-maximization

robustness. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed learning paradigm, which improves performance, and

spontaneous events in the form of spike avalanches. Since synchronization has
been causally linked to central aspects of brain function such as selective
signal processing and integration of stimulus information, participating in an
avalanche is a form of a transient synchrony which temporarily creates neural
assemblies and hence might especially be useful for implementing flexible
information processing. For understanding how assembly formation supports
neural computation, it is therefore essential to establish a comprehensive
theory of how network structure and dynamics interact to generate specific
avalanche patterns and sequences. Here we derive exact avalanche distributions
for a finite network of recurrently coupled spiking neurons with arbitrary
non-negative interaction weights, which is made possible by formally mapping
the model dynamics to a linear, random dynamical system on the $N$-torus and by
exploiting self-similarities inherent in the phase space. We introduce the
notion of relative unique ergodicity and show that this property is guaranteed
if the system is driven by a time-invariant Bernoulli process. This approach
allows us not only to provide closed-form analytical expressions for avalanche
size, but also to determine the detailed set(s) of units firing in an avalanche
(i.e., the avalanche assembly). The underlying dependence between network
structure and dynamics is made transparent by expressing the distribution of
avalanche assemblies in terms of the induced graph Laplacian. We explore
analytical consequences of this dependence and provide illustrating examples.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Network (GNN) is an emerging technique for graph-based learning
tasks such as node classification. In this work, we reveal the vulnerability of
GNN to the imbalance of node labels. Traditional solutions for imbalanced
classification (e.g. resampling) are ineffective in node classification without
considering the graph structure. Worse still, they may even bring overfitting
or underfitting results due to lack of sufficient prior knowledge. To solve
these problems, we propose a novel graph neural network framework with
curriculum learning (GNN-CL) consisting of two modules. For one thing, we hope
to acquire certain reliable interpolation nodes and edges through the novel
graph-based oversampling based on smoothness and homophily. For another, we
combine graph classification loss and metric learning loss which adjust the
distance between different nodes associated with minority class in feature
space. Inspired by curriculum learning, we dynamically adjust the weights of
different modules during training process to achieve better ability of
generalization and discrimination. The proposed framework is evaluated via
several widely used graph datasets, showing that our proposed model
consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

(pseudo-)likelihood ratio (PLR) test, for determining the co-integration rank
of a vector autoregressive (VAR) system of variables integrated of order one
can be significantly affected, even asymptotically, by unconditional
heteroskedasticity (non-stationary volatility) in the data. Known solutions to
this problem include wild bootstrap implementations of the PLR test or the use
of an information criterion, such as the BIC, to select the co-integration
rank. Although asymptotically valid in the presence of heteroskedasticity,
these methods can display very low finite sample power under some patterns of
non-stationary volatility. In particular, they do not exploit potential
efficiency gains that could be realised in the presence of non-stationary
volatility by using adaptive inference methods. Under the assumption of a known
autoregressive lag length, Boswijk and Zu (2022) develop adaptive PLR test
based methods using a non-parameteric estimate of the covariance matrix
process. It is well-known, however, that selecting an incorrect lag length can
significantly impact on the efficacy of both information criteria and bootstrap
PLR tests to determine co-integration rank in finite samples. We show that
adaptive information criteria-based approaches can be used to estimate the
autoregressive lag order to use in connection with bootstrap adaptive PLR
tests, or to jointly determine the co-integration rank and the VAR lag length
and that in both cases they are weakly consistent for these parameters in the
presence of non-stationary volatility provided standard conditions hold on the

reliable demand for communication and computation in maritime wireless networks
is investigated. Two types of marine user equipment (UEs), i.e., low-antenna
gain and high-antenna gain UEs, are considered. A joint task computation and
time allocation problem for weighted sum-rate maximization is formulated as
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The goal is to design an algorithm
that enables the network to efficiently provide backhaul resources to an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and offload HUEs tasks to LEO satellite for blue
data (i.e., marine user's data). To solve this MILP, a solution based on the
Bender and primal decomposition is proposed. The Bender decomposes MILP into
the master problem for binary task decision and subproblem for continuous-time
resource allocation. Moreover, primal decomposition deals with a coupling
constraint in the subproblem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm provides the maritime UEs coverage demand in polynomial time
computational complexity and achieves a near-optimal solution.

form of the optimal controller and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equations are obtained. Because of the augmented system, the optimal
controller can be obtained directly without relying on the system dynamics.
Secondly, the self-triggered mechanism is applied to reduce the computing and

problem that the HJB equations are difficult to solve analytically, a RL method
which only requires measurement data at the event-triggered instants is
proposed. For each agent, only one neural network is designed to approximate
the optimal value function. Each neural network is updated only at the event

provides essential information on the spectrum availability. However, due to
severe wireless channel fading and path loss, the primary user (PU) signals
received at the CR or secondary user (SU) can be practically too weak for
reliable detection. To tackle this issue, we consider in this letter a new
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided spectrum sensing scheme for CR, by
exploiting the large aperture and passive beamforming gains of IRS to boost the
PU signal strength received at the SU to facilitate its spectrum sensing.
Specifically, by dynamically changing the IRS reflection over time according to
a given codebook, its reflected signal power varies substantially at the SU,
which is utilized for opportunistic signal detection. Furthermore, we propose a
weighted energy detection method by combining the received signal power values
over different IRS reflections, which significantly improves the detection
performance. Simulation results validate the performance gain of the proposed
IRS-aided spectrum sensing scheme, as compared to different benchmark schemes.

of particle diffusion in presence of trapping boundaries. We start from a
drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble
traps, and is modeled by a short range potential with an attractive term and a
repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble
surface is simulated by the Lennard-Jones potential that simplifies the capture
due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model the effect of the
potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass
conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range
of small size $\varepsilon$. An asymptotic expansion in the $\varepsilon$ is
considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest
order terms in the expansion.
  Another aspect we investigate is saturation effect coming from high
concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. Various studies show
that these reactions lead to a modification of the model, including also non
linear terms. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests
in 1D, 2D and different geometries.

lead halide perovskites has largely remained a challenging task, owing
primarily to undesirable ionic migration effects near room temperature. In
addition, the presence of methylammonium in many high performing 3D perovskite
compositions introduces additional instabilities, which limit reliable room
temperature optoelectronic device operation. Here, we address both these
challenges and demonstrate that field-effect transistors (FETs) based on
methylammonium-free, mixed-metal (Pb/Sn) perovskite compositions, that are
widely studied for solar cell and light-emitting diode applications, do not
suffer from ion migration effects as their pure Pb counterparts and reliably
exhibit hysteresis free p-type transport with high mobility reaching 5.4
$cm^2/Vs$, ON/OFF ratio approaching $10^6$, and normalized channel conductance
of 3 S/m. The reduced ion migration is also manifested in an activated
temperature dependence of the field-effect mobility with low activation energy,
which reflects a significant density of shallow electronic defects. We
visualize the suppressed in-plane ionic migration in Sn-containing perovskites
compared to their pure-Pb counterparts using photoluminescence microscopy under
bias and demonstrate promising voltage and current-stress device operational
stabilities. Our work establishes FETs as an excellent platform for providing
fundamental insights into the doping, defect and charge transport physics of

design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twin of
wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for both
different aspects. These aspects are twins for wireless and wireless for twins.

design, prototyping, deployment trends, physical devices design, interface
design, incentive mechanism, twins isolation, and decoupling. On the other

presented. The observed spectra are well fitted using a spectral theory for
nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamics assuming a wave number anisotropy.
The density spectrum is a power law that resembles neither the Elsasser spectra

locations in an image, which has either the potential to create an imminent
threat from an adversary or appear as the target zones needing further
investigation. Covert places (CGL) for hiding behind an occluding object are
concealed 3D locations, not detectable from the viewpoint (camera). Hence this
involves delineating specific image regions around the projections of outer
boundary of the occluding objects, as places to be accessed around the
potential hideouts. CGL detection finds applications in military
counter-insurgency operations, surveillance with path planning for an
exploratory robot. Given an RGB image, the goal is to identify all CGLs in the
2D scene. Identification of such regions would require knowledge about the 3D
boundaries of obscuring items (pillars, furniture), their spatial location with

conceals the hideout) requires examining the 3D relation between boundaries of
occluding objects and their neighborhoods & surroundings. Our method
successfully extracts relevant depth features from a single RGB image and
quantitatively yields significant improvement over existing object detection

we look at cell migration, tissue response to external stress, tissue extrusion

a function of cell death and division and the rules that trigger these events.
We find that not only do cell death and division events significantly alter

attracted attention in recent years. In this paper, a communication efficient
algorithm, called ordering-based alternating direction method of multipliers
(OADMM) is devised in a general fully decentralized network setting where a
worker can only exchange messages with neighbors. Compared to the classical
ADMM, a key feature of OADMM is that transmissions are ordered among workers at
each iteration such that a worker with the most informative data broadcasts its
local variable to neighbors first, and neighbors who have not transmitted yet
can update their local variables based on that received transmission. In OADMM,
we prohibit workers from transmitting if their current local variables are not
sufficiently different from their previously transmitted value. A variant of
OADMM, called SOADMM, is proposed where transmissions are ordered but
transmissions are never stopped for each node at each iteration. Numerical
results demonstrate that given a targeted accuracy, OADMM can significantly
reduce the number of communications compared to existing algorithms including
ADMM. We also show numerically that SOADMM can accelerate convergence,
resulting in communication savings compared to the classical ADMM.

of the combustion chamber and propagate towards the closed end. Our experiments
revealed two distinct propagation regimes depending on the equivalence ratio of
the mixture as a consequence of the coupling between the heat-release rate and
the acoustic waves. The primary acoustic instability induces a small-amplitude,
of around 8 mm, oscillatory motion across the chamber that is observed for lean
propane, lean DME, and rich methane flames. Eventually, a secondary acoustic
instability emerges for sufficiently rich (lean) propane and DME (methane)
flames, inducing large-amplitude oscillations in the direction of propagation
of the flame. The amplitude of these oscillations can be as large as 30 mm and
drastically changes the outline of the flame. The front then forms pulsating
finger-shaped structures that characterize the flame propagation under the
secondary acoustic instability. The experimental setup allows the recording of
the flame propagation from two different points of view. The top view is used
to obtain accurate quantitative information about the flame propagation, while
the lateral view offered a novel three dimensional perspective of the flame
that gives relevant information on the transition between the two oscillatory
regimes. The influence of the geometry of the Hele-Shaw cell and of the
equivalence ratio on the transition between the two acoustic-instability

is conditioned on a latent vector. The zero-level-set of each SDF implicitly

geometries to their post-stamping physical (e.g., strain) distributions.
Manufacturing constraints are imposed based on these distributions and are used
to formulate a novel objective function for optimisation. A new gradient-based
optimisation technique is employed to iteratively update the latent vectors,
and therefore geometries, to minimise this objective function and thus meet the
manufacturing constraints. Case studies based on optimising box geometries
subject to a sheet thinning constraint for a hot stamping process are presented
and discussed. The results show that expressive geometric changes are
achievable, and that these changes are driven by stamping performance.

to backdoor attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by
poisoning a few training samples. The attacked model behaves normally on benign
samples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed when the backdoor
is activated. We reveal that poisoned samples tend to cluster together in the
feature space of the attacked DNN model, which is mostly due to the end-to-end
supervised training paradigm. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel
backdoor defense via decoupling the original end-to-end training process into
three stages. Specifically, we first learn the backbone of a DNN model via
\emph{self-supervised learning} based on training samples without their labels.
The learned backbone will map samples with the same ground-truth label to
similar locations in the feature space. Then, we freeze the parameters of the
learned backbone and train the remaining fully connected layers via standard
training with all (labeled) training samples. Lastly, to further alleviate
side-effects of poisoned samples in the second stage, we remove labels of some
`low-credible' samples determined based on the learned model and conduct a
\emph{semi-supervised fine-tuning} of the whole model. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets and DNN models verify that the proposed defense is
effective in reducing backdoor threats while preserving high accuracy in
predicting benign samples. Our code is available at

maintaining user engagement for online platforms. They are interesting
recommender systems to machine learning practitioners with more sequential and
long-term feedback considerations. Most machine learning applications in
notification systems are built around response-prediction models, trying to
attribute both short-term impact and long-term impact to a notification
decision. However, a user's experience depends on a sequence of notifications
and attributing impact to a single notification is not always accurate, if not
impossible. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning is a better
framework for notification systems in terms of performance and iteration speed.
We propose an offline reinforcement learning framework to optimize sequential
notification decisions for driving user engagement. We describe a
state-marginalized importance sampling policy evaluation approach, which can be
used to evaluate the policy offline and tune learning hyperparameters. Through
simulations that approximate the notifications ecosystem, we demonstrate the
performance and benefits of the offline evaluation approach as a part of the
reinforcement learning modeling approach. Finally, we collect data through
online exploration in the production system, train an offline Double Deep
Q-Network and launch a successful policy online. We also discuss the practical
considerations and results obtained by deploying these policies for a

(SMR), a user-oriented source-code-based approach for MLIR idiom matching and
rewriting that does not require a compiler expert's intervention. SMR uses a
two-phase automaton-based DAG-matching algorithm inspired by early work on
tree-pattern matching. First, the idiom Control-Dependency Graph (CDG) is
matched against the program's CDG to rule out code fragments that do not have a
control-flow structure similar to the desired idiom. Second, candidate code
fragments from the previous phase have their Data-Dependency Graphs (DDGs)

luminosities is based on the assumption that the decay with distance of the
flux of the X-rays received from magnetars obeys the inverse-square law. The
results presented here, of testing the hypothesis of independence of
luminosities and distances of magnetars by means of the Efron-Petrosian
statistic, do not uphold this assumption however: they imply that the
observational data in the McGill Magnetar Catalog are consistent with the
dependence S\propto D^{-3/2} of the flux densities S of these objects on their
distances D at substantially higher levels of significance than they are with
the dependence S\propto D^{-2}. These results are not incompatible with the
requirements of the conservation of energy because the radiation process
described in Ardavan (2021, MNRAS, 507, 4530), by which the superluminally
moving current sheet in the magnetosphere of a neutron star is shown to
generate the slowly decaying X-ray pulses, is intrinsically transient. Once
their over-estimation is rectified, the ratios of X-ray to spin-down
luminosities of known magnetars turn out to be invariably lower than one. A
magnetar differs from other rotationally powered pulsars only in that it is
observed along a privileged latitudinal direction relative to its spin axis:
the closer is the line of sight to a direction in which the radiation from the
current sheet is focused, the higher the frequency content and the lower the
decay rate with distance of the observed radiation. The outbursts
characterizing the emission of a magnetar thus arise from sudden movements of
its spin or magnetic axes.

that thermal 1/f noise closely matches the 1/f spectrum obtained by passing a

process has recently been introduced to interpret 1/f noise in semiconductors.
The square of this intermittent g-r process generates a 1/f noise component
which correlates with Voss and Clarke's empirical findings. Traps which
intermittently rather than continuously generate g-r pulses are suggested as
the origin of 1/f noise under drift and thermal agitation. We see no need to
introduce correlated temperature fluctuations or oxide traps with a large

maximize the number of conversions given a budget constraint. As the volume of
impressions, conversion rates and prices vary over time, these budget
management systems learn a spend plan (to find the optimal distribution of

  This paper considers two models for impressions and competition that varies
with time: a) an episodic model which exhibits stationarity in each episode,
but each episode can be arbitrarily different from the next, and b) a model
where the distributions of prices and values change slowly over time. We
present the first learning theoretic guarantees on both the accuracy of spend
plans and the resulting end-to-end budget management system. We present four
main results: 1) for the episodic setting we give sample complexity bounds for
the spend rate prediction problem: given $n$ samples from each episode, with
high probability we have $|\widehat{\rho}_e - \rho_e| \leq
\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ where $\rho_e$ is the optimal spend rate for the
episode, $\widehat{\rho}_e$ is the estimate from our algorithm, 2) we extend
the algorithm of Balseiro and Gur (2017) to operate on varying, approximate
spend rates and show that the resulting combined system of optimal spend rate
estimation and online pacing algorithm for episodic settings has regret that
vanishes in number of historic samples $n$ and the number of rounds $T$, 3) for
non-episodic but slowly-changing distributions we show that the same approach
approximates the optimal bidding strategy up to a factor dependent on the
rate-of-change of the distributions and 4) we provide experiments showing that
our algorithm outperforms both static spend plans and non-pacing across a wide
variety of settings.

popular in e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we figure out that although
existing recommendation models are effective in traditional recommendation

inferior performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel recommendation

User Intent Network (UIN), which responds to generate a precise probability

the prediction from UIN; and (3) Hybrid Interest Extracting Module (HIEM),

computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of
algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of
cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to
NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets
unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length
of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a
troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in
practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key,
and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on ""one-way""
assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the
existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P
!= NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher
algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a
plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the
plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext
pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also
easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing
short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem
and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way
functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions,
that is, directly proving that P != NP.
