ad-hoc peer to peer communication. Our Robot Web solution is based on Gaussian
Belief Propagation on the fundamental non-linear factor graph describing the
probabilistic structure of all of the observations robots make internally or of
each other, and is flexible for any type of robot, motion or sensor. We define
a simple and efficient communication protocol which can be implemented by the
publishing and reading of web pages or other asynchronous communication
technologies. We show in simulations with up to 1000 robots interacting in
arbitrary patterns that our solution convergently achieves global accuracy as
accurate as a centralised non-linear factor graph solver while operating with
high distributed efficiency of computation and communication. Via the use of
robust factors in GBP, our method is tolerant to a high percentage of faults in
sensor measurements or dropped communication packets.

an incommensurate CDW phase when cooled just below room temperature, namely at
T$_{\rm{CDW}} $= 263 K. We make use of both optical laser and free-electron
laser (FEL) based time-resolved spectroscopies in order to study the effect of
a selective excitation on the normal-state and on the CDW phases, by probing
the near-infrared/visible optical properties both along and perpendicularly to
the direction of the CDW, where the system is metallic and insulating,
respectively. Excitation of the core-levels by ultrashort X-ray FEL pulses at
47 eV and 119 eV induces reflectivity transients resembling those recorded when
only exciting the valence band of the compound - by near-infrared pulses at
1.55 eV - in the case of the insulating sub-system. Conversely, the metallic
sub-system displays a relaxation dynamics which depends on the energy of
photo-excitation. Moreover, excitation of the CDW amplitude mode is recorded
only for excitation at low-photon-energy. This fact suggests that the coupling
of light to ordered states of matter can predominantly be achieved when
directly injecting delocalized carriers in the valence band, rather than
localized excitations in the core levels. On a complementary side, table-top
experiments allow us to prove the quasi-unidirectional nature of the CDW phase
in (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, whose fingerprints are detected along its $c$-axis only.
Our results provide new insights on the symmetry of the ordered phase of
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I perturbed by a selective excitation, and suggest a novel
approach based on complementary table-top and FEL spectroscopies for the study
of complex materials.

due to underlying added complexity of magnetism. In this work, we predict the
interplay of magnetism and topology in the non-centrosymmetric ternary
manganese compound MnIn$_2$Te$_4$, using first-principles calculations. At
ambient pressure, the ground state of the system is an antiferromagnetic
insulator. With the application of small hydrostatic pressure ($\sim$0.50 GPa),
it undergoes a magnetic transition and the ferromagnetic state becomes
energetically favourable. At $\sim$2.92 GPa, the system undergoes a transition
into a Weyl semimetallic phase, which hosts multiple Weyl points in the bulk
and is associated with non-trivial surface Fermi arcs. Remarkably, we discover
that the number of Weyl points in this system can be controlled by pressure and
that these manifest in an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In addition to
proposing a new candidate magnetic topological material, our work demonstrates
that pressure can be an effective way to induce and control topological phases,
as well as AHC, in magnetic materials. These properties may allow our proposed
material to be used as a novel pressure-controlled Hall switch.

the primary aim to provide economic stationary energy storage. Featuring two
liquid metal electrodes separated by a molten salt electrolyte, LMBs operate at
elevated temperature as simple concentration cells. Therefore, efficient mass
transfer is a basic prerequisite for their economic operation. Understanding
these mechanisms cannot be limited at the single layer level. With this
motivation, the effects of solutal- and thermally-driven flow are studied, as
well as the flow coupling between the three liquid layers of the cell. It is
shown that solutal convection appears first and thermal convection much later.
While the presence of solutal flow depends on the mode of operation (charge or
discharge), the occurrence of thermal convection is dictated by the geometry
(thickness of layers). The coupling of the flow phenomena between the layers is
intriguing: while thermal convection is confined to its area of origin, i.e.
the electrolyte, solutal convection is able to drive flow in the positive
electrode and in the electrolyte.

Lima et al. [JCSS 2021] proved, among other results, that unlike most of the
so-called blocker problems, CONTRACTION(vc) admits an XP algorithm running in
time $f(d) \cdot n^{O(d)}$. They left open the question of whether this problem
is FPT under this parameterization. In this article, we continue this line of
research and prove the following results:
  1. CONTRACTION(vc) is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k + d$. Moreover, unless
the ETH fails, the problem does not admit an algorithm running in time $f(k +
d) \cdot n^{o(k + d)}$ for any function $f$. In particular, this answers the
open question stated in Lima et al. [JCSS 2021] in the negative.
  2. It is NP-hard to decide whether an instance $(G, k, d)$ of CONTRACTION(vc)
is a yes-instance even when $k = d$, hence enhancing our understanding of the
classical complexity of the problem.
  3. CONTRACTION(vc) can be solved in time $2^{O(d)} \cdot n^{k - d + O(1)}$.
This XP algorithm improves the one of Lima et al. [JCSS 2021], which uses
Courcelle's theorem as a subroutine and hence, the $f(d)$-factor in the running
time is non-explicit and probably very large. On the other hard, it shows that
when $k=d$, the problem is FPT parameterized by $d$ (or by $k$).

experimental results. It postulates that the brain is at a critical point
between an ordered and a chaotic regime, sometimes referred to as the ""edge of
chaos."" Another central observation of neuroscience is the principle of
excitation-inhibition balance: Certain brain networks exhibit a remarkably
constant ratio between excitation and inhibition. When this balance is
perturbed, the network shifts away from the critical point, as may for example
happen during epileptic seizures. However, it is as of yet unclear what
mechanisms balance the neural dynamics towards this excitation-inhibition ratio
that ensures critical brain dynamics. Here we introduce a simple yet
biologically plausible toy model of a self-organized critical neural network
with a self-organizing excitation to inhibition ratio. The model only requires
a neuron to have local information of its own recent activity and changes
connections between neurons accordingly. We find that the network evolves to a
state characterized by avalanche distributions following universal scaling laws
typical of criticality, and to a specific excitation to inhibition ratio. The
model connects the two questions of brain criticality and of a specific
excitation/inhibition balance observed in the brain to a common origin or
mechanism. From the perspective of the statistical mechanics of such networks,
the model uses the excitation/inhibition ratio as control parameter of a phase
transition, which enables criticality at arbitrary high connectivities. We find
that network clustering plays a crucial role for this phase transition to
occur.

learning algorithms, and there is increasing interest in understanding its
theoretical guarantees. In this work, we initiate the study of policy
optimization for the stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem, a goal-oriented
reinforcement learning model that strictly generalizes the finite-horizon model
and better captures many applications. We consider a wide range of settings,
including stochastic and adversarial environments under full information or
bandit feedback, and propose a policy optimization algorithm for each setting
that makes use of novel correction terms and/or variants of dilated bonuses
(Luo et al., 2021). For most settings, our algorithm is shown to achieve a
near-optimal regret bound.
  One key technical contribution of this work is a new approximation scheme to
tackle SSP problems that we call \textit{stacked discounted approximation} and
use in all our proposed algorithms. Unlike the finite-horizon approximation
that is heavily used in recent SSP algorithms, our new approximation enables us
to learn a near-stationary policy with only logarithmic changes during an
episode and could lead to an exponential improvement in space complexity.

computation and memory requirements for using deep neural networks for
resource-constrained devices. Most existing research focuses primarily on
balancing the sparsity and accuracy of a pruned neural network by strategically
removing insignificant parameters and retraining the pruned model. Such efforts
on reusing training samples pose serious privacy risks due to increased
memorization, which, however, has not been investigated yet.
  In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of privacy risks in neural
network pruning. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of neural network
pruning on training data privacy, i.e., membership inference attacks. We first
explore the impact of neural network pruning on prediction divergence, where
the pruning process disproportionately affects the pruned model's behavior for
members and non-members. Meanwhile, the influence of divergence even varies
among different classes in a fine-grained manner. Enlighten by such divergence,
we proposed a self-attention membership inference attack against the pruned
neural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted to rigorously evaluate the
privacy impacts of different pruning approaches, sparsity levels, and adversary
knowledge. The proposed attack shows the higher attack performance on the
pruned models when compared with eight existing membership inference attacks.
In addition, we propose a new defense mechanism to protect the pruning process
by mitigating the prediction divergence based on KL-divergence distance, whose
effectiveness has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively mitigate the
privacy risks while maintaining the sparsity and accuracy of the pruned models.

landcover methods and training strategies are claimed to be the
state-of-the-art, the already fragmented technical landscape of landcover

of literature review work attempting to guide researchers in making an informed
choice of landcover mapping methods, the articles either focus on the review of
applications in a specific area or revolve around general deep learning models,
which lack a systematic view of the ever advancing landcover mapping methods.
In addition, issues related to training samples and model transferability have
become more critical than ever in an era dominated by data-driven approaches,
but these issues were addressed to a lesser extent in previous review articles
regarding remote sensing classification. Therefore, in this paper, we present a
systematic overview of existing methods by starting from learning methods and

domain gaps across different geographical regions; and (3) multi-source and
multi-view fusion. We discuss in detail each of these categorical methods and
draw concluding remarks in these developments and recommend potential

exist various such algorithms, but many of them can only guarantee local
convergence to the desired path in its neighborhood. In contrast, the control
algorithms using a well-designed guiding vector field can ensure almost global
convergence of trajectories to the desired path; here, ""almost"" means that in
some cases, a measure-zero set of trajectories converge to the singular set
where the vector field becomes zero (with all other trajectories converging to
the desired path). In this paper, we first generalize the guiding vector field
from the Euclidean space to a general smooth Riemannian manifold. This
generalization can deal with path-following in some abstract configuration
space (such as robot arm joint space). Then we show several theoretical results
from a topological viewpoint. Specifically, we are motivated by the observation
that singular points of the guiding vector field exist in many examples where
the desired path is homeomorphic to the unit circle, but it is unknown whether
the existence of singular points always holds in general (i.e., is inherent in
the topology of the desired path). In the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, we
provide an affirmative answer, and conclude that it is not possible to
guarantee global convergence to desired paths that are homeomorphic to the unit
circle. Furthermore, we show that there always exist \emph{non-path-converging

required to be repeatedly evaluated. This task is intractable for costly
numerical models. Such a problem turns out to be even more severe for
stochastic simulators, the output of which is a random variable for a given set
of input parameters. To alleviate the computational burden, surrogate models
are usually constructed and evaluated instead. However, due to the random
nature of the model response, classical surrogate models cannot be applied
directly to the emulation of stochastic simulators. To efficiently represent
the probability distribution of the model output for any given input values, we
develop a new stochastic surrogate model called stochastic polynomial chaos
expansions. To this aim, we introduce a latent variable and an additional noise
variable, on top of the well-defined input variables, to reproduce the
stochasticity. As a result, for a given set of input parameters, the model
output is given by a function of the latent variable with an additive noise,
thus a random variable. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm which
does not require repeated runs of the simulator for the same input parameters.
The performance of the proposed method is compared with the generalized lambda
model and a state-of-the-art kernel estimator on two case studies in
mathematical finance and epidemiology and on an analytical example whose
response distribution is bimodal. The results show that the proposed method is
able to accurately represent general response distributions, i.e., not only
normal or unimodal ones. In terms of accuracy, it generally outperforms both
the generalized lambda model and the kernel density estimator.

with the O(P) largest eigenvalues, where $P$ is the size of the training set.
This prediction works very well on benchmark data sets such as images, yet the

To clarify when the spectral bias prediction holds, we first focus on a
one-dimensional model where rigorous results are obtained and then use scaling
arguments to generalize and test our findings in higher dimensions. Our
predictions include the classification case $f(x)=$sign$(x_1)$ with a data

allowed to switch between two distributions depending on the regime. It is
assumed that a self-adjusting threshold component that is driven by the past
values of the time series determines the current market regime. The proposed
model is able to capture aspects such as asymmetric and heteroscedastic
behavior of volatility in financial markets. The proposed model is an attempt
at addressing several potential deficits found in existing price range models
such as the Conditional Autoregressive Range (CARR), Asymmetric CARR (ACARR),
Feedback ACARR (FACARR) and Threshold Autoregressive Range (TARR) models.
Parameters of the model are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method.
A simulation study shows that the ML method performs well in estimating the
TACARR model parameters. The empirical performance of the TACARR model was
investigated using IBM index data and results show that the proposed model is a
good alternative for in-sample prediction and out-of-sample forecasting of
volatility.

contributions that lead to detectable back action. Specifically, we
theoretically address two realistic setups, exploiting one or two probe beams
for the nonlinear interaction with the quantum vacuum, respectively. The setup
parameters at which back action starts to considerably contaminate the measured
noise profiles are determined. Due to the vacuum fluctuations entering at the
beam splitter, the shot noise of two incoming probe pulses in different

noise in the correlation, while further contributions due to nonlinear
shot-noise enhancement are still present. Ultimately, the regime in which
electro-optic sampling of quantum fields can be considered as effectively

to investigate EBSE training and its benefits for the practice. Objective: We
sought both to develop an EBSE training course for university students and to
investigate what effects it has on the attitudes and behaviors of the trainees.
Method: We conducted a longitudinal case study to study our EBSE course and its
effects. For this, we collect data at the end of each EBSE course (2017, 2018,
and 2019), and in two follow-up surveys (one after 7 months of finishing the
last course, and a second after 21 months). Results: Our EBSE courses seem to
have taught students adequately and consistently. Half of the respondents to
the surveys report making use of the new skills from the course. The
most-reported effects in both surveys indicated that EBSE concepts increase
awareness of the value of research and evidence and EBSE methods improve
information gathering skills. Conclusions: As suggested by research in other
areas, training appears to play a key role in the adoption of evidence-based
practice. Our results indicate that our training method provides an
introduction to EBSE suitable for undergraduates. However, we believe it is
necessary to continue investigating EBSE training and its impact on software

These methods are not applicable to drawing inference for a continuous

confounders when evaluating a continuous treatment, existing inference methods
often rely on discretizing the treatment or using (possibly misspecified)
parametric models for the effect curve. Recently, Kennedy et al. (2017)
proposed nonparametric doubly robust estimation for a continuous treatment
effect in observational studies. However, inference for the continuous
treatment effect is a harder problem. To the best of our knowledge, a
completely nonparametric doubly robust approach for inference in this setting

actions of right-angled Coexter groups and right-angled Artin groups with
finite defining graphs on the visual boundaries and the Nevo-Sageev boundaries
of their natural assigned CAT(0) cube complexes. In particular, we establish
(strongly) pure infiniteness results for reduced crossed product $C^*$-algebras
of these actions through investigating the corresponding $\cat$ cube complexes
and establishing necessary dynamical properties such as minimality, topological
freeness and pure infiniteness of the actions. In addition, we study actions of
fundamental groups of graphs of groups on the visual boundaries of their
Bass-Serre trees. We show that the existence of repeatable paths essentially
implies that the action is $2$-filling, from which, we also obtain a large
class of unital Kirchberg algebras. Furthermore, our result also provides a new
method in identifying $C^*$-simple generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups. The
examples of groups obtained from our method have $n$-paradoxical towers in the
sense of \cite{G-G-K-N}. This class particularly contains non-degenerated free

put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing

ten global health threats. For the control of dengue, the Applying Wolbachia to
Eliminate Dengue (AWED) study group conducted a cluster-randomized trial in
Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and used a novel design, called the cluster-randomized
test-negative design (CR-TND). This design can yield valid statistical
inference with data collected by a passive surveillance system and thus has the
advantage of cost-efficiency compared to traditional cluster-randomized trials.
We investigate the statistical assumptions and properties of CR-TND under a
randomization inference framework, which is known to be robust and efficient
for small-sample problems. We find that, when the differential
healthcare-seeking behavior comparing intervention and control varies across
clusters (in contrast to the setting of Dufault and Jewell, 2020 where the
differential healthcare-seeking behavior is constant across clusters), current
analysis methods for CR-TND can be biased and have inflated type I error. We
propose the log-contrast estimator that can eliminate such bias and improve
precision by adjusting for covariates. Furthermore, we extend our methods to
handle partial intervention compliance and a stepped-wedge design, both of
which appear frequently in cluster-randomized trials. Finally, we demonstrate
our results by simulation studies and re-analysis of the AWED study.

network learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predict
whether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. The

updated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visual
encoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-training
framework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the first

TikTok), video retrieval using sentence queries has become an important demand
and attracts increasing research attention. Despite the decent performance,
existing text-video retrieval models in vision and language communities are
impractical for large-scale Web search because they adopt brute-force search
based on high-dimensional embeddings. To improve efficiency, Web search engines
widely apply vector compression libraries (e.g., FAISS) to post-process the
learned embeddings. Unfortunately, separate compression from feature encoding
degrades the robustness of representations and incurs performance decay. To
pursue a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose the
first quantized representation learning method for cross-view video retrieval,
namely Hybrid Contrastive Quantization (HCQ). Specifically, HCQ learns both
coarse-grained and fine-grained quantizations with transformers, which provide
complementary understandings for texts and videos and preserve comprehensive
semantic information. By performing Asymmetric-Quantized Contrastive Learning
(AQ-CL) across views, HCQ aligns texts and videos at coarse-grained and
multiple fine-grained levels. This hybrid-grained learning strategy serves as
strong supervision on the cross-view video quantization model, where
contrastive learning at different levels can be mutually promoted. Extensive
experiments on three Web video benchmark datasets demonstrate that HCQ achieves
competitive performance with state-of-the-art non-compressed retrieval methods
while showing high efficiency in storage and computation. Code and
configurations are available at https://github.com/gimpong/WWW22-HCQ.

personalization, game contextualization and social connection. However,
simultaneously solving all is rather challenging for game recommendation.
Firstly, personalization for game recommendation requires the incorporation of
the dwelling time of engaged games, which are ignored in existing methods.
Secondly, game contextualization should reflect the complex and high-order
properties of those relations. Last but not least, it is problematic to use
social connections directly for game recommendations due to the massive noise
within social connections. To this end, we propose a Social-aware

comets.
  We used the Onsala 20-m telescope to search for millimetre transitions of HCN
towards a sample of 11 recent and mostly bright comets in the period December
2016 to November 2019. Also CH$_3$OH was searched for in two comets. The HCN
sample includes the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. For the short-period comet
46P/Wirtanen we could monitor the variation of HCN emission over a time span of
about one month. We performed radiative transfer modelling for the observed
molecular emission by also including time-dependent effects due to the
outgassing of molecules.
  HCN was detected in 6 comets. Two of these are short-period comets and 4 of
them are long-period. Six methanol transitions were detected in 46P/Wirtanen,
enabling us to determine the gas kinetic temperature. From the observations, we
determined the molecular production rates using time-dependent radiative
transfer modelling. For 5 comets, we could determine that the HCN mixing ratios
lie near 0.1% using contemporary water production rates, $Q_\mathrm{H_2O}$,
taken from other studies. This HCN mixing ratio was also found typical in our
monitoring observations of 46P/Wirtanen but here we notice deviations, on a
daily time scale, up to 0.2% which could indicate short-time changes in the
outgassing activity. From our radiative transfer modelling of cometary comae,
we found that time-dependent effects on the HCN level populations are of the
order 5-15% when $Q_\mathrm{H_2O}$ is around $2\times 10^{28}\,\mathrm{mol\,
s^{-1}}$. The effects may be relatively stronger for comets with lower
$Q_\mathrm{H_2O}$. The exact details of the time-dependent effects depend on
the amount of neutral and electron collisions, radiative pumping, and molecular
parameters such as the spontaneous rate coefficient.

problem consists in the minimization of a smooth objective function and the
lower-level problem is to find the fixed point of a smooth contraction map.
This type of problems include instances of meta-learning, equilibrium models,
hyperparameter optimization and data poisoning adversarial attacks. Several
recent works have proposed algorithms which warm-start the lower-level problem,
i.e. they use the previous lower-level approximate solution as a staring point
for the lower-level solver. This warm-start procedure allows one to improve the
sample complexity in both the stochastic and deterministic settings, achieving
in some cases the order-wise optimal sample complexity. However, there are
situations, e.g., meta learning and equilibrium models, in which the warm-start
procedure is not well-suited or ineffective. In this work we show that without
warm-start, it is still possible to achieve order-wise (near) optimal sample
complexity. In particular, we propose a simple method which uses (stochastic)
fixed point iterations at the lower-level and projected inexact gradient
descent at the upper-level, that reaches an $\epsilon$-stationary point using
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ samples for the stochastic
and the deterministic setting, respectively. Finally, compared to methods using
warm-start, our approach yields a simpler analysis that does not need to study
the coupled interactions between the upper-level and lower-level iterates.

environment through carefully constructed transmitted signals. In this paper,
we design and implement the first-of-its-kind over-the-air convolution and
demonstrate it for inference tasks in a convolutional neural network (CNN). We
engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) to design such an architecture, which we call
'AirNN'. AirNN leverages the physics of wave reflection to represent a digital
convolution, an essential part of a CNN architecture, in the analog domain. In
contrast to classical communication, where the receiver must react to the
channel-induced transformation, generally represented as finite impulse
response (FIR) filter, AirNN proactively creates the signal reflections to
emulate specific FIR filters through RIS. AirNN involves two steps: first, the
weights of the neurons in the CNN are drawn from a finite set of channel
impulse responses (CIR) that correspond to realizable FIR filters. Second, each
CIR is engineered through RIS, and reflected signals combine at the receiver to
determine the output of the convolution. This paper presents a proof-of-concept
of AirNN by experimentally demonstrating over-the-air convolutions. We then
validate the entire resulting CNN model accuracy via simulations for an example
task of modulation classification.

challenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat

  In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy

new threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious
users, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic
encryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner.
Then, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of
detecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key
observation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models
for attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to
identify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of
secure aggregation.

compound growth, a system for growing the system. Its self-organization needs
to shift resources from multiplying its scale to maturing and adapting its
design for its new environment, a challenging environmental coordination
process.
  We see that taking place in biological reproduction all the time, of course,
but it all needs to occur for businesses, economies, cultures, and even for
creative work and personal relationships to survive their initial periods of
compound growth. Why economic growth as a process that accelerates ever faster
still seems unlimited to some seems to come from representing growth as a
numerical rather than organizational development process. For example, all
kinds of adaptive system organization have limits to how fast they can
rearrange their systems.
  To understand the kinds of limits and adaptations that lead to a successful
growth climax and perhaps a long creative life to follow, we combine the most
notable observed milestones of successful growth found in nature, divided into
3 main development periods. Those milestones of new lives (MNL) teach us
alternative paths to follow The primary milestones include 3 critical events,
initiating 3 feedback periods, for 3 organizational development stages,
occurring in 3 environments. Together they can be called the A, B, C, egg,
nest, world, or natural growth pattern. By observing them in familiar cases, we
learn the patterns that also apply in others.

awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into
the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The
considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark,
where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help
objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a
climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to
predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate
simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods
(e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution,
ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and,
if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN
decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further
investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation
of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep
learning for prediction problems.

However, to generalize or transport a causal effect from an RCT to a target

In practice, it is impossible to know whether the set of moderators has been
properly accounted for. In the following paper, I propose a three parameter
sensitivity analysis for generalizing or transporting experimental results
using weighted estimators, with several advantages over existing methods.
First, the framework does not require assumptions on the underlying data
generating process for either the experimental sample selection mechanism or
treatment effect heterogeneity. Second, I show that the sensitivity parameters
are guaranteed to be bounded and propose several tools researchers can use to
perform sensitivity analysis: (1) graphical and numerical summaries for
researchers to assess how robust a point estimate is to killer confounders; (2)
an extreme scenario analysis; and (3) a formal benchmarking approach for
researchers to estimate potential sensitivity parameter values using existing

the Fourier transform of the two-dimensional projection of the sample's
electron density, which can be reconstructed efficiently but lacks any depth
information. In cases where the diffracted signal can be measured up to
scattering angles exceeding 10 degrees, i.e. in the wide-angle regime,
three-dimensional morphological information of the target is contained in a
single-shot diffraction pattern. However, the extraction of the 3D structural
information is no longer straightforward and defines the key challenge in
wide-angle CDI. So far, the most convenient approach relies on iterative
forward fitting of the scattering pattern using scattering simulations. Here we
present the Scatman, an approximate and fast numerical tool for the simulation
and iterative fitting of wide-angle scattering images of isolated samples.
Furthermore, we publish and describe in detail our Open Source software
implementation of the Scatman algorithm, PyScatman. The Scatman approach yields
quantitative results for weakly scattering samples. PyScatman is capable of
computing wide-angle scattering patterns in few milliseconds even on
consumer-level computing hardware. The high computational efficiency of
PyScatman enables effective data analysis based on model fitting, thus
representing an important step towards a systematic application of 3D Coherent
Diffraction Imaging from single wide-angle diffraction patterns in various
scientific communities.

can represent a significant portion of the total multiplicity of a heavy-ion
collision event. Since their transverse momenta are initially larger than the
typical saturation scale describing the bulk of the equilibrating QGP, their
typical stopping distances are larger than the usual hydrodynamization time, so
they do not in general hydrodynamize at the same pace than the bulk of the
collision. Therefore, in general mini-jets cannot be described solely by a
unique pre-equilibrium stage that bridges the initial, over-occupied glasma
state, with the hydrodynamical evolution. In this work we make use of a new
concurrent mini-jet+hydrodynamic framework in which the properties of the
hydrodynamically evolving QGP are modified due to the injection of energy and
momentum from the mini-jets. We study the system for different choices of the
minimum transverse momentum associated to mini-jet production. In order to
achieve a realistic description of charged particle multiplicity, the amount of
entropy associated to the low-$x$ initial state needs to be reduced. Moreover,
the fact that the injected momentum from the randomly oriented mini-jets is not
correlated with the spatial gradients of the system reduces overall flow, and
the value of the QGP transport coefficients needs to be reduced accordingly.
They are an important new source of fluctuations, resulting in a spikier,
notably modified hydrodynamical evolution. We discuss the impact of the
mini-jets on a number of observables, such as $p_T$ spectra and
$p_T$-differential flow $v_n$ for a wide range of centrality classes. In
contrast to elliptic, triangular or quadrangular flow, we find that directed
flow, $v_1$, has the strongest potential to discriminate between different
mini-jet production rates.

However, in practice, data collection is often time-consuming and has time
delays, with both historical and current disease statistics being updated
continuously. In this work, we propose a real-time population-level disease
prediction model which captures data latency (PopNet) and incorporates the
updated data for improved predictions. To achieve this goal, PopNet models
real-time data and updated data using two separate systems, each capturing
spatial and temporal effects using hybrid graph attention networks and
recurrent neural networks. PopNet then fuses the two systems using both spatial
and temporal latency-aware attentions in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate
PopNet on real-world disease datasets and show that PopNet consistently
outperforms all baseline disease prediction and general spatial-temporal

lower mean absolute error compared with the best baselines.

recent Letter Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 176601 (2021) are unreliable. There
are two problems in this Letter. Firstly, the characteristic described by the
RG flows $m\rightarrow\infty$ and $D\rightarrow0$ can not be used as the
criterion for transition from second-order TI to TI, since this characteristic
could be essentially not induced by Coulomb interaction but only results from
the trivial power counting contribution of fermion action. Indeed, this
characteristic is satisfied even for free second-order TI. Second, the flow of
$B$ is not paid attention, which is very important and should be seriously
studied. In this article, we analyze carefully the corrections for the flows of
the model parameters induced by Coulomb interaction. We find that the sign of
$m$ changes but the sign of $B$ holds if the initial Coulomb strength is large
enough, while the sign of $m$ holds but the sign of $B$ changes if the initial
Coulomb strength takes small values. These results indicate that second-order
TI is unstable to trivial band insulator not only under strong Coulomb
interaction but also under weak Coulomb interaction. We also study the effects
of disorder scattering in second-order TI by renormalization group theory.
According to the criterion in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 176601 (2021), weak
disorder drives second-order TI to TI. However, we find that second-order TI is
robust against weak disorder, since weak disorder does not give qualitative
modification for second-order TI. This result is consistent with recent studies
based on other methods. Interplay of Coulomb interaction and disorder in

galaxies covering the same parameter space as the observed galaxies in the
SPARC database, assigning them to dark matter halos using abundance matching
and halo mass-concentration relations. We consider several abundance matching
relations, finding some to be a better match to the kinematic data than others.
We compute the unavoidable gravitational interactions between baryons and their
dark matter halos, leading to an overall compression of the original NFW halos.
Before halo compression, high-mass galaxies approximately lie on the observed
RAR whereas low-mass galaxies display up-bending ""hooks"" at small radii due to
DM cusps, making them deviate systematically from the observed relation. After
halo compression, the initial NFW halos become more concentrated at small
radii, making larger contributions to rotation curves. This increases the total
accelerations, moving all model galaxies away from the observed relation. These
systematic deviations suggest that the CDM model with abundance matching alone
cannot explain the observed RAR. Further effects (e.g., feedback) would need to
counteract the compression with precisely the right amount of halo expansion,
even in high mass galaxies with deep potential wells where such effects are
generally predicted to be negligible.

classify two fundamental types of CO line shapes interpreted as emission from
Keplerian rings (double-peak lines) and a disk surface plus a low-velocity part
of a wind (triangular lines), where CO excitation reflects different emitting
regions (and their gas-to-dust ratio) rather than just the irradiation

explains several properties observed in CO spectra, including the line
blue-shifts, line shapes that turn into narrow absorption at high inclinations,

showing more prominent signatures of elevated star formation. Our analysis thus

blazars) and can be exploited to infer the abundance of all the (misaligned)
jetted AGNs, using a geometrical argument. We then compare the space density of
the most massive SMBHs hosted in jetted AGNs with those present in the total
population (mostly composed by non-jetted AGNs). We find that the space density
has a peak at $z\sim3$, which is significantly larger than the value observed
in the total AGN population with similar optical/UV luminosities ($z\sim2.2$),
but not as extreme as the value previously inferred from X-ray selected blazars
($z\gtrsim4$). The jetted fraction (jetted AGNs/total AGNs) is overall
consistent with the estimates in the local Universe (10--20\%) and at high
redshift, assuming Lorentz bulk factors $\Gamma\approx5$. Finally, we find a
marginal decrease in the jetted fraction at high redshifts (by a factor of
$\sim2$). All these evidences point toward a different evolutionary path in the

Ca-rich transients remain unknown. Although they exhibit spectroscopic
properties not unlike core-collapse Type Ib/c SNe, nearly half are found in the
outskirts of their host galaxies that are predominantly elliptical, suggesting
a closer connection to the older stellar populations of SNe Ia. In this paper,
we present a compilation of publicly available multiwavelength observations of
all known and/or suspected host galaxies of Ca-rich transients ranging from FUV
to IR, and use these data to characterize their stellar populations with
prospector. We estimate several galaxy parameters including integrated star

Ca-rich transients in each of these host galaxies originated from a
core-collapse vs. Type Ia-like explosion. Our work supports the notion that the
population of Ca-rich transients do not come exclusively from core-collapse
explosions, and must either be only from white dwarf stars or a mixed
population of white dwarf stars with other channels, potentially including
massive star explosions. Additional photometry and explosion site spectroscopy
of larger samples of Ca-rich host galaxies will improve these estimates and
better constrain the ratio of white dwarf vs. massive star progenitors of

the linear magnetoelastic coupling present in non-Kramers magnetic ions. This
provides a direct coupling of Raman-active phonons to the magnet's
quasiparticles. We propose to use this mechanism to probe the emergent magnetic
monopoles, electric charges, and photons of the emergent quantum
electrodynamics (eQED) of the U(1) quantum spin liquid known as quantum spin
ice. Detecting this eQED in candidate rare-earth pyrochlore materials, or
indeed signatures of topological magnetic phases more generally, is a
challenging task. We show that the Raman scattering cross-section of the
phonons directly yields relevant information, with the broadening of the phonon
linewidth, which we compute, exhibiting a characteristic frequency dependence
reflecting the two-particle density of states of the emergent excitations.
Remarkably, we find that the Raman linewidth is sensitive to the details of the
symmetry fractionalisation and hence can reveal information about the
projective implementation of symmetry in the quantum spin liquid, thereby
providing a diagnostic for a $\pi$-flux phase. The Raman scattering of the
phonons thus provides a useful experimental tool to probe the fractionalisation
in quantum spin liquids that turns out closely to mirror pair production in
quantum electrodynamics and the deep inelastic scattering of quantum
chromodynamics. Indeed, the difference to the latter is conceptual more than
technical: the partons (quarks) emerge from the hadrons at high energies due to
asymptotic freedom, while those in eQED arise from fractionalisation of the
spins at low energies.

pertinent challenge. Here, we numerically compute the spectral function of a
single hole doped into the half-filled Hubbard model on the triangular lattice

been proposed to realize a chiral spin liquid at intermediate interaction
strength, surrounded by a magnetically ordered phase at strong interactions and
a superconducting/metallic phase at weak interactions. We find that the spectra

mean-field descriptions, we gain insight into the relevant low-energy features.

The QAOA is often presented as an algorithm for noisy hardware. However,

match the connectivity of the qubits. Furthermore, the QAOA must outpace
classical solvers. Here, we investigate swap strategies to map dense problems
into linear, grid and heavy-hex coupling maps. A line-based swap strategy works
best for linear and two-dimensional grid coupling maps. Heavy-hex coupling maps
require an adaptation of the line swap strategy. By contrast, three-dimensional
grid coupling maps benefit from a different swap strategy. Using known entropic

used to train such models. Such attacks, traditionally, are studied on static
models that are trained once and are accessible by the adversary. Motivated to
meet new legal requirements, many machine learning methods are recently
extended to support machine unlearning, i.e., updating models as if certain
examples are removed from their training sets, and meet new legal requirements.
However, privacy attacks could potentially become more devastating in this new
setting, since an attacker could now access both the original model before
deletion and the new model after the deletion. In fact, the very act of
deletion might make the deleted record more vulnerable to privacy attacks.
  Inspired by cryptographic definitions and the differential privacy framework,
we formally study privacy implications of machine unlearning. We formalize
(various forms of) deletion inference and deletion reconstruction attacks, in
which the adversary aims to either identify which record is deleted or to
reconstruct (perhaps part of) the deleted records. We then present successful
deletion inference and reconstruction attacks for a variety of machine learning
models and tasks such as classification, regression, and language models.
Finally, we show that our attacks would provably be precluded if the schemes
satisfy (variants of) Deletion Compliance (Garg, Goldwasser, and Vasudevan,

symmetries not necessarily present in the physical Hamiltonian. The simplest
class encompasses well-known examples such as the Hatano-Nelson and
non-Hermitian SSH models, while more sophisticated classes represent novel
multi-component models with interesting spectral graphs resembling stars,
flowers, and insects. With recent rapid advancements in metamaterials,
ultracold atomic lattices and quantum circuits, it is now feasible to not only
experimentally realize such esoteric spectra, but also investigate the
non-Hermitian flat bands and anomalous responses straddling transitions between
different spectral graph topologies.

  regret",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning is an attractive approach to learn good resource
allocation and scheduling policies based on data when the system model is
unknown. However, the cumulative regret of most RL algorithms scales as $\tilde
O(\mathsf{S} \sqrt{\mathsf{A} T})$, where $\mathsf{S}$ is the size of the state
space, $\mathsf{A}$ is the size of the action space, $T$ is the horizon, and
the $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms. Due to the linear
dependence on the size of the state space, these regret bounds are
prohibitively large for resource allocation and scheduling problems. In this
paper, we present a model-based RL algorithm for such problems which has
scalable regret. In particular, we consider a restless bandit model, and
propose a Thompson-sampling based learning algorithm which is tuned to the
underlying structure of the model. We present two characterizations of the
regret of the proposed algorithm with respect to the Whittle index policy.
First, we show that for a restless bandit with $n$ arms and at most $m$
activations at each time, the regret scales either as $\tilde{O}(mn\sqrt{T})$
or $\tilde{O}(n^2 \sqrt{T})$ depending on the reward model. Second, under an
additional technical assumption, we show that the regret scales as
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5} \sqrt{T})$ or $\tilde{O}(\max\{m\sqrt{n}, n\} \sqrt{T})$. We
present numerical examples to illustrate the salient features of the algorithm.

phenomena and are thought to be possible sources of particle acceleration in

performed a dedicated laboratory experiment. We have generated two
counter-streaming subcritical collisionless magnetized shocks by irradiating
two teflon (CF$_2$) targets with 100 J, 1 ns laser beams on the LULI2000 laser
facility. The interaction region between the plasma flows was pre-filled with a
low density background hydrogen plasma and initialized with an externally
applied homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the shocks. We report here
on measurements of the plasma density and temperature during the formation of
the supercritical shocks, their transition to subcritical, and final
interpenetration. We have also modeled the macroscopic evolution of the system
via hydrodynamic simulations and the microphysics at play during the
interaction via Particle-In-Cell simulations. The main goal was to understand
what was the effect of the second shock on particle energization. We found that
in the presence of two shocks the ambient ions reach energies around 1.5 times
of the ones obtained with single shocks. Both the presence of the downstream
zone of the second shock and of the downstream zone common for the two shocks
play a role in the different energization: the characteristics of the
perpendicular electric fields in the two areas allow, indeed, certain particles
to keep being accelerated or to avoid being decelerated.

learning must include planning with a model of the world that is abstract in
state and time. Deep learning has made progress in state abstraction, but,
although the theory of time abstraction has been extensively developed based on
the options framework, in practice options have rarely been used in planning.
One reason for this is that the space of possible options is immense and the
methods previously proposed for option discovery do not take into account how
the option models will be used in planning. Options are typically discovered by
posing subsidiary tasks such as reaching a bottleneck state, or maximizing a
sensory signal other than the reward. Each subtask is solved to produce an
option, and then a model of the option is learned and made available to the
planning process. The subtasks proposed in most previous work ignore the reward
on the original problem, whereas we propose subtasks that use the original
reward plus a bonus based on a feature of the state at the time the option
stops. We show that options and option models obtained from such
reward-respecting subtasks are much more likely to be useful in planning and
can be learned online and off-policy using existing learning algorithms. Reward
respecting subtasks strongly constrain the space of options and thereby also
provide a partial solution to the problem of option discovery. Finally, we show
how the algorithms for learning values, policies, options, and models can be
unified using general value functions.

inflationary models, with particular emphasis on scalar fields with
non-canonical Lagrangians of the type ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$. The
observational upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r \leq 0.036$,
implies that monotonically increasing convex potentials are now ruled out in
the canonical framework. This includes the simplest classic inflationary
potentials such as $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$ and $\lambda \phi^4$, as well as the
whole family of monomial power law potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$. Instead,
the current observations strongly favour asymptotically flat plateau
potentials. However, working in the non-canonical framework, we demonstrate
that the classic monomial potentials, as well as the Higgs potential with its
Standard Model self-coupling, can easily be accommodated by the CMB data.
Similarly we show that the inverse power law potential $V(\phi) \sim
\phi^{-p}$, which leads to power law inflation in the non-canonical framework,
also satisfies the latest CMB bounds. Significantly, $V(\phi)$ can originate
from Planck scale initial values $V(\phi) \simeq \, m_p^4$ in non-canonical
models while in plateau-like canonical inflation the initial value of the
potential is strongly suppressed $V_{\rm plat}(\phi) \leq 10^{-10} \, m_p^4$.
This has bearing on the issue of initial conditions for inflation and allows
for the equipartition of the kinetic and potential terms in non-canonical
models. Equipartition initial conditions can also be accommodated in simple
extensions to plateau potentials such as the Margarita model of inflation which
is discussed in this paper.

minimum Hamming distance $d$. Studying $A(n, d)$, including efforts to
determine it as well to derive bounds on $A(n, d)$ for large $n$'s, is one of
the most fundamental subjects in coding theory. In this paper, we explore new
lower and upper bounds on $A(n, d)$ in the large-minimum distance regime, in
particular, when $d = n/2 - \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. We first provide a new
construction of cyclic codes, by carefully selecting specific roots in the
binary extension field for the check polynomial, with length $n= 2^m -1$,
distance $d \geq n/2 - 2^{c-1}\sqrt{n}$, and size $n^{c+1/2}$, for any $m\geq
4$ and any integer $c$ with $0 \leq c \leq m/2 - 1$. These code parameters are
slightly worse than those of the Delsarte--Goethals (DG) codes that provide the
previously known best lower bound in the large-minimum distance regime.
However, using a similar and extended code construction technique we show a
sequence of cyclic codes that improve upon DG codes and provide the best lower
bound in a narrower range of the minimum distance $d$, in particular, when $d =
n/2 - \Omega(n^{2/3})$. Furthermore, by leveraging a Fourier-analytic view of
Delsarte's linear program, upper bounds on $A(n, n/2 - \rho\sqrt{n})$ with
$\rho\in (0.5, 9.5)$ are obtained that scale polynomially in $n$. To the best
of authors' knowledge, the upper bound due to Barg and Nogin
\cite{barg2006spectral} is the only previously known upper bound that scale
polynomially in $n$ in this regime. We numerically demonstrate that our upper
bound improves upon the Barg-Nogin upper bound in the specified high-minimum
distance regime.

unprecedented challenges to our society. Before vaccines were available, the
main disease intervention strategies were non-pharmaceutical. Starting December
2020, in Ontario, Canada, vaccines were approved for administering to
vulnerable individuals and gradually expanded to all individuals above the age
of 12. As the vaccine coverage reached a satisfactory level among the eligible
population, normal social activities resumed and schools reopened starting
September 2021. However, when schools reopen for in-person learning, children
under the age of 12 are unvaccinated and are at higher risks of contracting the
virus. We propose an age-stratified model based on the age and vaccine
eligibility of the individuals. We fit our model to the data in Ontario, Canada
and obtain a good fitting result. The results show that a relaxed between-group
contact rate may trigger future epidemic waves more easily than an increased
within-group contact rate. An increasing mixed contact rate of the older group
quickly amplifies the daily incidence numbers for both groups whereas an
increasing mixed contact rate of the younger group mainly leads to future waves
in the younger group alone. The results indicate the importance of accelerating
vaccine rollout for younger individuals in mitigating disease spread.

near-optimal expert data can be difficult to obtain, and even in the limit of
infinite data cannot imply a total ordering over trajectories as preferences
can. On the other hand, learning from preferences alone is challenging as a
large number of preferences are required to infer a high-dimensional reward
function, though preference data is typically much easier to collect than
expert demonstrations. The classical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
formulation learns from expert demonstrations but provides no mechanism to
incorporate learning from offline preferences and vice versa. We instantiate

benchmark datasets. These often contain biases, artifacts, or errors that have
remained unnoticed in the data collection process and therefore fail in
representing the real world truthfully. This can cause models trained on these
datasets to learn undesired behavior based upon spurious correlations, e.g.,
the existence of a copyright tag in an image. Concept Activation Vectors (CAV)
have been proposed as a tool to model known concepts in latent space and have
been used for concept sensitivity testing and model correction. Specifically,
class artifact compensation (ClArC) corrects models using CAVs to represent
data artifacts in feature space linearly. Modeling CAVs with filters of linear
models, however, causes a significant influence of the noise portion within the
data, as recent work proposes the unsuitability of linear model filters to find
the signal direction in the input, which can be avoided by instead using
patterns. In this paper we propose Pattern Concept Activation Vectors (PCAV)
for noise-robust concept representations in latent space. We demonstrate that
pattern-based artifact modeling has beneficial effects on the application of

enables important downstream applications, such as personalization and
authentication. Learning speaker representations, in the context of supervised
learning, heavily depends on both clean and sufficient labeled data, which is
always difficult to acquire. Noisy unlabeled data, on the other hand, also
provides valuable information that can be exploited using self-supervised
training methods. In this work, we investigate how to pretrain speaker
recognition models by leveraging dialogues between customers and smart-speaker
devices. However, the supervisory information in such dialogues is inherently
noisy, as multiple speakers may speak to a device in the course of the same
dialogue. To address this issue, we propose an effective rejection mechanism
that selectively learns from dialogues based on their acoustic homogeneity.
Both reconstruction-based and contrastive-learning-based self-supervised
methods are compared. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides
significant performance improvements, superior to earlier work. Dialogue
pretraining when combined with the rejection mechanism yields 27.10% equal
error rate (EER) reduction in speaker recognition, compared to a model without
self-supervised pretraining.

opportunities for passive acoustic wavefront manipulation, which is of
particular interest in flat acoustic lenses and ultrasound imaging at

never been scaled to MHz frequencies that are common in ultrasound imaging. One
of the greatest challenges is the production of complex structures of
microscopic size. Owing to two-photon polymerization, a novel fabrication
technique from the view of acoustic metamaterials, it is now possible to
precisely manufacture sub-wavelength structures in this frequency range.
However, shrinking in size poses another challenge; the increasing
thermoviscous effects lead to considerable losses, which must be taken into
account in the design. In this work we propose three microacoustic metagrating
designs refracting a normally incident wave towards -35$^{\circ}$ at 2 MHz. In
order to develop metaatoms insensitive to thermoviscous effects we use shape
optimization techniques incorporating the linearized Navier-Stokes equations
discretized with finite element method. We report for the first time

micromachined ultrasonic transducer as source and an optical microphone as a

A naive implementation of numerical computation can lead to errors that may
result in incorrect or inaccurate learning and results. A numerical algorithm
or a mathematical formula can have several implementations that are
mathematically equivalent, but have different numerical stability properties.
Designing numerically stable algorithm implementations is challenging, because
it requires an interdisciplinary knowledge of software engineering, DL, and

Tensorflow with the goal of identifying unstable numerical methods and their
solutions. Specifically, we investigate which DL algorithms are numerically
unstable and conduct an in-depth analysis of the root cause, manifestation, and
patches to numerical instabilities. Based on these findings, we launch, the
first database of numerical stability issues and solutions in DL. Our findings

Branch (SAGB) phase, and the existence of high magnetic fields. Traditionally,
ultra-massive white dwarfs are expected to harbour oxygen-neon (ONe) cores.
However, new observations and recent theoretical studies suggest that the
progenitors of some ultra-massive white dwarfs can avoid carbon burning,
leading to the formation of ultra-massive white dwarfs harbouring carbon-oxygen
(CO) cores. Here we present a set of ultra-massive white dwarf evolutionary
sequences with CO cores for a wide range of metallicity and masses. We take
into account the energy released by latent heat and phase separation during the
crystallization process and by $^{22}$Ne sedimentation. Realistic chemical
profiles resulting from the full computation of progenitor evolution are
considered. We compare our CO ultra-massive white dwarf models with ONe models.
We conclude that CO ultra-massive white dwarfs evolve significantly slower than
their ONe counterparts mainly for three reasons: their larger thermal content,
the effect of crystallization, and the effect of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation. We
also provide colors in several photometric bands on the basis of new model
atmospheres. These CO ultra-massive white dwarf models, together with the ONe
ultra-massive white dwarf models, provide an appropriate theoretical framework

salient object detection community. However, few efforts are devoted to
learning salient object detection from sparse annotations, especially in the
remote sensing field. In addition, the sparse annotation usually contains
scanty information, which makes it challenging to train a well-performing
model, resulting in its performance largely lagging behind the fully-supervised
models. Although some SOD methods adopt some prior cues to improve the
detection performance, they usually lack targeted discrimination of object
boundaries and thus provide saliency maps with poor boundary localization. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised salient object
detection framework to predict the saliency of remote sensing images from
sparse scribble annotations. To implement it, we first construct the
scribble-based remote sensing saliency dataset by relabelling an existing
large-scale SOD dataset with scribbles, namely S-EOR dataset. After that, we
present a novel scribble-based boundary-aware network (SBA-Net) for remote
sensing salient object detection. Specifically, we design a boundary-aware
module (BAM) to explore the object boundary semantics, which is explicitly
supervised by the high-confidence object boundary (pseudo) labels generated by
the boundary label generation (BLG) module, forcing the model to learn features
that highlight the object structure and thus boosting the boundary localization
of objects. Then, the boundary semantics are integrated with high-level
features to guide the salient object detection under the supervision of
scribble labels.

aligned with the substellar point, leading to the conclusion that there is an
inefficient heat distribution from the dayside to the nightside. Our estimated

performance of the widespread all-cotton mask, and examines the effect of
layering, machine washing and drying on their filtration and breathability for
submicron and supermicron particles. Individual materials were evaluated for
their quality factor, Q, which combines filtration efficiency and
breathability. Filtration was tested against particles 0.5 to 5 micron
aerodynamic diameter. Nonwoven polyester and nonwoven polypropylene (craft
fabrics, medical masks, and medical wraps) showed higher quality factors than
woven materials (flannel cotton, Kona cotton, sateen cotton). Materials with
meltblown nonwoven polypropylene filtered best, especially against submicron
particles. Subsequently, we combined high performing fabrics into multi-layer
sets, evaluating the sets quality factors before and after our washing
protocol, which included machine washing, machine drying, and isopropanol soak.
Sets incorporating meltblown nonwoven polypropylene designed for filtration
(Filti and surgical mask) degraded significantly post-wash in the submicron
range where they excelled prior to washing (Q = 57 and 79 at 1 micron,
respectively, degraded to Q = 10 and 15 post-wash). Washing caused lesser
quality degradation in sets incorporating spunbond non-woven polypropylene or
medical wraps (Q = 12 to 24 pre-wash, Q = 8 to 10 post-wash). Post-wash quality
factors are similar for all multi-layer sets in this study, and higher than
Kona quilting cotton (Q = 6). Washed multi-layer sets filtered 12-42 percent of
0.5 micron, 27-76 percent of 1 micron, 58-96 percent of 2.8 micron, and 72-100
percent of 4.2 micron particles. The measured filtration and pressure drop of
both the homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-layer fabric combinations agreed
with the estimations from the layering model.

history and production of light elements during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
Specifically, dark matter that annihilates into Standard Model particles can
modify the effective number of light species in the universe $N_\mathrm{eff}$,
as well as the abundance of light elements created buring BBN. These quantities
in turn affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We present the
first joint analysis of small-scale temperature and polarization CMB anisotropy
from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT), together
with Planck data and the recent primordial abundance measurements of helium and
deuterium to place comprehensive bounds on the mass of light thermal-relic dark
matter. We consider a range of models, including dark matter that couples to
photons and Standard-Model neutrinos. We find that the combination of ACT, SPT,
and Planck generally leads to the most stringent mass constraint for dark
matter that couples to neutrinos, improving the lower limit by 40%-80%, with
respect to previous Planck analyses. On the other hand, the addition of ACT and
SPT leads to a slightly weaker bound on electromagnetically coupled particles,
due to a shift in the preferred values of $Y_\mathrm{p}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff}$
driven by the ground based experiments. Combining all CMB measurements with
primordial abundance measurements, we rule out masses below $\sim$4 MeV at 95%
confidence, for all models. We show that allowing for new relativistic species
can weaken the mass bounds for dark matter that couples to photons by up to an
order of magnitude or more. Finally, we discuss the reach of the next
generation of the CMB experiments in terms of probing the mass of the thermal
relic dark matter.

areas include business process analysis, healthcare workflow analysis and
policy process analysis. This method is quite general and applicable to any
situation in which declarative-type constraints of a modal and/or temporal
nature play a part.
  A declarative process is a process in which activities may freely happen
while respecting a set of constraints. For such a process, anything may happen
so long as it is not explicitly forbidden. Declarative processes have been used
and studied as models of business and healthcare workflows by several authors.
In considering a declarative process as a model of some system it is natural to
consider how the process behaves with respect to stakeholders. We derive a
measure for stakeholder utility that can be applied in a very general setting.
This derivation is achieved by listing a collection a properties which we argue
such a stakeholder utility function ought to satisfy, and then using these to
show a very specific form must hold for such a utility. The utility measure
depends on the set of unique traces of the declarative process, and calculating
this set requires a combinatorial analysis of the declarative graph that
represents the process.
  This builds on previous work of the author wherein the combinatorial
diversity metrics for declarative processes were derived for use in policy
process analysis. The collection of stakeholder utilities can themselves then
be used to form a metric with which we can compare different declarative
processes to one another. These are illustrated using several examples of
declarative processes that already exist in the literature.

of material in the Solar System. Deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratios in water
are available for several comets. However, no long-term studies of the D/H
ratio in water of a comet during its passage around the Sun have been reported.
Linear alkanes are important organic molecules, which have been found on
several Solar System bodies, including comets. To date, only upper limits of
isotopic ratios for D/H and 13C/12C in linear alkanes are available.
  The aim of this work is a detailed analysis of the D/H ratio in water during
the whole Rosetta mission. In addition, a first determination of the D/H and
13C/12C ratios in the first four linear alkanes in the coma of
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is provided. We analysed in situ measurements from
the Rosetta/ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS).
  The D/H ratio from HDO/H2O and the 16O/17O ratio from H216O/H217O did not
change during 67P's passage around the Sun between 2014 and 2016. All D/H ratio
measurements were compatible, within 1$\sigma$, with the mean value of
$5.01\times10^{-4}$ and its relative variation of 2.0%. This suggests that the
D/H ratio in 67P's coma is independent of heliocentric distance, level of
cometary activity, as well as spacecraft location with respect to the nucleus.
Additionally, the 16O/17O ratio could be determined with a higher accuracy than
previously possible, yielding a value of 2347 with a relative variation of
2.3%. For the alkanes, the D/H ratio is between 4.1 and 4.8 times higher than
in H2O, while the 13C/12C ratio is compatible, within uncertainties, with data
for other Solar System objects. The relatively high D/H ratio in alkanes is in
line with other cometary organic molecules and suggests that these organics may
be inherited from the presolar molecular cloud from which the Solar System
formed.

Collider (LHC) in the decay of top quarks ($t\to H^\pm b$). In a recent search
by the ATLAS collaboration (with all Run II data, 139 fb$^{-1}$) a local excess
of around $3\sigma$ has been observed, which is best fitted by a charged Higgs
boson with a mass ($m_{H^\pm}$) of around 130 GeV and a product of branching
ratios (BRs) given by BR$(t\to H^\pm b)\times{\rm BR}(H^\pm\to cb)=0.16\%\pm
0.06\%$. In the context of Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM) with independent
Yukawa couplings for $H^\pm$ we present the parameter space for which this
excess (assuming it to be genuine) can be accommodated, taking into account the
limits from LHC searches for $H^\pm\to cs$ and $H^\pm\to \tau\nu$ at
$m_{H^\pm}$=130 GeV and the constraint from $b\to s\gamma$. It is then shown
that such an excess cannot be explained in 2HDMs with natural flavour
conservation, but can be accommodated in the flipped Three-Higgs-Doublet Model
(3HDM) and in the aligned 2HDM (A2HDM). Upcoming searches with 139 fb$^{-1}$ in
the channels $H^\pm\to cb$ (CMS), $H^\pm \to cs$ (ATLAS/CMS) and $H^\pm \to

having a resource-free target subsystem compatible with a given collection of
marginal density matrices. By identifying an appropriate choice of resource R
and target subsystem T, our problems reduce, respectively, to the well-known
marginal problems for quantum states and the problem of determining if a given
quantum system is a resource. More generally, we say that a set of marginal
states is resource-free incompatible with a target subsystem T if all global
states compatible with this set must result in a resourceful state in T. We
show that this incompatibility induces a resource theory that can be quantified
by a monotone, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for this monotone
to be computable as a conic program with finite optimum. We further show, via
the corresponding witnesses, that resource-free incompatibility is equivalent
to an operational advantage in some subchannel discrimination task. Through our
framework, a clear connection can be established between any marginal problem
(that involves some notion of incompatibility) for quantum states and a
resource theory for quantum states. In addition, the universality of our
framework leads, for example, to further quantitative understanding of the
incompatibility associated with the recently-proposed entanglement marginal
problems as well as entanglement transitivity problems. As a byproduct of our
investigation, we obtain the first example showing a form of transitivity of
nonlocality as well as steerability for quantum states, thereby answering a
decade-old question to the positive.

applications in many domains (medical, geoscience, network analysis, finance,
econometry etc.). In the case of multivariate time series, the key to good
performances is to properly capture the dependencies between the variates.
Often, these variates are structured, i.e. they are localised in an abstract
space, usually representing an aspect of the physical world, and prediction
amounts to a form of diffusion of the information across that space over time.
Several neural network models of diffusion have been proposed in the
literature. However, most of the existing proposals rely on some a priori
knowledge on the structure of the space, usually in the form of a graph
weighing the pairwise diffusion capacity of its points. We argue that this
piece of information can often be dispensed with, since data already contains
the diffusion capacity information, and in a more reliable form than that
obtained from the usually largely hand-crafted graphs. We propose instead a
fully data-driven model which does not rely on such a graph, nor any other
prior structural information. We conduct a first set of experiments to measure
the impact on performance of a structural prior, as used in baseline models,
and show that, except at very low data levels, it remains negligible, and
beyond a threshold, it may even become detrimental. We then investigate,
through a second set of experiments, the capacity of our model in two respects:
treatment of missing data and domain adaptation.

$\lambda$-terms (i.e., without closed sub-terms), leads to bridgeless planar
maps. Inspired by this restriction, Zeilberger and Reed (2019) conjectured that
3-connected planar linear normal $\lambda$-terms have the same counting formula
as bipartite planar maps. In this article, we settle this conjecture by giving
a direct bijection between these two families. Furthermore, using a similar
approach, we give a direct bijection between planar linear normal
$\lambda$-terms and planar maps, whose restriction to 2-connected
$\lambda$-terms leads to loopless planar maps. This bijection seems different

the proposed network is able to learn head poses efficiently while using less

\textit{LwPosr} is the lightest network proposed for estimating head poses
compared to both keypoints-based and keypoints-free approaches; (2) it sets a

a self-similar Gaussian process (SGP) $x(\tau)$ with Hurst exponent $H>0$
(e.g., standard or fractional Brownian motion, or the random acceleration
process) that stochastically resets to the origin at rate $r$. Typical
fluctuations of $A(t)$ scale as $\sim \sqrt{t}$ for large $t$ and on this scale
the distribution is Gaussian, as one would expect from the central limit
theorem. Here our main focus is on atypically large fluctuations of $A(t)$. In
the long-time limit $t\to\infty$, we find that the full distribution of the
area takes the form
$P_{r}\left(A|t\right)\sim\exp\left[-t^{\alpha}\Phi\left(A/t^{\beta}\right)\right]$
with anomalous exponents $\alpha=1/(2H+2)$ and $\beta = (2H+3)/(4H+4)$ in the
regime of moderately large fluctuations, and a different anomalous scaling form
$P_{r}\left(A|t\right)\sim\exp\left[-t\Psi\left(A/t^{\left(2H+3\right)/2}\right)\right]$
in the regime of very large fluctuations. The associated rate functions
$\Phi(y)$ and $\Psi(w)$ depend on $H$ and are found exactly. Remarkably,
$\Phi(y)$ has a singularity that we interpret as a first-order dynamical
condensation transition, while $\Psi(w)$ exhibits a second-order dynamical
phase transition above which the number of resetting events ceases to be
extensive. The parabolic behavior of $\Phi(y)$ around the origin $y=0$
correctly describes the typical, Gaussian fluctuations of $A(t)$. Despite these
anomalous scalings, we find that all of the cumulants of the distribution
$P_{r}\left(A|t\right)$ grow linearly in time, $\langle A^n\rangle_c\approx c_n
\, t$, in the long-time limit. For the case of reset Brownian motion
(corresponding to $H=1/2$), we develop a recursive scheme to calculate the
coefficients $c_n$ exactly and use it to calculate the first 6 nonvanishing
cumulants.

previous spacecraft provided the alpha-proton's differential velocities down to
0.3 au. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) now enables insights into differential flows
of newly accelerated solar wind closer to the Sun for the first time. Here, we
study the difference between proton and alpha bulk velocities near PSP
perihelia of Encounters 3-7 when the core solar wind is in the field of view of
the Solar Probe Analyzer for Ions (SPAN-I) instrument. As previously reported
at larger heliospheric distances, the alpha-proton differential speed observed
by PSP is greater for fast wind than the slow solar wind. We compare PSP
observations with various spacecraft measurements and present the radial and
temporal evolution of the alpha-proton differential speed. The differential
flow decreases as the solar wind propagates from the Sun, consistent with
previous observations. While Helios showed a small radial dependence of
differential flow for the slow solar wind, PSP clearly showed this dependency
for the young slow solar wind down to 0.09 au. Our analysis shows that the
alpha-proton differential speed's magnitude is mainly below the local Alfv\'en
speed. Moreover, alpha particles usually move faster than protons close to the
Sun. PSP crossed the Alfv\'en surface during its eighth Encounter and may cross
it in future Encounters, enabling us to investigate the differential flow very
close to the solar wind acceleration source region for the first time.

the two phase Navier-Stokes equations. We consider ratio of the wave speed $c$
to wind friction velocity $u_*$ from $c/u_*=$ 2 to 8, i.e. in the slow to
intermediate wave regime; and initial wave steepness $ak$ from 0.1 to 0.3; the
two being varied independently. The turbulent wind and the travelling, nearly
monochromatic waves are fully coupled without any subgrid scale models. The
novel fully-coupled approach captures the simultaneous evolution of the wave
amplitude and shape, together with the underwater boundary layer (drift
current), up to wave breaking. The wave energy growth computed from the
time-dependent rms surface elevation is in quantitative agreement with that
computed from the extracted surface pressure distribution, which confirms the
leading role of the pressure forcing for finite amplitude gravity waves. The
phase shift and the amplitude of the principal mode of surface pressure
distribution are systematically reported, to provide direct evidence for
possible wind wave growth theories. For the momentum and energy fluxes, we find
that the wave form drag force is not a strong function of wave age but closely
related to wave steepness. The time evolution of the rms steepness and the wave
form drag suggests that there is an effect of the history of wind wave
coupling. The normalised wave growth rate we obtain agrees with previous
experimental and numerical studies. We make an effort to clarify various
commonly-adopted underlying assumptions, and to reconcile the scattering of the
data between different previous theoretical, numerical, and experimental

In this article, we introduce a deep-learning-inspired approach to construct
descriptive nonstationary spatio-temporal models by modeling stationary

constructed using several simple injective warping units which, when combined
through composition, can induce complex warpings. A stationary spatio-temporal
covariance function on the warped domain induces covariance nonstationarity on
the original domain. Sparse linear algebraic methods are used to reduce the
computational complexity when fitting the model in a big data setting. We show
that our proposed nonstationary spatio-temporal model can capture covariance
nonstationarity in both space and time, and provide better probabilistic
predictions than conventional stationary models in both simulation studies and
on a real-world data set.

  with Pairwise Alignment","Accepted by CVPR-2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Atlas building and image registration are important tasks for medical image
analysis. Once one or multiple atlases from an image population have been
constructed, commonly (1) images are warped into an atlas space to study
intra-subject or inter-subject variations or (2) a possibly probabilistic atlas
is warped into image space to assign anatomical labels. Atlas estimation and
nonparametric transformations are computationally expensive as they usually
require numerical optimization. Additionally, previous approaches for atlas
building often define similarity measures between a fuzzy atlas and each
individual image, which may cause alignment difficulties because a fuzzy atlas
does not exhibit clear anatomical structures in contrast to the individual
images. This work explores using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
jointly predict the atlas and a stationary velocity field (SVF)
parameterization for diffeomorphic image registration with respect to the
atlas. Our approach does not require affine pre-registrations and utilizes
pairwise image alignment losses to increase registration accuracy. We evaluate
our model on 3D knee magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the OAI-ZIB dataset.
Our results show that the proposed framework achieves better performance than
other state-of-the-art image registration algorithms, allows for end-to-end
training, and for fast inference at test time.

used for maxillofacial modeling. However, the presence of metallic inserts,
such as implants, crowns, and dental filling, causes severe streaking and
shading artifacts in a CBCT image and loss of the morphological structures of
the teeth, which consequently prevents accurate segmentation of bones. A
two-stage metal artifact reduction method is proposed for accurate 3D low-dose
maxillofacial CBCT modeling, where a key idea is to utilize explicit tooth
shape prior information from intra-oral scan data whose acquisition does not
require any extra radiation exposure. In the first stage, an image-to-image
deep learning network is employed to mitigate metal-related artifacts. To
improve the learning ability, the proposed network is designed to take
advantage of the intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and perform multi-task
learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D
maxillofacial model is constructed by segmenting the bones from the dental CBCT
image corrected in the first stage. For accurate bone segmentation, weighted
thresholding is applied, wherein the weighting region is determined depending
on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Because acquiring a paired
training dataset of metal-artifact-free and metal artifact-affected dental CBCT
images is challenging in clinical practice, an automatic method of generating a
realistic dataset according to the CBCT physics model is introduced. Numerical
simulations and clinical experiments show the feasibility of the proposed
method, which takes advantage of tooth surface information from intra-oral scan
data in 3D low dose maxillofacial CBCT modeling.

by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. While neutron stars are
known to have large velocities associated with impulsive kicks imparted to them
at birth in supernovae, whether black holes receive similar kicks, and of what
magnitude, remains an open question. Recently, Callister et al. (2021) analysed
the binary black hole population under the hypothesis that they were all formed
through isolated binary evolution and claimed that large black hole kicks
(greater than 260 km/s at 99% confidence) were required for the spin
distribution of merging binary black holes to match observations. Here we
highlight that a key assumption made by Callister et al. (2021) -- that all
secondary black holes can be tidally spun up -- is not motivated by physical
models, and may lead to a bias in their estimate of the magnitudes of black
hole kicks. We make only minor changes to the Callister et al. (2021) model,
accounting for a population of wider merging binaries where tidal
synchronisation is ineffective. We show that this naturally produces a bimodal
spin distribution for secondary black holes, and that the spin-orbit
misalignments observed in the binary black hole population can be explained by
more typical black hole kicks of order 100 km/s, consistent with kicks inferred
from Galactic X-ray binaries containing black holes. We conclude that the
majority of the binary black hole population is consistent with forming through
isolated binary evolution.

increasingly important to assess the resilience of models. One such high impact
domain is that of face recognition, with real world applications involving
images affected by various degradations, such as motion blur or high exposure.
Moreover, images captured across different attributes, such as gender and race,
can also challenge the robustness of a face recognition algorithm. While
traditional summary statistics suggest that the aggregate performance of face
recognition models has continued to improve, these metrics do not directly
measure the robustness or fairness of the models. Visual Psychophysics
Sensitivity Analysis (VPSA) [1] provides a way to pinpoint the individual
causes of failure by way of introducing incremental perturbations in the data.
However, perturbations may affect subgroups differently. In this paper, we
propose a new fairness evaluation based on robustness in the form of a generic
framework that extends VPSA. With this framework, we can analyze the ability of
a model to perform fairly for different subgroups of a population affected by
perturbations, and pinpoint the exact failure modes for a subgroup by measuring
targeted robustness. With the increasing focus on the fairness of models, we
use face recognition as an example application of our framework and propose to
compactly visualize the fairness analysis of a model via AUC matrices. We
analyze the performance of common face recognition models and empirically show
that certain subgroups are at a disadvantage when images are perturbed, thereby
uncovering trends that were not visible using the model's performance on

contrastive information between acoustic inputs, CALM is able to bootstrap
audio embedding competitive with existing audio representation models in only a

using linearized patches through a Spectral Transformer (SpecTran) which is
trained using a Contrastive Audio-Language Pretraining objective to align audio

the exact reconstruction of continuous signals from discrete sets of sample

question of whether spacetime is continuous or discrete at the Planck scale,
since in sampling theory we have functions which can be viewed as equivalently
residing on a continuous or discrete space. Further, it is possible to
formulate analogues of sampling which yield discreteness without disturbing
underlying spacetime symmetries. In particular, there is a proposal for how
this can be adapted for Minkowski spacetime. Here we will provide a detailed
examination of the extension of sampling theory to this context. We will also
discuss generally how spacetime symmetries manifest themselves in sampling
theory, which at the surface seems in conflict with the fact that the
discreteness of the sampling is not manifestly covariant. Specifically, we will
show how the symmetry of a function space with a sampling property is

pandemic, an understanding of how rumors diffuse in online social networks is -
even for non-crisis situations - still in its infancy. Here we analyze a large
sample consisting of COVID-19 rumor cascades from Twitter that have been
fact-checked by third-party organizations. The data comprises N=10,610 rumor
cascades that have been retweeted more than 24 million times. We investigate
whether COVID-19 misinformation spreads more viral than the truth and whether
the differences in the diffusion of true vs. false rumors can be explained by
the moral emotions they carry. We observe that, on average, COVID-19
misinformation is more likely to go viral than truthful information. However,
the veracity effect is moderated by moral emotions: false rumors are more viral
than the truth if the source tweets embed a high number of other-condemning
emotion words, whereas a higher number of self-conscious emotion words is
linked to a less viral spread. The effects are pronounced both for health
misinformation and false political rumors. These findings offer insights into
how true vs. false rumors spread and highlight the importance of considering
emotions from the moral emotion families in social media content.

  Neural Network","The paper is 30 pages long and contains 10 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Suppressing the deliberate interference for wireless networks is critical to
guarantee a reliable communication link. However, nullifying the jamming
signals can be problematic when the correlations between transmitted jamming
signals are deliberately varied over time. Specifically, recent studies reveal
that by deliberately varying the correlations among jamming signals, attackers
can effectively vary the jamming channels and thus their nullspace, even when
the physical channels remain unchanged. That makes the beam-forming matrix
derived from the nullspace of the jamming channels unable to suppress the
jamming signals. Most existing solutions only consider unchanged correlations
or heuristically adapt to the time-varying correlation problem by continuously
monitoring the residual jamming signals before updating the beam-forming
matrix. In this paper, we systematically formulate the optimization problem of
the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Even ignoring the
unknown strategy of the jammers and the challenging nullspace estimation
process, the resulting problem is an integer programming problem, hence
intractable to obtain its optimal solution. To tackle it and address the
unknown strategy of the jammer, we reformulate the problem using a partially
observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) and then design a deep dueling
Q-learning based framework to tune the duration of the nullspace estimation and
data transmission phases. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
techniques effectively deal with jamming signals whose correlations vary over
time, and the range of correlations is unknown. Especially, our techniques do
not require continuous monitoring of the residual jamming signals (after the
nullification process) before updating the beam-forming matrix. As such, the
system is more spectral-efficient and has a lower outage probability.

induces an ordering transition that significantly decreases the measured

and planar order, and we determine that particles are packed into hexagonal
crystal layers (with numerous defects) that slide past each other. By computing
local $\psi_6$ and $\psi_4$ order parameters, we determine that the defects
correspond to chains of particles in a square-like lattice. We compute the
individual particle contributions to the stress tensor and discover that the
largest contributors to the shear stress are primarily located in these lower

compressed chains of particles to resist the shear, but these chains are
transient and short-lived. The inclusion of a contact friction force allows the
stress-bearing structures to grow into a system-spanning network, thereby

in addition to the pure d-wave component of the superconducting gap, the pure
s-wave component of the superconducting gap is generated by the electronic
nematicity, therefore there is a coexistence and competition of the d-wave
component and the s-wave component. This coexistence and competition leads to
that the maximal condensation energy appears at around the optimal strength of
the electronic nematicity, and then decreases in both the weak and strong

  Systems","Accepted at IEEE WCNC 2022",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In pursuance of the unused spectrum in higher frequencies, millimeter wave
(mmWave) bands have a pivotal role. However, the high path-loss and poor
scattering associated with mmWave communications highlight the necessity of
employing effective beamforming techniques. In order to efficiently search for
the beam to serve a user and to jointly serve multiple users it is often
required to use a composite beam which consists of multiple disjoint lobes. A
composite beam covers multiple desired angular coverage intervals (ACIs) and
ideally has maximum and uniform gain (smoothness) within each desired ACI,
negligible gain (leakage) outside the desired ACIs, and sharp edges. We propose
an algorithm for designing such ideal composite codebook by providing an
analytical closed-form solution with low computational complexity. There is a
fundamental trade-off between the gain, leakage and smoothness of the beams.
Our design allows to achieve different values in such trade-off based on
changing the design parameters. We highlight the shortcomings of the uniform
linear arrays (ULAs) in building arbitrary composite beams. Consequently, we
use a recently introduced twin-ULA (TULA) antenna structure to effectively
resolve these inefficiencies. Numerical results are used to validate the
theoretical findings.

in which data are collected, a model is trained, and then outputs of that model
are used to choose what data to consider next. For example, one data-driven
approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model to predict the
fitness of protein sequences, then use it to propose new sequences believed to
exhibit greater fitness than observed in the training data. Since validating
designed sequences in the wet lab is typically costly, it is important to
quantify the uncertainty in the model's predictions. This is challenging
because of a characteristic type of distribution shift between the training and
test data in the design setting -- one in which the training and test data are
statistically dependent, as the latter is chosen based on the former.
Consequently, the model's error on the test data -- that is, the designed
sequences -- has an unknown and possibly complex relationship with its error on
the training data. We introduce a method to quantify predictive uncertainty in
such settings. We do so by constructing confidence sets for predictions that
account for the dependence between the training and test data. The confidence
sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for any prediction
algorithm, even when a trained model chooses the test-time input distribution.
As a motivating use case, we demonstrate with several real data sets how our
method quantifies uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins,
and can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve acceptable
trade-offs between high predicted fitness and low predictive uncertainty.

two-layer localized package shipment on a TCN (LPS-TCN) model that exploits

strongly hinder the practicality. On the other hand, while being vastly used as
heuristics for computing UOT in modern deep learning applications and having
shown success in sparse OT problem, gradient methods applied to UOT have not

Gradient Extrapolation Method (GEM-UOT) to find an $\varepsilon$-approximate
solution to the UOT problem in $O\big( \kappa n^2 \log\big(\frac{\tau

error between UOT and OT. To this end, we further present a novel approach of
OT retrieval from UOT, which is based on GEM-UOT with fine tuned $\tau$ and a

secure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure direct
communication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum
communication that directly transmits information over quantum channel. The
final component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant
algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a
quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it
is read out and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the
information is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure
even in the face of a quantum computer. Hence, our solution offers secure
end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both
eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum internet. It is
compatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of
the popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the
transition from the classical Internet to the Quantum Internet (Qinternet) by
following a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative network
in quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first
experimental demonstration of a secure classical repeater based hybrid quantum

indeed be constructed using existing technology and continue to support a
seamless evolutionary pathway to the future Qinternet of quantum computers.

by the example of a physical system with an unexpected change in its dynamics,
we take the drift parameter to be unknown, so that it must be learned while

observation model with Gaussian noise. In contrast to most previous work, which
focuses on a controller's asymptotic performance over an infinite time horizon,
we minimize a quadratic cost function over a finite time horizon. The
performance of our control strategy is quantified by comparing its cost with
the cost incurred by an optimal controller that has full knowledge of the
parameters. This approach gives rise to several notions of ""regret."" We derive
a set of control strategies that provably minimize the worst-case regret; these
arise from Bayesian strategies that assume a specific fixed prior on the drift
parameter. This work suggests that examining Bayesian strategies may lead to
optimal or near-optimal control strategies for a much larger class of realistic

scalable learning on multiplex networks with a large number of layers. The
efficiency of our method is enabled by an online learning algorithm that learns
how to sample relevant neighboring layers so that only the layers with relevant
information are aggregated during training. This sampling differs from prior
work, such as MNE, which aggregates information across \emph{all} layers and
consequently leads to computational intractability on large networks. Our

states in the US with each state as a domain and each edge indicating
adjacency, thereby allowing domains to align flexibly based on the graph
structure. We generalize the existing adversarial learning framework with a
novel graph discriminator using encoding-conditioned graph embeddings.
Theoretical analysis shows that at equilibrium, our method recovers classic
domain adaptation when the graph is a clique, and achieves non-trivial
alignment for other types of graphs. Empirical results show that our approach
successfully generalizes uniform alignment, naturally incorporates domain
information represented by graphs, and improves upon existing domain adaptation
methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Code will soon be available

prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and
fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this
issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating
hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive
manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research
progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is
organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation
methods, and future directions; and (2) an overview of task-specific research
progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely
abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering,

recent studies indicate that the accuracy improvement by developing new model
structures is becoming marginal. Instead, we envision that the improvement can
be achieved by transferring the ""forecasting-related knowledge"" across cities
with different data distributions and network topologies. To this end, this
paper aims to propose a novel transferable traffic forecasting framework:
Domain Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Network (DASTNet). DASTNet is pre-trained
on multiple source networks and fine-tuned with the target network's traffic
data. Specifically, we leverage the graph representation learning and
adversarial domain adaptation techniques to learn the domain-invariant node
embeddings, which are further incorporated to model the temporal traffic data.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ adversarial
multi-domain adaptation for network-wide traffic forecasting problems. DASTNet
consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baseline methods on three
benchmark datasets. The trained DASTNet is applied to Hong Kong's new traffic
detectors, and accurate traffic predictions can be delivered immediately
(within one day) when the detector is available. Overall, this study suggests
an alternative to enhance the traffic forecasting methods and provides
practical implications for cities lacking historical traffic data.

present a generalized GAN framework for tabular synthesis, which combines the
adversarial training of GANs and the negative log-density regularization of

distinctive objectives. First, we can further improve the synthesis quality, by
decreasing the negative log-density of real records in the process of
adversarial training. On the other hand, by increasing the negative log-density
of real records, realistic fake records can be synthesized in a way that they
are not too much close to real records and reduce the chance of potential
information leakage. We conduct experiments with real-world datasets for
classification, regression, and privacy attacks. In general, the proposed
method demonstrates the best synthesis quality (in terms of task-oriented
evaluation metrics, e.g., F1) when decreasing the negative log-density during
the adversarial training. If increasing the negative log-density, our
experimental results show that the distance between real and fake records
increases, enhancing robustness against privacy attacks.

strategic games with incomplete information and qualitative objectives. In
Boolean observation games, each player is associated with a finite set of
propositional variables of which only it can observe the value, and it controls
whether and to whom it can reveal that value. It does not control the given,
fixed, value of variables. Boolean observation games are a generalization of
Boolean games, a well-studied subclass of strategic games but with complete
information, and wherein each player controls the value of its variables.
  In Boolean observation games player goals describe multi-agent knowledge of
variables. As in classical strategic games, players choose their strategies
simultaneously and therefore observation games capture aspects of both
imperfect and incomplete information. They require reasoning about sets of
outcomes given sets of indistinguishable valuations of variables. What a Nash
equilibrium is, depends on an outcome relation between such sets. We present
various outcome relations, including a qualitative variant of ex-post
equilibrium. We identify conditions under which, given an outcome relation,
Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. We also study the complexity of
checking for the existence of Nash equilibria and of verifying if a strategy
profile is a Nash equilibrium. We further study the subclass of Boolean

satisfaction does not depend on the value of variables. We show that each such

challenge as it requires simultaneous representation of long term temporal
dependencies and correlations across multiple variables. More often, this is
solved by breaking the complexity through modeling one dependency at a time. In
this paper, we propose a Time-series Representational Learning through
Contrastive Predictive Coding (TRL-CPC) towards anomaly detection in MVTS data.
First, we jointly optimize an encoder, an auto-regressor and a non-linear
transformation function to effectively learn the representations of the MVTS
data sets, for predicting future trends. It must be noted that the context
vectors are representative of the observation window in the MTVS. Next, the
latent representations for the succeeding instants obtained through non-linear
transformations of these context vectors, are contrasted with the latent
representations of the encoder for the multi-variables such that the density
for the positive pair is maximized. Thus, the TRL-CPC helps to model the
temporal dependencies and the correlations of the parameters for a healthy
signal pattern. Finally, fitting the latent representations are fit into a
Gaussian scoring function to detect anomalies. Evaluation of the proposed
TRL-CPC on three MVTS data sets against SOTA anomaly detection methods shows
the superiority of TRL-CPC.

required for reactor components. Simulations were conducted to investigate the
influence of temperature as well as the influence of grain boundary sinks on
the resulting oxide characteristics of a 12YWT-like alloy during heat
treatments at 1023K - 1223K. There is good agreement of the oxide
characteristics from simulation with literature values and the influence of the
grain boundary on precipitation is slight. The same oxide configuration and
positions were input into a new simulation and placed under simulated neutron
irradiation to a total accumulated dose of 8 dpa at temperatures, 673K - 873K,

While the offset/aperture-angle axis is frequently used for focusing analysis,
the physical (i.e., midpoint) axes of seismic images tend to be ignored as
focusing analysis of geological structures is highly interpretative and
difficult to automate. We have developed an automatic data-driven approach
using convolutional neural networks to automate image-focusing analysis. Using
focused and unfocused geological faults, we show that our method can make use
of both spatial and offset/angle focusing information to robustly estimate
velocity errors within seismic images. We demonstrate that our method correctly
estimates velocity errors from a 2D Gulf of Mexico limited-aperture image where
a traditional semblance-based approach fails. We also show that our method has
the added benefit of improving the interpretation of faults within the image.

  Network",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a promising technology in
the 5G era. It is deemed an effective paradigm to support computation-intensive
and delay critical applications even at energy-constrained and
computation-limited Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To effectively exploit
the performance benefits enabled by MEC, it is imperative to jointly allocate
radio and computational resources by considering non-stationary computation
demands, user mobility, and wireless fading channels. This paper aims to study
the tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and service delay for multi-user
multi-server MEC-enabled IoT systems when provisioning offloading services in a
user mobility scenario. Particularly, we formulate a stochastic optimization
problem with the objective of minimizing the long-term average network EE with
the constraints of the task queue stability, peak transmit power, maximum
CPU-cycle frequency, and maximum user number. To tackle the problem, we propose
an online offloading and resource allocation algorithm by transforming the
original problem into several individual subproblems in each time slot based on
Lyapunov optimization theory, which are then solved by convex decomposition and
submodular methods. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed algorithm can
achieve a $[O(1/V), O(V)]$ tradeoff between EE and service delay. Simulation
results verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate our proposed algorithm
can offer much better EE-delay performance in task offloading challenges,
compared to several baselines.

transition is the jump in the specific heat. Despite this importance, standard
theory for this jump is lacking. The difficulties encompass from lack of proper
treatments of specific heat of liquids, hysteresis, to the timescale issue. The
first part of this paper provides a non-empirical method to calculate specific
heat of glass. The method consists of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based
on density-functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamics methods. The total-energy
approach based on DFT enables us to calculate specific heat, irrespective of
solids or liquids. A serious problem for glass-transition states is involvement
of complicated energy dissipation processes, which is resolved by adiabatic MD
simulations. The problems of hysteresis and the timescale issue are alleviated
by restricting the scope of calculations to equilibrium states only. The second
part of this paper describes an application of the theory to the specific-heat
jump (Delta Cp) of glycerol in order to show the validity of the methods.
Despite severe limitations due to the small size of supercells, a reasonable
value for the specific-heat jump is obtained. By decomposing Delta Cp into
contributions of the structural energy, phonon, and thermal expansion parts, we
have a sound interpretation for the Delta Cp: the major contribution to Delta
Cp comes from the change in the structural energy. From this, a neat energy
diagram about the glass transition is obtained. An outcome of this study is
verification of the empirical relationship between the fragility and
specific-heat jump. These two energies are scaled by the ratio k=Tg/ Delta T,
where Delta T is the width of the transition, through which the two quantities
are interrelated. This is useful for organizing various relationships that are
found empirically.

are bent due to not only the gravity of the black hole, but also the effects of
coronal plasma dependent on $n$. The choice of $n$ alters the null geodesics,
producing the effect which is analogous to the light deflection. For the corona
with $n > 1$, the disc on the far side within the corona covers a larger area
on the observer' sky, enhancing the blue wing of the line and producing more
flux difference between the blue peak and extended red tail. The inverse
effects are seen when $n < 1$. Moreover, the corona with $n > 1$ and $n < 1$
could induce extra shifts in the blue wing ($\Delta g_{max}$) to higher and
lower energy, respectively. These effects are more prominent when the
inclination angle is $\gtrsim 60^\circ$ and the corona extends to $\gtrsim
5r_g$. To obtain the deviation of the line shift of $\Delta g_{\rm max} \gtrsim
0.01$, the difference between the refractive index of the corona and that of

apply DQD algorithms to training agent policies, we must approximate gradients
for performance and behavior. We propose two variants of the current
state-of-the-art DQD algorithm that compute gradients via approximation methods
common in reinforcement learning (RL). We evaluate our approach on four
simulated locomotion tasks. One variant achieves results comparable to the
current state-of-the-art in combining QD and RL, while the other performs
comparably in two locomotion tasks. These results provide insight into the
limitations of current DQD algorithms in domains where gradients must be
approximated. Source code is available at https://github.com/icaros-usc/dqd-rl

estimation of multiple parameters is significant but difficult. Using quantum
control to optimize this $SU(2)$ coding unitary evolution is one of solutions.
We propose a method, characterized by the nested cross-products of the
coefficient vector $\mathbf{X}$ of $SU(2)$ generators and its partial
derivative $\partial_\ell \mathbf{X}$, to investigate the control-enhanced
quantum multiparameter estimation. Our work reveals that quantum control is not
always functional in improving the estimation precision, which depends on the
characterization of an $SU(2)$ dynamics with respect to the objective
parameter. This characterization is quantified by the angle $\alpha_\ell$
between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\partial_\ell \mathbf{X}$. For an $SU(2)$ dynamics
featured by $\alpha_\ell=\pi/2$, the promotion of the estimation precision can
get the most benefits from the controls. When $\alpha_\ell$ gradually closes to
$0$ or $\pi$, the precision promotion contributed to by quantum control
correspondingly becomes inconspicuous. Until a dynamics with $\alpha_\ell=0$ or
$\pi$, quantum control completely loses its advantage. In addition, we find a
set of conditions restricting the simultaneous optimal estimation of all the
parameters, but fortunately, which can be removed by using a maximally
entangled two-qubit state as the probe state and adding an ancillary channel
into the configuration. Lastly, a spin-$1/2$ system is taken as an example to
verify the above-mentioned conclusions. Our proposal sufficiently exhibits the
hallmark of control-enhancement in fulfilling the multiparameter estimation
mission, and it is applicable to an arbitrary $SU(2)$ parametrization process.

time-reversible (reciprocal) swimming strokes from moving. In the presence of

A number of recent works have investigated dimer models that swim reciprocally
at intermediate Reynolds numbers Re ~ 1-1000. These show interesting results
(e.g. switches of the swim direction as a function of inertia) but the results
vary and seem to be case-specific. Here, we introduce a general model and
investigate the behaviour of an asymmetric spherical dimer of oscillating
length for small-amplitude motion at intermediate Re. In our analysis we make
the important distinction between particle and fluid inertia, both of which
need to be considered separately. We asymptotically expand the Navier-Stokes
equations in the small amplitude limit to obtain a system of linear PDEs. Using
a combination of numerical (Finite Element) and analytical (reciprocal theorem,
method of reflections) methods we solve the system to obtain the dimer's swim
speed and show that there are two mechanisms that give rise to motion: boundary
conditions (an effective slip velocity) and Reynolds stresses. Each mechanism
is driven by two classes of sphere-sphere interactions, between one sphere's
motion and 1) the oscillating background flow induced by the other's motion,
and 2) a geometric asymmetry induced by the other's presence. We can thus unify
and explain behaviours observed in other works. Our results show how sensitive,
counter-intuitive and rich motility is in the parameter space of finite inertia
of particles and fluid.

configuration. Different droplet (diameter, concentration) and cloud (diameter)
properties are considered. Our results show that droplet size, concentration
and cloud radius have significant effects on peak pressure trajectory of the
detonation wave. After interacting with cloud, the detonation wave exhibits
three propagation modes, including perturbed propagation, leeward
re-detonation, and detonation extinction. Leeward re-detonation is analyzed
from unsteady evolutions of gas and liquid droplet quantities. The refracted
detonation wave inside the cloud is decoupled and propagates more slowly than
the one outside the cloud. The detonation re-initiation is from a local hot
spot, caused by shock focusing from upper and lower diffracted detonations.
Disintegration of water droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the
cloud and multiphase interfacial instability is observed due to the difference
in effective density of the two fluids. Furthermore, detonation extinction is
observed when we consider various water cloud size. It is featured by quickly
fading peak pressure trajectories when the detonation passes the cloud, and no
local autoignition occurs in the shock focusing area. Evolutions of
thermochemical structures from the shocked area in an extinction process are
also studied. Moreover, parametric studies considering various droplet
concentrations and cloud radii are performed.

method to automatically transform face photos to portrait drawings using
unpaired training data with two new features; i.e., our method can (1) learn to
generate high quality portrait drawings in multiple styles using a single
network and (2) generate portrait drawings in a ""new style"" unseen in the
training data. To achieve these benefits, we (1) propose a novel quality metric
for portrait drawings which is learned from human perception, and (2) introduce
a quality loss to guide the network toward generating better looking portrait
drawings. We observe that existing unpaired translation methods such as
CycleGAN tend to embed invisible reconstruction information indiscriminately in
the whole drawings due to significant information imbalance between the photo
and portrait drawing domains, which leads to important facial features missing.
To address this problem, we propose a novel asymmetric cycle mapping that
enforces the reconstruction information to be visible and only embedded in the
selected facial regions. Along with localized discriminators for important
facial regions, our method well preserves all important facial features in the
generated drawings. Generator dissection further explains that our model learns
to incorporate face semantic information during drawing generation. Extensive

design quality-of-service functions ($Q$), including signal strength (RSRP) but
also other metrics of interest to operators, i.e., coverage and call drop
probability. By implicitly altering the loss function employed in learning,
quality functions can also improve prediction for RSRP itself where it matters
(e.g., MSE reduction up to 27% in the low signal strength regime, where errors
are critical). Second, we introduce weight functions ($W$) to specify the
relative importance of prediction at different locations and other parts of the
feature space. We propose re-weighting based on importance sampling to obtain
unbiased estimators when the sampling and target distributions are different.
This yields improvements up to 20% for targets based on spatially uniform loss
or losses based on user population density. Third, we apply the Data Shapley
framework for the first time in this context: to assign values ($\phi$) to
individual measurement points, which capture the importance of their
contribution to the prediction task. This improves prediction (e.g., from 64%
to 94% in recall for coverage loss) by removing points with negative values,
and can also enable data minimization. We evaluate our methods and demonstrate
significant improvement in prediction performance, using several real-world

straightforward. Two large, heterogeneous samples of small networks of
within-household contacts in Belgium were collected using two different but
complementary sampling designs: one smaller but with all contacts in each

contacts of only one person per household. We wish to combine their strengths
to learn the social forces that shape household contact formation and
facilitate simulation for prediction of disease spread, while generalising to
the population of households in the region.
  To accomplish this, we describe a flexible framework for specifying
multi-network models in the exponential family class and identify the
requirements for inference and prediction under this framework to be
consistent, identifiable, and generalisable, even when data are incomplete;
explore how these requirements may be violated in practice; and develop a suite
of quantitative and graphical diagnostics for detecting violations and
suggesting improvements to candidate models. We report on the effects of
network size, geography, and household roles on household contact patterns

  Cuprates",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses the long standing and controversial issue of the origin
of superconductivity in cuprates. Their superconductivity can be attributed to
amphoteric defects associated with vacancy sites in copper oxide planes. A
local defect lattice relaxation results in a negative-$U$ energy binding two
holes on amphoteric defects in the donor configuration that act as preformed
boson pair. Thermodynamic equilibrium between defects in the donor and acceptor
configurations stabilizes Fermi energy at the amphoteric defect charge
transition state assuring resonant coupling between free holes and the
localized hole pairs. Model calculations show that the critical temperature is
primarily determined by the density of the amphoteric defects in the donor
configuration, explaining the ubiquity of dome-like dependence of the critical
temperature on the doping as well as its universal dependence on the superfluid
density. Intentional doping with chemical acceptors or donors is neither
necessary nor sufficient condition for superconductivity that is fully
determined by the amphoteric defects whose concentration can be controlled by
crystal nonstoichiometry. The only role of chemical doping is changing the
balance between concentrations of amphoteric defects in the donor and acceptor
configurations resulting in an increase of the superfluid density and thus also
the critical temperature for acceptor and a decrease for donor doping. This
accounts for the experimentally observed distinct asymmetry between the dome
structures for the chemical doping with acceptors and donors. The unusual
sensitivity of the critical temperature to external perturbations is explained
by the resonant nature of the coupling between free holes and preformed hole
pairs. The work has broader implications as it could be applicable to other
superconductors with dome-like dependence of the critical temperature on
doping.

interpolation regimes and consistency cannot be achieved simultaneously for
several non-adaptive RF.Since adaptivity seems to be the cornerstone to bring
together interpolation and consistency, we study interpolating Median RF which
are proved to be consistent in the interpolating regime. This is the first
result conciliating interpolation and consistency for RF, highlighting that the
averaging effect introduced by feature randomization is a key mechanism,
sufficient to ensure the consistency in the interpolation regime and
beyond.Numerical experiments show that Breiman's RF are consistent while
exactly interpolating, when no bootstrap step is involved.We theoretically
control the size of the interpolation area, which converges fast enough to
zero, giving a necessary condition for exact interpolation and consistency to
occur in conjunction.

insight is that visual servoing does not depend on identifying the veridical
kinematic and camera parameters, but instead only on an accurate generative
model of image feature observations from the joint positions of the robot. We
demonstrate that with our model architecture and learning algorithm, we can
consistently learn accurate models from less than 50 training samples (which
amounts to less than 1 min of unsupervised data collection), and that such
data-efficient learning is not possible with standard neural architectures.
Further, we show that by using the generative model in the loop and learning

that the percolation transition in the ionized hydrogen, as studied by tracing
the evolution of the Largest Cluster Statistics (LCS), is a robust statistic
that can distinguish the fundamentally different scenarios -- inside-out and
outside-in reionization. Particularly, the global neutral fraction at the onset
of percolation is significantly higher for the inside-out scenario as compared
to that for the outside-in reionization. In complementary to percolation
analysis, we explore the shape and morphology of the ionized regions as they
evolve in different reionization models in terms of the Shapefinders (SFs) that
are ratios of the Minkowski functionals (MFs). The shape distribution can
readily discern the reionization scenario with extreme non-uniform
recombination in the IGM, such as the clumping model. In the rest of the
reionization models, the largest ionized region abruptly grows only in terms of
its third SF - 'length' - during percolation while the first two SFs -
'thickness' and 'breadth' - remain stable. Thus the ionized hydrogen in these
scenarios becomes highly filamentary near percolation and exhibit a
'characteristic cross-section' that varies among the source models. Therefore,
the geometrical studies based on SFs, together with the percolation analysis
can shed light on the reionization sources.

occur which create a bottleneck owing to resource (spectrum and energy)

receiver, exact information which was sent by transmitter, will result in a
never ending need for higher bandwidth. A possible solution to such a challenge
lies in semantic communications which focuses on meaning (context) of received

require less bandwidth, and will reduce bottleneck due to various undesired
phenomenon. In this respect, current article presents a detailed survey on
recent technological trends in regard to semantic communications for
intelligent wireless networks. We focus on semantic communications architecture

temporal network. In contrast to the widely-used betweenness centrality, we
assume that information does not necessarily spread on shortest paths but on
temporal random walks that satisfy the time constraints of the network. We show
that temporal walk centrality can identify nodes playing central roles in
dissemination processes that might not be detected by related betweenness
concepts and other common static and temporal centrality measures. We propose
exact and approximation algorithms with different running times depending on
the properties of the temporal network and parameters of our new centrality
measure. A technical contribution is a general approach to lift existing
algebraic methods for counting walks in static networks to temporal networks.
Our experiments on real-world temporal networks show the efficiency and
accuracy of our algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that the rankings by
temporal walk centrality often differ significantly from those of other
state-of-the-art temporal centralities.

of the set of the symmetric states, we introduce the extension of the Klein
transformation for general Fermi tensor product of two $\bz^2$ graded
$C^*$-algebras, under the condition that the grading of one of the involved
algebras is inner. After extending the construction to $C^*$-inductive limits,
such a Klein transformation realises a canonical $*$-isomorphism between two
$\bz^2$-graded $C^*$-algebras made of the infinite Fermi $C^*$-tensor product
and the infinite $C^*$-tensor product of a single $\bz^2$-graded $C^*$-algebra,
both built with respect to the corresponding minimal $C^*$-cross norms. It
preserves the grading, and its transpose sends even product states of $\ga_{\rm
X}$ in (necessarily even) product states on $\ga_{\rm F}$, and therefore
induces an isomorphism of simplexes $$ \cs_\bp(\ga_{\rm
F})=\cs_{\bp\times\bz^2}(\ga_{\rm F})\sim\cs_{\bp\times\bz^2}(\ga_{\rm X})\,,
$$ which allows to reduce the study of the structure of the symmetric states
for $C^*$-Fermi systems to the corresponding even symmetric states on the usual
infinite $C^*$-tensor product. Other relevant properties of symmetric states on
the Fermi algebra will be proved without the use of the Klein transformation.
  We end with an example for which such a Klein transformation is not
implementable, simply because the Fermi tensor product does not generate a
usual tensor product. Therefore, in general, the study of the symmetric states
on the Fermi algebra cannot be reduced to that of the corresponding symmetric
states on the usual infinite tensor product, even if both share many common
properties.

influence the receiver's decoding by sending a limited number of messages to an

distortion measures and can make rational decision about their encoding and
decoding strategies, respectively. The decoder can also have some side
information (e.g., background knowledge and/or information obtained from
previous communications) about the semantic source to assist its interpretation
of the semantic information. We focus particularly on the case that the
transmitter can commit to an encoding strategy and study the impact of the
strategic decision making on the rate distortion of semantic communication.
Three equilibrium solutions including the strong Stackelberg equilibrium, weak
Stackelberg equilibrium, as well as Nash equilibrium have been studied and
compared. The optimal encoding and decoding strategy profiles under various
equilibrium solutions have been derived. We prove that committing to an
encoding strategy cannot always bring benefit to the encoder. We therefore
propose a feasible condition under which committing to an encoding strategy can
always reduce the distortion performance of semantic communication.

considered as experts and their respective coefficients are updated via an
exponential weight update rule each time the black box is evaluated. Second, we
consider a Bayesian setting where queries are selected via Thompson sampling
and the posterior is updated via a sparse Bayesian regression model (over our
proposed representation) with a regularized horseshoe prior. Numerical
experiments over synthetic benchmarks as well as real-world RNA sequence
optimization and design problems demonstrate the representational power of the

cold-stream to hot-accretion transition predicted by theory by measuring a
decrease in the ratio between the spatially extended Lya luminosity and the
expected baryonic accretion rate (BAR), with increasing elongation above the
transition mass Mstream). This implies a modulation of the share of BAR that
remains cold diminishing quasi-linearly (logarithmic slope of 0.97+-0.19, 5
sigma significance) with the halo to Mstream mass ratio. The integrated
star-formation rates (SFRs) and AGN bolometric luminosities display a
potentially consistent decrease, albeit significant only at 2.6 sigma and 1.3
sigma, respectively. The higher scatter in these tracers suggests the Lya
emission might be mostly a direct product of cold accretion in these structures
rather than indirect, mediated by outflows and photo-ionization from SFR and
AGNs; this is also supported by energetics considerations. Below Mstream
(cold-stream regime) we measure LLya/BAR=10^{40.51+-0.16}~erg/s/Msun*yr,
consistent with predictions, and SFR/BAR=10^{-0.54+-0.23}: on average
30_{-10}^{+20}% of the cold streams go into stars. Above Mstream (hot-accretion

distribution and thus presents an exponential decay. Levy flights are
particular random walks with some power-law increments of infinite variance.
When building the geometric graphs from them, we show from dimensional
arguments, that the number of connected components (clusters) follows an
inverse power of the scale. The distribution of the size of their components,
properly normalized, is scale-invariant, which reflects the self-similar nature
of the underlying process. This allows to test if a graph (including
non-spatial ones) could possibly result from an underlying Levy process. When
the scale increases, these graphs never tend towards a single cluster, the

decades. The spectral leakage and picket fence effect would cause the
distortions in amplitude, frequency, and phase of signals, which have always
been of concern, and attempts have been made to solve them. This paper proposes
two novel decomposition theorems that can totally eliminate the spectral
leakage and picket fence effect, and could broaden the knowledge of signal
processing. First, two generalized eigenvalue equations are constructed for
multifrequency discrete real signals and complex signals. The two decomposition
theorems are then proved. On these bases, exact decomposition methods for real
and complex signals are proposed. For a noise-free multifrequency real signal
with m sinusoidal components, the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each
component can be exactly calculated by using just 4m-1 discrete values and its
second-order derivatives. For a multifrequency complex signal, only 2m-1
discrete values and its first-order derivatives are needed. The numerical
experiments show that the proposed methods have very high resolution, and the
sampling rate does not necessarily obey the Nyquist sampling theorem. With

light bounces on different hair fibers. For this reason, reproducing a specific
hair color in a rendering environment is a challenging task that requires
manual work and expert knowledge in computer graphics to tune the result
visually. While current hair capture methods focus on hair shape estimation
many applications could benefit from an automated method for capturing the
appearance of a physical hair sample, from augmented/virtual reality to hair
dying development. Building on recent advances in inverse graphics and material
capture using deep neural networks, we introduce a novel method for hair color
digitization. Our proposed pipeline allows capturing the color appearance of a
physical hair sample and renders synthetic images of hair with a similar
appearance, simulating different hair styles and/or lighting environments.
Since rendering realistic hair images requires path-tracing rendering, the
conventional inverse graphics approach based on differentiable rendering is
untractable. Our method is based on the combination of a controlled imaging
device, a path-tracing renderer, and an inverse graphics model based on
self-supervised machine learning, which does not require to use differentiable
rendering to be trained. We illustrate the performance of our hair digitization
method on both real and synthetic images and show that our approach can
accurately capture and render hair color.

equivalent and feature the same electrokinetic potential. Experiments: Pure

macroscopic surfaces with extremely low roughness (root mean square [RMS]

(RMS roughness about 35 nm). Equivalence of the surface chemistry is assessed
by comparing the electrokinetic potentials of the NPs via electrophoretic light

The wettability of the macroscopic substrates is obtained from advancing (ACAs)

(XRR) provided by the NP wettability at the liquid interfaces. Findings:
Generally, the RCA on smooth surfaces provides a good estimate of NP wetting
properties. However, mCAs alone cannot predict adsorption barriers that prevent
NP segregation to the interface, as is the case with the pure SiO2
nanoparticles. This strategy greatly facilitates assessing the wetting

Engineering (SBSE), Pareto search has been commonly adopted. It searches for a
good approximation of the problem's Pareto optimal solutions, from which the
stakeholders choose the most preferred solution according to their preferences.
However, when clear preferences of the stakeholders (e.g., a set of weights
which reflect relative importance between objectives) are available prior to
the search, weighted search is believed to be the first choice since it
simplifies the search via converting the original multi-objective problem into
a single-objective one and enable the search to focus on what only the
stakeholders are interested in.
  This paper questions such a ""weighted search first"" belief. We show that the
weights can, in fact, be harmful to the search process even in the presence of
clear preferences. Specifically, we conduct a large scale empirical study which
consists of 38 systems/projects from three representative SBSE problems,
together with two types of search budget and nine sets of weights, leading to
604 cases of comparisons. Our key finding is that weighted search reaches a
certain level of solution quality by consuming relatively less resources at the
early stage of the search; however, Pareto search is at the majority of the
time (up to 77% of the cases) significantly better than its weighted
counterpart, as long as we allow a sufficient, but not unrealistic search
budget. This, together with other findings and actionable suggestions in the
paper, allows us to codify pragmatic and comprehensive guidance on choosing
weighted and Pareto search for SBSE under the circumstance that clear
preferences are available. All code and data can be accessed at:

  By applying well-known techniques from complex analysis -- in particular, the
famous Hadamard factorisation theorem -- we develop some known and many new
results for the phase retrieval of entire functions. Among other things, we
provide a full classification of all (finite order) entire functions whose

which to generate signals whose Gabor magnitudes agree on infinitely many

counterexamples to sampled Gabor phase retrieval in the literature. We show
that one may also apply this machinery to generate so-called ``universal

This paper takes the first step in exploring this area by undertaking an
extensive empirical study comprising 60 combinations of interventions, 9
fairness metrics, 2 utility metrics (Accuracy and F1 Score) across 4 benchmark
datasets. We quantitatively analyze the experimental data to measure the impact
of multiple interventions on fairness, utility and population groups. We found
that applying multiple interventions results in better fairness and lower
utility than individual interventions on aggregate. However, adding more
interventions do no always result in better fairness or worse utility. The
likelihood of achieving high performance (F1 Score) along with high fairness
increases with larger number of interventions. On the downside, we found that
fairness-enhancing interventions can negatively impact different population
groups, especially the privileged group. This study highlights the need for new
fairness metrics that account for the impact on different population groups
apart from just the disparity between groups. Lastly, we offer a list of
combinations of interventions that perform best for different fairness and
utility metrics to aid the design of fair ML pipelines.

boundary-layer stream by continuous heat deposition from a line energy source
placed perpendicular to the flow on the wall surface, a planar flow
configuration relevant for small-scale combustion applications, including
portable rotary engines. Ignition is investigated in the constant density
approximation with a one-step irreversible reaction with large activation
energy adopted for the chemistry description. The ratio of the characteristic
strain time, given by the inverse of the wall velocity gradient, to the
characteristic deflagration residence time defines the relevant controlling
Damk\""ohler number $D$. The time-dependent evolution following the activation
of the heat source is obtained by numerical integration of the energy and fuel
conservation equations. For sufficiently small values of $D$, the solution is
seen to evolve towards a steady flow in which the chemical reaction remains
confined to a finite near-source reactive kernel. This becomes increasingly
slender for increasing values of $D$, corresponding to smaller near-wall
velocities, until a critical value $D_{c1}$ is reached at which the confined
kernel is replaced by a steady anchored deflagration, assisted by the source
heating rate, which develops indefinitely downstream. As the boundary-layer
velocity gradient is further decreased, a second critical Damk\""ohler number
$D_{c2}>D_{c1}$ is reached at which the energy deposition results in a
flashback deflagration propagating upstream against the incoming flow along the
base of the boundary layer. The computations are extended to investigate the
dependence of $D_{c1}$ and $D_{c2}$ on the fuel diffusivity as well as the
additional dependence of $D_{c1}$ on the source heating rate, thereby
delineating the boundaries that define the relevant regime diagram for these

of very high-resolution (VHR) images. Nevertheless, training these models
generally requires a large amount of accurate pixel-wise annotations, which is
very laborious and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the annotation burden,
this paper proposes a consistency-regularized region-growing network (CRGNet)
to achieve semantic segmentation of VHR images with point-level annotations.
The key idea of CRGNet is to iteratively select unlabeled pixels with high
confidence to expand the annotated area from the original sparse points.
However, since there may exist some errors and noises in the expanded
annotations, directly learning from them may mislead the training of the
network. To this end, we further propose the consistency regularization
strategy, where a base classifier and an expanded classifier are employed.
Specifically, the base classifier is supervised by the original sparse
annotations, while the expanded classifier aims to learn from the expanded
annotations generated by the base classifier with the region-growing mechanism.
The consistency regularization is thereby achieved by minimizing the
discrepancy between the predictions from both the base and the expanded
classifiers. We find such a simple regularization strategy is yet very useful
to control the quality of the region-growing mechanism. Extensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CRGNet significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Codes and pre-trained models

of nine galaxies (named as 'Zwicky's Nonet'; G1 - G9 in this work) within a 30
kpc radius region. The cluster core also hosts a luminous radio active galactic
nucleus (AGN), 4C 35.06 with helically twisted jets extending over 200 kpc.
With a 44 ks Chandra observation of A407, we characterize the X-ray properties
of its intracluster medium (ICM) and central galaxies. The mean X-ray
temperature of A407 is 2.7 keV and the $M_{200}$ is $1.9 \times 10^{14}
{M_{\odot}}$. We suggest that A407 has a weak cool core at $r < 60$ kpc scales
and at its very center, $< 1$-2 kpc radius, a small galaxy corona associated
with the strong radio AGN. We also conclude that the AGN 4C 35.06 host galaxy
is most likely G3. We suggest that the central group of galaxies is undergoing
a `slow merge' procedure. The range of the merging time-scale is $0.3\sim2.3$
Gyr and the stellar mass of the future brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) will be
$7.4\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We find that the regions which overlap with the
radio jets have higher temperature and metallicity. This is consistent with AGN
feedback activity. The central entropy is higher than that for other clusters,
which may be due to the AGN feedback and/or merging activity. With all these
facts, we suggest that A407 is a unique and rare system in the local universe
that could help us to understand the formation of a massive BCG.

invariably results in slow inference speed. Previous approaches aim to optimize
the choice of inference schedule over a few iterations to speed up inference.
However, this results in reduced generation quality, mainly because the
inference process is optimized separately, without jointly optimizing with the
training process. In this paper, we propose InferGrad, a diffusion model for
vocoder that incorporates inference process into training, to reduce the
inference iterations while maintaining high generation quality. More
specifically, during training, we generate data from random noise through a
reverse process under inference schedules with a few iterations, and impose a
loss to minimize the gap between the generated and ground-truth data samples.
Then, unlike existing approaches, the training of InferGrad considers the
inference process. The advantages of InferGrad are demonstrated through
experiments on the LJSpeech dataset showing that InferGrad achieves better
voice quality than the baseline WaveGrad under same conditions while
maintaining the same voice quality as the baseline but with $3$x speedup ($2$
iterations for InferGrad vs $6$ iterations for WaveGrad).

with an abrupt change in structure and chemistry across the interface. The
interface between a metal and its nitride is expected to be atomically sharp,
as chemical gradation would require the creation of N vacancies in nitrides and
N interstitials in metal. Contrary to this belief, using first-principles
density functional theory (DFT), we establish that the chemically graded Ti/TiN
interface is thermodynamically preferred over the sharp interface. DFT
calculated N vacancy formation energy in TiN is 2.4 eV, and N interstitial in
Ti is -3.8 eV. Thus, diffusion of N from TiN to Ti by the formation of N
vacancy in TiN and N interstitial in Ti would reduce the internal energy of the
Ti-TiN heterostructure. We show that diffusion of N is thermodynamically
favorable till ~23% of N has diffused from TiN to Ti, resulting in an
atomically chemically graded interface, which we refer to as a 3-D interface.
Experiments' inability to identify a 3-D interface in Ti/TiN could be
attributed to limitations in identifying chemical composition and structure
with atomic-level resolution at interfaces. We define the sum of N vacancy
formation energy and N interstitial formation energy as driving-force, which
could be used as a convenient way to assess the possibility of forming a 3-D
interface in metal/ceramic heterostructures. We also show gradual variation in
lattice parameters and mechanical properties (like bulk modulus, shear modulus,
Young's modulus, and hardness) across the Ti/TiN interface. 3-D interfaces open
a new way to control properties of metal/ceramic heterostructures, in line with
the already established advantage of gradation at interfaces in micrometer

time it takes for an event of interest to happen in a population or an
individual. In the medical context this event might be the time of dying,
metastasis, recurrence of cancer, etc. Recently, the use of neural networks
that are specifically designed for survival analysis has become more popular
and an attractive alternative to more traditional methods. In this paper, we
take advantage of the inherent properties of neural networks to federate the
process of training of these models. This is crucial in the medical domain
since data is scarce and collaboration of multiple health centers is essential
to make a conclusive decision about the properties of a treatment or a disease.
To ensure the privacy of the datasets, it is common to utilize differential
privacy on top of federated learning. Differential privacy acts by introducing
random noise to different stages of training, thus making it harder for an
adversary to extract details about the data. However, in the realistic setting
of small medical datasets and only a few data centers, this noise makes it
harder for the models to converge. To address this problem, we propose
DPFed-post which adds a post-processing stage to the private federated learning
scheme. This extra step helps to regulate the magnitude of the noisy average
parameter update and easier convergence of the model. For our experiments, we
choose 3 real-world datasets in the realistic setting when each health center
has only a few hundred records, and we show that DPFed-post successfully
increases the performance of the models by an average of up to $17\%$ compared

taxation of traders on automated market makers (AMMs). AMM traders specify a
slippage tolerance to indicate the maximum price movement they are willing to
accept. This way, traders avoid automatic transaction failure in case of small
price movements before their trade request executes. However, while a too-small
slippage tolerance may lead to trade failures, a too-large slippage tolerance
allows predatory trading bots to profit from sandwich attacks. These bots can
extract the difference between the slippage tolerance and the actual price
movement as profit.
  In this work, we introduce the sandwich game to analyze sandwich attacks
analytically from both the attacker and victim perspectives. Moreover, we
provide a simple and highly effective algorithm that traders can use to set the
slippage tolerance. We unveil that most broadcasted transactions can avoid
sandwich attacks while simultaneously only experiencing a low risk of
transaction failure. Thereby, we demonstrate that a constant auto-slippage
cannot adjust to varying trade sizes and pool characteristics. Our algorithm
outperforms the constant auto-slippage suggested by the biggest AMM, Uniswap,
in all performed tests. Specifically, our algorithm repeatedly demonstrates a
cost reduction exceeding a factor of 100.

framework achieved by decentralized execution and centralized training for an

partially-observable Markov decision process, which is intractable by dynamic

the following key points: counterfactual baseline for facilitating contributing
agents to learn better policies, soft actor-critic for improving robustness and
exploring optimal solutions. A novel reward is designed by Lagrange multiplier
method to ensure the capacity constraints of energy storage. In addition,
considering that the increase in the number of agents leads to performance
degradation due to large observation spaces, an attention mechanism is
introduced to enhance the stability of policy and enable agents to focus on
important energy-related information, which improves the exploration efficiency
of soft actor-critic. Numerical results based on actual data verify the
performance of the proposed algorithm with high scalability, indicating that
the industrial park can minimize energy costs under different demands.

regions with an average diameter of 20 um with dark contrast. We identify these
as strong-pinning regions with a substantially higher local penetration field
than the surrounding regions. A unique feature of these strong-pinning centers
is that they survive upto high temperatures (near Tc) and produce a
non-Gaussian distribution of the penetration field strength. By analysing the
field dependence of the pinning force behaviour, we identify two distinct
pinning mechanisms: at low temperatures, well below Tc, it is predominantly
surface pinning mechanism and at higher temperatures near Tc, we see a
crossover into a purely delTc pinning mechanism. Our studies show that surface
pinning effects are related to grain alignment, grain boundary, and voids in
the sample. The effect of these diminishes near Tc, and the strong-pinning
regions here are related to local stoichiometric fluctuations. We investigate
the impact of these pinning centers on the current distribution in a
macroscopic Bi-2223 superconducting cylindrical tube. We map the current
distribution across the macroscopic cylindrical tube using an array of hall
sensors distributed around the cylinder. The map shows that the current
distribution is non-uniform across the tube at high currents. The
non-uniformity reveals an inhomogeneous distribution of strong-pinning centers

synthesising the categories of coordination strategies in a novel exhaustive,

relevance of these concepts in the literature is illustrated through a
systematic literature review of 84,741 publications using a structured topic

for selecting appropriate coordination strategies for differing contexts within

advantage of massive amounts of face images on the web. State-of-the-art

their powerful representation capacity. However, existing GCN-based methods
build face graphs mainly according to kNN relations in the feature space, which
may lead to a lot of noise edges connecting two faces of different classes. The
face features will be polluted when messages pass along these noise edges, thus
degrading the performance of GCNs. In this paper, a novel algorithm named
Ada-NETS is proposed to cluster faces by constructing clean graphs for GCNs. In
Ada-NETS, each face is transformed to a new structure space, obtaining robust
features by considering face features of the neighbour images. Then, an
adaptive neighbour discovery strategy is proposed to determine a proper number
of edges connecting to each face image. It significantly reduces the noise
edges while maintaining the good ones to build a graph with clean yet rich
edges for GCNs to cluster faces. Experiments on multiple public clustering

bypassing the need of explicit channel tracking for reducing the system

short-term memory network is designed for predictive beamforming that can
exploit the spatial and temporal dependencies of communication channels to
further improve the learning performance. Finally, simulation results show that
the proposed method can satisfy the requirement of sensing performance, while
its achievable sum-rate can approach the upper bound obtained by a genie-aided

intermediates (I, I*) arising as a result of the ion non-equilibrium

be involved in the L-L micro-phase transition forming clusters and fibrils in
the main phase of N and N* proteins. Thus, they compensate for their excess
chemical potential (ChPot) caused by unbalanced distribution of adsorbed salt
ions in protein structure as compared to N-protein. A temperature model is
proposed for the behavior of ChPots (delta mui) of various states of the
protein: low-temperature i = D, N, I and high-temperature i = D*, N*, I*, as
well as the transition between them. On this basis, the temperature dependence
of the solvent ChPot delta mu1 is proposed. The relationship between the
extreme values of delta mu1 and the temperatures of the critical points (upper
and lower critical solution temperatures) of L-L transitions is established.
The reasons for the nonideal behavior of osmotic pressure at different

Furthermore, the oxygen octahedral distortion and its relation to magnetic

studied the magnetic anisotropy in patterned SrRuO3 (SRO) nanodots as small as
30 nm while performing atomic-resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopy

observe that the magnetic anisotropy and RuO6 octahedra distortion in SRO

with the first principle calculations, we unravel a unique structural mechanism

sugguesting that the competition between lattice anisotropy and oxygen

classification. Coarse-grained classification represents categories with a
large degree of dissimilarity, such as the classification of cats and dogs,
while fine-grained classification represents classifications with a large
degree of similarity, such as cat species, bird species, and the makes or
models of vehicles. Unlike coarse-grained visual classification, fine-grained
visual classification often requires professional experts to label data, which
makes data more expensive. To meet this challenge, many approaches propose to
automatically find the most discriminative regions and use local features to
provide more precise features. These approaches only require image-level
annotations, thereby reducing the cost of annotation. However, most of these
methods require two- or multi-stage architectures and cannot be trained
end-to-end. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-in module that can be integrated
to many common backbones, including CNN-based or Transformer-based networks to
provide strongly discriminative regions. The plugin module can output
pixel-level feature maps and fuse filtered features to enhance fine-grained
visual classification. Experimental results show that the proposed plugin
module outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the
accuracy to 92.77\% and 92.83\% on CUB200-2011 and NABirds, respectively. We

considerable interest. One of their applications is as flying base stations
(FBSs), which can increase coverage and quality of service (QoS). Because FBSs
are battery-powered, regulating their energy usage is a vital aspect of their
use; and therefore the appropriate placement and trajectories of FBSs
throughout their operation are critical to overcoming this challenge. In this
paper, we propose a method of solving a multi-FBS 3D trajectory problem that
considers FBS energy consumption, operation time, flight distance limits, and
inter-cell interference constraints. Our method is divided into two phases: FBS
placement and FBS trajectory. In taking this approach, we break the problem
into several snapshots. First, we find the minimum number of FBSs required and
their proper 3D positions in each snapshot. Then, between every two snapshots,
the trajectory phase is executed. The optimal path between the origin and
destination of each FBS is determined during the trajectory phase by utilizing
a proposed binary linear problem (BLP) model that considers FBS energy
consumption and flight distance constraints. Then, the shortest path for each
FBS is determined while taking obstacles and collision avoidance into
consideration. The number of FBSs needed may vary between snapshots, so we
present an FBS set management (FSM) technique to manage the set of FBSs and
their power. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is applicable
to real-world situations and that the outcomes are consistent with
expectations.

maxima of the spectrogram toward its zeros, which, for signals corrupted by

leveraged by modern spatial statistics tools to perform component
disentanglement and signal detection. The major bottlenecks of this approach
are the discretization of the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the boundedness
of the time-frequency observation window deteriorating the estimation of
summary statistics of the zeros, on which signal processing procedures rely. To
circumvent these limitations, we introduce the Kravchuk transform, a
generalized time-frequency representation suited to discrete signals, providing
a covariant and numerically tractable counterpart to a recently proposed
discrete transform, with a compact phase space, particularly amenable to
spatial statistics. Interesting properties of the Kravchuk transform are
demonstrated, among which covariance under the action of SO(3) and
invertibility. We further show that the point process of the zeros of the
Kravchuk transform of white Gaussian noise coincides with those of the
spherical Gaussian Analytic Function, implying its invariance under isometries
of the sphere. Elaborating on this theorem, we develop a procedure for signal
detection based on the spatial statistics of the zeros of the Kravchuk
spectrogram, whose statistical power is assessed by intensive numerical
simulations, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art zeros-based detection
procedures. Furthermore it appears to be particularly robust to both low
signal-to-noise ratio and small number of samples.

the problem of multiplicity for platform trials where a relatively large number

crowd. To this end, we propose the unified multi-task learning framework for
crowd counting for the first time and re-design the unified training loss
functions to align the image fusion network and crowd counting network. We also
design the Assisted Learning Module (ALM) to fuse the density map feature to
the image fusion encoder process for learning the counting features. To improve
the accuracy, we propose the Extensive Context Extraction Module (ECEM) that is
based on a dense connection architecture to encode multi-receptive-fields
contextual information and apply the Multi-domain Attention Block (MAB) for
concerning the head region in the drone view. Finally, we apply the prediction
map to automatically guide the drones to supervise the dense crowd. The
experimental results on the DroneRGBT dataset show that, compared with the
existing methods, ours has comparable results on objective evaluations and an
easier training process.

  based Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, Deep Learning models have shown a great performance in
complex optimization problems. They generally require large training datasets,
which is a limitation in most practical cases. Transfer learning allows
importing the first layers of a pre-trained architecture and connecting them to
fully-connected layers to adapt them to a new problem. Consequently, the
configuration of the these layers becomes crucial for the performance of the
model. Unfortunately, the optimization of these models is usually a
computationally demanding task. One strategy to optimize Deep Learning models
is the pruning scheme. Pruning methods are focused on reducing the complexity
of the network, assuming an expected performance penalty of the model once
pruned. However, the pruning could potentially be used to improve the
performance, using an optimization algorithm to identify and eventually remove
unnecessary connections among neurons. This work proposes EvoPruneDeepTL, an
evolutionary pruning model for Transfer Learning based Deep Neural Networks
which replaces the last fully-connected layers with sparse layers optimized by
a genetic algorithm. Depending on its solution encoding strategy, our proposed
model can either perform optimized pruning or feature selection over the
densely connected part of the neural network. We carry out different
experiments with several datasets to assess the benefits of our proposal.
Results show the contribution of EvoPruneDeepTL and feature selection to the
overall computational efficiency of the network as a result of the optimization
process. In particular, the accuracy is improved reducing at the same time the
number of active neurons in the final layers.

  We conduct a real-world experiment that involves 13 participants in a company

proposed system. We show that this system can provide seamless and unobtrusive
authentication while still staying highly resistant to zero-effort, video, and
in-person observation-based mimicry attacks. Even when at most 1% of the
strongest type of mimicry attacks are successful, our system does not require
the user to take out their phone to approve legitimate transactions in more

their attributes. Recently, KGs are popularly used as the auxiliary information
to enable more accurate, explainable, and diverse user preference
recommendations. Specifically, existing KG-based recommendation methods target
modeling high-order relations/dependencies from long connectivity user-item
interactions hidden in KG. However, most of them ignore the cold-start problems
(i.e., user cold-start and item cold-start) of recommendation analytics, which
restricts their performance in scenarios when involving new users or new items.
Inspired by the success of meta-learning on scarce training samples, we propose
a novel meta-learning based framework called MetaKG, which encompasses a
collaborative-aware meta learner and a knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture
meta users' preference and entities' knowledge for cold-start recommendations.
The collaborative-aware meta learner aims to locally aggregate user preferences
for each user preference learning task. In contrast, the knowledge-aware meta
learner is to globally generalize knowledge representation across different
user preference learning tasks. Guided by two meta learners, MetaKG can
effectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic
representations, which could be easily adapted to cold-start scenarios.
Besides, we devise a novel adaptive task scheduler which can adaptively select
the informative tasks for meta learning in order to prevent the model from
being corrupted by noisy tasks. Extensive experiments on various cold-start
scenarios using three real data sets demonstrate that our presented MetaKG
outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art competitors in terms of
effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.

standard approach to tackle such applications is based on supervised learning,
which is assisted by large sets of labeled data and is conducted by the
so-called classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random

traditional classifiers is the parameterless Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), which
uses a graph-based methodology and a distance measure to create arcs between
nodes and hence sets of trees, responsible for conquering the nodes, defining
their labels, and shaping the forests. Nevertheless, its performance is
strongly associated with an appropriate distance measure, which may vary
according to the dataset's nature. Therefore, this work proposes a comparative
study over a wide range of distance measures applied to the supervised
Optimum-Path Forest classification. The experimental results are conducted
using well-known literature datasets and compared across benchmarking

fact that the image collection indexed by the system will be regularly updated

indirectly interfere with the retrieval process, letting users see certain

consider nuclear bubble structures and shape coexistence separately. We confirm
that deformations and pairing correlations hinder bubble structures by

have bubble structures both in oblate and prolate deformations. We compare the

selecting images with naturally occurring distortions and reliable labeling,
the dataset addresses the challenge of obtaining representative images for

assessment, those taken with intentionally introduced natural distortions, and
those taken from an open-source image-sharing platform. It is attempted to
maintain a diverse collection of images from various devices, containing a
variety of different types of objects and varying degrees of foreground and

subjectively scored in a laboratory environment using a single stimulus method.
The database contains information about subjective scoring, human subject
statistics, and the standard deviation of each image. The dataset's Mean
Opinion Scores (MOS) make it useful for assessing visual quality. Additionally,
the proposed database is used to evaluate existing blind image quality
assessment approaches, and the scores are analyzed using Pearson and Spearman's

we adopt a definition of group fairness, requiring that individuals who are

argument that the only imperfect procedures offering an a-priori guarantee of
fairness in relation to all non-merit trait are lotteries or degenerate ones
(i.e., everyone or no one is convicted). To provide a more intuitive point of
view, we exploit an adjustment of the well-known ROC space, in order to
represent all possible procedures in our model by a schematic diagram. The
argument seems to be equally valid for all human procedures, provided they are
imperfect. This clearly includes algorithmic decision-making, including
decisions based on statistical predictions, since in practice all statistical

understanding of IH by introducing a new physical quantity, the IH admixture
ratio ${\alpha}$. Consequently, an exotic strategy of IH engineering in energy
space can be proposed, i.e., instead of changing t as commonly used, ${\alpha}$
can be effectively tuned in energy space by changing the onsite energy
difference ($2{\Delta}$) between neighboring-layer states. In practice, this is
feasible via reshaping the electrostatic potential of the surface by deposing a
dipolar overlayer, e.g., crystalline ice. Our first-principles calculations
unveil that IH engineering via adjusting $2{\Delta}$ can greatly tune
interlayer optical transitions in transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers,
switch different types of Dirac surface states in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films, and
control magnetic phase transition of charge density waves in 1H/1T-TaS$_2$

compared the Lya profile of various regions of the environment with the zELDA
radiative transfer model, revealing the neutral gas distribution and
kinematics. We identified 10 Lya emitting sources, including 2 regions with
extended emission: one embedding AzTEC3 and LBG3, a star-forming galaxy located
12 kpc north of the SMG and another toward LBG-1, a star-forming galaxy located
90 kpc to the southeast. The sources appear distributed in an elongated
configuration of about 70'' in extent. The number of sources confirms the
overdensity around AzTEC3. For the AzTEC3+LBG3 system, the Lya emission appears
redshifted and more spatially extended than the [CII] line emission. Similarly,
the Lya line spectrum is broader in velocity than [CII] for LBG1. In the former
spectrum, the Lya emission is elongated to the north of LBG3 and to the south
of AzTEC3, where a faint Lya emitting galaxy is also located. The elongated
structures could resemble tidal features due to the interaction of the two
galaxies with AzTEC3. Also, we find a bridge of gas, revealed by the Lya
emission between AzTEC3 and LBG3. The Lya emission toward LBG1 embeds its three
components. The HI kinematics support the idea of a merger of the three
components. Given the availability of CO and [CII] observations from previous
campaigns, and our Lya information, we find evidence of starburst-driven
phenomena and interactions around AzTEC-3. The stellar mass of the galaxies of
the overdensity and the Lya luminosity of the HI nebula associated with AzTEC-3
imply a dark matter halo of 10^12 Msun at z=5.3 that could evolve into a
cluster of 2x10^14 Msun at z=0.

an in-depth statistical analysis of structure and dynamics of the emerging

existence of a direct correspondence between the sequence of the active forces

ensemble of highly mobile compact structures capable of moving from
conformation to conformation. Finally, akin to protein design problems, we
discuss a method that is capable of designing specific target folds by sampling

lead to misclassification by a DNN. This renders DNNs vulnerable to strategic
input manipulations by attackers, and also oversensitive to environmental
noise.
  To mitigate this phenomenon, practitioners apply joint classification by an
*ensemble* of DNNs. By aggregating the classification outputs of different
individual DNNs for the same input, ensemble-based classification reduces the
risk of misclassifications due to the specific realization of the stochastic
training process of any single DNN. However, the effectiveness of a DNN
ensemble is highly dependent on its members *not simultaneously erring* on many
different inputs.
  In this case study, we harness recent advances in DNN verification to devise
a methodology for identifying ensemble compositions that are less prone to
simultaneous errors, even when the input is adversarially perturbed --
resulting in more robustly-accurate ensemble-based classification.
  Our proposed framework uses a DNN verifier as a backend, and includes
heuristics that help reduce the high complexity of directly verifying
ensembles. More broadly, our work puts forth a novel universal objective for
formal verification that can potentially improve the robustness of real-world,

overcoming the typical computational bottleneck associated with standard

Great progress with all kinds of particles and interaction methods provide
access to nearly all properties of an object under study. However, a
tomographic analysis of the subsurface region remains still a challenge today.
In this regard, the Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) technique has seen
rebirth fueled by the availability of high intensity muon beams. We report here
a study conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). It demonstrates that
the absence of any beam time-structure leads to low pile-up events and a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than one hour acquisition time per sample
or data point. This performance creates the perspective to open this technique
to a wider audience for the routine investigation of non-destructive and
depth-sensitive elemental compositions, for example in rare and precious
samples. Using a hetero-structured sample of known elements and thicknesses, we
successfully detected the characteristic muonic X-rays, emitted during the
capture of a negative muon by an atom, and the gamma-rays resulting from the
nuclear capture of the muon, characterizing the capabilities of MIXE at PSI.
This sample emphasizes the quality of a continuous beam, and the exceptional

worldwide are importantly shaped by both human mobility networks and
socio-economic factors. Few studies, however, have examined the interaction of
mobility networks with socio-spatial inequalities to understand the spread of
infection. We introduce a novel methodology, called the Infection Delay Model,
to calculate how the arrival time of an infection varies geographically,
considering both effective distance-based metrics and differences in regions'
capacity to isolate -- a feature associated with socioeconomic inequalities. To
illustrate an application of the Infection Delay Model, this paper integrates
household travel survey data with cell phone mobility data from the S\~ao Paulo
metropolitan region to assess the effectiveness of lockdowns to slow the spread
of COVID-19. Rather than operating under the assumption that the next pandemic
will begin in the same region as the last, the model estimates infection delays
under every possible outbreak scenario, allowing for generalizable insights
into the effectiveness of interventions to delay a region's first case. The
model sheds light on how the effectiveness of lockdowns to slow the spread of
disease is influenced by the interaction of mobility networks and
socio-economic levels. We find that a negative relationship emerges between
network centrality and the infection delay after lockdown, irrespective of
income. Furthermore, for regions across all income and centrality levels,
outbreaks starting in less central locations were more effectively slowed by a
lockdown. Using the Infection Delay Model, this paper identifies and quantifies
a new dimension of disease risk faced by those most central in a mobility
network.

key-dissemination problem the source nodes have access to independent
randomness and, as the network is noiseless, the resulting key K is a function
of the sources' information. However, different from traditional forms of
multicast, in key-dissemination the key K need not consist of source messages,
but rather may be any function of the information generated at the sources, as
long as it is shared by all terminals. Allowing the shared key K to be a
mixture of source information grants a flexibility to the communication process

traditional secure multicast. The multicast key-capacity is the supremum of
achievable key-rates, subject to the security requirement that the shared key

  CMNs calculated on individual spheres show correlations with both the

correlations, we introduce a new measure, the rank ordered Cosmic Mach number
($\hat{\mathcal{M}}_g$), which shows a tight correlations with the overdensity
$\delta=\frac{\rho-\bar{\rho}}{\bar{\rho}}$. Measures of the large scale
density gradient as well as other average properties of the halo population in

results in this first empirical study suggest that $\hat{\mathcal{M}}_g$ is an
excellent proxy for the underlying density field and hence environment that can
circumvent reliance on number density counts in a region. For scales between

provided by kernel mean embeddings, which lifts kernel-induced similarity on

the two-stage sampling nature of the problem, enabling one to derive estimators

key geometrical relations between distributions. In contrast, optimal transport
(OT) metrics, are potentially more appealing. In this work, we propose an
OT-based estimator for distribution regression. We build on the Sliced
Wasserstein distance to obtain an OT-based representation. We study the
theoretical properties of a kernel ridge regression estimator based on such

Assurance relies on the availability of precisely specified and, ideally,

machine learning (ML) and training data but largely lack such requirements.
  In this paper, we address the need for defining machine-verifiable
reliability requirements for MVCs against transformations that simulate the
full range of realistic and safety-critical changes in the environment. Using
human performance as a baseline, we define reliability requirements as: 'if the
changes in an image do not affect a human's decision, neither should they
affect the MVC's.' To this end, we provide: (1) a class of safety-related image
transformations; (2) reliability requirement classes to specify
correctness-preservation and prediction-preservation for MVCs; (3) a method to
instantiate machine-verifiable requirements from these requirements classes
using human performance experiment data; (4) human performance experiment data
for image recognition involving eight commonly used transformations, from about
2000 human participants; and (5) a method for automatically checking whether an
MVC satisfies our requirements. Further, we show that our reliability
requirements are feasible and reusable by evaluating our methods on 13
state-of-the-art pre-trained image classification models. Finally, we
demonstrate that our approach detects reliability gaps in MVCs that other
existing methods are unable to detect.

computational kernels for efficient computations in mortar finite element
methods. Mortar methods enable a variationally consistent imposition of
coupling conditions at high accuracy, but come with considerable numerical
effort and cost for the evaluation of the mortar integrals to compute the
coupling operators. In this paper, we identify bottlenecks in parallel data
layout and domain decomposition that hinder an efficient evaluation of the
mortar integrals. We then propose a set of computational strategies to restore
optimal parallel communication and scalability for the core kernels devoted to
the evaluation of mortar terms. We exemplarily study the proposed algorithmic
components in the context of three-dimensional large-deformation contact
mechanics, both for cases with fixed and dynamically varying interface
topology, yet these concepts can naturally and easily be transferred to other
mortar applications, e.g. classical meshtying problems. To restore parallel
scalability, we employ overlapping domain decompositions of the interface
discretization independent from the underlying volumes and then tackle parallel
communication for the mortar evaluation by a geometrically motivated reduction
of ghosting data. Using three-dimensional contact examples, we demonstrate
strong and weak scalability of the proposed algorithms up to 480 parallel
processes as well as study and discuss improvements in parallel communication
related to mortar finite element methods. For the first time, dynamic load
balancing is applied to mortar contact problems with evolving contact zones,
such that the computational work is well balanced among all parallel processors
independent of the current state of the simulation.

query and the system returns a ranked list of products in order of relevance to
the query. An increasingly popular alternative in e-commerce search is to issue
a voice-query to a smart speaker (e.g., Amazon Echo) powered by a voice
assistant (VA, e.g., Alexa). In this situation, the VA usually spells out the
details of only one product, an explanation citing the reason for its
selection, and a default action of adding the product to the customer's cart.
This reduced autonomy of the customer in the choice of a product during
voice-search makes it necessary for a VA to be far more responsible and
trustworthy in its explanation and default action.
  In this paper, we ask whether the explanation presented for a product
selection by the Alexa VA installed on an Amazon Echo device is consistent with
human understanding as well as with the observations on other traditional
mediums (e.g., desktop ecommerce search). Through a user survey, we find that
in 81% cases the interpretation of 'a top result' by the users is different
from that of Alexa. While investigating for the fairness of the default action,
we observe that over a set of as many as 1000 queries, in nearly 68% cases,
there exist one or more products which are more relevant (as per Amazon's own
desktop search results) than the product chosen by Alexa. Finally, we conducted
a survey over 30 queries for which the Alexa-selected product was different
from the top desktop search result, and observed that in nearly 73% cases, the
participants preferred the top desktop search result as opposed to the product
chosen by Alexa. Our results raise several concerns and necessitates more
discussions around the related fairness and interpretability issues of VAs for
e-commerce search.

uses the accelerometer signal captured by a bed-attached consumer smartphone.
Automatic bed-occupancy detection is necessary for automatic long-term cough
monitoring, since the time which the monitored patient occupies the bed is
required to accurately calculate a cough rate. Accelerometer measurements are
more cost effective and less intrusive than alternatives such as video
monitoring or pressure sensors. A 249-hour dataset of manually-labelled
acceleration signals gathered from seven patients undergoing treatment for
tuberculosis (TB) was compiled for experimentation. These signals are
characterised by brief activity bursts interspersed with long periods of little
or no activity, even when the bed is occupied. To process them effectively, we
propose an architecture consisting of three interconnected components. An
occupancy-change detector locates instances at which bed occupancy is likely to
have changed, an occupancy-interval detector classifies periods between
detected occupancy changes and an occupancy-state detector corrects
falsely-identified occupancy changes. Using long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, this architecture was demonstrated to achieve an AUC of 0.94. When
integrated into a complete cough monitoring system, the daily cough rate of a
patient undergoing TB treatment was determined over a period of 14 days. As the
colony forming unit (CFU) counts decreased and the time to positivity (TPP)
increased, the measured cough rate decreased, indicating effective TB
treatment. This provides a first indication that automatic cough monitoring
based on bed-mounted accelerometer measurements may present a non-invasive,
non-intrusive and cost-effective means of monitoring long-term recovery of TB
patients.

rotations experienced by non-spherical inertial-scale particles result from
volume filtered fluid forces and torques, similar to spherical particles.
However, the particle orientations carry signatures of preferential alignments
with the surrounding flow structures, which is reflected in distinct axial and
lateral fluctuations for accelerations and rotation rates. The randomization of
orientations does not occur even for particles with volume equivalent diameter
size in the inertial range, here up to 60 $\eta$ at $Re_{\lambda}=120$.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the role of fluid boundary layers around the
particles cannot be neglected to reach a quantitative understanding of particle
statistical dynamics, as they affect the intensities of angular velocities, and
the relative importance of tumbling with respect to spinning rotations. This
study brings to the fore the importance of inertial-scale flow structures in

subtleties of functioning. The documentation provided with the libraries is
often very sparse and describes only the main intended scenarios for the

approach based on the use of formal library specifications, which allows
detecting integration errors using static analysis methods. To do this, the
external library is described using the LibSL specification language, the
resulting description is translated into the internal data structures of the
KEX analyzer. The execution of the incorrect scenarios of library usage, such
as the incorrect sequence of method calls or the violation of the API function
contract, is marked in the program model with special built-in functions of the
KEX analyzer. Later, when analyzing the program, KEX becomes able to detect
integration errors, since incorrect library usage scenarios are diagnosed as
calling marked functions. The proposed approach is implemented as SPIDER
(SPecification-based Integration Defect Revealer), which is an extension of the
Kex analyzer and has proven its efficiency by detecting integration errors of
different classes on several special-made projects, as well as on several
projects taken from open repositories.

applications throughout the sciences. Many such networks are multipartite,
meaning their nodes can be divided into groups and nodes of the same group are
never connected. When the network is multipartite, this paper demonstrates that
the node representations obtained via spectral embedding live near
group-specific low-dimensional subspaces of a higher-dimensional ambient space.
For this reason we propose a follow-on step after spectral embedding, to
recover node representations in their intrinsic rather than ambient dimension,
proving uniform consistency under a low-rank, inhomogeneous random graph model.
Our method naturally generalizes bipartite spectral embedding, in which node
representations are obtained by singular value decomposition of the biadjacency

we study the choice of prior for the variance or precision matrix when Gaussian

mixture models is done by considering observations in a space of only a handful
of dimensions. Instead, we are concerned with more realistic problems of higher

of prior is increasingly important as the dimensionality of the problem
increases. After identifying certain undesirable properties of standard priors
in problems of higher dimensionality, we review and implement possible
alternative priors. The most promising priors are identified, as well as other
factors that affect the convergence of MCMC samplers. Our results show that the
choice of prior is critical for deriving reliable posterior inferences. This

the robotics community \emph{in its entirety} due to the challenges of
minimizing time in the presence of the non-convex constraints posed by
collision avoidance. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial
trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of
a quadrotor and, thus, did not aim at minimizing time. We address this
challenging problem by using a hierarchical, sampling-based method with an
incrementally more complex quadrotor model. Our method first finds paths in
different topologies to guide subsequent trajectory search for a kinodynamic
point-mass model. Then, it uses an asymptotically-optimal, kinodynamic
sampling-based method based on a full quadrotor model on top of the point-mass
solution to find a feasible trajectory with a time-optimal objective. The
proposed method is shown to outperform all related baselines in cluttered

There is no statistically significant evidence of increased test automation

Thus, we conclude that, a potential benefit of improving test automation
maturity (using standard best practices) is product quality improvement and
release cycle acceleration in the CI context of open source projects. We
encourage future research to extend our findings by adding more datasets with
different programming languages and CI tools, closed source projects, and

increasingly being completed digitally, and are therefore not only fulfilled
faster, more efficiently but also more purposefully and successfully. The rapid
developments in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years have
played a major role in this, as they brought up many helpful approaches to
build on. At the same time, the eyes, their movements, and the meaning of these
movements are being progressively researched. The combination of these
developments has led to exciting approaches. In this dissertation, I present
some of these approaches which I worked on during my Ph.D.
  First, I provide insight into the development of models that use artificial
intelligence to connect eye movements with visual expertise. This is
demonstrated for two domains or rather groups of people: athletes in
decision-making actions and surgeons in arthroscopic procedures. The resulting
models can be considered as digital diagnostic models for automatic expertise
recognition. Furthermore, I show approaches that investigate the
transferability of eye movement patterns to different expertise domains and
subsequently, important aspects of techniques for generalization. Finally, I
address the temporal detection of confusion based on eye movement data. The
results suggest the use of the resulting model as a clock signal for possible
digital assistance options in the training of young professionals. An
interesting aspect of my research is that I was able to draw on very valuable
data from DFB youth elite athletes as well as on long-standing experts in
arthroscopy. In particular, the work with the DFB data attracted the interest
of radio and print media, namely DeutschlandFunk Nova and SWR DasDing. All
resulting articles presented here have been published in internationally
renowned journals or at conferences.

target objects like lesions and polyps in medical images. Motivated by this, we
propose a cross-level contrastive learning scheme to enhance representation
capacity for local features in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Compared to existing image-wise, patch-wise and point-wise contrastive learning
algorithms, our devised method is capable of exploring more complex similarity
cues, namely the relational characteristics between global and local patch-wise
representations. Additionally, for fully making use of cross-level semantic
relations, we devise a novel consistency constraint that compares the
predictions of patches against those of the full image. With the help of the
cross-level contrastive learning and consistency constraint, the unlabelled

to support documenters in evaluating the differences and similarities between
the concrete information need of developers and the current state of

our approach, we perform a case study on the documentation of Rust. Our results
show that there is a relatively high level of topical alignment in Rust

discuss implications for programming language documenters, particularly how to

making use of regional projections and standardized indices: the Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI). The method adopted,
using historical precipitation and temperature data and water levels collected
in monitoring wells, first investigates the possible correlations between
meteorological and groundwater indices at each well. Then, if there is a
correlation, a linear regression analysis is used to model the relationships
between SGIs and SPIs, and SGIs and SPEIs. The same relationships are used to
infer future SGIs from SPI and SPEI projections obtained by means of an
ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), under different climate scenarios
(RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). This methodology has been applied to data collected in
Tuscany (Italy), where historical series of daily climate variables (since
1934) and daily records for 16 wells, covering the period 2005-2020, are
available. The impacts on groundwater have been computed in the short
(2006-2035), medium (2036-2065) and long term (2066-2095). The analysis
indicates that, in the historical period and for most of the monitoring wells,
there is a good correlation between SGIs and SPIs or SPEIs. In a global warming
scenario, the influence of temperature on evapotranspiration phenomena cannot
be overlooked so the SGI-SPEI relationships seem more suitable to forecast
groundwater droughts. According to these relationships, negative effects on
groundwater levels in almost all wells are estimated for the futureDue to the
type of data required and its simplicity, this methodology can be applied to
different areas of interest for a quick estimate of groundwater availability
under climate change scenarios.

the emergence of these correlations is the ponderomotive force of the slowly

fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the bulk micromachining

years for its potential inclusion in consumer and industrial applications like

under controlled settings with specific materials' properties and shapes.
Recent literature has challenged the earlier findings on radars-based materials
classification claiming that earlier solutions are not easily scaled to
industrial applications due to a variety of real-world issues. Published
experiments on the impact of these factors on the robustness of the extracted
radar-based traditional features have already demonstrated that the application
of deep neural networks can mitigate, to some extent, the impact to produce a
viable solution. However, previous studies lacked an investigation of the
usefulness of lower frequency radar units, specifically <10GHz, against the
higher range units around and above 60GHz. This research considers two radar
units with different frequency ranges: Walabot-3D (6.3-8 GHz) cm-wave and
IMAGEVK-74 (62-69 GHz) mm-wave imaging units by Vayyar Imaging. A comparison is
presented on the applicability of each unit for material classification. This
work extends upon previous efforts, by applying deep wavelet scattering
transform for the identification of different materials based on the reflected
signals. In the wavelet scattering feature extractor, data is propagated
through a series of wavelet transforms, nonlinearities, and averaging to
produce low-variance representations of the reflected radar signals. This work
is unique in comparison of the radar units and algorithms in material
classification and includes real-time demonstrations that show strong
performance by both units, with increased robustness offered by the cm-wave
radar unit.

\emph{Planck}, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dust is obtained
after subtracting the synchrotron radiation and considering the spectral line
emission. The dust mass is derived from fitting the SED by a two-component

the mass of 0.1 $M_\odot$, and a cold component of the temperature of $\sim 17$
K and the mass of 46 $M_\odot$. On the other hand, the dust mass is derived to
be $\sim$ 66 $M_\odot$ from the visual extinction of IC 443 which is identified
from the 3D Bayestar extinction map and its coincidence with the infrared
emission morphology. Roughly the dust mass derived from the infrared emission

infrared emission can be adjusted to be more consistent with that from the
extinction by using different dust opacity property or considering optically
thick radiation. In addition, the distribution of dust temperature and mass is

representations and then use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models to capture
the interactions among entities and relations. However, many GCN-based KGC
models fail to outperform state-of-the-art KGE models though introducing
additional computational complexity. This phenomenon motivates us to explore
the real effect of GCNs in KGC. Therefore, in this paper, we build upon
representative GCN-based KGC models and introduce variants to find which factor
of GCNs is critical in KGC. Surprisingly, we observe from experiments that the
graph structure modeling in GCNs does not have a significant impact on the
performance of KGC models, which is in contrast to the common belief. Instead,
the transformations for entity representations are responsible for the
performance improvements. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet
effective framework named LTE-KGE, which equips existing KGE models with
linearly transformed entity embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that LTE-KGE
models lead to similar performance improvements with GCN-based KGC methods,
while being more computationally efficient. These results suggest that existing
GCNs are unnecessary for KGC, and novel GCN-based KGC models should count on
more ablation studies to validate their effectiveness. The code of all the

untargeted attacks on FL, but they are not widely applicable as they i) assume
that the attacker knows every update of benign clients, which is indeed sent in
encrypted form to the central server, or ii) assume that the attacker has a
large dataset and sufficient resources to locally train updates imitating
benign parties. In this paper, we design a zero-knowledge untargeted attack
(ZKA), which synthesizes malicious data to craft adversarial models without
eavesdropping on the transmission of benign clients at all or requiring a large
quantity of task-specific training data. To inject malicious input into the FL
system by synthetic data, ZKA has two variants. ZKA-R generates adversarial
ambiguous data by reversing engineering from the global models. To enable
stealthiness, ZKA-G trains the local model on synthetic data from the generator
that aims to synthesize images different from a randomly chosen class.
Furthermore, we add a novel distance-based regularization term for both attacks
to further enhance stealthiness. Experimental results on Fashion-MNIST and
CIFAR-10 show that the ZKA achieves similar or even higher attack success rate
than the state-of-the-art untargeted attacks against various defense
mechanisms, namely more than 50% for Cifar-10 for all considered defense
mechanisms. As expected, ZKA-G is better at circumventing defenses, even
showing a defense pass rate of close to 90% when ZKA-R only achieves 70%.
Higher data heterogeneity favours ZKA-R since detection becomes harder.

entropic measures, and the effect of the quantum memory reduces the

high-energy Dirac neutrinos emitted by some distant source and propagating
towards the earth. The neutrino has a finite magnetic moment and interacts with
both deterministic and stochastic interstellar magnetic fields. To describe the

significant effort has been devoted to the development of intricate
constitutive models for finite elasticity, we show that in the kinds of
large-strain mechanics problems arising in soft robotics, many of the
parameters in constitutive models are irrelevant. For the most part, the
isochoric (locally volume-preserving) constraint dominates behavior, and this
can be built into closed-form kinematic deformation fields before even
considering other aspects of constitutive modeling. We therefore focus on
developing and applying primitive deformations that each observe this

deformations that the most common behaviors observed in soft robots can be
replicated. Case studies include an inflatable rubber chamber, a slender rubber
rod, and a rubber block subjected to different boundary conditions. We show

through incorporating the genetic variation factor into the traditional

prove that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimal solution.

  alignment for long sequences",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Popular solutions to Named Entity Recognition (NER) include conditional
random fields, sequence-to-sequence models, or utilizing the question-answering
framework. However, they are not suitable for nested and overlapping spans with
large ontologies and for predicting the position of the entities. To fill this
gap, we introduce a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer (RNN-T). These
models are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly
specifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models.
RNN-T models learn the alignment using a loss function that sums over all
alignments. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and target
labels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment
RNN-T model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of
RNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. As a more general case, we also
propose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation of
the given input alignment and the model will learn an alignment within the
given constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models
which can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when
available. Through empirical experiments on a challenging real-world medical
NER task with multiple nested ontologies, we demonstrate that our fixed
alignment model outperforms the standard RNN-T model, improving F1-score from
0.70 to 0.74.

  in 6G","This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Network",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The next generation of wireless systems will take the concept of
communications and networking to another level through the seamless integration
of terrestrial, aerial, satellite, maritime and underwater communication
systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an innovative technology
which, with its singular features and functionalities, can expedite the
realization of this everywhere connectivity. Motivated by the unparalleled
properties of this innovatory technology, this article provides a comprehensive
discussion on how RIS can contribute to the actualization and proper
functioning of future integrated terrestrial/non-terrestrial (INTENT) networks.
As a case study, we explore the integration of RIS into non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA)-based satellite communication networks and demonstrate the
performance enhancement achieved by the inclusion of RIS via numerical
simulations. Promising directions for future research in this area are set
forth at the end of this article.

hypothetical scenarios. If we stretch our imagination, one of the interesting
scenarios would be our interstellar future. To model an interstellar society,
we need to consider relativistic physics, which is not straightforward to
implement in existing agent-based simulation frameworks. In this paper, we
present the mathematics and algorithmic details needed for simulating
agent-based models in 4D relativistic spacetime. These algorithms form the
basis of our open-source computational framework, ""Relativitization"".
