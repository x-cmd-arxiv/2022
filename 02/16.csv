gained considerable interest in the communication sector. Free-space optical
communication (FSOC) systems can deliver information wirelessly at high data
rates (above 1 Gbps) using compact and lightweight optical terminals. Thus,
airborne FSOC systems have been a recent subject of interest and activity,
including emerging projects such as Google Loon and Facebook Aquila. One of
major technical challenges of FSOC system is the stringent requirement of
pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) capability to ensure the reliable
transmission between the transmitter and receiver, due to narrow beam width and
movement of airborne platforms. By identifying and validating improvement
techniques dealing with this issue, we developed simple models of propeller and
wind induced vibrations and investigated the effect of those vibrations on the
performance of FSOC systems operating in the stratosphere.

quantum fields decreases as one studies them at extremely short distances. This
emerges from the study of entropy of black holes, as well as from holographic
theories in AdS geometries. Presumably a theory of quantum gravity will provide
an explicit description of how the number of degrees of freedom thin out as one
studies high energy scales.
  We do not have a comprehensive theory of how such a thinning of degrees of
freedom would occur. It is likely that there might be residual (and measurable)
effects at larger length scales, though this might be significant only near the
Planck scale. There are very few instances in Nature where one might be able to
see effects of this thinning. One promising venue is in the phenomenon of
inflation, produced in the simplest models through a scalar inflaton field in a
potential with a flat (""slow-roll"") part as well as a potential well. We
compute the effect of such a thinning of degrees of freedom upon the running of
the spectral index of quantum fluctuations of the inflaton and deduce that this
will lead to a positive power of wave-vector (opposite to the usual $\sim
-\epsilon$, i.e., negative power correction). Some comments are then made about
the impact on observations (or non-observations) of such fluctuations

stresses are balanced by surface tension, disintegrating in turbulence. For
cavities with initial sizes $d_0$ much larger than $d_\mathrm{H}$ (probing up
to $d_0 / d_\mathrm{H} = 8.3$), the size distribution of bubbles smaller than
$d_\mathrm{H}$ follows $N(d) \propto d^{-3/2}$, with $d$ the bubble diameter.
The capillary instability of ligaments involved in the deformation of the large
bubbles is shown visually to be responsible for the creation of the small ones.
Turning to dynamical, three-dimensional measurements of individual break-up
events, we describe the break-up child size distribution and the number of
child bubbles formed as a function of $d_0 / d_\mathrm{H}$. Then, to model the
evolution of a population of bubbles produced by turbulent bubble break-up, we
propose a population balance framework in which break-up involves two physical
processes: an inertial deformation to the parent bubble that sets the size of
large child bubbles, and a capillary instability that sets the size of small
child bubbles. A Monte Carlo approach is used to construct the child size
distribution, with simulated stochastic break-ups constrained by our
experimental measurements and the understanding of the role of capillarity in
small bubble production. This approach reproduces the experimental time
evolution of the bubble size distribution during the disintegration of large

Variance Reduction method (SMVR), which achieves the optimal sample complexity
of $\mathcal{O}\left(1 / \epsilon^{3}\right)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary
point for non-convex objectives. Furthermore, when the objective function
satisfies the convexity or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we propose a

$\mathcal{O}\left(1 / \epsilon^{2}\right)$ for convex functions or
$\mathcal{O}\left(1 /\left(\mu\epsilon\right)\right)$ for non-convex functions

complexity for $\mu$-strongly convex functions. To make use of adaptive
learning rates, we also develop Adaptive SMVR, which achieves the same
complexities but converges faster in practice. All our complexities match the
lower bounds not only in terms of $\epsilon$ but also in terms of $\mu$ (for PL

vibrating beams that may undergo motions of large magnitude -- i.e. large
displacements of the reference line and large rotations of the cross sections.
Such beams, shearable and very flexible, are often called geometrically exact
beams and are especially needed in modern highly flexible light-weight
structures, where one cannot neglect these large motions. We view these beams
from two perspectives. The first perspective is one in which the beam is
described in terms of the position of its reference line and the orientation of
its cross sections (expressed in some fixed coordinate system). This is the
generally encountered model, due to Eric Reissner and Juan C. Simo. Of second
order in time and space, it is a quasilinear system of six equations. The
second perspective is one in which the beam is rather described by intrinsic
variables -- velocities and strains or internal forces and moments -- which are
moreover expressed in a moving coordinate system attached to the beam. This
system, proposed in its most general form by Dewey H. Hodges, consists of twice
as many equations, but is of first order in time and space, hyperbolic and only
semilinear (quadratic). From the definition of the state of the latter model,
one can see that both perspectives are linked by a nonlinear transformation.
The questions of well-posedness, stabilization and control are addressed for
beams governed by the intrinsic model, while by using the transformation we
also prove that the existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to the
intrinsic model implies that of a classical solution to the model written in
terms of positions and rotations. In particular, this enables us to deduce
corresponding results for the latter model. We also also address these
questions for networks of beams attached to each other by means of rigid
joints.

have been used extensively to study the generalization gap of learning
algorithms, the information-theoretic nature of excess risk has not yet been

desirable to modify this game in a way that the order of play can be swapped.
We then prove that, under some regularity conditions, if the world and designer

In this case, a Bayesian problem surfaces in the dual representation. This
makes it possible to utilize recent information-theoretic results on minimum

100 K temperature jump under irradiation of a pulse with 1 ps width and maximum
intensity of 0.5 V/nm. A general anisotropic phenomenon is manifested as a
result of preferential resonant excitation of symmetric or asymmetric OH
stretching vibration, depending on the relationships between the orientations

water molecules with the preferred dipole orientation, constrained by applied
static electric field or spacial confinement, parallel to the polarized

constitute a novel tool for optical control at the nanoscale. While well
described in simple geometries, SOI of light in disordered environments, where
only a partial knowledge of the material's microscopy is available, remain
largely unexplored. Here, we show that in transversally random media, the
disorder correlation can be exploited to tailor a variety of trajectories for
ballistic beams via SOI. In particular, we unveil the existence of an
oscillating spin Hall effect, stemming from the deformation of the phase of the
wavefront due to SOI. In combination with a weak measurement, this phenomenon
can also be maximized by an optimal choice of the disorder correlation.

Due to the coupling in the dark sector, we also obtain a scaling solution where
the 2-form field behaves as a pressure-less fluid. For a particular set of

most abundant ($70 \pm 2\%$ of all energy deposition events). We report that
neuronal energy deposition by proton and $\alpha$-particle tracks declines
approximately hyperbolically with increasing primary particle energy at

with the values oscillating about a mean value of $-$1.37$\times$10$^{-11}$ Hz

with time before converging on the mean value. We were able to identify four
states in the spin-frequency derivative that were quantified by the amount of
modulation about the mean value and the transition between these states seem to
be correlated with the change in the radio emission of the magnetar while no
correlation is seen in the average radio profile variability on a shorter
timescale (days). The 0.5--12 keV X-ray flux shows a monotonic decrease that
can be attributed to thermal emission from a hot-spot on the surface of the
neutron star that is reducing in size. Such decrease is consistent with what is
seen in other magnetars. The potential correlation between the radio emission
mode and the behaviour of the spin-down rate hints to a global change in the
magnetopshere of the magnetar akin to the correlation seen in a subset of

is a common practice that mitigates the model's bias towards a single expert.
Reliable models generating calibrated outputs and reflecting the inter-rater
disagreement are key to the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical
practice. Various methods exist to take into account different expert labels.
We focus on comparing three label fusion methods: STAPLE, average of the
rater's segmentation, and random sampling of each rater's segmentation during
training. Each label fusion method is studied using both the conventional
training framework and the recently published SoftSeg framework that limits
information loss by treating the segmentation task as a regression. Our
results, across 10 data splittings on two public datasets, indicate that
SoftSeg models, regardless of the ground truth fusion method, had better
calibration and preservation of the inter-rater rater variability compared with
their conventional counterparts without impacting the segmentation performance.
Conventional models, i.e., trained with a Dice loss, with binary inputs, and
sigmoid/softmax final activate, were overconfident and underestimated the
uncertainty associated with inter-rater variability. Conversely, fusing labels
by averaging with the SoftSeg framework led to underconfident outputs and
overestimation of the rater disagreement. In terms of segmentation performance,
the best label fusion method was different for the two datasets studied,
indicating this parameter might be task-dependent. However, SoftSeg had
segmentation performance systematically superior or equal to the conventionally
trained models and had the best calibration and preservation of the inter-rater

example, image classification is usually invariant to rotation and color
transformation: a rotated car in a different color is still identified as a
car. Data augmentation, which adds the transformed data into the training set
and trains a model on the augmented data, is one commonly used technique to
build these invariances into the learning process. However, it is unclear how
data augmentation performs theoretically and what the optimal algorithm is in
presence of transformation invariances. In this paper, we study PAC
learnability under transformation invariances in three settings according to
different levels of realizability: (i) A hypothesis fits the augmented data;
(ii) A hypothesis fits only the original data and the transformed data lying in
the support of the data distribution; (iii) Agnostic case. One interesting
observation is that distinguishing between the original data and the
transformed data is necessary to achieve optimal accuracy in setting (ii) and
(iii), which implies that any algorithm not differentiating between the
original and transformed data (including data augmentation) is not optimal.
Furthermore, this type of algorithms can even ""harm"" the accuracy. In setting
(i), although it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two data sets, data
augmentation still does not perform optimally. Due to such a difference, we
propose two combinatorial measures characterizing the optimal sample complexity
in setting (i) and (ii)(iii) and provide the optimal algorithms.

learning. But many optimization tasks are neither i.i.d. nor fully adversarial,
which makes it of fundamental interest to get a better theoretical
understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish
novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that
interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By
exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence
on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was
previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d.
assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were
previously considered in the expert and bandit setting. Our results extend this
to the online convex optimization framework. In the fully i.i.d. case, our
bounds match the rates one would expect from results in stochastic
acceleration, and in the fully adversarial case they gracefully deteriorate to
match the minimax regret. We further provide lower bounds showing that our
regret upper bounds are tight for all intermediate regimes in terms of the
stochastic variance and the adversarial variation of the loss gradients.

performance while model repeatability is rarely assessed, leading to the
development of models that are unusable in clinical practice. In this work, we
evaluate the repeatability of four model types (binary classification,
multi-class classification, ordinal classification, and regression) on images

performance of binary, multi-class, ordinal, and regression models on four

retinopathy of prematurity. Repeatability is measured and compared on ResNet

repeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increased
repeatability for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models

conditions in the nilpotent setting. This main result is then applied to obtain
a new proof for a previous extension of the same sequence. It also yields a
different extension of the sequence that involves terms in the upper central
series. Furthermore, we use the main result to obtain a collection of dimension
bounds on the multiplier of a nilpotent diassociative algebra. These differ
notably from the Lie case. Since diassociative algebras generalize associative
algebras, we obtain an associative analogue of the results herein. We conclude
by computing both the associative and diassociative multipliers of an
associative algebra. This paper is part of an ongoing project to advance
extension theory in the context of several Loday algebras.

the agent to consider both return maximization and safe exploration. In this
paper, we propose CUP, a Conservative Update Policy algorithm with a
theoretical safety guarantee. We derive the CUP based on the new proposed
performance bounds and surrogate functions. Although using bounds as surrogate
functions to design safe RL algorithms have appeared in some existing works, we
develop them at least three aspects: (i) We provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis to extend the surrogate functions to generalized advantage estimator
(GAE). GAE significantly reduces variance empirically while maintaining a
tolerable level of bias, which is an efficient step for us to design CUP; (ii)
The proposed bounds are tighter than existing works, i.e., using the proposed
bounds as surrogate functions are better local approximations to the objective
and safety constraints. (iii) The proposed CUP provides a non-convex
implementation via first-order optimizers, which does not depend on any convex
approximation. Finally, extensive experiments show the effectiveness of CUP
where the agent satisfies safe constraints. We have opened the source code of
CUP at https://github.com/RL-boxes/Safe-RL.

machine learning models has been in the image recognition domain. The ML-based
malware detection domain has received less attention despite its importance.
Moreover, most work exploring these defenses has focused on several methods but
with no strategy when applying them. In this paper, we introduce StratDef,
which is a strategic defense system based on a moving target defense approach.
We overcome challenges related to the systematic construction, selection, and
strategic use of models to maximize adversarial robustness. StratDef
dynamically and strategically chooses the best models to increase the
uncertainty for the attacker while minimizing critical aspects in the
adversarial ML domain, like attack transferability. We provide the first
comprehensive evaluation of defenses against adversarial attacks on machine
learning for malware detection, where our threat model explores different
levels of threat, attacker knowledge, capabilities, and attack intensities. We
show that StratDef performs better than other defenses even when facing the
peak adversarial threat. We also show that, of the existing defenses, only a
few adversarially-trained models provide substantially better protection than
just using vanilla models but are still outperformed by StratDef.

constant-weight codewords}. A constant-weight code is a collection of codewords
that share the same Hamming weight. Constant-weight equality operators have a
multiplicative depth that depends only on the Hamming weight of the code, not
the bit-length of the elements. In our experiments, we show how these equality
operators are up to 10 times faster than existing equality operators.
Furthermore, we propose PIR using the constant-weight equality operator or
\emph{constant-weight PIR}, which is a PIR protocol using an approach
previously deemed impractical. We show that for private retrieval of large,
streaming data, constant-weight PIR has a smaller communication complexity and
lower runtime compared to SEALPIR and MulPIR, respectively, which are two
state-of-the-art solutions for PIR. Moreover, we show how constant-weight PIR

paradigm to categorize pathology images is patch-based processing, which often
incorporates multiple instance learning (MIL) to aggregate local patch-level
representations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically
relevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and
current MIL-based approaches often process images uniformly, discarding the
inter-patches interactions. To alleviate these issues, we propose ScoreNet, a
new efficient transformer that exploits a differentiable recommendation stage
to extract discriminative image regions and dedicate computational resources
accordingly. The proposed transformer leverages the local and global attention
of a few dynamically recommended high-resolution regions at an efficient
computational cost. We further introduce a novel mixing data-augmentation,
namely ScoreMix, by leveraging the image's semantic distribution to guide the
data mixing and produce coherent sample-label pairs. ScoreMix is embarrassingly
simple and mitigates the pitfalls of previous augmentations, which assume a
uniform semantic distribution and risk mislabeling the samples. Thorough

mixing augmentation variants. Finally, ScoreNet yields high efficacy and
outperforms SOTA efficient transformers, namely TransPath and SwinTransformer.

Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and analyse its accuracy for the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one spatial dimension. The ground state
of this model has a non-trivial sign structure, especially for $J_2/J_1>0.5$,
forcing us to work with complex-valued RBMs. Two variational Ans\""atze are
discussed: one defined through a fully complex RBM, and one in which two
different real-valued networks are used to approximate modulus and phase of the
wave function. In both cases, translational invariance is imposed by
considering linear combinations of RBMs, giving access also to the
lowest-energy excitations at fixed momentum $k$. We perform a systematic study
on small clusters to evaluate the accuracy of these wave functions in
comparison to exact results, providing evidence for the supremacy of the fully
complex RBM. Our calculations show that this kind of Ans\""atze is very flexible
and describes both gapless and gapped ground states, also capturing the
incommensurate spin-spin correlations and low-energy spectrum for
$J_2/J_1>0.5$. The RBM results are also compared to the ones obtained with
Gutzwiller-projected fermionic states, often employed to describe quantum spin
models [F. Ferrari, A. Parola, S. Sorella and F. Becca, Phys. Rev. B 97, 235103

fully-connected structure of RBMs hampers the transferability of the wave
function from small to large clusters, implying an increase of the
computational cost with the system size.

larger Ohnesorge numbers than a Newtonian drop, when elasticity gives rise to
visible shape oscillations of the merged droplet. The numerical results show
that polymer chains are stretched during the coalescence and prior to the
departure of two drops, and the resulting elastic stresses at the interface
induce the jumping of the liquid out of the surface. This study shows that
viscoelasticity, typical of many biological and industrial applications,

w.r.t. a given closeness measure. Such sets are called granular approximations.
In this article, we introduce the concepts of disjoint and adjacent granules
and we examine how the new definitions affect the granular approximations.
First, we show that the new concepts are important for binary classification
problems since they help to keep decision regions separated (disjoint granules)
and at the same time to cover as much as possible of the attribute space
(adjacent granules). Later, we consider granular approximations for multi-class
classification problems leading to the definition of a multi-class granular
approximation. Finally, we show how to efficiently calculate multi-class
granular approximations for {\L}ukasiewicz fuzzy connectives. We also provide
graphical illustrations for a better understanding of the introduced concepts.

the leading jet, rapidity difference between the jets and the dijet invariant

heavy flavour dijets, measured recently for the first time individually for
both, charm and bottom flavours. We found that an agreement between the
predictions and the data within the full $k_T$-factorization is strongly
related to the modelling of the large-$x$ behaviour of the gluon uPDFs which is
usually not well constrained. The problem may be avoided following the hybrid
factorization approach. Then a good description of the measured distributions
is obtained with the Parton-Branching, the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin, the
Kutak-Sapeta and the Jung setA0 CCFM gluon uPDFs. We calculate also
differential distributions for the ratio of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ cross
sections. In all cases we obtain the ratio close to 1 which is caused by the
condition on minimal jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}} > 20$ GeV)
introduced in the experiment, that makes the role of heavy quark mass almost
negligible. The LHCb experimental ratio seems a bit larger. We discuss
potentially important for the ratio effect of $c$- or $b$-quark gluon radiative
corrections related to emission outside of the jet cone. The found effect seems
rather small. More refine calculation requires full simulation of $c$- and
$b$-jets which goes beyond of the scope of the present paper.

models for time series anomaly detection, trained by maximizing the observed
likelihood by posterior sampling and alternating back-propagation. A top-down
Convolution Network maps a novel hierarchical latent space to time series
windows, exploiting temporal dynamics to encode information efficiently.
Despite relying on posterior sampling, it is computationally more efficient
than current approaches, with up to 10x shorter training times than RNN based
models. Our method outperformed current state-of-the-art models on four popular
benchmark datasets. Finally, DGHL is robust to variable features between
entities and accurate even with large proportions of missing values, settings
with increasing relevance with the advent of IoT. We demonstrate the superior
robustness of DGHL with novel occlusion experiments in this literature. Our

this eigenvalue can be bounded by the first spectral gap of a linearized

Systematic diagnosis of fairness, harms, and biases of computer vision systems
is an important step towards building socially responsible systems. To initiate
an effort towards standardized fairness audits, we propose three fairness
indicators, which aim at quantifying harms and biases of visual systems. Our
indicators use existing publicly available datasets collected for fairness
evaluations, and focus on three main types of harms and bias identified in the
literature, namely harmful label associations, disparity in learned

structure formation consisting of large under/over-densities, and possibly the
formation of compact objects. Moreover, when confronting the same model to
multi-field inhomogeneous preinflation, the onset of inflation is shown to be a
robust outcome. At relatively large Higgs values, the non-minimal coupling acts
as a stabilizer, protecting the dynamics of the inflaton, and significantly
reducing the impact of perturbations in other fields and matter sectors. These
investigations further confirm the robustness of Higgs inflation to multi-field
inhomogeneous initial conditions, while putting in evidence the formation of
complex structures during the reheating.

and efficiently navigate among pedestrians, whose behavior may adapt to
environmental changes. This paper introduces a self-supervised continual
learning framework to improve data-driven pedestrian prediction models online
across various scenarios continuously. In particular, we exploit online streams
of pedestrian data, commonly available from the robot's detection and tracking
pipeline, to refine the prediction model and its performance in unseen
scenarios. To avoid the forgetting of previously learned concepts, a problem
known as catastrophic forgetting, our framework includes a regularization loss
to penalize changes of model parameters that are important for previous
scenarios and retrains on a set of previous examples to retain past knowledge.
Experimental results on real and simulation data show that our approach can
improve prediction performance in unseen scenarios while retaining knowledge
from seen scenarios when compared to naively training the prediction model
online.

spectrum and complement each other. When they are effectively combined, the
hybrid bootstrap enjoys the best of both worlds and the prediction for the
actual CFT can be significantly improved. In this work, we discuss the general
strategy to perform such a hybrid bootstrap, and we make a partial
implementation of the strategy for 3D Ising CFT $\{\sigma,\epsilon\}$ system.
Even at relatively low derivative order $\Lambda=19$, the hybrid bootstrap
predicts very precise values for the scaling dimension
$\Delta_\sigma,\Delta_\epsilon$ that are within the previous $\Lambda=43$

small resonating cavity weakly coupled to a large one, for small and
intermediate volumes (lengths). By defining N as the ratio of the length of the
large cavity over the small one, we study the symmetric case N=1, in which the
two cavities actually have the same length, as well as the cases N=2,3,4.
  By increasing N in the above range, the transition from a simple quantum
oscillating system to a system having a resonance spectrum is investigated. We
find that each resonant state is represented, at finite volume, by a cluster of
states, each one resonating in a specific coupling region, centered around a
state resonating at very small couplings.
  We derive high-energy expansions for the particle momenta in the above N
cases, which (approximately) resum their perturbative series to all orders in
the coupling among the cavities. These new expansions converge rather quickly
with the order, provide, surprisingly, a uniform approximation in the coupling
and also work, again surprisingly, at low energies.
  We construct a first resummation scheme having a clear physical picture,
which is based on a function-series expansion, as well as a second scheme based
on a recursion equation. The two schemes coincide at leading order, while they
differ from next-to-leading order on. In particular, the recursive scheme
realizes an approximate resummation of the function-series expansion generated
within the first scheme.

all-dielectric platform that features the photonic quantum spin Hall effect at
telecom wavelengths and supports helical edge states that are weakly coupled to
the radiation continuum. The modes of resonators scaling down to single point
defects in the surrounding bulk lattice are characterized via spectral position
and multipolar nature of the eigenstates. The mode profiles in real and
momentum space are mapped using far field imaging and Fourier
spectropolarimetry, revealing how certain properties of the cavity modes
reflect on their origin in the topological bandstructure. This includes
band-inversion-induced confinement and inverted scaling of mode spectra for
trivial and topological defect cavities. Furthermore, hallmarks of topological
protection in the loss rates are demonstrated, which are largely unaffected by
cavity shape and size. The results constitute an important step toward the use
of radiative topological cavities for on-chip confinement of light, control of

large angular momentum, and can be computed by evaluating Green's functions on
the worldsheet. We derive a representation of the Green's functions in terms of
a sum over residues in the complexified Fourier space, and show that it gives
rise to the conformal block expansion in the heavy-light channel. This allows
us to extract the scaling dimensions and structure constants for an infinite
tower of non-protected dCFT operators. We also find a close connection between
our results and the semi-classical integrability of the string sigma model. The
series of poles of the Green's functions in Fourier space corresponds to points
on the spectral curve where the so-called quasi-momentum satisfies a
quantization condition, and both the scaling dimensions and the structure
constants in the heavy-light channel take simple forms when written in terms of
the spectral curve. These observations suggest extensions of the results by
Gromov, Schafer-Nameki and Vieira on the semiclassical energy of closed
strings, and in particular hint at the possibility of determining the structure
constants directly from the spectral curve.

one of the most destructive types of noise affecting superconducting qubits.
Previous approaches to suppressing $ZZ$ crosstalk have mainly relied on
specific chip design that can complicate chip fabrication and aggravate
decoherence. To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on
pulse optimization to suppress $ZZ$ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are
non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the
number of qubits involved. To address the above problems, we propose a scalable
approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an
ability to suppress $ZZ$ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design
scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across
the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not
require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a
general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods.
We have conducted extensive evaluations by simulation and on a real quantum
computer. Simulation results show that our proposal can improve the fidelity of
quantum computing on $4{\sim}12$ qubits by up to $81\times$ ($11\times$ on
average). Ramsey experiments on a real quantum computer also demonstrate that
our method can eliminate the effect of $ZZ$ crosstalk to a great extent.

evolution of BBHs interacting with the disc gas, we perform a suite of
high-resolution 2D simulations of binaries in local disc (shearing-box) models,
considering various binary mass ratios, eccentricities and background disc
properties. We use the $\gamma$-law equation of state and adopt a robust
post-processing treatment to evaluate the mass accretion rate, torque and
energy transfer rate on the binary to determine its long-term orbital
evolution. We find that circular comparable-mass binaries contract, with an
orbital decay rate of a few times the mass doubling rate. Eccentric binaries
always experience eccentricity damping. Prograde binaries with higher
eccentricities or smaller mass ratios generally have slower orbital decay
rates, with some extreme cases exhibiting orbital expansion. The averaged
binary mass accretion rate depends on the physical size of the accretor. The
accretion flows are highly variable, and the dominant variability frequency is
the apparent binary orbital frequency (in the rotating frame around the central
massive BH) for circular binaries but gradually shifts to the radial epicyclic
frequency as the binary eccentricity increases. Our findings demonstrate that
the dynamics of BBHs embedded in AGN discs is quite different from that of
isolated binaries in their own circumbinary discs. Furthermore, our results
suggest that the hardening timescales of the binaries are much shorter than
their migration timescales in the disc, for all reasonable binary and disc

states, where coexisting quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) and conventional
higher-dimensional energy bands take part in the creation of the aggregate
superconducting condensate. When the chemical potential approaches the edge of
a Q1D band in a single-band superconductor, the corresponding mean-field
critical temperature increases significantly but the superconductivity is
quenched by fluctuations. However, recent investigation has revealed that when
a Q1D band is coupled to a higher dimensional one by the interband Cooper-pair
transfer, the thermal superconductive fluctuations can be suppressed so that
the resulting critical temperature can be close to its mean-field value. In the
present work, we calculate the mean-field T_c0 and fluctuation-shifted T_c
critical temperatures for a two-band superconductor where a Q1D band coexists
with a higher-dimensional band, and investigate how the thermal fluctuations
are sensitive to the system parameters. We find that T_c is close to T_c0 in a
wide range of microscopic parameters, and even the dimensionality of the
higher-dimensional band does not play an essential role. Thus, the screening
mechanism for suppressing fluctuations via the pair-exchange coupling between
the bands is indeed relevant for a large class of Q1D multiband superconducting
materials, encouraging further experiments aimed at reaching larger critical
temperatures in such multiband superconductors.

their correlations determine or reflect, respectively, the functionality of and
the dynamics on the network. These correlations are time-dependent as the
dynamics on the network is highly non-stationary. Apart from the conceptual
importance, correlations are also indispensable to detect risks of failure in a
traffic network. Here, we proceed with revealing a certain hierarchy of
correlations in traffic networks that is due to the presence and to the extent
of collectivity. In a previous study, we focused on the collectivity motion
present in the entire traffic network, i.e. the collectivity of the system as a
whole. Here, we manage to subtract this dominant effect from the data and
identify the subdominant collectivities which affect different, large parts of
the traffic network. To this end, we employ a spectral analysis of the
correlation matrix for the whole system. We thereby extract information from
the virtual network induced by the correlations and map it on the true

collectivities provide a new characterization of the traffic network. We carry

training data, and when prompted appropriately, they will emit the memorized
training data verbatim. This is undesirable because memorization violates
privacy (exposing user data), degrades utility (repeated easy-to-memorize text
is often low quality), and hurts fairness (some texts are memorized over
others).
  We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which
LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we
increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has
been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the
model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes more complicated when
generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that

TKGs represent facts about entities and their relations, where each fact is

from time-evolving KGs, is crucial for many applications to provide intelligent
services. However, despite the prevalence of real-world data that can be
represented as TKGs, most methods focus on reasoning over static knowledge
graphs, or cannot predict future events. In this paper, we present a problem
formulation that unifies the two major problems that need to be addressed for
an effective reasoning over TKGs, namely, modeling the event time and the
evolving network structure. Our proposed method EvoKG jointly models both tasks
in an effective framework, which captures the ever-changing structural and
temporal dynamics in TKGs via recurrent event modeling, and models the
interactions between entities based on the temporal neighborhood aggregation
framework. Further, EvoKG achieves an accurate modeling of event time, using
flexible and efficient mechanisms based on neural density estimation.
Experiments show that EvoKG outperforms existing methods in terms of
effectiveness (up to 77% and 116% more accurate time and link prediction) and
efficiency.

to output a precise set of promising prediction candidates with a bounded
number of incorrect answers. Standard conformal prediction provides the ability
to adapt to model uncertainty by constructing a calibrated candidate set in
place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct
answer with high probability. In order to obey this coverage property, however,
conformal sets can become inundated with noisy candidates -- which can render
them unhelpful in practice. This is particularly relevant to practical
applications where there is a limited budget, and the cost (monetary or
otherwise) associated with false positives is non-negligible. We propose to
trade coverage for a notion of precision by enforcing that the presence of
incorrect candidates in the predicted conformal sets (i.e., the total number of
false positives) is bounded according to a user-specified tolerance. Subject to
this constraint, our algorithm then optimizes for a generalized notion of set
coverage (i.e., the true positive rate) that allows for any number of true
answers for a given query (including zero). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach across a number of classification tasks in natural language

against manually annotated finite sets of one or more answers. This leads to a
coverage limitation that results in underestimating the true performance of
systems, and is typically addressed by extending over exact match (EM) with
pre-defined rules or with the token-level F1 measure. In this paper, we present
the first systematic conceptual and data-driven analysis to examine the
shortcomings of token-level equivalence measures.
  To this end, we define the asymmetric notion of answer equivalence (AE),
accepting answers that are equivalent to or improve over the reference, and
publish over 23k human judgments for candidates produced by multiple QA systems
on SQuAD. Through a careful analysis of this data, we reveal and quantify
several concrete limitations of the F1 measure, such as a false impression of
graduality, or missing dependence on the question.
  Since collecting AE annotations for each evaluated model is expensive, we
learn a BERT matching (BEM) measure to approximate this task. Being a simpler
task than QA, we find BEM to provide significantly better AE approximations
than F1, and to more accurately reflect the performance of systems.
  Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of AE and BEM on the concrete

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices cross-linked via a single site. The
coupling site functions as a defect with protected states in the trivial regime
and also induces edges inside the bulk with protected localized states centered
around it in the topological regime. When more than two lattices are coupled by
the defect, namely, a graph-dimensionality larger than one, the crossed chains
support two types of localized eigenstates around the defect. One type is
highly controllable by modifying the cross-linking strength, enabling broad
tuning of eigenenergies from being submerged in the bulk band to becoming
highly isolated and protected. We show that these unique features can be
explained by an equivalence of the aforementioned system to an SSH chain
coupled nonreciprocally to an external reservoir, yielding a unique
pseudospectrum for both the bulk and localized states, with spatially symmetric
eigenstates. Applying non-Hermiticity by adding gain and loss to alternating

in the interior of the system, harbor a novel phenomenon, the \emph{inner skin

by implementing prominent models for NH insulators and superconductors on
representative planar Sierpinski carpet fractal lattices. They accommodate both
first-order and second-order ISEs at inner edges and corners, respectively, for
charged as well as neutral Majorana fermions. Furthermore, over extended
parameter regimes ISEs are tied with nontrivial bulk topological invariants,
yielding intrinsic ISEs. With the recent success in engineering NH topological
phases on highly tunable metamaterial platforms, such as photonic and phononic

ancient merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, estimated to have occurred ~8 Gyr ago.
Follow-up studies have associated GSE with a large-scale tilt in the stellar
halo that links two well-known stellar over-densities in diagonally opposing
octants of the Galaxy (the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Overdensity; HAC and
VOD). In this paper, we study the plausibility of such unmixed merger debris
persisting over several Gyr in the Galactic halo. We employ the simulated
stellar halo from Naidu et al. (2021), which reproduces several key properties
of the merger remnant, including the large-scale tilt. By integrating the
orbits of these simulated stellar halo particles, we show that adoption of a
spherical halo potential results in rapid phase mixing of the asymmetry.
However, adopting a tilted halo potential preserves the initial asymmetry in
the stellar halo for many Gyr. The asymmetry is preserved even when a realistic
growing disk is added to the potential. These results suggest that HAC and VOD
are long-lived structures that are associated with GSE and that the dark matter
halo of the Galaxy is tilted with respect to the disk and aligned in the
direction of HAC-VOD. Such halo-disk misalignment is common in modern
cosmological simulations. Lastly, we study the relationship between the local
and global stellar halo in light of a tilted global halo comprised of highly
radial orbits. We find that the local halo offers a dynamically biased view of
the global halo due to its displacement from the Galactic Center.

process that shapes the geometry of stellar orbits in nuclear star clusters.
This leads to the realignment of the orbital planes on the corresponding VRR
time scale $t_{\rm VRR}$ of a few million years, while the eccentricity $e$ and
semimajor axis $a$ of the individual orbits are approximately conserved. The
distribution of orbital inclinations reaches an internal equilibrium
characterised by two conserved quantities, the total potential energy among
stellar orbits, $E_{\rm tot}$, and the total angular momentum, $L_{\rm tot}$.
On timescales longer than $t_\mathrm{VRR}$, the eccentricities and semimajor
axes change slowly and the distribution of orbital inclinations are expected to
evolve through a series of VRR equilibria. Using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain
method, we determine the equilibrium distribution of orbital inclinations in
the microcanonical ensemble with fixed $E_{\rm tot}$ and $L_{\rm tot}$ for
isolated nuclear star clusters with a power-law distribution of $a$, $e$, and
$m$, where $m$ is the stellar mass. We explore the possible equilibria for $9$

segregation where the distribution of more massive objects is more flattened

the ALMA REBELS LP to derive their physical properties. Our model uses three
input data: (a) the UV spectral slope, $\beta$, (b) the observed UV continuum
flux at $1500$A, $F_{\rm UV}$, (c) the observed continuum flux at $\approx
158\mu$m, $F_{158}$, and considers Milky Way (MW) and SMC extinction curves,
along with different dust geometries. We find that REBELS galaxies have
(28-90.5)% of their star formation obscured; the total (UV+IR) star formation
rates are in the range $31.5 < {\rm SFR}/ (M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}) < 129.5$. The
sample-averaged dust mass and temperature are $(1.3\pm 1.1)\times 10^7 M_\odot$
and $52 \pm 11$ K, respectively. In some galaxies dust is abundant (REBELS-14,
$M'_d \approx 3.4 \times 10^7 M_\odot$), or hot (REBELS-18, $T'_d \approx 67$
K). The dust distribution is compact ($<0.3$ kpc for 70% of the galaxies). The
dust yield per supernova is $0.1 \le y_d/M_\odot \le 3.3$, with 70% of the
galaxies requiring $y_d < 0.25 M_\odot$. Three galaxies (REBELS-12, 14, 39)
require $y_d > 1 M_\odot$. With the SFR predicted by the model and a MW
extinction curve, REBELS galaxies detected in [CII] nicely follow the local
$L_{\rm CII}-$SFR relation, and are approximately located on the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The sample-averaged gas depletion time is of
$0.11\, y_P^{-2}$ Gyr, where $y_P$ is the ratio of the gas-to-stellar
distribution radius. For some systems a solution simultaneously matching the
observed ($\beta, F_{\rm UV}, F_{158}$) values cannot be found. This occurs
when the index $I_m = (F_{158}/F_{\rm UV})/(\beta-\beta_{\rm int})$, where
$\beta_{\rm int}$ is the intrinsic UV slope, exceeds $I_m^*\approx 1120$ for a
MW curve. For these objects we argue that the FIR and UV emitting regions are
not co-spatial, questioning the use of the IRX-$\beta$ relation.

full disruptions by supermassive black hole binaries can be enhanced by up to a
factor of $40-50$ or suppressed by up to a factor of $10$, relative to that by
single black holes, depending on the binary parameters. Relativistic effects
are not important for the primary black hole mass $\leq 10^{7}M_{\odot}$, but
can provide an additional enhancement of the full disruption probability by
less than a factor of $2-3$ for higher primary black hole masses. We provide a
fitting formula for the full disruption probability by the hard supermassive

that partial disruption events can occur multiple times before full disruptions

disruption events by a factor of three. Because partial disruption events can
induce stellar spins and mass loss and change the orbits, it can significantly
affect the overall full disruption event rate and the shape of the light

illustrative because its surface and bulk dissipative behavior are linked due
to its non-trivial topology, which manifests in directional amplification.

miscalibrated class probabilities. In high-risk applications like healthcare,
practitioners require $\textit{fully calibrated}$ probability predictions for
decision-making. That is, conditioned on the prediction $\textit{vector}$,
$\textit{every}$ class' probability should be close to the predicted value.
Most existing calibration methods either lack theoretical guarantees for
producing calibrated outputs, reduce classification accuracy in the process, or
only calibrate the predicted class. This paper proposes a new Kernel-based
calibration method called KCal. Unlike existing calibration procedures, KCal
does not operate directly on the logits or softmax outputs of the DNN. Instead,
KCal learns a metric space on the penultimate-layer latent embedding and
generates predictions using kernel density estimates on a calibration set. We
first analyze KCal theoretically, showing that it enjoys a provable
$\textit{full}$ calibration guarantee. Then, through extensive experiments
across a variety of datasets, we show that KCal consistently outperforms
baselines as measured by the calibration error and by proper scoring rules like

large-scale structure. However, the present-day matter distribution is highly
non-Gaussian and significant cosmological information is also contained in
higher-order correlation functions. Meanwhile, baryon physics (particularly AGN
feedback) has previously been shown to strongly affect the two-point statistics
but there has been limited exploration of its effects on higher-order functions
to date. Here we use the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations to explore the effects of baryon physics and massive neutrinos on
the halo bispectrum. In contrast to matter clustering which is suppressed by
baryon physics, we find that the halo clustering is typically enhanced. The
strength of the effect and the scale over which it extends depends on how
haloes are selected. On small scales (k > 1 $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, dominated by
satellites of groups/clusters), we find that the bispectrum is highly sensitive
to the efficiency of star formation and feedback, making it an excellent
testing ground for galaxy formation models. We show that the effects of
feedback and the effects of massive neutrinos are largely separable
(independent of each other) and that massive neutrinos strongly suppress the
halo bispectrum on virtually all scales up to the free-streaming length (apart
from the smallest scales, where baryon physics dominates). The strong
sensitivity of the bispectrum to neutrinos on the largest scales and galaxy
formation physics on the smallest scales bodes well for upcoming precision
measurements from the next generation of wide-field surveys.

companion star is accreted on a white dwarf (WD). Accumulation of hydrogen in a
layer eventually causes a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the WD,
brightening the WD to ~10^5 solar luminosities and triggering ejection of the
accumulated matter.They provide extreme conditions required to accelerate
particles, electrons or protons, to high energies. Here we present the
detection of gamma rays by the MAGIC telescopes from the 2021 outburst of RS
Ophiuchi (RS Oph), a recurrent nova with a red giant (RG) companion, that
allowed us, for the first time, to accurately characterize the emission from a
nova in the 60 GeV to 250 GeV energy range. The theoretical interpretation of
the combined Fermi-LAT and MAGIC data suggests that protons are accelerated to
hundreds of GeV in the nova shock. Such protons should create bubbles of
enhanced Cosmic Ray density, on the order of 10 pc, from the recurrent novae.

for use cases including translating code between programming languages,
creating documentation from code, and auto-completing methods. Yet,
state-of-the-art models often produce code that is erroneous or incomplete. In
a controlled study with 32 software engineers, we examined whether such
imperfect outputs are helpful in the context of Java-to-Python code
translation. When aided by the outputs of a code translation model,
participants produced code with fewer errors than when working alone. We also
examined how the quality and quantity of AI translations affected the work
process and quality of outcomes, and observed that providing multiple
translations had a larger impact on the translation process than varying the
quality of provided translations. Our results tell a complex, nuanced story
about the benefits of generative code models and the challenges software
engineers face when working with their outputs. Our work motivates the need for
intelligent user interfaces that help software engineers effectively work with
generative code models in order to understand and evaluate their outputs and
achieve superior outcomes to working alone.

spectrum of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian constructed from a bosonic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian in general even though the system is
essentially Hermitian. In other words, two types of non-Hermiticity can
coexist: one from the bosonic BdG nature and the other from the open quantum
nature. In this paper, we propose boundary-dependent dynamical instability. We
first define the bosonic dissipative BdG Hamiltonian in terms of Green's
function in Nambu space and discuss the correct particle-hole symmetry of the
corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We then construct a model of the
boundary-dependent dynamical instability so that it satisfies the correct
particle-hole symmetry. In this model, an anomalous term that breaks the
particle number conservation represents the non-Hermiticity of the BdG nature,
while a normal term is given by a dissipative Hatano-Nelson model. Thanks to
the competition between the two types of non-Hermiticity, the imaginary part of
the spectrum can be positive without the help of the amplification of the
normal part and the particle-hole band touching that causes the Landau
instability. This leads to the boundary-dependent dynamical instability under
the non-Hermitian skin effect, -strong dependence of spectra on boundary
conditions for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians-, of the Bogoliubov spectrum.

accretion onto the newly born neutron star. In cases of weak jets, a total
power of 10^45-10^46 erg, the backflow mass accretion might power up to an
order of magnitude more energetic jets. In total, the jets of the two
post-explosion jet-launching episodes have enough energy to influence the
morphology of the very inner ejecta, a mass of 0.1 M_O. Our results imply that
in some, probably a minority of, CCSN remnants the very inner regions might
display a bipolar structure that results from post-explosion weak jets. The
regions outside this part might display the morphology of jittering jets.

gravitational lensing and present 41 (0.14 deg$^{-2}$) candidate lensed systems

is key to limiting global warming. Regulators and standards bodies have made a
start by requiring some carbon-related disclosures and proposing others. Here
we go further and propose a Carbon Equivalence Principle: all financial
products shall contain a description of the equivalent carbon flows from
greenhouse gases that the products enable, as well as their existing
description in terms of cash flows. This description of the carbon flows
enabled by the project shall be compatible with existing bank systems that
track cashflows so that carbon flows have equal standing to cash flows. We
demonstrate that this transparency alone can align incentives by applying it to
project finance examples for power generation and by following through the
financial analysis. The financial requirements to offset costs of carbon flows
enabled in the future radically change project costs, and risk that assets
become stranded, thus further increasing costs. This observation holds
whichever partner in the project bears the enabled-carbon costs. Mitigating
these risks requires project re-structuring to include negative emissions
technologies. We also consider that sequestered carbon needs to remain
sequestered permanently, e.g., for at least one hundred years. We introduce
mixed financial-physical solutions to minimise this permanence cost, and price
to them. This complements previous insurance-based proposals with lesser scope.
For financial viability we introduce project designs that are financially
net-zero, and as a consequence are carbon negative. Thus we see that adoption
of the Carbon Equivalence Principle for financial products aligns incentives,
requires product redesign, and is simply good financial management driving
sustainability.

of single server private information retrieval with private coded side

goal of PIR-PCSI is to allow a user to efficiently retrieve a desired message
$\bm{W}_{\bm{\theta}}$, which is one of $K$ independent messages that are
stored at a server, while utilizing private side information of a linear
combination of a uniformly chosen size-$M$ subset
($\bm{\mathcal{S}}\subset[K]$) of messages. The settings PIR-PCSI-I and
PIR-PCSI-II correspond to the constraints that $\bm{\theta}$ is generated
uniformly from $[K]\setminus\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, and $\bm{\mathcal{S}}$,
respectively. In each case, $(\bm{\theta},\bm{\mathcal{S}})$ must be kept
private from the server. The capacity is defined as the supremum over message
and field sizes, of achievable rates (number of bits of desired message

PIR-PCSI-I in general, and for PIR-PCSI-II for $M>(K+1)/2$ as $(K-M+1)^{-1}$.
For $2\leq M\leq (K+1)/2$ the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II remains open, and it is
conjectured that even in this case the capacity is $(K-M+1)^{-1}$. We show the
capacity of PIR-PCSI-II is equal to $2/K$ for $2 \leq M \leq \frac{K+1}{2}$,
which is strictly larger than the conjectured value, and does not depend on $M$
within this parameter regime. Remarkably, half the side-information is found to
be redundant. We also characterize the infimum capacity (infimum over fields
instead of supremum), and the capacity with private coefficients. The results
are generalized to PIR-PCSI-I ($\theta\in[K]\setminus\mathcal{S}$) and PIR-PCSI
($\theta\in[K]$) settings.

theorems about pseudohalfplanes.
  Here we continue this line of research and introduce the notion of convex

results corresponding to classical results about convexity, namely Helly's
Theorem, Carath\'eodory's Theorem, Kirchberger's Theorem, Separation Theorem,
Radon's Theorem and the Cup-Cap Theorem. These results imply the respective
results about pseudoconvex sets in the plane defined using pseudohalfplanes.
  It turns out that most of our results can be also proved using oriented
matroids and topological affine planes (TAPs) but our approach is different
from both of them. Compared to oriented matroids, our theory is based on a
linear ordering of the vertex set which makes our definitions and proofs quite
different and perhaps more elementary. Compared to TAPs, which are continuous
objects, our proofs are purely combinatorial and again quite different in
flavor. Altogether, we believe that our new approach can further our
understanding of these fundamental convexity results.

of a balanced Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with spherical
covariance matrix $\sigma^2\mathbf{I}$. In particular, we are interested in the
following question: what is the maximal noise level $\sigma^2$, for which the
sample complexity is essentially the same as when estimating the centers from
labeled measurements? To that end, we restrict attention to a Bayesian
formulation of the problem, where the centers are uniformly distributed on the
sphere $\sqrt{d}\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. Our main results characterize the exact
noise threshold $\sigma^2$ below which the GMM learning problem, in the large
system limit $d,k\to\infty$, is as easy as learning from labeled observations,
and above which it is substantially harder. The threshold occurs at $\frac{\log
k}{d} = \frac12\log\left( 1+\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \right)$, which is the capacity
of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Thinking of the set of $k$
centers as a code, this noise threshold can be interpreted as the largest noise
level for which the error probability of the code over the AWGN channel is
small. Previous works on the GMM learning problem have identified the minimum
distance between the centers as a key parameter in determining the statistical
difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM. While our results are only proved
for GMMs whose centers are uniformly distributed over the sphere, they hint
that perhaps it is the decoding error probability associated with the center
constellation as a channel code that determines the statistical difficulty of
learning the corresponding GMM, rather than just the minimum distance.

time-reversal symmetry breaking charge order. Remarkably, the superconducting
state displays nodal energy gap and a reduced superfluid density, which can be
attributed to the competition with the novel charge order. Upon applying
pressure, the charge-order transitions are suppressed, the superfluid density
increases, and the superconducting state progressively evolves from nodal to
nodeless. Once charge order is eliminated, we find a superconducting pairing
state that is not only fully gapped, but also spontaneously breaks
time-reversal symmetry. Our results point to unprecedented tunable nodal kagome
superconductivity competing with time-reversal symmetry-breaking charge order

build up a new theoretical foundation for combinatorial decomposition
strategies and combinatorial specifications.
  We then apply Combinatorial Exploration to the domain of permutation
patterns, to great effect. We rederive hundreds of results in the literature in
a uniform manner and prove many new ones. These results can be found in a new
public database, the Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL) at

showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the
domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions.

often lack access to key information on which these predictions may hinge, such

addresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive model
as stochastic hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using
information gathered during system operation. While able to optimally and
automatically trade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is
computationally intractable for general interactive motion planning, mainly due
to the fundamental coupling between robot trajectory optimization and human

enable active uncertainty reduction for interactive motion planning based on
the implicit dual control paradigm. Our approach relies on sampling-based
approximation of stochastic dynamic programming, leading to a model predictive
control problem that can be readily solved by real-time gradient-based
optimization methods. The resulting policy is shown to preserve the dual

demonstrated with simulated driving examples.

lower the stage's structural resonance frequencies, making the hardware

simple proof that the (approximate, decisional) Shortest Vector Problem is
$\NP$-hard under a randomized reduction. Specifically, we show that for any $p
\geq 1$ and any constant $\gamma < 2^{1/p}$, the $\gamma$-approximate problem
in the $\ell_p$ norm ($\gamma$-$\GapSVP_p$) is not in $\mathsf{RP}$ unless $\NP
\subseteq \mathsf{RP}$. Our proof follows an approach pioneered by Ajtai (STOC
1998), and strengthened by Micciancio (FOCS 1998 and SICOMP 2000), for showing
hardness of $\gamma$-$\GapSVP_p$ using locally dense lattices. We construct
such lattices simply by applying ""Construction A"" to Reed-Solomon codes with
suitable parameters, and prove their local density via an elementary argument
originally used in the context of Craig lattices.
  As in all known $\NP$-hardness results for $\GapSVP_p$ with $p < \infty$, our
reduction uses randomness. Indeed, it is a notorious open problem to prove
$\NP$-hardness via a deterministic reduction. To this end, we additionally
discuss potential directions and associated challenges for derandomizing our
reduction. In particular, we show that a close deterministic analogue of our
local density construction would improve on the state-of-the-art explicit
Reed-Solomon list-decoding lower bounds of Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2005 and
IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2006).
  As a related contribution of independent interest, we also give a
polynomial-time algorithm for decoding $n$-dimensional ""Construction A
Reed-Solomon lattices"" (with different parameters than those used in our
hardness proof) to a distance within an $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ factor of
Minkowski's bound. This asymptotically matches the best known distance for
decoding near Minkowski's bound, due to Mook and Peikert (IEEE Trans. Inf.

another, primarily due to the uneven thickness of the ice layer. This contrast
variation can affect the quality of 2-D class averaging, 3-D ab-initio
modeling, and 3-D heterogeneity analysis. Contrast estimation is currently
performed during 3-D iterative refinement. As a result, the estimates are not
available at the earlier computational stages of class averaging and ab-initio
modeling. This paper aims to solve the contrast estimation problem directly
from the picked particle images in the ab-initio stage, without estimating the
3-D volume, image rotations, or class averages.
  Methods: The key observation underlying our analysis is that the 2-D
covariance matrix of the raw images is related to the covariance of the
underlying clean images, the noise variance, and the contrast variability
between images. We show that the contrast variability can be derived from the
2-D covariance matrix and we apply the existing Covariance Wiener Filtering
(CWF) framework to estimate it. We also demonstrate a modification of CWF to
estimate the contrast of individual images.
  Results: Our method improves the contrast estimation by a large margin,
compared to the previous CWF method. Its estimation accuracy is often
comparable to that of an oracle that knows the ground truth covariance of the
clean images. The more accurate contrast estimation also improves the quality
of image restoration as demonstrated in both synthetic and experimental
datasets.
  Conclusions: This paper proposes an effective method for contrast estimation
directly from noisy images without using any 3-D volume information. It enables
contrast correction in the earlier stage of single particle analysis, and may
improve the accuracy of downstream processing.

families of graphs whose expected number of faces is $\Theta(n)$, none are
known where the expected number would be super-linear. This lead to the
conjecture that there is a linear upper bound. In this note we confirm the
conjecture by proving that for any $n$-vertex multigraph, the expected number
of faces in a random 2-cell embedding is at most $n(1+H_m)$, where $m$ is the
maximum edge-multiplicity and $H_m$ denotes the $m$th harmonic number. This

Classic neural field theories are derived from highly simplified models of
individual neurons, while biological neurons are highly complex cells.
Integrate-and-fire neuron models balance biophysical detail and analytical
tractability. Here, we develop a statistical field theory for networks of
integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission. This reveals an
exact mapping to a self-consistent renewal process and a new mean field theory
for the activity in these networks. The mean field theory has a rate-dependent
leak, approximating the spike-driven resets of the membrane voltage. This gives
rise to bistability between quiescent and active states in homogenous and
excitatory-inhibitory pulse-coupled networks. The field-theoretic framework
also exposes fluctuation corrections to the mean field theory. We find that due
to the spike reset, fluctuations suppress activity. We then examine the roles
of spike resets and recurrent inhibition in stabilizing network activity. We
calculate the phase diagram for inhibitory stabilization and find that an
inhibition-stabilized regime occurs in wide regions of parameter space,
consistent with experimental reports of inhibitory stabilization in diverse
brain regions. Fluctuations narrow the region of inhibitory stabilization,
consistent with their role in suppressing activity through spike resets.

targets being observed. However, the measured signal is neither a weighted-sum
of basis functions (such as principal components) nor one of a set of
prototypes (K-means), which has motivated the novel clustering method proposed
here. Signals are clustered based on their shape, but not amplitude, via
angular distance and centroids are calculated as the direction of maximal
intra-cluster variance, resulting in a clustering algorithm capable of learning
centroids (signal shapes) that are related to the underlying, albeit unknown,
target characteristics in a scalable and noise-robust manner.

which is extremely challenging due to the difference of both images. Here, we
show an unsupervised image-to-image translation network that significantly

optimisation-based regression network, applicable to autofluorescence lifetime
images at different emission wavelengths. A preliminary blind comparison by
experienced researchers shows the superiority of our method on co-registration.
The results also indicate that the approach is applicable to various image
formats, like fluorescence intensity images. With the registration, stitching
outcomes illustrate the distinct differences of the spectral lifetime across an
unstained tissue, enabling macro-level rapid visual identification of lung

volume, Federated Learning(FL) has become an important learning paradigm.
However, jointly learning a deep neural network model in a FL setting proves to
be a non-trivial task because of the complexities associated with the neural
networks, such as varied architectures across clients, permutation invariance
of the neurons, and presence of non-linear transformations in each layer. This
work introduces a novel Federated Heterogeneous Neural Networks (FedHeNN)
framework that allows each client to build a personalised model without
enforcing a common architecture across clients. This allows each client to
optimize with respect to local data and compute constraints, while still
benefiting from the learnings of other (potentially more powerful) clients. The
key idea of FedHeNN is to use the instance-level representations obtained from
peer clients to guide the simultaneous training on each client. The extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the FedHeNN framework is capable of
learning better performing models on clients in both the settings of
homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures across clients.

shield from detection using modest amounts of high-Z material. In contrast,
fast-neutrons are much more penetrating and can escape relatively thick high-Z
shielding without losing significant energy. Furthermore, fast neutrons provide
a clear and unambiguous signature of the presence of SNM with few competing
natural background sources. The challenge of detecting fast neutrons is
twofold. First, the neutron flux from SNM are only a fraction of the
corresponding gamma-ray flux. Second, fast neutrons can be difficult to
differentiate from gamma rays. The ability to discriminate gamma rays from
neutrons combined with neutron imaging can yield large benefit to isolate the
localized SNM neutron source from background. With the recent developments of
pulse-shape-sensitive plastic scintillators that offer excellent
gamma-ray/neutron discrimination, and arrays of silicon photomultipliers
combined with highly scalable and fast positron-emission-tomography (PET)
multi-channel readout systems, field-deployable neutron imagers suitable for
SNM detection might now be within reach. In this paper, we present a
characterization of the performance of a recently available commercial
PET-scanner readout, including its sensitivity to pulse-shape differences
between fast neutrons and gamma rays, energy and timing resolution, as well as
linearity and dynamic range. We find that, while the pulse-shape discrimination
is achievable with stilbene, further improvement of the readout is required to
achieve it with the best available plastic scintillators. The time and energy
resolution appear to be adequate for neutron imaging in some circumstances.

Global Forecasting Models (GFM) trained across time series have shown superior
results in many demand forecasting competitions and real-world applications
recently, compared with univariate forecasting approaches. We aim to fill the
gap between the accuracy and the interpretability in global forecasting
approaches. In order to explain the global model forecasts, we propose Local
Interpretable Model-agnostic Rule-based Explanations for Forecasting (LIMREF),
a local explainer framework that produces k-optimal impact rules for a
particular forecast, considering the global forecasting model as a black-box
model, in a model-agnostic way. It provides different types of rules that
explain the forecast of the global model and the counterfactual rules, which
provide actionable insights for potential changes to obtain different outputs
for given instances. We conduct experiments using a large-scale electricity
demand dataset with exogenous features such as temperature and calendar
effects. Here, we evaluate the quality of the explanations produced by the
LIMREF framework in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects such as
accuracy, fidelity, and comprehensibility and benchmark those against other
local explainers.

of random coefficients, we prove a stochastic maximum principle (SMP), which
also holds for utility functions $U$ with $\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^{+}} \cdot
U'$ being not necessarily nonincreasing, like the power utility functions,
thereby generalizing the SMP proved by Li and Zheng (2018). We use this SMP
together with the strong duality property for defining a new algorithm, which
we call deep primal SMP algorithm. Numerical examples illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm - in particular for higher-dimensional
problems and problems with random coefficients, which are either path dependent
or satisfy their own SDEs. Moreover, our numerical experiments for constrained
problems show that the novel deep primal SMP algorithm overcomes the deep SMP
algorithm's (see Davey and Zheng (2021)) weakness of erroneously producing the
value of the corresponding unconstrained problem. Furthermore, in contrast to
the deep controlled 2BSDE algorithm from Davey and Zheng (2021), this algorithm
is also applicable to problems with path dependent coefficients. As the deep
primal SMP algorithm even yields the most accurate results in many of our
studied problems, we can highly recommend its usage. Moreover, we propose a
learning procedure based on epochs which improved the results of our algorithm
even further. Implementing a semi-recurrent network architecture for the

intervention strategy in an infinite-dimensional space of controls containing
multiple consecutive lockdowns, gradually imposed and lifted restrictions, and
various heuristic controls based for example on tracking the effective

in aerospace and vehicular communication, localization and radar. In this
paper, we consider a challenging multi-source DOA estimation task, where the
receiving antenna array is composed of non-coherent sub-arrays, i.e.,
sub-arrays that observe different unknown phase shifts at every snapshot (e.g.,
due to waiving the demanding synchronization of local oscillators across the
entire array). We formulate this problem as the reconstruction of joint sparse
and low-rank matrices, and solve the problem's convex relaxation. To scale the
optimization complexity with the number of snapshots better than
general-purpose solvers, we design an optimization scheme, based on integrating
the alternating direction method of multipliers and the accelerated proximal
gradient techniques, that exploits the structure of the problem. While the DOAs
can be estimated from the solution of the aforementioned convex problem, we
further show how an improvement is obtained if, instead, one estimates from
this solution only the sub-arrays' phase shifts. This is done using another,
computationally-light, convex relaxation that is practically tight. Using the
estimated phase shifts, ""phase-corrected"" observations are created and a final
plain (""coherent"") DOA estimation method can be applied. Numerical experiments
show the performance advantages of the proposed strategies over existing

capable, general purpose, generative models such as GPT-3, Megatron-Turing NLG,

property of such models and discuss the policy implications of this property.
Namely, these generative models have an unusual combination of predictable loss
on a broad training distribution (as embodied in their ""scaling laws""), and
unpredictable specific capabilities, inputs, and outputs. We believe that the
high-level predictability and appearance of useful capabilities drives rapid
development of such models, while the unpredictable qualities make it difficult
to anticipate the consequences of model deployment. We go through examples of
how this combination can lead to socially harmful behavior with examples from
the literature and real world observations, and we also perform two novel
experiments to illustrate our point about harms from unpredictability.
Furthermore, we analyze how these conflicting properties combine to give model
developers various motivations for deploying these models, and challenges that
can hinder deployment. We conclude with a list of possible interventions the AI
community may take to increase the chance of these models having a beneficial
impact. We intend this paper to be useful to policymakers who want to
understand and regulate AI systems, technologists who care about the potential
policy impact of their work, and academics who want to analyze, critique, and
potentially develop large generative models.

the attention to anomaly detection tasks is far from sufficient. Considering
that many anomaly detection tasks are life-changing tasks involving human

cautious. Hence, ensuring the anomaly detection models conducted in a

for mission-critical decision-making and onboard users' entertainment. These
contents are required to be fully delivered to the requester CVs within
stringent deadlines that the existing radio access technology (RAT) solutions
may fail to ensure. Motivated by the above consideration, this paper exploits
content caching in vehicular edge networks (VENs) with a software-defined
user-centric virtual cell (VC) based RAT solution for delivering the requested
contents from a proximity edge server. Moreover, to capture the heterogeneous
demands of the CVs, we introduce a preference-popularity tradeoff in their
content request model. To that end, we formulate a joint optimization problem
for content placement, CV scheduling, VC configuration, VC-CV association and
radio resource allocation to minimize long-term content delivery delay.
However, the joint problem is highly complex and cannot be solved efficiently
in polynomial time. As such, we decompose the original problem into a cache
placement problem and a content delivery delay minimization problem given the
cache placement policy. We use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a learning
solution for the first sub-problem. Furthermore, we transform the delay
minimization problem into a priority-based weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization
problem, which is solved leveraging maximum bipartite matching (MWBM) and a
simple linear search algorithm. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing baselines in

Our approach is to design heuristic algorithms for computing a sequence of

hopefully converge to $\tw(G)$ from both sides. The upper bound algorithm
extends and simplifies Tamaki's unpublished work on a heuristic use of the
dynamic programming algorithm for deciding treewidth due to Bouchitt\'{e} and
Todinca. The lower bound algorithm is based on the well-known fact that, for
every minor $H$ of $G$, we have $\tw(H) \leq \tw(G)$. Starting from a greedily
computed minor $H_0$ of $G$, the algorithm tries to construct a sequence of
minors $H_0$, $H_1$, \ldots $H_k$ with $\tw(H_i) < \tw(H_{i + 1})$ for $0 \leq
i < k$ and hopefully $\tw(H_k) = \tw(G)$.
  We have implemented a treewidth solver based on this approach and have
evaluated it on the bonus instances from the exact treewidth track of PACE 2017

extremely effective in tackling instances that are hard for conventional
solvers. Our solver has an additional advantage over conventional ones in that
it attaches a compact certificate to the lower bound it computes.

evidence for topologically non-trivial superconductivity in the bulk. However,
at the surface of these materials, even the observation of superconductivity
itself is still controversial. We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) down
to 0.4 K to show that on the surface of bulk superconducting SrxBi2Se3, no gap
in the density of states is observed around the Fermi energy as long as clean
metallic probe tips are used. Nevertheless, using scanning electron microscopy
and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, we find that micron-sized flakes of
SrxBi2Se3 are easily transferred from the sample onto the STM probe tip and
that such flakes consistently show a superconducting gap in the density of
states. We argue that the superconductivity in SrxBi2Se3 crystals does not
extend to the surface when the topological surface state (TSS) is intact, but
in micro-flakes the TSS has been destroyed due to strain and allows the
superconductivity to extend to the surface. To understand this phenomenon, we
propose that the local electric field, always found in electron doped Bi2Se3 in
the presence of the TSS due to an intrinsic upward band bending, works against
superconductivity at the surface.

variables as well as time. The state of such systems is modelled by partial
differential equations and evolves on an infinite-dimensional space. Systems
modelled by delay-differential equations are also infinite-dimensional systems.
The full state of these systems cannot be measured. Observer design is an
important tool for estimating the state from available measurements. For linear
systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional, the Kalman filter provides an
estimate with minimum-variance on the error, if certain assumptions on the
noise are satisfied. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one type of extension
to nonlinear finite-dimensional systems. In this paper we provide an extension
of the EKF to semilinear infinite-dimensional systems. Under mild assumptions
we prove the well-posedness of equations defining the EKF. Local exponential
stability of the error dynamics is shown. Only detectability is assumed, not
observability, so this result is new even for finite-dimensional systems. The
results are illustrated with implementation of finite-dimensional
approximations of the infinite-dimensional EKF on an example.

multi-head self-attention (MHSA) among them. Complete leverage of these image
tokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in
MHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or
distractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT
predictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the
feed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during
training. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens
between MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by
the corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by
preserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite
subsequent MHSA and FFN computations. To this end, our method EViT improves
ViTs from two perspectives. First, under the same amount of input image tokens,
our method reduces MHSA and FFN computation for efficient inference. For
instance, the inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50% while its
recognition accuracy is decreased by only 0.3% for ImageNet classification.
Second, by maintaining the same computational cost, our method empowers ViTs to
take more image tokens as input for recognition accuracy improvement, where the
image tokens are from higher resolution images. An example is that we improve
the recognition accuracy of DeiT-S by 1% for ImageNet classification at the
same computational cost of a vanilla DeiT-S. Meanwhile, our method does not

strengths and terminal velocities to address the $Z$ dependence, over a large
luminosity range. The empirical wind-luminosity relation (WLR) obtained updates
and extends previous results in the literature. It reveals a luminosity and $Z$
dependence, in agreement with the radiatively driven wind theory. For bright
objects ($\log L/L_\odot \gtrsim 5.4$), we infer that $\dot{M} \sim
Z^{0.5-0.8}$. However, this dependence seems to get weaker or vanish at lower
luminosities. The analysis of the terminal velocities suggests a shallow $Z^n$
dependence, with $n \sim 0.1-0.2$, but it should be confirmed with a larger
sample and more accurate $V_{\infty}$ determinations. Recent results on SMC
stars based on the PoWR code support our inferred WLR. On the other hand,
recent bow-shocks measurements stand mostly above our derived WLR. Theoretical
calculations of the WLR are not precise, specially at low $L$, where the
results scatter. Deviations between our results and recent predictions are
identified to be due to the weak wind problem and the extreme terminal
velocities predicted by the models. The Z dependence suggested by our analysis

party's location in spacetime by exploiting constraints on quantum information
and relativistic causality. A popular verification scheme known as $f$-routing
involves requiring the prover to redirect a quantum system based on the value
of a Boolean function $f$. Cheating strategies for the $f$-routing scheme
require the prover use pre-shared entanglement, and security of the scheme
rests on assumptions about how much entanglement a prover can manipulate. Here,
we give a new cheating strategy in which the quantum system is encoded into a
secret-sharing scheme, and the authorization structure of the secret-sharing
scheme is exploited to direct the system appropriately. This strategy completes
the $f$-routing task using $O(SP_p(f))$ EPR pairs, where $SP_p(f)$ is the
minimal size of a span program over the field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ computing $f$.
This shows we can efficiently attack $f$-routing schemes whenever $f$ is in the
complexity class $\text{Mod}_p\text{L}$, after allowing for local
pre-processing. The best earlier construction achieved the class L, which is
believed to be strictly inside of $\text{Mod}_p\text{L}$. We also show that the

  reliability of Self-Driving Cars",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to misclassifying images
when small perturbations are present. With the increasing prevalence of CNNs in
self-driving cars, it is vital to ensure these algorithms are robust to prevent
collisions from occurring due to failure in recognizing a situation. In the
Adversarial Self-Driving framework, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is
implemented to generate realistic perturbations in an image that cause a
classifier CNN to misclassify data. This perturbed data is then used to train
the classifier CNN further. The Adversarial Self-driving framework is applied
to an image classification algorithm to improve the classification accuracy on
perturbed images and is later applied to train a self-driving car to drive in a
simulation. A small-scale self-driving car is also built to drive around a
track and classify signs. The Adversarial Self-driving framework produces
perturbed images through learning a dataset, as a result removing the need to
train on significant amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the
Adversarial Self-driving framework identifies situations where CNNs are
vulnerable to perturbations and generates new examples of these situations for
the CNN to train on. The additional data generated by the Adversarial
Self-driving framework provides sufficient data for the CNN to generalize to
the environment. Therefore, it is a viable tool to increase the resilience of
CNNs to perturbations. Particularly, in the real-world self-driving car, the
application of the Adversarial Self-Driving framework resulted in an 18 %
increase in accuracy, and the simulated self-driving model had no collisions in
30 minutes of driving.

  Text-to-Speech","Accepted by ICASSP 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expressive text-to-speech (TTS) has become a hot research topic recently,
mainly focusing on modeling prosody in speech. Prosody modeling has several
challenges: 1) the extracted pitch used in previous prosody modeling works have
inevitable errors, which hurts the prosody modeling; 2) different attributes of
prosody (e.g., pitch, duration and energy) are dependent on each other and
produce the natural prosody together; and 3) due to high variability of prosody
and the limited amount of high-quality data for TTS training, the distribution
of prosody cannot be fully shaped. To tackle these issues, we propose
ProsoSpeech, which enhances the prosody using quantized latent vectors
pre-trained on large-scale unpaired and low-quality text and speech data.
Specifically, we first introduce a word-level prosody encoder, which quantizes
the low-frequency band of the speech and compresses prosody attributes in the
latent prosody vector (LPV). Then we introduce an LPV predictor, which predicts
LPV given word sequence. We pre-train the LPV predictor on large-scale text and
low-quality speech data and fine-tune it on the high-quality TTS dataset.
Finally, our model can generate expressive speech conditioned on the predicted
LPV. Experimental results show that ProsoSpeech can generate speech with richer
prosody compared with baseline methods.

in this work propose a probabilistic approach based on distributions calculated
out of the Logit layer scores of pre-trained networks. We demonstrate that
Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) functions are more

however, is inadequate for scale-free networks, where hub vertices propagate
more dominant information due to vertex imbalance. In this paper, we propose a
novel centrality-based framework named CenGCN to address the inequality of
information. This framework first quantifies the similarity between hub
vertices and their neighbors by label propagation with hub vertices. Based on
this similarity and centrality indices, the framework transforms the graph by
increasing or decreasing the weights of edges connecting hub vertices and
adding self-connections to vertices. In each non-output layer of the GCN, this
framework uses a hub attention mechanism to assign new weights to connected
non-hub vertices based on their common information with hub vertices. We
present two variants CenGCN\_D and CenGCN\_E, based on degree centrality and
eigenvector centrality, respectively. We also conduct comprehensive
experiments, including vertex classification, link prediction, vertex
clustering, and network visualization. The results demonstrate that the two

a powerful tool for graph analytics, graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently
gained wide attention due to its end-to-end processing capabilities. With the
proliferation of cloud computing, it is increasingly popular to deploy the
services of complex and resource-intensive model training and inference in the

services, if deployed in the cloud, will raise critical privacy concerns about
the information-rich and proprietary graph data (and the resulting model).
While there has been some work on secure neural network training and inference,
they all focus on convolutional neural networks handling images and text rather
than complex graph data with rich structural information. In this paper, we
design, implement, and evaluate SecGNN, the first system supporting
privacy-preserving GNN training and inference services in the cloud. SecGNN is
built from a synergy of insights on lightweight cryptography and machine
learning techniques. We deeply examine the procedure of GNN training and

support the holistic computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecGNN
achieves comparable plaintext training and inference accuracy, with promising

should be candidate targets, which combinations of targets are safe to compare,
and what comparison operations make sense? This paper proposes a conceptual
model that lets users compose combinations of values, marks, legend elements,

classical phase space functions to quantum operators. I discuss the early
history of this notion of quantization with emphasis on the works of
Schr\""odinger and Dirac, and how quantization fit into their overall
understanding of quantum theory in the 1920's. Dirac, in particular, proposed a
quantization map which should satisfy certain properties, including the
property that quantum commutators should be related to classical Poisson
brackets in a particular way. However, in 1946, Groenewold proved that Dirac's
mapping was inconsistent, making the problem of defining a rigorous
quantization map more elusive than originally expected. This result, known as
the Groenewold-Van Hove theorem, is not often discussed in physics texts, but
here I will give an account of the theorem and what it means for potential
""corrections"" to Dirac's scheme. Other proposals for quantization have arisen
over the years, the first major one being that of Weyl in 1927, which was later
developed by many, including Groenewold, and which has since become known as
Weyl Quantization in the mathematical literature. Another, known as Geometric
Quantization, formulates quantization in differential-geometric terms by
appealing to the character of classical phase spaces as symplectic manifolds;
this approach began with the work of Souriau, Kostant, and Kirillov in the
1960's. I will describe these proposals for quantization and comment on their
relation to Dirac's original program. Along the way, the problem of operator
ordering and of quantizing in curvilinear coordinates will be described, since
these are natural questions that immediately present themselves when thinking
about quantization.

  Source Localization","Accepted by TASLP 2021",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) refers to the ratio between
the direct-path acoustic transfer functions of two microphone channels. Though
DP-RTF fully encodes the sound spatial cues and serves as a reliable
localization feature, it is often erroneously estimated in the presence of
noise and reverberation. This paper proposes to learn DP-RTF with deep neural
networks for robust binaural sound source localization. A DP-RTF learning
network is designed to regress the binaural sensor signals to a real-valued
representation of DP-RTF. It consists of a branched convolutional neural
network module to separately extract the inter-channel magnitude and phase
patterns, and a convolutional recurrent neural network module for joint feature
learning. To better explore the speech spectra to aid the DP-RTF estimation, a
monaural speech enhancement network is used to recover the direct-path
spectrograms from the noisy ones. The enhanced spectrograms are stacked onto
the noisy spectrograms to act as the input of the DP-RTF learning network. We
train one unique DP-RTF learning network using many different binaural arrays
to enable the generalization of DP-RTF learning across arrays. This way avoids
time-consuming training data collection and network retraining for a new array,
which is very useful in practical application. Experimental results on both

direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in the noisy and reverberant environment,

up to 631% at room temperature (RT), which is two or more times larger than
those used currently for magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) devices,
using CoFe/MgO/CoFe(001) epitaxial MTJs. The TMR ratio increased up to 1143% at
10 K, which corresponds to an effective tunneling spin polarization of 0.923.
The observed large TMR ratios resulted from the fine-tuning of atomic-scale
structures of the MTJs, such as crystallographic orientations and MgO interface
oxidation, in which the well-known Delta1 coherent tunneling mechanism for the
giant TMR effect is expected to be pronounced. However, behavior that is not
covered by the standard coherent tunneling theory was unexpectedly manifested;
i.e., (i) TMR saturation at a thick MgO barrier region and (ii) enhanced TMR
oscillation with a 0.32 nm period in MgO thickness. Particularly, the TMR
oscillatory behavior dominates the transport in a wide range of MgO
thicknesses; the peak-to-valley difference of the TMR oscillation exceeded 140%
at RT, attributable to the appearance of large oscillatory components in
resistance area product (RA). Further, we found that the oscillatory behaviors
of the TMR ratio and RA survive, even under a +-1 V bias voltage application,
indicating the robustness of the oscillation. Our demonstration of the giant
RT-TMR ratio will be an essential step for establishing spintronic
architectures, such as large-capacity MRAMs and spintronic artificial neural

environmental disturbances such as climate and fisheries. However, such
arguments break down if the distribution of the individual offspring numbers is
heavy-tailed. In a world with power-law offspring-number distribution with
exponent $1<\alpha<2$, the recruitment distribution has a putative power-law
regime in the tail with the same $\alpha$. The question is to what extent
individual reproductive variability can have a noticeable impact on the
recruitment under environmentally driven population fluctuations. This question
is answered by considering the L\'evy-stable fluctuations as embedded in a
randomly varying environment. I report fluctuation scaling and asymmetric
fluctuations in recruitment of commercially exploited fish stocks throughout
the North Atlantic. The linear scaling of recruitment standard deviation with
recruitment level implies that the individual reproductive variability is
dominated by population fluctuations. The totally asymmetric (skewed to the
right) character is a sign of idiosyncratic variation in reproductive success.

directed acyclic graph (DAG) that models causal relationships; it factorizes
the joint probability of the series into the product of easy-to-evaluate
conditional probabilities. We call such a graph-augmented normalizing flow

challenging issue due to interaction between sources, time-varying

learning techniques to learn competing and time-varying direct-path phase
differences for localizing multiple moving sound sources. A causal
convolutional recurrent neural network is designed to extract the direct-path
phase difference sequence from signals of each microphone pair. To avoid the
assignment ambiguity and the problem of uncertain output-dimension encountered
when simultaneously predicting multiple targets, the learning target is
designed in a weighted sum format, which encodes source activity in the weight
and direct-path phase differences in the summed value. The learned direct-path
phase differences for all microphone pairs can be directly used to construct
the spatial spectrum according to the formulation of steered response power
(SRP). This deep neural network (DNN) based SRP method is referred to as
SRP-DNN. The locations of sources are estimated by iteratively detecting and
removing the dominant source from the spatial spectrum, in which way the
interaction between sources is reduced. Experimental results on both simulated

likely. In rural areas, the predation motives of perpetrators can explain the
positive relationship between prices and conflict. Predation happens at places
and in periods where and when spoils to be appropriated are available. In
predominantly agrarian societies, such opportune times align with the harvest
season. Does the seasonality of agricultural income lead to the seasonality of
conflict? We address this question by analyzing over 55 thousand incidents
involving violence against civilians staged by paramilitary groups across
Africa during the 1997-2020 period. We investigate the crop year pattern of
violence in response to agricultural income shocks via changes in international
cereal prices. We find that a year-on-year one standard deviation annual growth
of the price of the major cereal grain results in a harvest-time spike in
violence by militias in a one-degree cell where this cereal grain is grown.
This translates to a nearly ten percent increase in violence during the early
postharvest season. We observe no such change in violence by state forces or
rebel groups--the other two notable actors. By further investigating the
mechanisms, we show that the violence by militias is amplified after plausibly
rich harvest seasons when the value of spoils to be appropriated is higher. By
focusing on harvest-related seasonality of conflict, as well as actors more
likely to be involved in violence against civilians, we contribute to the
growing literature on the economic causes of conflict in predominantly agrarian
societies.

redshift range $0\lesssim z\lesssim 8$ to explore the Hubble tension. The age
of the Universe at any $z$ is inversely proportional to the Hubble constant,
$H_0$, so requiring the Universe to be older than the OAO it contains at any
$z$ will lead to an upper limit on $H_0$. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM and
setting a Gaussian prior on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.315\pm0.007$ informed by {\it Planck}, we obtain a 95\% confidence-level
upper limit of $H_0<70.6 \rm{~km} \rm{~s}^{-1} \rm{~Mpc}^{-1}$, representing a
$2\sigma$ tension with the measurement using the local distance ladder. We
find, however, that the inferred upper limit on $H_{0}$ depends quite
sensitively on the prior for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and the Hubble tension between
early-time and local measurements of $H_{0}$ may be due in part to the
inference of both $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$ in {\it Planck}, while the local
measurement uses only $H_{0}$. The age-redshift data may also be used for
cosmological model comparisons. We find that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe
accounts well for the data, with a reasonable upper limit on $H_{0}$, while
Einstein-de Sitter fails to pass the cosmic-age test. Finally, we present a
model-independent estimate of the spatial curvature using the ages of 61
galaxies and the luminosity distances of 1,048 Pantheon Type Ia supernovae.
This analysis suggests that the geometry of the Universe is marginally
consistent with spatial flatness at a confidence level of $1.6\sigma$,
characterized as $\Omega_{k}=0.43^{+0.27}_{-0.27}$.

researchers recently turned to data-driven approaches to solving the IK
problem. Unfortunately, NNs become inadequate for robotic arms with redundant

one-to-one mapping functions, which associate just one consistent output for a

existing works employ customized training datasets, in which every desired pose
only has one angle solution. This inevitably limits the generalization and

demonstrates that the intensity fluctuations are separated into a component pv
that mostly arises from velocity fluctuations and pd that mostly arise from
density fluctuations. The VDA helps to clarify the nature of the filamentary

correlation of pv and pd,which according to the authors invalidates the
technique since it requires that pv and pd have zero correlation. However, the
quantities pv and pd given by VDA are naturally orthogonal which can be
trivially checked analytically or numerically. That means the correct
application of the VDA to any data must provide zero correlation. This is the
point that we clarify in this paper and search for the cause of the mistake in
the application of the VDA in K22 that resulted in the erroneous conclusion. We
prove analytically that by construction pv and pd are not correlated. We
identify the likely mistake in the VDA expression that K22 used and reproduce
their figures with the incorrect expression. We find that 14 out of 15 figures

Checkerboard Demodulation (FCD) method in Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)

apparent displacement (local distortion) of a background image caused by the
density gradient of the fluid in front of the background. The cross-correlation
particle image velocimetry (PIV) method, which is commonly employed in the BOS
technique for detecting the apparent displacement, uses a random-dot
background, whereas FCD uses a periodic pattern as the background (e.g.,
checkerboard pattern, lattice grid pattern (grid scale)) to detect the apparent
displacement as the phase change of the pattern in the Fourier space. In this
study, we measured the apparent displacement, which is proportional to density
gradient of fluid, of an underwater shock wave using FCD and PIV. The results
showed that FCD can measure a displacement gradient of up to 2.5 times larger
than that which PIV can measure. Furthermore, we systematically investigated
the measurement limit of FCD-BOS by changing several parameters of the periodic
patterns, such as the grid size. Also, we explored the related parameters in
the Fourier space to understand the limitations. It is worth noting that
FCD-BOS with lattice grid pattern (grid scale) can measure the apparent
displacement as accurately as that with a custom-made pattern, indicating that

Subsequently, we use this model in combination with a genetic algorithm to

from massive labeled and unlabeled graph data can be captured. The knowledge
implicitly encoded in model parameters can benefit various downstream tasks and
help to alleviate several fundamental issues of learning on graphs. In this
paper, we provide the first comprehensive survey for PGMs. We firstly present
the limitations of graph representation learning and thus introduce the
motivation for graph pre-training. Then, we systematically categorize existing
PGMs based on a taxonomy from four different perspectives. Next, we present the
applications of PGMs in social recommendation and drug discovery. Finally, we

automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since it can unify the acoustic and
language model into a single neural network. However, as a drawback, training
of end-to-end speech recognizers always requires transcribed utterances. Since
end-to-end models are also known to be severely data hungry, this constraint is
crucial especially because obtaining transcribed utterances is costly and can
possibly be impractical or impossible. This paper proposes a method for
alleviating this issue by transferring knowledge from a language model neural
network that can be pretrained with text-only data. Specifically, this paper
attempts to transfer semantic knowledge acquired in embedding vectors of
large-scale language models. Since embedding vectors can be assumed as implicit
representations of linguistic information such as part-of-speech, intent, and
so on, those are also expected to be useful modeling cues for ASR decoders.
This paper extends two types of ASR decoders, attention-based decoders and
neural transducers, by modifying training loss functions to include embedding
prediction terms. The proposed systems were shown to be effective for error
rate reduction without incurring extra computational costs in the decoding
phase.

(ICU) and is monitored by multiple sensors. We wish to assess relevant
unmeasured physiological variables (e.g., cardiac contractility and output and
vascular resistance) that have a strong effect on the patients diagnosis and
treatment. We do not have any information about this specific patient, but,
extensive offline information is available about previous patients, that may
only be partially related to the present patient (a case of dataset shift).
This information constitutes our prior knowledge, and is both partial and
approximate. The basic question is how to best use this prior knowledge,
combined with online patient data, to assist in diagnosing the current patient
most effectively. Our proposed approach consists of three stages: (i) Use the
abundant offline data in order to create both a non-causal and a causal
estimator for the relevant unmeasured physiological variables. (ii) Based on
the non-causal estimator constructed, and a set of measurements from a new
group of patients, we construct a causal filter that provides higher accuracy
in the prediction of the hidden physiological variables for this new set of
patients. (iii) For any new patient arriving in the ICU, we use the constructed
filter in order to predict relevant internal variables. Overall, this strategy
allows us to make use of the abundantly available offline data in order to
enhance causal estimation for newly arriving patients. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this methodology on a (non-medical) real-world task, in
situations where the offline data is only partially related to the new
observations. We provide a mathematical analysis of the merits of the approach

learning, and use separate schedulers to manage them. This leads to problems
for both training and inference: inference clusters have low GPU utilization
when the traffic load is low; training jobs often experience long queueing time
due to lack of resources. We introduce Aryl, a new cluster scheduler to address
these problems. Aryl introduces capacity loaning to loan idle inference GPU
servers for training jobs. It further exploits elastic scaling that scales a
training job's GPU allocation to better utilize loaned resources. Capacity
loaning and elastic scaling create new challenges to cluster management. When
the loaned servers need to be returned, we need to minimize the number of job
preemptions; when more GPUs become available, we need to allocate them to
elastic jobs and minimize the job completion time (JCT). Aryl addresses these
combinatorial problems using principled heuristics. It introduces the notion of
server preemption cost which it greedily reduces during server reclaiming. It
further relies on the JCT reduction value defined for each additional worker
for an elastic job to solve the scheduling problem as a multiple-choice
knapsack problem. Prototype implementation on a 64-GPU testbed and large-scale
simulation with 15-day traces of over 50,000 production jobs show that Aryl
brings 1.53x and 1.50x reductions in average queuing time and JCT, and improves
cluster usage by up to 26.9% over the cluster scheduler without capacity
loaning or elastic scaling.

be performed on small samples and typically require elaborate environments for
variation of parameters such as temperature, magnetic field and pressure. To
improve the achievable signal-to-background ratio, focusing devices based on
elliptic or parabolic neutron guides or Montel mirrors have been implemented.
Here we report an experimental demonstration of a nested mirror optics (NMO),
which overcomes some of the disadvantages of such devices. While even simpler
than the original Wolter design, our compact assembly of elliptic mirrors
images neutrons from a source to a target, minimizing geometric aberrations,
gravitational effects and waviness-induced blurring. Experiments performed at
MIRA at FRM-II demonstrate the expected focusing properties and a beam
transport efficiency of 72 % for our first prototype. NMO seem particularly
well-suited to i) extraction of neutrons from compact high-brilliance neutron
moderators, ii) general neutron transport, and iii) focusing and polarizing
neutrons. The phase space of the neutrons hitting a sample can be tailored
on-line to the needed experimental resolution, resulting in small scattering
backgrounds. As additional benefits, NMO situated far away from both the
moderator and the sample are less susceptible to radiation damage and can
easily be replaced. NMO enable a modular and physically transparent realization
of beam lines for neutron physics similar to setups used in visible light
optics.

will lead to the model instability or even failure to synthesize voice. To
learn accurate alignment information automatically, this paper proposes an

the proposed framework and Tacotron is that the speech can be controlled
significantly by the musical score's duration information. Firstly, we propose
a global duration control attention mechanism for the SVS model. The attention
mechanism can control each phoneme's duration. Secondly, a duration encoder is
proposed to learn a set of global transition tokens from the musical score.
These transition tokens can help the attention mechanism decide whether moving
to the next phoneme or staying at each decoding step. Thirdly, to further
improve the model's stability, a dynamic filter is designed to help the model
overcome noise interference and pay more attention to local context
information. Subjective and objective evaluation verify the effectiveness of
the method. Furthermore, the role of global transition tokens and the effect of
duration control are explored. Examples of experiments can be found at

from the BPIO layer is negligible compared to the intrinsic LSSE in the
Si/BPIO/Pt heterostructure even at room temperature. Below the Verwey
transition of the Fe3O4 phase, the total signal across BPIO/Pt is dominated by
the LSSE. Noticeable changes in the intrinsic LSSE signal for both Si/BPIO/Pt

in the semiclassical limit. In particular, we carry out the \emph{canonical}
analysis of the T-duality transformation rules in TSNC background. Following
the standard canonical prescription of obtaining T-duality transformations, we
map these TSNC sigma models to relativistic sigma models propagating over
general relativity backgrounds. Finally, we conclude with a detailed discussion
on the effects of adding \emph{flavour} branes and thereby taking the
corresponding TSNC limit in the bulk description of $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ quivers.
We compute various field theory observables in the nonrelativistic limit and
outline the structure of the NR Lagrangian following the light cone reduction
of $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ SYM theory.

slow gait speed, smaller pace and speed variability, more frequent stride, and
smaller acceleration range than in TUG test. We also found that gait speed,

This study proposes the hybrid finite difference with the physics-informed
neural network (HFD-PINN) to fully use the domain knowledge. The main idea is
to use the finite difference method (FDM) locally instead of AD in the
framework of PINN. In particular, we use AD at complex boundaries and the FDM
in other domains. The hybrid learning model shows promising results in
experiments. To use the FDM locally in the complex boundary domain and avoid
the generation of background mesh, we propose the HFD-PINN-sdf method, which
locally uses the finite difference scheme at random points. In addition, the
signed distance function is used to avoid the difference scheme from crossing
the domain boundary. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of our
proposed methods and compare the results with the different number of
collocation points for the Poisson equation, Burgers equation. We also chose
several different finite difference schemes, including the compact finite
difference method (CDM) and crank-nicolson method (CNM), to verify the
robustness of HFD-PINN. We take the heat conduction problem and the heat
transfer problem on the irregular domain as examples to demonstrate the
efficacy of our framework. In summary, HFD-PINN, especially HFD-PINN-sdf, are
more instructive and efficient, significantly when solving PDEs in complex
geometries.

first ground level enhancement (GLE) of the current cycle. A detailed
reconstruction of the NM response together with the identification of the solar
eruption that generated these particles is investigated based on in-situ and

Results. GLE73 reached a maximum particle rigidity of $\sim$2.4 GV and is

point of this novel theoretical approach is the introduction of a mechanical

temperature, and assuming a mechanical energy equipartition principle per mode,
the model predict the existence of a dynamic phase transition where the
rheological behavior of the medium evolves from a solid-like to a liquid-like

behavior is recovered as limiting case. The present modeling is applied to the
analysis of recent liquid water viscoelastic data pointing out a prevalent
elastic behavior in confined geometry. It is demonstrated that the model makes
it possible to understand these data in a coherent and unified way with the

concluded that any finite volume of fluid at rest possesses a static shear

number of machines and our goal is to decide for each job, when and on which
machine(s) it should be scheduled in order to minimize some objective function.
Different machine models, job characteristics and objective functions result in
a multitude of scheduling problems and many of them are NP-hard, even for a
fixed number of identical machines. In this work, we give conditional running
time lower bounds for a large number of scheduling problems, indicating the
optimality of some classical algorithms. Most notably, we show that the
algorithm by Lawler and Moore for $1||\sum w_jU_j$ and $Pm||C_{max}$, as well
as the algorithm by Lee and Uzsoy for $P2||\sum w_jC_j$ are probably optimal.
There is still small room for improvement for the $1|Rej\leq Q|\sum w_jU_j$
algorithm by Zhang et al., the algorithm for $1||\sum T_j$ by Lawler and the
FPTAS for $1||\sum w_jU_j$ by Gens and Levner. We also give a lower bound for
$P2|any|C_{max}$ and improve the dynamic program by Du and Leung from
$\mathcal{O}(nP^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(nP)$, matching this new lower bound. Here,
$P$ is the sum of all processing times. The same idea also improves the
algorithm for $P3|any|C_{max}$ by Du and Leung from $\mathcal{O}(nP^5)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(nP^2)$. While our results suggest the optimality of some classical
algorithms, they also motivate future research in cases where the best known
algorithms do not quite match the lower bounds.

consider the load forecasting for a new user in the system by observing only
few shots (data points) of its energy consumption. This task is challenging
since the limited samples are insufficient to exploit the temporal
characteristics, essential for load forecasting. Nonetheless, we notice that
there are not too many temporal characteristics for residential loads due to
the limited kinds of human lifestyle. Hence, we propose to utilize the
historical load profile data from existing users to conduct effective

Specifically, we first design a feature extraction clustering method for
categorizing historical data. Then, inheriting the prior knowledge from the
clustering results, we propose a two-phase Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model
to conduct load forecasting for new users. The proposed method outperforms the
traditional LSTM model, especially when the training sample size fails to cover

parameters based on laboratory measurements and by removing lines that are
either blended or display abundance variations along the pulsation cycle. The
spectroscopic approach that we developed brings forward small dispersions in
the variation of the atmospheric parameters ($\sigma$($T_{\rm eff}$)$\sim$50 K,
$\sigma$($\log{g}$)$\sim$0.2 dex, and $\sigma$($\xi$)$\sim$0.2 km/s) and in the
abundance of both iron ($\lesssim$ 0.05 dex) and alpha elements ($\lesssim$0.10

effective temperature templates by splitting the calibrating Cepheids into four
different period bins, ranging from short to long periods. For each period bin,
we performed an analytical fit with Fourier series providing $\theta =
5040/{T_{\rm eff}}$ as a function of the pulsation phase. The current findings
are a good viaticum to trace the chemical enrichment of the Galactic thin disk

representation is inadequate to grasp the information of tree structure in AST.
In this paper, we first present a new large-scale Apache Automatic Code Review

Subsequently, in the light of the merit of graph structure, we explore a graph

leverage the crucial implications of code fragments to derive code
representations. Finally, we exploit a simple but effective subtraction
operation in the representations between the original and revised code,
enabling the revised difference to be preferably learned for deciding the

includes sub-Alfv\'enic regions for the large majority of the exoplanet orbits,
very high dynamic and magnetic pressure values in quiescence (varying within
$10^{2} - 10^{5}$ times the dynamic pressure experienced by the Earth), and an
even harsher environment during the passage of any escaping CME associated with
the frequent flaring observed in AU Mic. These space weather conditions alone
pose an immense challenge for the survival of the exoplanetary atmospheres (if
any) in this system.

Glauber's theory of quantum coherence to predict the coincidence probability of
realistic broadband photons in HOM-experiments in a non-relativistic setting.
We extend the quantum field theoretical framework previously developed to
describe the deformation of the spectral profile of single photons in curved
spacetimes to a multi-photon framework, which is exact for inertial observers
in a flat spacetime and an approximation when observers are located in a curved
spacetime. We find that, in case of frequency entangled photons, a mutual
redshift between the sender and the receiver can change the coincidence
statistics from photon bunching to photon anti-bunching, and vice versa. This
implies that the (anti-) symmetry of the photonic spectral wave function is an
observer dependent notion, and that this can be probed via HOM-experiments in a
relativistic setting.

These oscillations can be used to infer the geometry and intensity of the
filament magnetic field. Previous theoretical studies of longitudinal
oscillations made two simplifying assumptions: uniform gravity and
semi-circular dips on the supporting flux tubes. However, the gravity is not
uniform and realistic dips are not semi-circular. To understand the effects of
including the nonuniform solar gravity on longitudinal oscillations, and
explore the validity of the pendulum model with different flux-tube geometries.
We first derive the equation describing the motion of the plasma along the flux
tube including the effects of nonuniform gravity, yielding corrections to the
original pendulum model. We also compute the full numerical solutions for the
normal modes, and compare them with the new pendulum approximation. We have
found that the nonuniform gravity introduces a significant modification in the
pendulum model. We have also found a cut-off period, i.e. the longitudinal
oscillations cannot have a period longer than 167 minutes. In addition,
considering different tube geometries, the period depends almost exclusively on
the radius of curvature at the bottom of the dip. We conclude that nonuniform
gravity significantly modifies the pendulum model. These corrections are
important for prominence seismology, because the inferred values of the radius
of curvature and minimum magnetic-field strength differ substantially from
those of the old model. However, we find that the corrected pendulum model is
quite robust and is still valid for non-circular dips.

the development of dedicated numerical techniques is generally based on the
exploitation of simplified models considering either coherent or diffuse
fields. The optimization of such applications in conditions of partial
coherence can therefore be particularly challenging, requiring the development
of hybrid algorithms adaptable to prior knowledge on the processed fields. The
objective of this work is to provide numerical techniques for decomposing an
electromagnetic field into subspaces that can then be filtered according to
their level of spatial and temporal coherence. In contrast to the studies
carried out on space-space transfer matrices notably used for the calculation
of Wigner-Smith operators, these decompositions are carried out on space-time
matrices in order to facilitate the study of temporal dispersion. The theory is
developed for illustrative purposes using experimental results from a leaky
resonant system but seem to be applicable to any scattering and reverberating
media capable of transforming localized and coherent excitations into complex

exploited to improve image reconstruction in a millimeter-wave computational
imaging demonstration. In the studied context and from a more general
perspective, we propose a technique to select the most suitable subspaces for
each application operating under conditions of partial coherence, whether these

explodability of strongly and weakly magnetized models of $20$ and $27$

efficiency for the conversion of the neutrino heating into turbulent energy
including magnetic fields in the gain region is not significantly different
between the strong and weak field models, the amplified magnetic field due to
the neutrino-driven convection on large hot bubbles just behind stalled shock
results in a faster and more energetic explosion in the strongly magnetized

different configurations, namely, graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen, by means of
the van der Waals density functional. We found that the local nitrogen
configuration plays a key role in determining the stable water configuration,
while the dispersion force is responsible for the water adsorption. With the
graphitic nitrogen, water prefers to orient with its oxygen toward the surface,
whereas for the pyridinic nitrogen it prefers to orient with its hydrogens
toward the surface, because nitrogen is positively and negatively charged for
the former and the latter, respectively. Our results have great implications
for the modeling of the interface between water and nitrogen-doped graphitic

balancing algorithms that achieve asymptotic zero-waiting in the
sub-Halfin-Whitt regime, named LB-zero. Most existing results on zero-waiting
load balancing algorithms assume the service time distribution is exponential.
This paper establishes the {\em large-system insensitivity} of LB-zero for jobs
whose service time follows a Coxian distribution with a finite number of
phases. This result suggests that LB-zero achieves asymptotic zero-waiting for
a large class of service time distributions, which is confirmed in our
simulations. To prove this result, this paper develops a new technique, called
""Iterative State-Space Peeling"" (or ISSP for short). ISSP first identifies an
iterative relation between the upper and lower bounds on the queue states and
then proves that the system lives near the fixed point of the iterative bounds
with a high probability. Based on ISSP, the steady-state distribution of the
system is further analyzed by applying Stein's method in the neighborhood of
the fixed point. ISSP, like state-space collapse in heavy-traffic analysis, is
a general approach that may be used to study other complex stochastic systems.

Our analysis demonstrates that the exceptional points can be tailored by a
judicious tuning of the coupling parameters of the system, resulting in
enhanced sensitivity to a small perturbation. The tunable coupling also leads
to a sharp change in the sensitivity slope, enabling the perturbation to be
measured precisely as a function of coupling. This two-way detection of the
perturbation opens up a rich landscape toward ultra-sensitive measurements,
which could be applicable to a wide range of non-Hermitian ternary platforms.

to screen for retinal disorders. Cutting edge deep learning based algorithms

standard evaluation benchmarks. To deal with this issue, we set up the
Automatic Detection challenge on Age-related Macular degeneration (ADAM), which
was held as a satellite event of the ISBI 2020 conference. The ADAM challenge
consisted of four tasks which cover the main aspects of detecting and
characterizing AMD from fundus images, including detection of AMD, detection
and segmentation of optic disc, localization of fovea, and detection and
segmentation of lesions. As part of the challenge, we have released a
comprehensive dataset of 1200 fundus images with AMD diagnostic labels,
pixel-wise segmentation masks for both optic disc and AMD-related lesions
(drusen, exudates, hemorrhages and scars, among others), as well as the
coordinates corresponding to the location of the macular fovea. A uniform
evaluation framework has been built to make a fair comparison of different
models using this dataset. During the challenge, 610 results were submitted for
online evaluation, with 11 teams finally participating in the onsite challenge.
This paper introduces the challenge, the dataset and the evaluation methods, as
well as summarizes the participating methods and analyzes their results for
each task. In particular, we observed that the ensembling strategy and the
incorporation of clinical domain knowledge were the key to improve the
performance of the deep learning models.

trend since the year 2000. While the start of the greening trend seems to match
with the implementation of ecological conservation projects, no statistical
evidence on a relationship between vegetation greening and eco-engineering
exists. Moreover, dominant factors influencing the spatial patterns of
vegetation trends have rarely been investigated. Here we use six comprehensive
factors representing the natural conditions and human activities of the study
area, and several statistical models consistently show that eco-engineering
explains large parts of the positive vegetation trends in the karst areas,
while negative vegetation trends in non-karst areas of Yunnan were related with
a decrease in rainfall. We further show that the interaction of eco-engineering
with other factors leads to a heterogeneous pattern of different vegetation
trends. Knowing and understanding these patterns is crucial when planning
ecological restoration, especially in diverse landscapes like China karst and
the methods can be reused in other restoration areas.

luminosity. Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently
observed in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class.
For example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate
the rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission.
Periodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently
reported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery
of FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced
by 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important
clues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that
of FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the
main FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A
components to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these
against the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with
sub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from
repeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the
periodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5$\sigma$. Its
repeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the
required spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star
equations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict
with a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could,
however, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a
magnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the
smallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star
rotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.

sizes or masking strategies. In this work, we revisit this important choice of
MLM pre-training. We first establish that 15% is not universally optimal, and
larger models should adopt a higher masking rate. Specifically, we find that
masking 40% outperforms 15% for BERT-large size models on GLUE and SQuAD.
Interestingly, an extremely high masking rate of 80% can still preserve 95%
fine-tuning performance and most of the accuracy in linguistic probing,
challenging the conventional wisdom about the role of the masking rate. We then
examine the interplay between masking rates and masking strategies and find
that uniform masking requires a higher masking rate compared to sophisticated
masking strategies such as span or PMI masking. Finally, we argue that
increasing the masking rate has two distinct effects: it leads to more
corruption, which makes the prediction task more difficult; it also enables
more predictions, which benefits optimization. Using this framework, we revisit
BERT's 80-10-10 corruption strategy. Together, our results contribute to a

intervals is allowed to be recolored. The limit on the number of recolorings
per update is called the recourse budget. In this paper we show, that if the
graph remains $k$-colorable at all times, and the updates consist of insertions
only, then we can achieve the amortized recourse budget of $O(k^7 \log n)$
while maintaining a proper coloring with $k$ colors. This is an exponential
improvement over the result in [Bosek et al., Recoloring Interval Graphs with
Limited Recourse Budget. SWAT 2020] in terms of both $k$ and $n$. We complement
this result by showing the lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ on the amortized recourse

represent higher order Markov models as a convex mixture of single step Markov

we prove that if only few lags are relevant we can consistently and efficiently

which is based on the concept of synchronous message passing and uses two

every node to exchange one message per round with each neighbor in a local

an end-to-end two-branch multi-task learning network, SegFuse, that mimics the
human eye to effectively learn from the dataset and estimate high-quality depth

distributions of Na ions. The chirality of the alternating Na layers is
opposite. Such alternating chirality of the Na layer dictates the magnetic
periodicity along the c axis where an up-up-down-down spin arrangement of the

commensurate (CM) zigzag AFM order state is found to coexist with an
incommensurate (ICM) AFM state below the TN ~ 27.5 K. The ICM state is found to
appear at much higher temperature ~ 50 K and persists down to lowest measured

dimensional (2D) magnetic correlations (within the ab plane) of the ICM AFM

has been determined by carrying out inelastic neutron scattering experiments

competing inplane exchange interactions up to 3 rd nearest neighbours
consistent with the zigzag AFM ground state, and weak interplanar interaction
as well as a weak single-ion-anisotropy. The values of the exchange constants
yield that Na2Ni2TeO6 is situated well inside the zigzag AFM phase (spans over
a wide ranges of J2/J1 and J3/J1 values) in the theoretical phase diagram. The

theoretical model of the $\beta$-relaxation, i.e., the first step of the
relaxation dynamics. The model, first introduced by Cavagna et al., describes
the dynamics of the system in the neighborhood of a saddle point of the
potential energy surface. We extend the model to account for density-density
correlation functions and for the 4-point dynamic susceptibility. We obtain
analytical results for a simple schematic model, making contact with related
results for p-spin models and with the predictions of inhomogeneous
mode-coupling theory. Building on recent computational advances, we also
explicitly compare the model predictions against overdamped Langevin dynamics
simulations of a glass-forming liquid close to the mode-coupling crossover. The
agreement is quantitative at the level of single-particle dynamic properties
only up to the early $\beta$-regime. Due to its inherent harmonic
approximation, however, the model is unable to predict the dynamics on the time
scale relevant for structural relaxation. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests
that the agreement with the simulations may be largely improved if the modes'
spatial localization is properly taken into account.

properties of programs in an automated manner. Using a new approach, Din et al.
strengthen the ability of reasoning about concurrent programs by proposing a
modular trace semantics, which can flexibly adapt to the most prominent
imperative programming language paradigms. These semantics decouple the
evaluation in the local environments from the evaluation in the global
environment by generating abstract, symbolic traces for the individual, local
systems. The traces are then composed and concretized, resulting in global
traces for the global system. Hence, these semantics are called Locally
Abstract, Globally Concrete (LAGC).
  In this work, we present a formalization of the LAGC semantics in the popular
theorem proving environment Isabelle/HOL. The given model is based on the prior
work on the theory of LAGC semantics by Din et al. and includes formalizations
of the basic theorems, the LAGC semantics for the While Language (WL), as well
as the LAGC semantics for an extended version of the While Language (WLEXT). We
furthermore use our Isabelle model in order to provide formal proofs for
several advanced properties of the LAGC semantics, which have not been analyzed
in the original paper.
  Whilst the main goal of the work was to formalize the LAGC semantics in a
mathematically rigorous manner, we also achieve a high level of proof
automatization and manage to contribute an efficient code-generation for the
computation of program traces. As the formalization of the semantics is highly
modular, the given theories could in the future be extended with even more
sophisticated programming language paradigms.

achieving system stability. Finally, numerical simulations showcase the

termed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK),
systematically perturbs each of the four sub-models of a chemical kinetic model
to discover what combinations of terms results in a good model. A virtual
reaction network comprised of n species is first obtained using conventional
mechanism reduction. To counteract the imposed decrease in model performance,
the weights (virtual reaction rate constants) of important connections (virtual
reactions) between each node (species) of the virtual reaction network are
numerically optimised to replicate selected calculations across four sequential
phases. The first version of MLOCK, (MLOCK1.0) simultaneously perturbs all
three virtual Arrhenius reaction rate constant parameters for important
connections and assesses the suitability of the new parameters through
objective error functions, which quantify the error in each compact model
candidate's calculation of the optimisation targets, which may be comprised of

by creating compact models for the archetypal case of methane air combustion.
It is shown that the NUGMECH1.0 detailed model comprised of 2,789 species is

both sparse optimization and deep learning. Since sparsity-based audio
declipping methods have been developed upon constrained optimization, they are
adjustable and well-studied in theory. However, they always uniformly promote
sparsity and ignore the individual properties of a signal. Deep neural network
(DNN)-based methods can learn the properties of target signals and use them for
audio declipping. Still, they cannot perform well if the training data have
mismatches and/or constraints in the time domain are not imposed. In the
proposed method, we use a DNN in an optimization algorithm. It is inspired by
an idea called plug-and-play (PnP) and enables us to promote sparsity based on
the learned information of data, considering constraints in the time domain.
Our experiments confirmed that the proposed method is stable and robust to
mismatches between training and test data.

development. It provides semantically similar implementations from a large code
corpus to developers based on their queries. Existing techniques leverage deep
learning models to construct embedding representations for code snippets and
queries, respectively. Features such as abstract syntactic trees, control flow
graphs, etc., are commonly employed for representing the semantics of code
snippets. However, the same structure of these features does not necessarily
denote the same semantics of code snippets, and vice versa. In addition, these
techniques utilize multiple different word mapping functions that map query
words/code tokens to embedding representations. This causes diverged embeddings
of the same word/token in queries and code snippets. We propose a novel
context-aware code translation technique that translates code snippets into
natural language descriptions (called translations). The code translation is
conducted on machine instructions, where the context information is collected
by simulating the execution of instructions. We further design a shared word
mapping function using one single vocabulary for generating embeddings for both
translations and queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique,
called TranCS, on the CodeSearchNet corpus with 1,000 queries. Experimental
results show that TranCS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques

from decentralized data in a privacy-preserving way. Existing FL methods
usually assume the global model can be trained on any participating client.
However, in real applications, the devices of clients are usually
heterogeneous, and have different computing power. Although big models like
BERT have achieved huge success in AI, it is difficult to apply them to
heterogeneous FL with weak clients. The straightforward solutions like removing
the weak clients or using a small model to fit all clients will lead to some
problems, such as under-representation of dropped clients and inferior accuracy
due to data loss or limited model representation ability. In this work, we
propose InclusiveFL, a client-inclusive federated learning method to handle
this problem. The core idea of InclusiveFL is to assign models of different
sizes to clients with different computing capabilities, bigger models for
powerful clients and smaller ones for weak clients. We also propose an
effective method to share the knowledge among multiple local models with
different sizes. In this way, all the clients can participate in the model
learning in FL, and the final model can be big and powerful enough. Besides, we
propose a momentum knowledge distillation method to better transfer knowledge
in big models on powerful clients to the small models on weak clients.
Extensive experiments on many real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in learning accurate models from clients
with heterogeneous devices under the FL framework.

(ML) technique to address a prediction task, especially non-process-aware PPM
approaches. Consequently, PPM inherits the challenges faced by ML approaches.
One of these challenges concerns the need to gain user trust in the predictions
generated. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses
this issue. However, the choices made, and the techniques employed in a PPM
task, in addition to ML model characteristics, influence resulting
explanations. A comparison of the influence of different settings on the
generated explanations is missing. To address this gap, we investigate the
effect of different PPM settings on resulting data fed into an ML model and
consequently to a XAI method. We study how differences in resulting
explanations may indicate several issues in underlying data. We construct a
framework for our experiments including different settings at each stage of PPM
with XAI integrated as a fundamental part. Our experiments reveal several
inconsistencies, as well as agreements, between data characteristics (and hence
expectations about these data), important data used by the ML model as a result
of querying it, and explanations of predictions of the investigated ML model.

2021) are substantially subcritical reaching much lower Weissenberg ($Wi$)
numbers than on the neutral curve at a given Reynolds ($Re$) number over $Re
\in [0,3000]$. The travelling waves on the lower branch are surprisingly weak
indicating that viscolastic channel flow is susceptible to (nonlinear)
instability triggered by small finite amplitude disturbances for $Wi$ and $Re$
well below the neutral curve. The critical $Wi$ for these waves to appear in a
saddle node bifurcation decreases monotonically from, for example, $\approx 37$
at $Re=3000$ down to $\approx 7.5$ at $Re=0$ at the solvent-to-total-viscosity
ratio $\beta=0.9$. In this latter creeping flow limit, we also show that these
waves exist at $Wi \lesssim 50$ for higher polymer concentrations - $\beta \in
[0.5,0.97)$ -- where there is no known linear instability. Our results
therefore indicate that these travelling waves -- found in simulations and
named `arrowheads' by Dubief et al. {\em arXiv}.2006.06770 (2020) - exist much
more generally in $(Wi,Re, \beta)$ parameter space than their spawning neutral
curve and hence can either directly, or indirectly through their instabilities,
influence the dynamics seen far away from where the flow is linearly unstable.
Possible connections to elastic and elasto-inertial turbulence are discussed.

of the existing debiasing methods often identify and weaken these samples with
biased features (i.e., superficial surface features that cause such spurious

learning from the non-biased parts of these samples. To tackle this challenge,
in this paper, we propose to eliminate spurious correlations in a fine-grained
manner from a feature space perspective. Specifically, we introduce Random
Fourier Features and weighted re-sampling to decorrelate the dependencies
between features to mitigate spurious correlations. After obtaining
decorrelated features, we further design a mutual-information-based method to
purify them, which forces the model to learn features that are more relevant to
tasks. Extensive experiments on two well-studied NLU tasks demonstrate that our
method is superior to other comparative approaches.

the four-layer-type bismuth chalcogenide semiconductors LaOPbBiS$_{3}$ and
La$_{2}$O$_{2}$Bi$_{3}$AgS$_{6}$ and present the discovery of a
pressure-induced superconductivity. In both compounds, the semiconductorlike
behavior concomitant with an anomaly in the more insulating state is gradually
suppressed with increasing pressure while the superconductivity develops. The
obtained phase diagrams, in sharp contrast with the interplay between the
conventional charge density waves and superconductivity, suggest that the
enhancement of the superconductivity is due to the disorder near the
localization threshold. These results indicate that pressure tuning of the
local disorder in four-layer-type bismuth chalcogenides provides an attractive
opportunity to study the interplay between disorder and superconductivity.

functional linear regression for time series via a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space approach. In contrast to most of the literature, which considers tests
for the exact nullity of the slope function, we are interested in the null
hypothesis that the slope function vanishes only approximately, where
deviations are measured with respect to the $L^2$-norm. An asymptotically
pivotal test is proposed, which does not require the estimation of nuisance
parameters and long-run covariances. The key technical tools to prove the
validity of our approach include a uniform Bahadur representation and a weak
invariance principle for a sequential process of estimates of the slope
function. Both scalar-on-function and function-on-function linear regression
are considered and finite-sample methods for implementing our methodology are
provided. We also illustrate the potential of our methods by means of a small
simulation study and a data example.

the inner magnetosphere due to a geomagnetic storm, an increasing seismic
activity may occur near the magnetic field lines' footprint of a newly created
radiation belt. The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES)
detected a new radiation belt after a geomagnetic storm on March 24, 1991.
Shortly after that, on May 30, 1991, a strong M7.0 earthquake occurred in
Alaska in the footprint of geomagnetic line L~2.69. Additionally, on October
28, 2012, a strong M7.8 earthquake occurred in Canada near the footprint of
L~3.3, which was close to the magnetic lines of a new radiation belt detected
by a satellite ""Van Allen Probes"" after a geomagnetic storm on September 3,
2012. Seismic activity also increased near the magnetic field lines' footprint
of a newly created radiation belt around L~1.5-1.8 due to a geomagnetic storm
on June 21, 2015. We demonstrate the possible existence of two way of
solar-lithosphere coupling processes : (i) the disturbances in the lithosphere,
accompanying the earthquake preparation process, can modify the electric field
in the global electric circuit (GEC), which results in appearing of
disturbances in the ionosphere; and the vice-versa mechanism (ii) the solar
wind-generated disturbances in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, can modify the
electric field in the GEC, that will result in appearing of disturbances in the
lithosphere.

It is cost
effective, hazardless, portable and implemented routinely in numerous clinical
procedures. Nonetheless, image quality is characterized by granulated
appearance, poor SNR and speckle noise. Specific for malignant tumors, the
margins are blurred and indistinct. Thus, there is a great need for improving
ultrasound image quality. We hypothesize that this can be achieved, using
neural networks, by translation into a more realistic display which mimics an
anatomical cut through the tissue. In order to achieve this goal, the
preferable approach would be to use a set of paired images. However, this is
practically impossible in our case. Therefore, Cycle Generative Adversarial
Network (CycleGAN) was used, in order to learn each domain properties
separately and enforce cross domain cycle consistency. The two datasets which
were used for training the model were ""Breast Ultrasound Images"" (BUSI) and a
set of optic images of poultry breast tissue samples acquired at our lab. The
generated pseudo anatomical images provide improved visual discrimination of
the lesions with clearer border definition and pronounced contrast. In order to
evaluate the preservation of the anatomical features, the lesions in the
ultrasonic images and the generated pseudo anatomical images were both
automatically segmented and compared. This comparison yielded median dice score
of 0.91 for the benign tumors and 0.70 for the malignant ones. The median
lesion center error was 0.58% and 3.27% for the benign and malignancies
respectively and the median area error index was 0.40% and 4.34% for the benign
and malignancies respectively. In conclusion, these generated pseudo anatomical
images, which are presented in a more intuitive way, enhance tissue anatomy and
can potentially simplify the diagnosis and improve the clinical outcome.

domains. One of the best existing methods for this task, in terms of accuracy
and computation time, is MiniROCKET. In this work, we extend this approach to
provide better global temporal encodings using hyperdimensional computing (HDC)
mechanisms. HDC (also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures, VSA) is a general
method to explicitly represent and process information in high-dimensional
vectors. It has previously been used successfully in combination with deep
neural networks and other signal processing algorithms. We argue that the
internal high-dimensional representation of MiniROCKET is well suited to be
complemented by the algebra of HDC. This leads to a more general formulation,
HDC-MiniROCKET, where the original algorithm is only a special case. We will
discuss and demonstrate that HDC-MiniROCKET can systematically overcome
catastrophic failures of MiniROCKET on simple synthetic datasets. These results
are confirmed by experiments on the 128 datasets from the UCR time series
classification benchmark. The extension with HDC can achieve considerably
better results on datasets with high temporal dependence without increasing the
computational effort for inference.

on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the adversary can merely inject few
malicious nodes instead of modifying existing nodes or edges, i.e., Graph
Modification Attack (GMA). Although GIA has achieved promising results, little
is known about why it is successful and whether there is any pitfall behind the
success. To understand the power of GIA, we compare it with GMA and find that
GIA can be provably more harmful than GMA due to its relatively high
flexibility. However, the high flexibility will also lead to great damage to
the homophily distribution of the original graph, i.e., similarity among
neighbors. Consequently, the threats of GIA can be easily alleviated or even
prevented by homophily-based defenses designed to recover the original
homophily. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a novel constraint -- homophily
unnoticeability that enforces GIA to preserve the homophily, and propose
Harmonious Adversarial Objective (HAO) to instantiate it. Extensive experiments
verify that GIA with HAO can break homophily-based defenses and outperform
previous GIA attacks by a significant margin. We believe our methods can serve
for a more reliable evaluation of the robustness of GNNs.

behaviour of the initial momentum-momentum correlations. This result is then
used to derive the asymptotics of the power spectrum in the Zel'dovich

tail at large wave-numbers, containing higher-order terms that differ by
integer powers of $k^{n_s-1}$ and logarithms of $k$. Furthermore, we show that
dark matter power spectra with an ultraviolet cut-off develop an intermediate
range of scales where the power spectrum is accurately described by the
asymptotics of dark matter without a cut-off. These results reveal information
about the mathematical structure that underlies the perturbative terms in
kinetic field theory and thus the non-linear power spectrum. We also discuss
the sensitivity of the small-scale asymptotics to the spectral index $n_s$.

studies thanks to its place in industry guidelines such as CLSI. Unfortunately,
its computational cost is high as a naive approach requires O(n2) time. This
makes it impossible to compute the Passing-Bablok regression estimator on large
datasets. Additionally, even on smaller datasets it can be difficult to perform
bootstrap-based inference. We introduce the first quasilinear time algorithm
for the equivariant Passing-Bablok estimator. In contrast to the naive
algorithm, our algorithm runs in O(n log(n)) expected time using O(n) space,
allowing for its application to much larger data sets. Additionally, we
introduce a fast estimator for the variance of the Passing-Bablok slope and
discuss statistical inference based on bootstrap and this variance estimate.
Finally, we propose a diagnostic plot to identify influential points in
Passing-Bablok regression. The superior performance of the proposed methods is

it is recently observed that non-monotonic activation functions outperform the
traditional monotonic ones in many applications. To fill this gap, we establish
learnability without assuming monotonicity. Specifically, when the input
distribution is the standard Gaussian, we show that mild conditions on $\sigma$

learnability in polynomial time and polynomial samples. Moreover, with a
stronger assumption on the activation function, the condition of input
distribution can be relaxed to a non-degeneracy of the marginal distribution.

non-monotonic activation functions, such as SiLU/Swish and GELU. We also

  A Comparative Study on Power Grid Transients Prediction","17 pages, this paper is currently under review in a journal",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuous monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamic behavior of critical
infrastructure networks, such as the power systems, is a challenging but
important task. In particular, accurate and timely prediction of the
(electro-mechanical) transient dynamic trajectories of the power grid is
necessary for early detection of any instability and prevention of catastrophic
failures. Existing approaches for the prediction of dynamic trajectories either
rely on the availability of accurate physical models of the system, use
computationally expensive time-domain simulations, or are applicable only at
local prediction problems (e.g., a single generator). In this paper, we report
the application of two broad classes of data-driven learning models -- along
with their algorithmic implementation and performance evaluation -- in
predicting transient trajectories in power networks using only streaming
measurements and the network topology as input. One class of models is based on
the Koopman operator theory which allows for capturing the nonlinear dynamic
behavior via an infinite-dimensional linear operator. The other class of models
is based on the graph convolutional neural networks which are adept at
capturing the inherent spatio-temporal correlations within the power network.
Transient dynamic datasets for training and testing the models are synthesized
by simulating a wide variety of load change events in the IEEE 68-bus system,
categorized by the load change magnitudes, as well as by the degree of
connectivity and the distance to nearest generator nodes. The results confirm
that the proposed predictive models can successfully predict the
post-disturbance transient evolution of the system with a high level of
accuracy.

  Version 2: Fixed an inaccuracy",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit the task of computing the edit distance in sublinear time. In the
$(k,K)$-gap edit distance problem the task is to distinguish whether the edit
distance of two strings is at most $k$ or at least $K$. It has been established
by Goldenberg, Krauthgamer and Saha (FOCS '19), with improvements by Kociumaka
and Saha (FOCS '20), that the $(k,k^2)$-gap problem can be solved in time
$\widetilde O(n/k+\operatorname{poly}(k))$. One of the most natural questions
in this line of research is whether the $(k,k^2)$-gap is best-possible for the
running time $\widetilde O(n/k+\operatorname{poly}(k))$.
  In this work we answer this question by significantly improving the gap.
Specifically, we show that in time $O(n/k+\operatorname{poly}(k))$ we can even
solve the $(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem. This is the first algorithm that breaks
the $(k,k^2)$-gap in this running time. Our algorithm is almost optimal in the
following sense: In the low distance regime ($k\le n^{0.19}$) our running time
becomes $O(n/k)$, which matches a known $n/k^{1+o(1)}$ lower bound for the
$(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem up to lower order factors.
  Our result also reveals a surprising similarity of Hamming distance and edit
distance in the low distance regime: For both, the $(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem
has time complexity $n/k^{1\pm o(1)}$ for small $k$.
  In contrast to previous work, which employed a subsampled variant of the
Landau-Vishkin algorithm, we instead build upon the algorithm of Andoni,
Krauthgamer and Onak (FOCS '10). We first simplify their approach and then show
how to to effectively prune their computation tree in order to obtain a
sublinear-time algorithm in the given time bound. Towards that, we use a
variety of structural insights on the (local and global) patterns that can
emerge during this process and design appropriate property testers to
effectively detect these patterns.

bounds to accommodate function composition and addition, as well as the

Lipschitz constants of the layers and an (2, 1) group norm distance to the
initializations of the convolution weights. Experiments on benchmark datasets

density-functional theory (DFT). An in-principle-exact density-functional
version of Ht-DMFET is derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard lattice with a
single embedded impurity. On the basis of well-identified density-functional
approximations, a local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET) is
formulated and implemented. Even though LPFET performs better than Ht-DMFET in
the low-density regime, in particular when electron correlation is strong, both
methods are unable to describe the density-driven Mott-Hubbard transition, as
expected. These results combined with our formally exact density-functional
embedding theory reveal that a single statically embedded impurity can in
principle describe the gap opening, provided that the complementary correlation
potential (that describes the interaction of the embedding cluster with its
environment, which is simply neglected in both Ht-DMFET and LPFET) exhibits a
derivative discontinuity (DD) at half filling. The extension of LPFET to
multiple impurities (which would enable to circumvent the modeling of DDs) and
its generalization to quantum chemical Hamiltonians are left for future work.

These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower resolution continuum

$\sim$1 Myr and to be either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their

roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We
further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and

the impact of initial coherence and the behaviour of coherence on their speed
of evolution for both dephasing and dissipative processes. The role of the
non-zero value of initial coherence under information backflow conditions for

limit time ($\tau_{QSL}$). The trade-off between mixedness and coherence on the

The complementarity effect between mixedness and coherence is more prominent in
the quantum non-unital dissipation process. The parametric trajectory of speed

advantages over the standard concatenated quantum codes (CQCs). Several
families of EACQCs that, unlike standard CQCs, can beat the nondegenerate
Hamming bound for entanglement-assisted quantum error correction codes

the best known standard quantum error correction codes (QECCs) and EAQECCs are
also derived. In particular, several catalytic EACQCs with better parameters

constructed. Furthermore, each catalytic EACQC consumes only one or two ebits.
It is also shown that EACQCs make entanglement-assisted quantum communication
possible even if the ebits are noisy. Finally, it is shown that EACQCs can
outperform CQCs in entanglement fidelity over depolarizing channels if the
ebits are less noisy than the qubits. Moreover, the threshold error probability
of EACQCs is larger than that of CQCs when the error probability of ebits is
sufficiently lower than that of qubits. Therefore EACQCs are not only
competitive in quantum communication but also applicable in fault-tolerant

tasks includes optimizing the network's weights even after the training error
vanishes to further push the training loss toward zero. Recently, a phenomenon
termed ""neural collapse"" (NC) has been empirically observed in this training
procedure. Specifically, it has been shown that the learned features (the
output of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples converge to their
mean, and the means of different classes exhibit a certain tight frame
structure, which is also aligned with the last layer's weights. Recent papers
have shown that minimizers with this structure emerge when optimizing a
simplified ""unconstrained features model"" (UFM) with a regularized
cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we further analyze and extend the UFM.
First, we study the UFM for the regularized MSE loss, and show that the
minimizers' features can have a more delicate structure than in the
cross-entropy case. This affects also the structure of the weights. Then, we
extend the UFM by adding another layer of weights as well as ReLU nonlinearity
to the model and generalize our previous results. Finally, we empirically
demonstrate the usefulness of our nonlinear extended UFM in modeling the NC

strategy to reduce system complexity; they operate under the framework of
coupled compressed sensing (CCS) which concatenates an outer tree code to an
inner compressed sensing code for slot-wise message stitching. We suggest that
by exploiting the MIMO channel information in the angular domain, redundancies

efficiency, thereby an uncoupled transmission protocol is devised. To perform
activity detection and channel estimation, we propose an
expectation-maximization-aided generalized approximate message passing
algorithm with a Markov random field support structure, which captures the
inherent clustered sparsity structure of the angular domain channel. Then,
message reconstruction in the form of a clustering decoder is performed by
recognizing slot-distributed channels of each active user based on similarity.
We put forward the slot-balanced K-means algorithm as the kernel of the
clustering decoder, resolving constraints and collisions specific to the

  orthogonal projection-based methods",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of fault diagnosis in dynamic
systems as an alternative to the well-established observer-based framework. The
basic idea behind this work is to (i) formulate fault detection and isolation
as projection of measurement signals onto (system) subspaces in Hilbert space,
and (ii) solve the resulting problems by means of projection methods with
orthogonal projection operators and gap metric as major tools. In the new
framework, fault diagnosis issues are uniformly addressed both in the
model-based and data-driven fashions. Moreover, the design and implementation
of the projection-based fault diagnosis systems, from residual generation to
threshold setting, can be unifiedly handled. Thanks to the well-defined
distance metric for projections in Hilbert subspaces, the projection-based
fault diagnosis systems deliver optimal fault detectability. In particular, a
new type of residual-driven thresholds is proposed, which significantly
increases the fault detectability. In this work, various design schemes are
proposed, including a basic projection-based fault detection scheme, fault
detection schemes for feedback control systems, fault classification as well as
two modified fault detection schemes. As a part of our study, relations to the
existing observer-based fault detection systems are investigated, which
showcases that, with comparable online computations, the proposed
projection-based detection methods offer improved detection performance.

whole. Here we measure for eleven THINGS galaxies the excess kinetic energy,
velocity dispersion and surface density of HI gas associated with regions of
excess star formation, where the excess is determined from the difference
between the observed local value and the azimuthal average. We find small
decreases in the excess kinetic energy and velocity dispersion in regions of
excess star formation rate density, suggesting that most of the feedback energy
does not go into local HI motion. Most likely it disrupts molecular clouds and
dissipates rapidly at high gas density. Some could also be distributed over
larger regions, filling in spaces between the peaks of star formation and
contributing to other energy sources from self-gravity and spiral arm shocks.

problem of Logical Layout Analysis applied to historical documents in French.
We propose a rule-based method, that we evaluate and compare with two
Machine-Learning models, namely RIPPER and Gradient Boosting. Our data set
contains French newspapers, periodicals and magazines, published in the first
half of the twentieth century in the Franche-Comt\'e Region. Results. Our
rule-based system outperforms the two other models in nearly all evaluations.
It has especially better Recall results, indicating that our system covers more
types of every logical label than the other two models. When comparing RIPPER
with Gradient Boosting, we can observe that Gradient Boosting has better
Precision scores but RIPPER has better Recall scores. Conclusions. The
evaluation shows that our system outperforms the two Machine Learning models,
and provides significantly higher Recall. It also confirms that our system can
be used to produce annotated data sets that are large enough to envisage
Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches for the task of Logical Layout
Analysis. Combining rules and Machine Learning models into hybrid systems could
potentially provide even better performances. Furthermore, as the layout in
historical documents evolves rapidly, one possible solution to overcome this

Scott's untyped linear combinatory algebras, and relates this to more recent
work of Abramsky and Heunen on Frobenius algebras in the infinitary setting.
The key to this is extensional reflexivity (the property of an object being
isomorphic to its own internal hom. $N\cong [N\rightarrow N]$). We characterise
extensional reflexivity in compact closed categories, and consider how this may
be `strictified' to give monoidally equivalent categories where the
isomorphisms exhibiting reflexivity are identity arrows.
  This results in two-object compact closed categories consisting of a unit
object, and a non-unit extensionally reflexive object.
  We study the endomorphism monoids of such `strictly extensionally reflexive'
objects from an algebraic viewpoint. They necessarily contain an interesting
monoid that may be thought of as Richard Thompson's iconic group F together
with the equally iconic bicyclic monoid of semigroup theory, with non-trivial
interactions between the two derived from the Frobenius algebra identity. We
claim this as a significant example of the (unitless) Frobenius algebras of
Abramsky and Heunen.
  We then give concrete examples, based on the algebra and category theory
behind the Geometry of Interaction program. These are based on the traced
monoidal category of partial injections, and reflexive objects in the compact
closed category that results from applying the Int or GoI construction. We give
compact closed categories, monoidally equivalent to compact closed
subcategories of Int(pInj), where this reflexivity is exhibited by identity
arrows, and show how the above algebraic structures (Thompson's F, the bicyclic
monoid, and Frobenius algebras) arise in a fundamental manner.

Magnetic field emanations from the C4 bumps in the flip chip dominate the QDM
measurements, but these prove to be useful for image registration and can be
subtracted to resolve adjacent current traces in the die at the micron scale.
Vias in 3D ICs display only Bx and By magnetic fields due to their vertical
orientation and are difficult to detect with magnetometers that only measure
the Bz component (orthogonal to the IC surface). Using the multi-layer PCB, we
show that the QDM's ability to simultaneously measure Bx, By, and Bz is
advantageous for resolving magnetic fields from vias as current passes between
layers. We also show how spacing between conducting layers is determined by
magnetic field images and how it agrees with the design specifications of the
PCB. In our initial efforts to provide further z-depth information for current
sources in complex 3D circuits, we show how magnetic field images of individual
layers can be subtracted from the magnetic field image of the total structure.
This allows for isolation of signal layers and can be used to map embedded
current paths via solution of the 2D magnetic inverse. In addition, the paper
also discusses the use of neural networks to identify 2D current distributions

building block of many computer-assistance applications for minimally invasive
surgery. So far, state-of-the-art approaches completely rely on the
availability of a ground-truth supervision signal, obtained via manual
annotation, thus expensive to collect at large scale. In this paper, we present
FUN-SIS, a Fully-UNsupervised approach for binary Surgical Instrument
Segmentation. FUN-SIS trains a per-frame segmentation model on completely
unlabelled endoscopic videos, by solely relying on implicit motion information
and instrument shape-priors. We define shape-priors as realistic segmentation
masks of the instruments, not necessarily coming from the same dataset/domain
as the videos. The shape-priors can be collected in various and convenient
ways, such as recycling existing annotations from other datasets. We leverage
them as part of a novel generative-adversarial approach, allowing to perform
unsupervised instrument segmentation of optical-flow images during training. We
then use the obtained instrument masks as pseudo-labels in order to train a
per-frame segmentation model; to this aim, we develop a
learning-from-noisy-labels architecture, designed to extract a clean
supervision signal from these pseudo-labels, leveraging their peculiar noise
properties. We validate the proposed contributions on three surgical datasets,
including the MICCAI 2017 EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge
dataset. The obtained fully-unsupervised results for surgical instrument
segmentation are almost on par with the ones of fully-supervised
state-of-the-art approaches. This suggests the tremendous potential of the
proposed method to leverage the great amount of unlabelled data produced in the

We execute a cosmological reconstruction based on a parametrization of the

comparing the theoretical estimates with JLA + OHD + BAO data sets, using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. An analysis of molecular absorption lines
from HIRES and UVES spectrographs is considered as a reference for the
variation of $\alpha$ at different redshifts. Two examples are discussed. The
first explores a field-dependent kinetic coupling of the scalar field
interacting with charged matter. The second example is a generalized
Brans-Dicke formalism where the varying $\alpha$ is fitted in as an effective
matter field. This generates a simultaneous variation of the Newtonian constant
$G$ and $\alpha$. The pattern of this variation can have a crucial role in

fail. We propose an algorithm called Tucker-Structured Phase Retrieval (TSPR)
that models the sequence of images as a tensor rather than a matrix that we
factorize using the Tucker decomposition. This factorization reduces the number
of parameters that need to be estimated, allowing for a more accurate
reconstruction in the under-sampled regime. Interestingly, we observe that this
structure also has improved performance in the over-determined setting when the
Tucker ranks are chosen appropriately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on real video datasets under several different measurement models.

its real-time and non-invasive nature. However, its lesion detectability is
often limited in many applications due to the phase aberration artefact caused
by variations in the speed of sound (SoS) within body parts. To address this,
here we propose a novel self-supervised 3D CNN that enables phase aberration
robust plane-wave imaging. Instead of aiming at estimating the SoS distribution
as in conventional methods, our approach is unique in that the network is
trained in a self-supervised manner to robustly generate a high-quality image
from various phase aberrated images by modeling the variation in the speed of
sound as stochastic. Experimental results using real measurements from
tissue-mimicking phantom and \textit{in vivo} scans confirmed that the proposed
method can significantly reduce the phase aberration artifacts and improve the
visual quality of deep scans.

building blocks of attention and their computational properties. Within the
standard model of deep learning, we classify all possible fundamental building
blocks of attention in terms of their source, target, and computational
mechanism. We identify and study three most important mechanisms: additive
activation attention, multiplicative output attention (output gating), and
multiplicative synaptic attention (synaptic gating). The gating mechanisms
correspond to multiplicative extensions of the standard model and are used
across all current attention-based deep learning architectures. We study their
functional properties and estimate the capacity of several attentional building
blocks in the case of linear and polynomial threshold gates. Surprisingly,
additive activation attention plays a central role in the proofs of the lower
bounds. Attention mechanisms reduce the depth of certain basic circuits and
leverage the power of quadratic activations without incurring their full cost.

demand to develop robust automatic methods to analyze and recognize the various
emotions. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based emotion recognition
framework that uses a late fusion of transfer-learned and fine-tuned models
from speech and text modalities. More specifically, we i) adapt a residual
network (ResNet) based model trained on a large-scale speaker recognition task
using transfer learning along with a spectrogram augmentation approach to
recognize emotions from speech, and ii) use a fine-tuned bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) based model to represent and recognize
emotions from the text. The proposed system then combines the ResNet and
BERT-based model scores using a late fusion strategy to further improve the
emotion recognition performance. The proposed multimodal solution addresses the
data scarcity limitation in emotion recognition using transfer learning, data
augmentation, and fine-tuning, thereby improving the generalization performance
of the emotion recognition models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
proposed multimodal approach on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture

task. However, recently general pretrained models such as CodeBERT or CodeT5
have been shown to outperform task-specific models in many applications. While
pretrained models are known to learn complex patterns from data, they may fail
to understand some properties of source code. To test diverse aspects of code
understanding, we introduce a set of diagnosting probing tasks. We show that
pretrained models of code indeed contain information about code syntactic
structure and correctness, the notions of identifiers, data flow and
namespaces, and natural language naming. We also investigate how probing
results are affected by using code-specific pretraining objectives, varying the
model size, or finetuning.

machine learning through the lenses of structural econometrics models in which
the unknown index is the solution of a functional equation and issues of
endogeneity are explicitly accounted for. We model fairness as a linear
operator whose null space contains the set of strictly {\it fair} indexes. A
{\it fair} solution is obtained by projecting the unconstrained index into the
null space of this operator or by directly finding the closest solution of the
functional equation into this null space. We also acknowledge that policymakers
may incur a cost when moving away from the status quo. Achieving
\textit{approximate fairness} is obtained by introducing a fairness penalty in
the learning procedure and balancing more or less heavily the influence between
the status quo and a full fair solution.

n-player games in normal form repeated over time, where we call the human
player optimizer, and the (n -- 1) artificial players, learners. We assume that
learners play no-regret algorithms, a class of algorithms widely used in online

shown that in a 2-player game the optimizer can always guarantee an expected

accuracy, the value of the distribution function that will propagate along the
characteristic line with ending point at the cell interface is appropriated by
the parabolic reconstruction instead of the linear reconstruction. To validate

fermions in a general curved background using Pauli-Villars regularization. We
use both Feynman diagram method and Fujikawa's method to calculate the
parity-odd contribution (Pontryagin term). Our result indicates that the trace
anomaly of energy-momentum tensor for chiral fermions has Pontryagin term
$P=\frac{i}{1536\pi^2}\epsilon_{\nu\sigma\kappa\lambda}R^{\nu\sigma}_{\ \
\rho\mu}R^{\rho\mu\kappa\lambda}$ which agrees with the work of Bonora et al
\cite{Bonora:2014qla}.

(AS2), an essential component for retrieval-based Question Answering (QA)
systems. During offline learning, our model constructs a small-scale relevant
training graph per question in an unsupervised manner, and integrates with
Graph Neural Networks. Graph nodes are question sentence to answer sentence
pairs. We train and integrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for computing
scores between question-question, question-answer, and answer-answer pairs, and
use thresholding on relevance scores for creating graph edges. Online inference
is then performed to solve the AS2 task on unseen queries. Experiments on two
well-known academic benchmarks and a real-world dataset show that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA QA baseline models.

of governments, organizations, communities, and individuals are preserved for
future generations as cultural heritage, as sources of rights, and as vehicles
for holding the past accountable and to inform the future. This commitment is
guaranteed through the adoption of strategic and technical measures for the
long-term preservation of digital assets in any medium and form - textual,
visual, or aural. Public and private archives are the largest providers of data
big and small in the world and collectively host yottabytes of trusted data, to
be preserved forever. Several aspects of retention and preservation,
arrangement and description, management and administrations, and access and use
are still open to improvement. In particular, recent advances in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) open the discussion as to whether AI can support the ongoing
availability and accessibility of trustworthy public records. This paper
presents preliminary results of the InterPARES Trust AI (I Trust AI)
international research partnership, which aims to (1) identify and develop
specific AI technologies to address critical records and archives challenges;
(2) determine the benefits and risks of employing AI technologies on records
and archives; (3) ensure that archival concepts and principles inform the
development of responsible AI; and (4) validate outcomes through a conglomerate
of case studies and demonstrations.

  Interactions With an eTextbook","21 pages,11 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rise of online eTextbooks and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a
huge amount of data has been collected related to students' learning. With the
careful analysis of this data, educators can gain useful insights into the
performance of their students and their behavior in learning a particular
topic. This paper proposes a new model for predicting student performance based
on an analysis of how students interact with an interactive online eTextbook.
By being able to predict students' performance early in the course, educators
can easily identify students at risk and provide a suitable intervention. We
considered two main issues the prediction of good/bad performance and the
prediction of the final exam grade. To build the proposed model, we evaluated
the most popular classification and regression algorithms on data from a data
structures and algorithms course (CS2) offered in a large public research
university. Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression have been
applied in Regression. While Logistic Regression, decision tree, Random Forest
Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine have been applied
in classification.

Normalized Score of scientific publications and Article Processing Charges
(APCs) of Gold Open Access (OA) publications 2) the determinants of APCs. To do
so, we used APCs information provided by the OpenAPC database, citation scores
of publications from the WoS database and, for Altmetrics, data from
Altmetrics.com database, over the period from 2006 to 2019 for 83,752 articles
published in 4751 journals belonging to 267 distinct publishers. Results show
that contrary to common belief, paying high APCs does not necessarily increase
the impact of publications. First, large publishers with high impact are not
the most expensive. Second, publishers with the highest APCs are not
necessarily the best in terms of impact. Correlation between APCs and impact is
moderate. Regarding the determinants, results indicate that APCs are on average
50% higher in hybrid journals than in full OA journals. The results also
suggest that Altmetrics do not have a great impact: OA articles that have
garnered the most attention on internet are articles with relatively low APCs.
Another interesting result is that the ''number of readers'' indicator is more
effective as it is more correlated with classic bibliometrics indicators than
the Altmetrics score.

  Processing and Analysis in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Vehicular
  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of
Things (IoTs), an increasing number of computation intensive or delay sensitive
biomedical data processing and analysis tasks are produced in vehicles,
bringing more and more challenges to the biometric monitoring of drivers. Edge
computing is a new paradigm to solve these challenges by offloading tasks from
the resource-limited vehicles to Edge Servers (ESs) in Road Side Units (RSUs).
However, most of the traditional offloading schedules for vehicular networks
concentrate on the edge, while some tasks may be too complex for ESs to
process. To this end, we consider a collaborative vehicular network in which
the cloud, edge and terminal can cooperate with each other to accomplish the
tasks. The vehicles can offload the computation intensive tasks to the cloud to
save the resource of edge. We further construct the virtual resource pool which
can integrate the resource of multiple ESs since some regions may be covered by
multiple RSUs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scenario offloading schedule
for biomedical data processing and analysis in Cloud-Edge-Terminal
collaborative vehicular networks called MSCET. The parameters of the proposed
MSCET are optimized to maximize the system utility. We also conduct extensive
simulations to evaluate the proposed MSCET and the results illustrate that
MSCET outperforms other existing schedules.
