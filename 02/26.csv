standard model of particle physics. We study the violation of Lorentz symmetry
in some basic phenomena in atomic physics. Using the Green's function, and the
source 4-current, the differential equation of 4-vector of electromagnetic
potential is solved and the modified coulomb potential is obtained by some
researchers. Using modified Coulomb potential, we find the corrections due to
LIV on the spectrum of Hydrogen and Helium atoms. We also investigate the
consequences of LIV on Stark, Zeeman and Spin orbit effects and obtain some
upper bounds for the LIV coefficients.

consistently emphasized behavioral influences for this phenomenon and leveraged
behavioral ordering models to suggest interventions. However more recent
model-free approaches have also seen success. In this work, the author develops
algorithmic approaches towards mitigating bullwhip using both behaviorally

emphasizes the complementary nature of model-based and model-free approaches in
approaching behaviorally grounded supply chain management problems.

proposes a visual notification of AP-features to drivers based on real-time
images obtained via dashcam. For this purpose, Google Street View images around
accident hotspots (areas of dense accident occurrence) identified by a
real-accident dataset are used to train a novel attention module to classify a
given urban scene into an accident hotspot or a non-hotspot (area of sparse
accident occurrence). The proposed module leverages channel, point, and
spatial-wise attention learning on top of different CNN backbones. This leads
to better classification results and more certain AP-features with better
contextual knowledge when compared with CNN backbones alone. Our proposed
module achieves up to 92% classification accuracy. The capability of detecting
AP-features by the proposed model were analyzed by a comparative study of three
different class activation map (CAM) methods, which were used to inspect
specific AP-features causing the classification decision. Outputs of CAM
methods were processed by an image processing pipeline to extract only the
AP-features that are explainable to drivers and notified using a visual
notification system. Range of experiments was performed to prove the efficacy
and AP-features of the system. Ablation of the AP-features taking 9.61%, on
average, of the total area in each image increased the chance of a given area
to be classified as a non-hotspot by up to 21.8%.

radial velocities from the APOGEE-2 survey. More specifically, we explore stars
lie in assorted APOGEE-2 pointings in a region of the LMC periphery where
various overdensities of stars have previously been identified in maps of stars
from Gaia and DECam. By using a model of the LMC disk rotation, we find that a
sizeable fraction of the APOGEE-2 stars have extreme space velocities that are
distinct from, and not a simple extension of, the LMC disk. Using N-body
hydrodynamical simulations of the past dynamical evolution and interaction of
the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), we explore whether the extreme
velocity stars may be accounted for as tidal debris created in the course of
that interaction. We conclude that the combination of LMC and SMC debris
produced from their interaction is a promising explanation, although we cannot
rule out other possible origins, and that these new data should be used to
constrain future simulations of the LMC-SMC interaction. We also conclude that
many of the stars in the southern periphery of the LMC lie out of the LMC plane
by several kpc. Given that the metallicity of these stars suggest they are
likely of Magellanic origin, our results suggest that a wider exploration of

  Transport","29 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a unifying approach to central limit type theorems for empirical
optimal transport (OT). In general, the limit distributions are characterized
as suprema of Gaussian processes. We explicitly characterize when the limit
distribution is centered normal or degenerates to a Dirac measure. Moreover, in
contrast to recent contributions on distributional limit laws for empirical OT
on Euclidean spaces which require centering around its expectation, the
distributional limits obtained here are centered around the population
quantity, which is well-suited for statistical applications.
  At the heart of our theory is Kantorovich duality representing OT as a
supremum over a function class $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ for an underlying sufficiently
regular cost function $c$. In this regard, OT is considered as a functional
defined on $\ell^{\infty}(\mathcal{F}_{c})$ the Banach space of bounded
functionals from $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and equipped with uniform
norm. We prove the OT functional to be Hadamard directional differentiable and
conclude distributional convergence via a functional delta method that
necessitates weak convergence of an underlying empirical process in
$\ell^{\infty}(\mathcal{F}_{c})$. The latter can be dealt with empirical
process theory and requires $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to be a Donsker class. We give
sufficient conditions depending on the dimension of the ground space, the
underlying cost function and the probability measures under consideration to
guarantee the Donsker property. Overall, our approach reveals a noteworthy
trade-off inherent in central limit theorems for empirical OT: Kantorovich
duality requires $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to be sufficiently rich, while the empirical
processes only converges weakly if $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ is not too complex.

k-means problem ($z = 2$). The $k$-median and $k$-means problems are at the
heart of modern data analysis and massive data applications have given raise to
the notion of coreset: a small (weighted) subset of the input point set
preserving the cost of any solution to the problem up to a multiplicative $(1
\pm \varepsilon)$ factor, hence reducing from large to small scale the input to
the problem.
  In this paper, we present improved lower bounds for coresets in various
metric spaces. In finite metrics consisting of $n$ points and doubling metrics
with doubling constant $D$, we show that any coreset for $(k,z)$ clustering
must consist of at least $\Omega(k \varepsilon^{-2} \log n)$ and $\Omega(k

performance in grasping a variety of novel objects. However, these methods
either are typically limited to one single grasping mode, or else more end
effectors are needed to grasp various objects. In addition, gripper design and
learning methods are commonly developed separately, which may not adequately

can be caused by either the differing stellar mass or stellar evolution. To
properly disentangle the effects of both, the planet population around giant
stars needs to be characterized as accurately as possible. Our goal is to
investigate the giant planet occurrence rate around evolved stars and determine
its dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, and orbital period. We combine
data from the Lick, EXPRESS, and PPPS giant star surveys, yielding a sample of
482 evolved stars and 37 planets. We homogeneously rederived the stellar
parameters and accounted for varying observational coverage, precision, and
stellar noise properties by computing detection maps via injection and
retrieval of synthetic planetary signals. We then computed occurrence rates as
a function of period, stellar mass, and metallicity, corrected for
incompleteness. Our findings agree with previous studies that found a positive
planet-metallicity correlation for evolved stars and identified a peak in the
occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass, but our results place it at a
slightly smaller mass of 1.68Msun. The period dependence of the occurrence rate
seems to follow a broken power-law or log-normal peaking at 700-800 days,
roughly corresponding to 1.6AU for a 1Msun star and 2.0AU for a 2Msun star.
This peak could be a remnant from halted migration around intermediate-mass
stars, caused by stellar evolution, or an artifact from contamination by false
positives. The global occurrence rate of giant planetary systems is 10.7% for
the entire sample, while the subsets of RGB and HB stars exhibit 14.2% and
6.6%, respectively. However, we demonstrate that the different stellar mass
distributions suffice to explain the apparent change of occurrence with
evolutionary stage.

track the intake manifold pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate
targets by manipulating the EGR valve and variable geometry turbine (VGT) while
satisfying state and control constraints. The MPC controller is designed and
verified using a high-fidelity engine model in GT-Power. The controller
exploits a low-order rate-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model for
prediction which is identified from transient response data generated by the
GT-Power model. It is shown that transient engine thermal dynamics influence
the airpath dynamics, specifically the intake manifold pressure response,
however, MPC demonstrates robustness against inaccuracies in modeling these
thermal dynamics. In particular, we show that MPC can be successfully
implemented using a rate-based prediction model with two inputs (EGR and VGT
positions) identified from data with steady-state wall temperature dynamics,
however, closed-loop performance can be improved if a prediction model (i) is
identified from data with transient thermal dynamics, and (ii) has the fuel
injection rate as extra model input. Further, the MPC calibration process
across the engine operating range to achieve improved performance is addressed.
As the MPC calibration is shown to be sensitive to the operating conditions, a
fast calibration process is proposed.

decorrelations from perturbations in the media itself. For in-line imaging
modalities, which are appealing because they are compact, require no moving
parts, and are robust, negating the effects of such scattering becomes
particularly challenging. Here we explore the effect of stationary scattering
media on light scattering in in-line geometries, including digital holographic
microscopy. We consider various object-scatterer scenarios where the object is
distorted or obscured by additional stationary scatterers, and use an advanced
deep learning (DL) generative methodology, generative adversarial networks
(GANs), to mitigate the effects of the additional scatterers. Using light
scattering simulations and experiments on objects of interest with and without
additional scatterers, we find that conditional GANs can be quickly trained
with minuscule datasets and can also efficiently learn the one-to-one
statistical mapping between the cross-domain input-output image pairs. Training
such a network yields a standalone model, that can be used later to inverse or
negate the effect of scattering, yielding clear object reconstructions for
object retrieval and downstream processing. Moreover, it is well-known that the
coherent point spread function (c-PSF) of a stationary scattering optical
system is a speckle pattern which is spatially shift variant. We show that with
rapid training using only 20 image pairs, it is possible to negate this
undesired scattering to accurately localize diffraction-limited impulses with
high spatial accuracy, therefore transforming the earlier shift variant system
to a linear shift invariant (LSI) system.

experimentally, statistical analyses must rely on pre-specified causal models.
Causal discovery algorithms are empirical methods for constructing such causal
models from data.
  Several asymptotically correct methods already exist, but they generally
struggle on smaller samples. Moreover, most methods focus on very sparse causal
models, which may not always be a realistic representation of real-life data
generating mechanisms. Finally, while causal relationships suggested by the
methods often hold true, their claims about causal non-relatedness have high
error rates. This non-conservative error tradeoff is not ideal for
observational sciences, where the resulting model is directly used to inform
causal inference: A causal model with many missing causal relations entails too
strong assumptions and may lead to biased effect estimates.
  We propose a new causal discovery method that addresses these three
shortcomings: Supervised learning discovery (SLdisco). SLdisco uses supervised
machine learning to obtain a mapping from observational data to equivalence
classes of causal models.
  We evaluate SLdisco in a large simulation study based on Gaussian data and we
consider several choices of model size and sample size. We find that SLdisco is
more conservative, only moderately less informative and less sensitive towards
sample size than existing procedures.
  We furthermore provide a real epidemiological data application. We use random
subsampling to investigate real data performance on small samples and again
find that SLdisco is less sensitive towards sample size and hence seems to
better utilize the information available in small datasets.

in large-$c$ CFTs where we find that OTOCs display an exponential, an
oscillatory and a power-law behaviour in the heating phase, the non-heating

Ising CFT representing an integrable model, OTOCs never display such

between integrable and chaotic CFT models subjected to a periodic drive. We
further explore properties of the light-cone which is characterized by the
corresponding butterfly velocity as well as the Lyapunov exponent.

the so-called ""island of inversion"" where in the ground states $sd$-shell
neutrons are promoted to the $fp$-shell orbitals across the shell gap,
resulting in the disappearance of the canonical neutron magic number $N=20$.
Purpose: The primary goals of this work are to extend the level scheme of
$^{32}$Mg, provide spin-parity assignments to excited states, and discuss the
microscopic structure of each state through comparisons with theoretical
calculations. Method: In-beam $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy of $^{32}$Mg was
performed using two direct-reaction probes, one-neutron (two-proton) knockout
reactions on $^{33}$Mg ($^{34}$Si). Final-state exclusive cross sections and
parallel momentum distributions were extracted from the experimental data and
compared with eikonal-based reaction model calculations combined with
shell-model overlap functions. Results: Owing to the remarkable selectivity of
the one-neutron and two-proton knockout reactions, a significantly updated
level scheme for $^{32}$Mg, which exhibits negative-parity intruder and
positive-parity normal states, was constructed. The experimental results were
confronted with four different nuclear structure models. Conclusions: In some
of these models, different aspects of $^{32}$Mg and the transition into the
island of inversion are well described. However, unexplained discrepancies
remain, and even with the help of these state-of-the-art theoretical

nothing but a wonder of biology, physics, and engineering. By utilizing dynamic
soaring, the bird can travel in the desired flight direction almost for free by
harvesting energy from the wind. Dynamic soaring biological inspiration has
triggered a momentous interest among many communities of science and
engineering. Studying, modeling, and simulating dynamic soaring have been
conducted in literature by mostly configuring dynamic soaring as an optimal
control problem. Said configuration requires accurate dynamic system modeling
of the albatross/mimicking-object, accurate wind profile models, and a defined
mathematical formula of an objective function that aims at conserving energy
and minimizing its dissipation. However, the experimental observations of
albatrosses indicate their ability to conduct dynamic soaring in real time.
Indeed, a functioning modeling and control framework for dynamic soaring that
allows for a meaningful bio-mimicry of the albatross needs to be autonomous,
real-time, stable, and capable of tolerating the absence of mathematical
expressions of the wind profiles and the objective function, hypothetically
similar to what the bird does. The qualifications of such modeling and control
framework are the very same characteristics of the so-called extremum seeking
systems. In this paper, we propose an extremum seeking modeling and control
framework for the dynamic soaring problem. We provide and discuss the problem
setup, design, and stability of the introduced framework. Our results,
supported by simulations and comparison with optimal control methods of the
literature, provide a proof of concept that the dynamic soaring phenomenon can
be a natural expression of extremum seeking. Hence, dynamic soaring has the
potential to be performed autonomously and in real-time with stability
guarantees.

central charge is given by the black hole mass, echoing results on black hole
entropy from near-horizon diffeomorphism symmetry. The finite symmetry
transformations generated by these conserved charges correspond to Galilean and
conformal transformations of the static field and of the coordinates. This new

show that the (horizontal) symmetry protecting the vanishing of the Love

with one of the sl$(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators of the Schr\""{o}dinger group.
Then, it is demonstrated that the HJPSS symmetry is selected thanks to the
spontaneous breaking of the full Schr\""{o}dinger symmetry at the horizon down
to a simple abelian sub-group. The latter can be understood as the symmetry
protecting the regularity of the test field at the horizon. In the
4-dimensional case, this provides a symmetry protection for the vanishing of
the Schwarzschild Love numbers. Our results trivially extend to the Kerr case.

inflection tables, which then serve as training and evaluation data for various

cross-linguistic inconsistencies, that arise from the lack of a clear
linguistic and operational definition of what is a word, and that severely
impair the universality of the derived tasks. To overcome this deficiency, we
propose to view morphology as a clause-level phenomenon, rather than
word-level. It is anchored in a fixed yet inclusive set of features, that
encapsulates all functions realized in a saturated clause. We deliver
MightyMorph, a novel dataset for clause-level morphology covering 4
typologically-different languages: English, German, Turkish and Hebrew. We use
this dataset to derive 3 clause-level morphological tasks: inflection,
reinflection and analysis. Our experiments show that the clause-level tasks are
substantially harder than the respective word-level tasks, while having
comparable complexity across languages. Furthermore, redefining morphology to
the clause-level provides a neat interface with contextualized language models
(LMs) and allows assessing the morphological knowledge encoded in these models
and their usability for morphological tasks. Taken together, this work opens up
new horizons in the study of computational morphology, leaving ample space for
studying neural morphology cross-linguistically.

silica and related glasses for greater thermodynamic stability during

continuously for 10% <= x <= 70% during experiments. The increase in fragility
may correspond to an increase in surface enhanced diffusion, as fragility and
surface diffusion are correlated. We observe that for the silicates
investigated, while surface enhanced diffusion increases with fragility, the
enhancement is quite small. The slower diffusing Si and O atoms have higher
enhancements, which could allow for some surface stabilization effects. We
demonstrate that there are only small changes in atomic arrangements,
consistent with the similar diffusion rates, at the surface as compared to

compared to current GW detectors, and it is designed to extend the observation
band down to a few Hz. At these frequencies, a major limitation of the ET
sensitivity is predicted to be due to gravitational fluctuations produced by
the environment, most importantly by the seismic field, which give rise to the
so-called Newtonian noise (NN). Accurate models of ET NN are crucial to assess
the compatibility of an ET candidate site with the ET sensitivity target also
considering a possible reduction of NN by noise cancellation. With NN models
becoming increasingly complex as they include details of geology and
topography, it is crucial to have tools to make robust assessments of their
accuracy. For this purpose, we derive a lower bound on seismic NN spectra,
which is weakly dependent on geology and properties of the seismic field. As a
first application, we use the lower limit to compare it with NN estimates
recently calculated for the Sardinia and Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) candidate

predictions for the EMR site, which indicates that ET NN models require further

membrane within the framework of a systematic perturbative renormalization
group (RG). A power-counting analysis shows that the leading singularities of
correlation functions can be analyzed within an effective renormalizable model
in which the kinetic energy of in-plane phonons and subleading geometrical
nonlinearities in the expansion of the strain tensor are neglected. For
membranes at zero temperature, governed by zero-point motion, the RG equations
of the effective model provide a systematic derivation of logarithmic
corrections to the bending rigidity and to the elastic Young modulus derived in
earlier investigations. In the limit of a weakly applied external tension, the
stress-strain relation at $T = 0$ is anomalous: the linear Hooke's law is
replaced with a singular law exhibiting logarithmic corrections. For small, but
finite temperatures, we use techniques of finite-size scaling to derive general
relations between the zero-temperature RG flow and scaling laws of
thermodynamic quantities such as the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$,
the entropy S, and the specific heat C. A combination of the scaling relations
with an analysis of thermal fluctuations shows that, for small temperatures,
the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ is negative and logarithmically
dependent on $T$, as predicted in an earlier work. Although the requirement
$\lim_{T \to 0} \alpha = 0$, expected from the third law of thermodynamics is
formally satisfied, $\alpha$ is predicted to exhibit such a slow variation to
remain practically constant down to unaccessibly small temperatures.

  Cost Functions",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of online convex optimization algorithms in a dynamic
environment is often expressed in terms of the dynamic regret, which measures
the decision maker's performance against a sequence of time-varying
comparators. In the analysis of the dynamic regret, prior works often assume
Lipschitz continuity or uniform smoothness of the cost functions. However,
there are many important cost functions in practice that do not satisfy these
conditions. In such cases, prior analyses are not applicable and fail to
guarantee the optimization performance. In this letter, we show that it is
possible to bound the dynamic regret, even when neither Lipschitz continuity
nor uniform smoothness is present. We adopt the notion of relative smoothness
with respect to some user-defined regularization function, which is a much
milder requirement on the cost functions. We first show that under relative
smoothness, the dynamic regret has an upper bound based on the path length and
functional variation. We then show that with an additional condition of
relatively strong convexity, the dynamic regret can be bounded by the path
length and gradient variation. These regret bounds provide performance
guarantees to a wide variety of online optimization problems that arise in
different application domains. Finally, we present numerical experiments that
demonstrate the advantage of adopting a regularization function under which the
cost functions are relatively smooth.

and medical research. Distributional copula regression provides a flexible tool
to model the joint distribution of multiple outcome variables by disentangling
the marginal response distributions and their dependence structure. In a
regression setup each parameter of the copula model, i.e. the marginal
distribution parameters and the copula dependence parameters, can be related to
covariates via structured additive predictors. We propose a framework to fit
distributional copula regression models via a model-based boosting algorithm.
Model-based boosting is a modern estimation technique that incorporates useful
features like an intrinsic variable selection mechanism, parameter shrinkage
and the capability to fit regression models in high dimensional data setting,
i.e. situations with more covariates than observations. Thus, model-based
boosting does not only complement existing Bayesian and maximum-likelihood
based estimation frameworks for this model class but rather enables unique
intrinsic mechanisms that can be helpful in many applied problems. The
performance of our boosting algorithm in the context of copula regression
models with continuous margins is evaluated in simulation studies that cover
low- and high-dimensional data settings and situations with and without
dependence between the responses. Moreover, distributional copula boosting is
used to jointly analyze and predict the length and the weight of newborns

identification of the relevant terms in the PDEs and their parameters is
usually indirect. Here, we adapt a recently developed method to automatically

coarse-grained fields onto generic low order PDEs. We test the method
extensively on computational models, and then apply it to data from experiments
on microtubule-based active nematics. Thereby, we identify the optimal models
for microtubule-based active nematics, along with the relevant phenomenological
parameters. We find that the dynamics of the orientation field are largely
governed by its coupling to the underlying flow, with free-energy gradients
playing a negligible role. Furthermore, by fitting the flow equation to

Realistic extensions of the model in which assets may be jointly owned by

they are not robust to tiny input perturbations known as adversarial examples.
First we illustrate how to generate valid adversarial images that can easily
cause incorrect image attribution. Then we describe an approach to prevent
imperceptible adversarial attacks on deep visual fingerprinting models, via
robust contrastive learning. The proposed training procedure leverages training
on $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversarial examples, it is conceptually simple and
incurs only a small computational overhead. The resulting models are
substantially more robust, are accurate even on unperturbed images, and perform
well even over a database with millions of images. In particular, we achieve
91.6% standard and 85.1% adversarial recall under $\ell_\infty$-bounded

first introduce a formulation of a racing game with realistic safety and
fairness rules. A high-level planner approximates the original formulation as a
discrete game with simplified state, control, and dynamics to easily encode the
complex safety and fairness rules and calculates a series of target waypoints.
The low-level controller takes the resulting waypoints as a reference
trajectory and computes high-resolution control inputs by solving an
alternative formulation approximation with simplified objectives and
constraints. We consider two approaches for the low-level planner, constructing
two hierarchical controllers. One approach uses multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), and the other solves a linear-quadratic Nash game (LQNG) to
produce control inputs. The controllers are compared against three baselines:
an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed racing line,
and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line. Quantitative results show
that the proposed hierarchical methods outperform their respective baseline
methods in terms of head-to-head race wins and abiding by the rules. The
hierarchical controller using MARL for low-level control consistently
outperformed all other methods by winning over 90% of head-to-head races and
more consistently adhered to the complex racing rules. Qualitatively, we
observe the proposed controllers mimicking actions performed by expert human
drivers such as shielding/blocking, overtaking, and long-term planning for
delayed advantages. We show that hierarchical planning for game-theoretic
reasoning produces competitive behavior even when challenged with complex rules
and constraints.

interact asynchronously in pairs chosen at random. Each agent starts in the
same initial state $s$. We introduce the *dynamic size counting* problem:
approximately counting the number of agents in the presence of an adversary who
at any time can remove any number of agents or add any number of new agents in
state $s$. A valid solution requires that after each addition/removal event,
resulting in population size $n$, with high probability each agent ""quickly""
computes the same constant-factor estimate of the value $\log_2 n$ (how quickly
is called the *convergence* time), which remains the output of every agent for
as long as possible (the *holding* time). Since the adversary can remove
agents, the holding time is necessarily finite: even after the adversary stops
altering the population, it is impossible to *stabilize* to an output that
never again changes.
  We first show that a protocol solves the dynamic size counting problem if and
only if it solves the *loosely-stabilizing counting* problem: that of
estimating $\log n$ in a *fixed-size* population, but where the adversary can
initialize each agent in an arbitrary state, with the same convergence time and
holding time. We then show a protocol solving the loosely-stabilizing counting
problem with the following guarantees: if the population size is $n$, $M$ is
the largest initial estimate of $\log n$, and s is the maximum integer
initially stored in any field of the agents' memory, we have expected
convergence time $O(\log n + \log M)$, expected polynomial holding time, and
expected memory usage of $O(\log^2 (s) + (\log \log n)^2)$ bits. Interpreted as
a dynamic size counting protocol, when changing from population size $n_{prev}$
to $n_{next}$, the convergence time is $O(\log n_{next} + \log \log n_{prev})$.

taking into account material supply (geological) uncertainty to manage the
associated risk. Although simulated annealing has been shown to outperform
comparing methods for solving the SSOMC, early performance might dominate
recent performance in that a combination of the heuristics' performance is used
to determine which perturbations to apply. This work proposes a data-driven
framework for heuristic scheduling in a fully self-managed hyper-heuristic to
solve the SSOMC. The proposed learn-to-perturb (L2P) hyper-heuristic is a
multi-neighborhood simulated annealing algorithm. The L2P selects the heuristic
(perturbation) to be applied in a self-adaptive manner using reinforcement
learning to efficiently explore which local search is best suited for a
particular search point. Several state-of-the-art agents have been incorporated
into L2P to better adapt the search and guide it towards better solutions. By
learning from data describing the performance of the heuristics, a
problem-specific ordering of heuristics that collectively finds better
solutions faster is obtained. L2P is tested on several real-world mining
complexes, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, and generalization
capacity. Results show a reduction in the number of iterations by 30-50% and in

few experimental tests. Developing composite manufacturing digital twins for
SFRP composite processes, including injection molding and extrusion deposition
additive manufacturing (EDAM) requires extensive experimental material
characterization. In particular, characterizing the composite mechanical
properties is time consuming and therefore, micromechanics models are used to
fully identify the elasticity tensor. Hence, the objective of this paper is to
infer the fiber orientation and the effective polymer modulus and therefore,
identify the elasticity tensor of the composite with minimal experimental
tests. To that end, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model coupled with a
micromechanics model to infer the fiber orientation and the polymer elastic
modulus simultaneously which we then use to estimate the composite elasticity
tensor. We motivate and demonstrate the methodology for the EDAM process but
the development is such that it is applicable to other SFRP composites
processed via other methods. Our results demonstrate that the approach provides
a reliable framework for the inference, with as few as three tensile tests,
while accounting for epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Posterior predictive
checks show that the model is able to recreate the experimental data well. The
ability of the Bayesian approach to calibrate the material properties and its
associated uncertainties, make it a promising tool for enabling a probabilistic
predictive framework for composites manufacturing digital twins.

many domains. In order to accurately estimate such treatment effects, one
typically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments.
Currently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is
often confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data
is confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually
too small to learn heterogeneous treatment effects. In this paper, we propose
to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining large amounts of
observational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation
learning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: first, we use
observational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation);
and then, we use randomized data to learn the data-specific structures. We
analyze the finite sample properties of our framework and compare them to
several natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining
observational and randomized data is beneficial, and for when it is not. Based
on this, we introduce a sample-efficient algorithm, called CorNet. We use
extensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and
multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method's superiority compared
to existing methods.

identical, irrotational stars modeled by the SLy nuclear equation of state
(EOS). They are initially in quasicircular orbit and threaded with a poloidal
magnetic field that extends from the stellar interior into the exterior, as in
typical pulsars. We insert neutrino processes shortly after the merger and
focus on the role of neutrinos in launching a jet following the collapse of the
hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant to a spinning black hole (BH). We
treat two microphysical versions: one (a ""warm-up"") evolving a single neutrino
species and considering only charged-current processes, and the other evolving
three species $(\nu_e, \bar{\nu}_e, \nu_{\rm x})$ and related processes. We
trace the evolution until the system reaches a quasiequilibrium state after BH
formation. We find that the BH + disk remnant eventually launches an incipient
jet. The electromagnetic Poynting luminosity is $\sim 10^{53} \rm \, erg\,
s^{-1}$, consistent with that of typical short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). The
effect of neutrino cooling shortens the lifetime of the HMNS, and lowers the
amplitude of the major peak of the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum
somewhat. After BH formation, neutrinos help clear out the matter near the BH
poles, resulting in lower baryon-loaded surrounding debris. The neutrino
luminosity resides in the range $\sim 10^{52-53} \rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$ once
quasiequilibrium is achieved. Comparing with the neutrino-free models, we
observe that the inclusion of neutrinos yields similar ejecta masses and is
inefficient in carrying off additional angular momentum.

this can sustain a magnetic dynamo. We reanalyse the dynamo mechanism, arising
from the slow crystallization of the core, and find convective turnover times
$t_{\rm conv}$ of weeks to months - longer by orders of magnitude than
previously thought. With white dwarf spin periods $P\ll t_{\rm conv}$,
crystallization-driven dynamos are almost always in the fast rotating regime,
where the magnetic field $B$ is at least in equipartition with the convective
motion and is possibly further enhanced by a factor of $B\propto (t_{\rm

growth of the crystallized core using MESA and compute the magnetic field
$B(T_{\rm eff})$ as a function of the white dwarf's effective temperature

heavy elements that are expected to sink out of visible layers on short
timescales. This has been interpreted as a signature of ongoing accretion of
debris from asteroids, comets, and giant planets. This scenario is supported by
the detection of debris discs and transits of planetary fragments around some
white dwarfs. However, photospheric metals are only indirect evidence for
ongoing accretion, and the inferred accretion rates and parent body
compositions heavily depend on models of diffusion and mixing processes within
the white dwarf atmosphere. Here we report a 4.4$\sigma$ detection of X-rays
from a polluted white dwarf, G29$-$38, using a 106 ks exposure with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory, demonstrating directly that the star is currently accreting.
From the measured X-ray luminosity, we find an instantaneous accretion rate of
$\dot{M_{\rm X}}=1.63^{+1.29}_{-0.40}\times 10^{9}\mathrm{\,g\,s^{-1}}$. This
is the first direct measurement of the accretion rate onto the white dwarf,
which is independent of stellar atmosphere models. This rate exceeds estimates
based on past studies of the photospheric abundances by more than a factor two,
and implies that convective overshoot has to be accounted for in modelling the
spectra of debris-accreting white dwarfs. We measure a low plasma temperature
of $kT=0.5\pm0.2\,\mathrm{keV}$, corroborating the predicted bombardment
solution for white dwarfs accreting at low accretion rates. Offering a new
method for studying evolved planetary systems, these observations provide the
opportunity to independently measure the instantaneous accretion rate of
planetary material, and therefore investigate the timescale of accretion onto
white dwarfs, and the evolution and replenishment of debris disks.

semi-Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) GRMHD model for various $T_{\rm e}$
parameters, bearing M87 in mind. We find an LP-CP separation in the images of
the low-$T_{\rm e}$ disk cases at 230 GHz; namely, the LP flux mainly
originates from downstream of the jet and the CP flux comes from the
counter-side jet, while the total intensity is maximum at the jet base. This
can be understood as follows: although the LP flux is generated through
synchrotron emission widely around the black hole, most of the LP flux from the
jet base does not reach the observer, since it undergoes Faraday rotation
($\propto T_{\rm e}^{-2}$) when passing through the outer cold disk and is thus
depolarized. Hence, only the LP flux from the downstream (not passing the cold
dense plasmas) can survive. Meanwhile, the CP flux is generated from the LP
flux by Faraday conversion ($\propto T_{\rm e}$) in the inner hot region.
Stronger CP flux is thus observed from the counter-side jet. Moreover, the
LP-CP separation is more enhanced at a lower frequency such as 86 GHz but is
rather weak at 43 GHz, since the media in the latter case is optically thick
for synchrotron self-absorption so that all the fluxes should come from the
photosphere. The same is true for cases with higher mass accretion rates and/or
larger inclination angles.

entanglement due to decoherence and evolve to a mixed state with only classical
correlations. Here, we show that measurements can stabilize quantum
entanglement within open quantum systems. Specifically, in random unitary
circuits with dephasing at the boundary, we find both numerically and
analytically that projective measurements performed at a small nonvanishing
rate results in a steady state with an $L^{1/3}$ power-law scaling entanglement
negativity within the system. Using an analytical mapping to a statistical
mechanics model of directed polymers in a random environment, we show that the
power-law negativity scaling can be understood as Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
fluctuations due to the random measurement locations. Further increasing the
measurement rate leads to a phase transition into an area-law negativity phase,
which is of the same universality as the entanglement transition in monitored
random circuits without decoherence.

domain walls in the ordered phase form bound states reminiscent of mesons. The
system first relaxes towards a prethermal state, described by a Gibbs ensemble
with conserved meson number. The prethermal state arises from rare events in
which mesons are created in close vicinity, leading to an avalanche of
scattering events. Only at much later times a true thermal equilibrium is
achieved in which the meson number conservation is violated by a mechanism akin
to the Schwinger effect. The discussed prethermalization dynamics is directly
relevant to generic one-dimensional, many-body systems with confined

densities. We study the halo occupation distribution model (HOD) of the
selected samples by matching them to their corresponding dark matter halos in
the IllustrisTNG dark matter run. We find the HOD of both the LRG and ELG
samples to be consistent with their respective baseline models, but also we
find important deviations from common assumptions about the satellite
distribution, velocity bias, and galaxy secondary biases. We identify strong
evidence for concentration-based and environment-based occupational variance in
both samples, an effect known as ""galaxy assembly bias"". The central and
satellite galaxies have distinct dependencies on secondary halo properties,
showing that centrals and satellites have distinct evolutionary trajectories

complexities in modeling galaxy-halo connection for DESI analyses and also
prepare for building high-fidelity mock galaxies. Finally, we present a

ambiguous requests. The intent is to compensate for imperfect natural language
via visual observations. Early symbolic methods, based on manually defined
symbols, built modular framework consist of semantic parsing and task planning
for producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern
connectionist methods employ deep neural networks to automatically learn visual
and linguistic features and map to a sequence of low-level actions, in an
endto-end fashion. These two approaches are blended to create a hybrid, modular
framework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via
deep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners.
Connectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition
Language. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal
representation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing
action sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further
incorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions. To learn
generic features for vision and language, we propose to separately pretrain
vision and language encoders on scene graph parsing and semantic textual
similarity tasks. Benchmarking evaluates the impacts of different components
of, or options for, the vision-and-language learning model and shows the
effectiveness of pretraining strategies. Manipulation experiments conducted in
the simulator AI2THOR show the robustness of the framework to novel scenarios.

perform an analysis of the largest young SN Ia sample to date. We compare 115
SN Ia light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility to the turtls model grid
containing light curves of Chandrasekhar-mass explosions with a range of nickel
masses, nickel distributions and explosion energies. We find that the majority
of our observed light curves are well reproduced by Chandrasekhar-mass
explosion models with a preference for highly extended nickel distributions. We
identify six SNe Ia with an early-time flux excess in our g- and r-band data
(four `blue' and two `red' flux excesses). We find an intrinsic rate of 18+/-11
per cent of early flux excesses in SNe Ia at z < 0.07, based on three detected
flux excesses out of 30 (10 per cent) observed SNe Ia with a simulated
efficiency of 57 per cent. This is comparable to rates of flux excesses in the
literature but also accounts for detection efficiencies. Two of these events
are mostly consistent with CSM interaction, while the other four have longer
lifetimes in agreement with companion interaction and nickel-clump models. We

strongly depend on the initially symmetry breaking, constraining the nature of

are chosen by searching efficiently through the Clifford parameter space via
classical simulation. The resulting initial states always equal or outperform
traditional classical initialization (e.g., Hartree-Fock), and enable
high-accuracy VQA estimations. CAFQA is well-suited to classical computation

correlation energy that is lost in Hartree-Fock initialization. CAFQA achieves
mean accuracy improvements of 6.4x and 56.8x, over the state-of-the-art, on
different metrics. The scalability of the approach allows for preliminary
ground state energy estimation of the challenging chromium dimer (Cr$_2$)
molecule. With CAFQA's high-accuracy initialization, the convergence of VQAs is
shown to accelerate by 2.5x, even for small molecules.
  Furthermore, preliminary exploration of allowing a limited number of
non-Clifford (T) gates in the CAFQA framework, shows that as much as 99.9% of
the correlation energy can be recovered at bond lengths for which Clifford-only
CAFQA accuracy is relatively limited, while remaining classically simulable.

diffusion equations, we develop a deterministic particle method for the
weighted porous medium equation (WPME) and prove its convergence on bounded

porous medium equations. From a numerical analysis perspective, our method has
several advantages: it is meshfree, preserves the gradient flow structure of
the underlying PDE, converges in arbitrary dimension, and captures the correct
asymptotic behavior in simulations.
  That our method succeeds in capturing the long time behavior of WPME is
significant from the perspective of related problems in quantization. Just as
the Fokker-Planck equation provides a way to quantize a probability measure
$\bar{\rho}$ by evolving an empirical measure according to stochastic Langevin
dynamics so that the empirical measure flows toward $\bar{\rho}$, our particle
method provides a way to quantize $\bar{\rho}$ according to deterministic
particle dynamics approximating WMPE. In this way, our method has natural
applications to multi-agent coverage algorithms and sampling probability
measures.
  A specific case of our method corresponds exactly to confined mean-field
dynamics of training a two-layer neural network for a radial basis function
activation function. From this perspective, our convergence result shows that,
in the overparametrized regime and as the variance of the radial basis
functions goes to zero, the continuum limit is given by WPME. This generalizes
previous results, which considered the case of a uniform data distribution, to
the more general inhomogeneous setting. As a consequence of our convergence
result, we identify conditions on the target function and data distribution for
which convexity of the energy landscape emerges in the continuum limit.

three issues: 1) How to ensure that generated samples are believable, realistic

synthesized image? 3) How to improve the explainability of a text-to-image
generation framework? In this work, we constructed two novel data sets (i.e.,
the Good & Bad bird and face data sets) consisting of successful as well as
unsuccessful generated samples, according to strict criteria. To effectively

generating Good latent codes, we use a dedicated Good/Bad classifier for

Further, experimental data are collected under various conditions (inputs),

enhancement via exponentiation. Thirdly, we plug the learned denoiser into the

structure alternating a denoising step with a gradient-descent data-fidelity
step. We have validated AIRI against CLEAN, optimization algorithms of the SARA
family, and a DNN trained to reconstruct the image directly from visibility

serious inequality remains in the domestic sphere, especially around parenting.
The present study analyses discussions about parenting on Reddit to explore
audience effects and gender stereotypes. It suggests a novel method to study
topical variation in individuals' language when interacting with different
audiences. Comments posted in 2020 were collected from three parenting
subreddits, described as being for fathers (r/Daddit), mothers (r/Mommit), and
all parents (r/Parenting). Users posting on r/Parenting and r/Daddit or on
r/Parenting and r/Mommit were assumed to identify as fathers or mothers,
respectively, allowing gender comparison. Users' comments on r/Parenting (to a
mixed-gender audience) were compared with their comments to single-gender
audiences on r/Daddit or r/Mommit using LDA topic modelling. Results showed
that the most discussed topic among parents is about education and family
advice, a topic mainly discussed in the mixed-gender subreddit and more by
fathers than mothers. Regarding the basic needs of children (sleep, food, and
medical care), mothers seemed to be more concerned regardless of the audience.
In contrast, topics such as birth and pregnancy announcements and physical
appearance were more discussed by fathers in the father-centric subreddit.
Overall, findings seem to show that mothers are generally more concerned about
the practical sides of parenting while fathers' expressed concerns are more
contextual: with other fathers, there seems to be a desire to show their
fatherhood and be recognized for it while they discuss education with mothers.
These results demonstrate that concerns expressed by parents on Reddit are
context-sensitive but also consistent with gender stereotypes, potentially
reflecting a persistent gendered and unequal division of labour in parenting.

holography and more accurate phenomenological predictions. In this work, we
focus on a mixing of glueball and meson mass eigenstates that arises from the
DBI action as a finite Nf/Nc effect. For concreteness, we work in the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, and show that this mixing must be treated in
conjunction with the backreaction of the flavor branes onto the background
geometry. Including the backreaction with the simplification that it is
""smeared out"" over the compact transverse direction, we derive a corrected
effective action for the vector glueball and scalar states. Along the way, we
observe a Stueckelberg-like mechanism that restores translation invariance in
the transverse direction. We also derive a general technique, that lends itself
easily to numerics, for finding mass eigenstates of Lagrangians with
vector-scalar mixing. We then calculate the first order corrections to the mass
spectra of both the vector and scalar particles, and show that the term that
explicitly mixes vector and scalar states is the most significant correction to
the masses of low-lying scalar mesons.

private ML models on datasets with public features and sensitive private
labels. Despite its rigorous privacy guarantee, it has been observed that in

trained with label-DP can be evaluated on the public training features to
recover, with high accuracy, the very private labels that it was designed to
protect. In this work, we argue that this phenomenon is not paradoxical and
that label-DP is designed to limit the advantage of an LIA adversary compared
to predicting training labels using the Bayes classifier. At label-DP
$\epsilon=0$ this advantage is zero, hence the optimal attack is to predict
according to the Bayes classifier and is independent of the training labels.
Our bound shows the semantic protection conferred by label-DP and gives

each vehicle as a knapsack with a capacity given by the remaining service time
available along the vehicle's route. We combine these approximations with

significant role in advanced network management systems. It is especially
challenging in case of dynamic adaptive streaming schemes over HTTP (DASH)
which has increasingly complex characteristics including additional playback
issues. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of adaptive video streaming
quality assessment. Upon our review of related works, we analyze and compare
different variations of objective QoE assessment models with or without using
machine learning techniques for adaptive video streaming. Through the
performance analysis, we observe that hybrid models perform better than both
quality-of-service (QoS) driven QoE approaches and signal fidelity measurement.
Moreover, the machine learning-based model slightly outperforms the model
without using machine learning for the same setting. In addition, we find that
existing video streaming QoE assessment models still have limited performance,
which makes it difficult to be applied in practical communication systems.
Therefore, based on the success of deep learned feature representations for
traditional video quality prediction, we also apply the off-the-shelf deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN) to evaluate the perceptual quality of
streaming videos, where the spatio-temporal properties of streaming videos are
taken into consideration. Experiments demonstrate its superiority, which sheds
light on the future development of specifically designed deep learning
frameworks for adaptive video streaming quality assessment. We believe this

practice by missing data arising from the sampling design or other random

To address this limitation, we propose a nonparametric variable selection

describe all the different modes by which information can flow. To achieve
this, we propose a novel information-theoretic measure of temporal dependency
($I_{\tau sx}$) based on informative and misinformative local probability mass

decomposition to spontaneous spiking activity recorded from dissociated neural
cultures of rat cerebral cortex to show how different modes of information
processing are distributed over the system. Furthermore, being a localizable

The current GradArgmax ignores the ""long-term"" benefit of the perturbation. It
is faced with zero-gradient and invalid benefit estimates in certain
situations. (2) In the reinforcement learning-based attack methods, the learned
attack strategies might not be transferable when the attack budget changes. To
this end, we first formulate the perturbation space and propose an evaluation
framework and the projective ranking method. We aim to learn a powerful attack
strategy then adapt it as little as possible to generate adversarial samples
under dynamic budget settings. In our method, based on mutual information, we
rank and assess the attack benefits of each perturbation for an effective
attack strategy. By projecting the strategy, our method dramatically minimizes
the cost of learning a new attack strategy when the attack budget changes. In
the comparative assessment with GradArgmax and RL-S2V, the results show our
method owns high attack performance and effective transferability. The
visualization of our method also reveals various attack patterns in the

seagrass. We show that the impedance to flow due to the seagrass results in an
unstable velocity shear layer at the canopy interface, leading to a periodic
array of vortices that propagate downstream. Each passing vortex locally
weakens the along-stream velocity at the canopy top, reducing the drag and
allowing the deformed grass to straighten up just beneath it. This causes the
grass to oscillate periodically. Crucially, the maximal grass deflection is out
of phase with the vortices. A phase diagram for the onset of instability shows
its dependence on the fluid Reynolds number and an effective buoyancy
parameter. Less buoyant grass is more easily deformed by the flow and forms a
weaker shear layer, with smaller vortices and less material exchange across the
canopy top. While higher Reynolds number leads to stronger vortices and larger
waving amplitudes of the seagrass, waving is maximized at intermediate grass
buoyancy. All together, our theory and computations correct some misconceptions
in interpretation of the mechanism and provide a robust explanation consistent

information about the stability of the molecular species being investigated. It
is shown that simulations restricted to valence spaces incorrectly predict the
hydroxyl radical to be more stable than the hydroxide anion. Inclusion of
dynamical electron correlation from non-valence orbitals is demonstrated,
through the integration of the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum

  Monte Carlo Tree Search",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decision-making under uncertainty (DMU) is present in many important
problems. An open challenge is DMU in non-stationary environments, where the
dynamics of the environment can change over time. Reinforcement Learning (RL),
a popular approach for DMU problems, learns a policy by interacting with a
model of the environment offline. Unfortunately, if the environment changes the
policy can become stale and take sub-optimal actions, and relearning the policy
for the updated environment takes time and computational effort. An alternative
is online planning approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which
perform their computation at decision time. Given the current environment, MCTS
plans using high-fidelity models to determine promising action trajectories.
These models can be updated as soon as environmental changes are detected to
immediately incorporate them into decision making. However, MCTS's convergence
can be slow for domains with large state-action spaces. In this paper, we
present a novel hybrid decision-making approach that combines the strengths of
RL and planning while mitigating their weaknesses. Our approach, called Policy
Augmented MCTS (PA-MCTS), integrates a policy's actin-value estimates into
MCTS, using the estimates to seed the action trajectories favored by the
search. We hypothesize that PA-MCTS will converge more quickly than standard
MCTS while making better decisions than the policy can make on its own when
faced with nonstationary environments. We test our hypothesis by comparing
PA-MCTS with pure MCTS and an RL agent applied to the classical CartPole
environment. We find that PC-MCTS can achieve higher cumulative rewards than
the policy in isolation under several environmental shifts while converging in
significantly fewer iterations than pure MCTS.

excellent, parameter-free agreement with time-averaged data from 280 numerical

for an extensive suite of 2D neutral fluid turbulence test problems. Numerical
solutions are verified via comparison to a semi-analytic linear eigensolver as
well as to the finite difference Global Drift Ballooning (GDB) code. However,
it is found that turbulent simulations that conserve both energy and enstrophy
tend to have too much power at high wavenumber and that this part of the
spectrum should be controlled by reintroducing artificial dissipation. The DG
formulation allows upwinding of the advection operator which dissipates
enstrophy while still maintaining conservation of energy. Coupling upwinded DG
with implicit symplectic integration appears to offer the best compromise of
allowing mid-range wavenumbers to reach the appropriate amplitude while still
controlling the high-wavenumber part of the spectrum.

sensor networks is studied. There are $n$ heterogeneous sensors and a fusion
center. The sensors are clustered into $K$ groups, and different groups follow
different data-generating distributions. At some unknown time, an event occurs
in the network and changes the data-generating distribution of the sensors. The
goal is to detect the change as quickly as possible, subject to false alarm
constraints. The anonymous setting is studied, where at each time step, the
fusion center receives $n$ unordered samples, and the fusion center does not
know which sensor each sample comes from, and thus does not know its exact
distribution. A simple optimality proof is first derived for the mixture
likelihood ratio test, which was constructed and proved to be optimal for the
non-sequential anonymous setting in (Chen and Wang, 2019). For the QCD problem,
a mixture CuSum algorithm is further constructed, and is further shown to be
optimal under Lorden's criterion. For large networks, a computationally
efficient test is proposed and a novel theoretical characterization of its
false alarm rate is developed. Numerical results are provided to validate the

clinical target volume (CTV) in radiation oncology less subjective and more
scientifically based. The specific objective of this study is to investigate
similarities and differences between two methods that model tumor spread beyond
the visible gross tumor volume (GTV): 1. The shortest path model, which is the
standard method of adding a geometric GTV-CTV margin, and 2. The
reaction-diffusion model.
  Approach: These two models to capture the invisible tumor ""fire front"" are
defined and compared in mathematical terms. The models are applied to example
cases that represent tumor spread in non-uniform and anisotropic media with
anatomical barriers.
  Main Results: The two seemingly disparate models bring forth traveling waves
that can be associated with the front of tumor growth outward from the GTV. The
shape of the fronts is similar for both models. Differences are seen in cases
where the diffusive flow is reduced due to anatomical barriers, and in complex
spatially non-uniform cases. The diffusion model generally leads to smoother
fronts. The smoothness can be controlled with a parameter defined by the ratio
of the diffusion coefficient and the proliferation rate.
  Significance: Defining the CTV has been described as the weakest link of the
radiotherapy chain. There are many similarities in the mathematical description
and the behavior of the common geometric GTV-CTV expansion method, and the
definition of the CTV tumor front via the reaction-diffusion model. Its
mechanistic basis and the controllable smoothness make the diffusion model an
attractive alternative to the standard GTV-CTV margin model.

technology to derive the cascade condition and the giant component of

we find a dual role of the hyperedge in propagation: when the average
hyperdegree is small, increasing the size of the hyperedges may make the system
fragile, while the average hyperdegree is relatively large, the increase of the
hyperedges causes the system to be robust. Then, we identify the effects of
threshold, hyperdegree, and hyperedge heterogeneities. The heterogeneity of
individual thresholds causes the system to be more fragile, while the
heterogeneity of individual hyperdegrees or hyperedges increases the robustness
of the system. Finally, we show that the higher hyperdegree a vertex has, the
larger possibility and faster speed it will get activated. We verify these
results by simulating meme spreading on both random hypergraph models and

focus on vanadium redox flow batteries and use the optimization algorithm to

minimizing the electrical and flow pressure power losses. To understand how
these designs improve performance, we analyze the polarization of the reactant

there is a critical need to improve our understanding of the physical processes
that cause dimmings as well as their relationship with CMEs. In this study, we
investigate coronal dimmings by combining simulation and observational efforts.
By utilizing a data-constrained global magnetohydrodynamics model (AWSoM:
Alfven-wave Solar Model), we simulate coronal dimmings resulting from different
CME energetics and flux rope configurations. We synthesize the emissions of
different EUV spectral bands/lines and compare with SDO/AIA and EVE
observations. A detailed analysis of the simulation and observation data
suggests that the transient dimming / brightening are related to plasma heating
processes, while the long-lasting core and remote dimmings are caused by mass
loss process induced by the CME. Moreover, the interaction between the erupting
flux rope with different orientations and the global solar corona could
significantly influence the coronal dimming patterns. Using metrics such as
dimming depth and dimming slope, we investigate the relationship between
dimmings and CME properties (e.g., CME mass, CME speed) in the simulation. Our
result suggests that coronal dimmings encode important information about the
associated CMEs, which provides a physical basis for detecting stellar CMEs
from distant solar-like stars.

fully utilized. However, offloading computing tasks to vehicles faces many
challenging issues. In this paper, we introduce a vehicular fog-edge computing
paradigm and formulate it as a multi-stage Stackelberg game to deal with these
issues. Specifically, vehicles are not obligated to share resources, let alone
disclose their private information (e.g., stay time and the amount of
resources). Therefore, in the first stage, we design a contract-based incentive
mechanism to motivate vehicles to contribute their idle resources. Next, due to
the complicated interactions among vehicles, road-side unit (RSU), MEC server

parties and design a transaction mechanism to make all entities benefit. In the
second and third stages, based on Stackelberg game, we develop pricing

optimal strategies for each stage are given. Simulation results demonstrate the

From 20 deg$^2$ of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Wide layer, we
identify 17 dwarf satellite candidates around NGC 4437, a spiral galaxy with
about one-fourth of the MW stellar mass. We estimate their distances using the
surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method. Then we confirm five candidates as
members of the NGC 4437 group, resulting in a total of seven group members.
Combining the NGC 4437 group (with $\Delta m_{12} = 2.5$ mag) with other groups
in the literature, we find a stratification of the satellite number by $\Delta
m_{12}$ for a given host stellar mass. The satellite number for given host
stellar mass decreases as $\Delta m_{12}$ increases. The same trend is found in
simulated galaxy groups in IllustrisTNG50 simulations. We also find that the
host galaxies in groups with a smaller $\Delta m_{12}$ (like NGC 4437) have
assembled their halo mass more recently than those in larger gap groups, and
that their stellar-to-halo mass ratios (SHMRs) increase as $\Delta m_{12}$

Unfortunately, existing stochastic program synthesizers do not meet this

we first propose a general profit-oriented framework to address the problem of
revenue maximization based on economic behavior, and compute the 0n-shelf
Popular and most Profitable Products (OPPPs) for the targeted marketing. To
tackle the revenue maximization problem, we model the k-satisfiable product

evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

  Theory and Algorithm","16 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a fundamental problem in machine learning, dataset shift induces a
paradigm to learn and transfer knowledge under changing environment. Previous
methods assume the changes are induced by covariate, which is less practical
for complex real-world data. We consider the Generalized Label Shift (GLS),
which provides an interpretable insight into the learning and transfer of
desirable knowledge. Current GLS methods: 1) are not well-connected with the
statistical learning theory; 2) usually assume the shifting conditional
distributions will be matched with an implicit transformation, but its explicit
modeling is unexplored. In this paper, we propose a conditional adaptation
framework to deal with these challenges. From the perspective of learning
theory, we prove that the generalization error of conditional adaptation is
lower than previous covariate adaptation. Following the theoretical results, we
propose the minimum uncertainty principle to learn conditional invariant
transformation via discrepancy optimization. Specifically, we propose the
\textit{conditional metric operator} on Hilbert space to characterize the
distinctness of conditional distributions. For finite observations, we prove
that the empirical estimation is always well-defined and will converge to
underlying truth as sample size increases. The results of extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance under
different GLS scenarios.

multiscale problems which may have singularities in some special portions of
the computational domain. For example, in the simulation of steady flow
transporting through highly heterogeneous porous media driven by extraction
wells, the singularities lie in the near-well regions. The basic idea of the
combined method is to utilize the traditional finite element method (FEM)
directly on a fine mesh of the problematic part of the domain and using the
LOD-based MsFEM on a coarse mesh of the other part. The key point is how to
define local correctors for the basis functions of the elements near the coarse
and fine mesh interface, which require meticulous treatment. The proposed
method takes advantages of the traditional FEM and the LOD-based MsFEM, which
uses much less DOFs than the standard FEM and may be more accurate than the
LOD-based MsFEM for problems with singularities. The error analysis is carried
out for highly varying coefficients, without any assumptions on scale
separation or periodicity. {Numerical examples with periodic and random highly
oscillating coefficients}, as well as the multiscale problems on the L-shaped
domain, and multiscale problems with high-contrast channels or

methods borrowed from dynamical systems (chaos) theory, which aim to uncover
the \emph{Lagrangian kinematics} of these flows: namely how fluid particle
trajectories (which form a dynamical system) are organized and interact and the
associated impacts on solute transport and mixing. This dynamical systems
approach to transport is inherently Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian kinematics
form Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), special sets of trajectories that
divide the Lagrangian frame into chaotic mixing regions, poorly mixing hold-up
regions (and in some cases non-mixing ``islands'') and the transport barriers
that organise these regions. Hence the dynamical systems approach provides
insights into flows that may exhibit chaotic, regular (non-chaotic) or mixed
Lagrangian kinematics, and also into how LCSs organize solute transport and
mixing. Novel experimental methods are only recently permitting visualization
of LCSs are in porous media flows. In this primer we review the dynamical
systems approach to porous media flow and transport and connect the associated
tools and techniques with the latest research findings from pore to Darcy

Although the unimodal Gaussian distribution is usually chosen as a parametric

employ the Gaussian mixture distribution as a parametric distribution. A main
difficulty of variational inference with the Gaussian mixture is how to
approximate the entropy of the Gaussian mixture. We approximate the entropy of
the Gaussian mixture as the sum of the entropy of the unimodal Gaussian, which
can be analytically calculated. In addition, we theoretically analyze the
approximation error between the true entropy and approximated one in order to
reveal when our approximation works well. Specifically, the approximation error
is controlled by the ratios of the distances between the means to the sum of
the variances of the Gaussian mixture. Furthermore, it converges to zero when
the ratios go to infinity. This situation seems to be more likely to occur in
higher dimensional parametric spaces because of the curse of dimensionality.
Therefore, our result guarantees that our approximation works well, for

applications in social networks, citation networks, and bioinformatics. One of
the most popular models is graph attention networks. They were introduced to
allow a node to aggregate information from features of neighbor nodes in a
non-uniform way, in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not
distinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we theoretically study the
behaviour of graph attention networks. We prove multiple results on the
performance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem of node
classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here, the node features
are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block
model. We show that in an ""easy"" regime, where the distance between the means
of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention is able to distinguish
inter-class from intra-class edges. Thus it maintains the weights of important
edges and significantly reduces the weights of unimportant edges. Consequently,
we show that this implies perfect node classification. In the ""hard"" regime, we
show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from
inter-class edges. In addition, we show that graph attention convolution cannot
(almost) perfectly classify the nodes even if intra-class edges could be
separated from inter-class edges. Beyond perfect node classification, we
provide a positive result on graph attention's robustness against structural
noise in the graph. In particular, our robustness result implies that graph
attention can be strictly better than both the simple graph convolution and the

attention from both academia and industry due to their fast generation speed.
One limitation of NAR-TTS models is that they ignore the correlation in time
and frequency domains while generating speech mel-spectrograms, and thus cause
blurry and over-smoothed results. In this work, we revisit this over-smoothing
problem from a novel perspective: the degree of over-smoothness is determined
by the gap between the complexity of data distributions and the capability of
modeling methods. Both simplifying data distributions and improving modeling
methods can alleviate the problem. Accordingly, we first study methods reducing
the complexity of data distributions. Then we conduct a comprehensive study on
NAR-TTS models that use some advanced modeling methods. Based on these studies,
we find that 1) methods that provide additional condition inputs reduce the
complexity of data distributions to model, thus alleviating the over-smoothing
problem and achieving better voice quality. 2) Among advanced modeling methods,
Laplacian mixture loss performs well at modeling multimodal distributions and
enjoys its simplicity, while GAN and Glow achieve the best voice quality while
suffering from increased training or model complexity. 3) The two categories of
methods can be combined to further alleviate the over-smoothness and improve
the voice quality. 4) Our experiments on the multi-speaker dataset lead to
similar conclusions as above and providing more variance information can reduce
the difficulty of modeling the target data distribution and alleviate the
requirements for model capacity.

embeds the identity information into the carrier imperceptibly. Then the
identity can be extracted to prove the copyright from the watermarked carrier

technologies take the nature images as carriers. Different from the natural
images, document images are not so rich in color and texture, and thus have
less redundant information to carry watermarks. This paper proposes an
end-to-end document image watermarking scheme using the deep neural network.
Specifically, an encoder and a decoder are designed to embed and extract the
watermark. A noise layer is added to simulate the various attacks that could be
encountered in reality, such as the Cropout, Dropout, Gaussian blur, Gaussian
noise, Resize, and JPEG Compression. A text-sensitive loss function is designed
to limit the embedding modification on characters. An embedding strength
adjustment strategy is proposed to improve the quality of watermarked image
with little loss of extraction accuracy. Experimental results show that the
proposed document image watermarking technology outperforms three

classical multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) problem. It is well-known that
photometric stereo (PS) is excellent at recovering high-frequency surface
details, whereas multi-view stereo (MVS) can help remove the low-frequency
distortion due to PS and retain the global geometry of the shape. This paper
proposes an approach that can effectively utilize such complementary strengths
of PS and MVS. Our key idea is to combine them suitably while considering the
per-pixel uncertainty of their estimates. To this end, we estimate per-pixel
surface normals and depth using an uncertainty-aware deep-PS network and
deep-MVS network, respectively. Uncertainty modeling helps select reliable
surface normal and depth estimates at each pixel which then act as a true
representative of the dense surface geometry. At each pixel, our approach
either selects or discards deep-PS and deep-MVS network prediction depending on
the prediction uncertainty measure. For dense, detailed, and precise inference
of the object's surface profile, we propose to learn the implicit neural shape
representation via a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Our approach encourages the
MLP to converge to a natural zero-level set surface using the confident
prediction from deep-PS and deep-MVS networks, providing superior dense surface
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark dataset show
that our method provides high-quality shape recovery with a much lower memory
footprint while outperforming almost all of the existing approaches.

application in the domain of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. In this
paper, we consider the problem of automatically identifying the classes of the
products placed on racks in retail stores from an image of the rack and
information about the query/product images. We improve upon the existing
approaches in terms of effectiveness and memory requirement by developing a
two-stage object detection and recognition pipeline comprising of a
Faster-RCNN-based object localizer that detects the object regions in the rack
image and a ResNet-18-based image encoder that classifies the detected regions
into the appropriate classes. Each of the models is fine-tuned using
appropriate data sets for better prediction and data augmentation is performed
on each query image to prepare an extensive gallery set for fine-tuning the
ResNet-18-based product recognition model. This encoder is trained using a
triplet loss function following the strategy of online-hard-negative-mining for
improved prediction. The proposed models are lightweight and can be connected
in an end-to-end manner during deployment for automatically identifying each
product object placed in a rack image. Extensive experiments using Grozi-32k

analytically and numerically. To achieve invariance with respect to a discrete

circular target space that interacts with fermionic isodublets through the
Yukawa interaction. It is shown that the diagonal and antidiagonal parts of the
fermionic wave function interact independently with the external field of the
sine-Gordon kink. The wave functions of the fermionic scattering states are
expressed in terms of the Heun functions. General expressions for the

the fermion momentum and mass are studied numerically. The existence condition
is found for two fermionic zero modes, and their analytical expressions are
obtained. It is shown that the zero modes do not lead to fragmentation of the
fermionic charge, but can lead to polarization of the fermionic vacuum. The
scattering of the diagonal and antidiagonal fermionic states is found to be
significantly different; this difference is shown to be due to the different
dependences of the energy levels of these bound states on the fermion mass, and

recommendation. However, since there is no manually annotated label for user
interests, existing approaches always follow the paradigm of entangling these
two aspects, which may lead to inferior recommendation accuracy and
interpretability. In this paper, to address it, we propose a Contrastive
learning framework to disentangle Long and Short-term interests for
Recommendation (CLSR) with self-supervision. Specifically, we first propose two
separate encoders to independently capture user interests of different time
scales. We then extract long-term and short-term interests proxies from the
interaction sequences, which serve as pseudo labels for user interests. Then
pairwise contrastive tasks are designed to supervise the similarity between
interest representations and their corresponding interest proxies. Finally,
since the importance of long-term and short-term interests is dynamically
changing, we propose to adaptively aggregate them through an attention-based
network for prediction. We conduct experiments on two large-scale real-world
datasets for e-commerce and short-video recommendation. Empirical results show
that our CLSR consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models with
significant improvements: GAUC is improved by over 0.01, and NDCG is improved
by over 4%. Further counterfactual evaluations demonstrate that stronger
disentanglement of long and short-term interests is successfully achieved by
CLSR. The code and data are available at

knowledge from unlabeled data. This technique requires a balanced mixture of
two ingredients: positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) samples. This is
typically achieved by maintaining a queue of negative samples during training.
Prior works in the area typically uses a fixed-length negative sample queue,
but how the negative sample size affects the model performance remains unclear.
The opaque impact of the number of negative samples on performance when
employing contrastive learning aroused our in-depth exploration. This paper
presents a momentum contrastive learning model with negative sample queue for
sentence embedding, namely MoCoSE. We add the prediction layer to the online
branch to make the model asymmetric and together with EMA update mechanism of
the target branch to prevent the model from collapsing. We define a maximum
traceable distance metric, through which we learn to what extent the text
contrastive learning benefits from the historical information of negative
samples. Our experiments find that the best results are obtained when the
maximum traceable distance is at a certain range, demonstrating that there is
an optimal range of historical information for a negative sample queue. We

tool for solving 3D scene understanding tasks. While recent works show that
point cloud convolutions can be invariant to translation and point permutation,
investigations of the rotation invariance property for point cloud convolution
has been so far scarce. Some existing methods perform point cloud convolutions
with rotation-invariant features, existing methods generally do not perform as
well as translation-invariant only counterpart. In this work, we argue that a
key reason is that compared to point coordinates, rotation-invariant features
consumed by point cloud convolution are not as distinctive. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective convolution operator that enhances
feature distinction by designing powerful rotation invariant features from the
local regions. We consider the relationship between the point of interest and
its neighbors as well as the internal relationship of the neighbors to largely
improve the feature descriptiveness. Our network architecture can capture both
local and global context by simply tuning the neighborhood size in each
convolution layer. We conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world
point cloud classifications, part segmentation, and shape retrieval to evaluate
our method, which achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy under challenging

accuracy (with real experimental data) and able to accommodate
complex/non-convex object shapes; 2) contact force solving, which
precisely/robustly enforces physics of contact (i.e., no penetration, Coulomb
friction, maximum energy dissipation) with contact mechanics of contact nodes
augmented with that of their object; 3) contact detection with a neural
network, which is parallelized for each contact point, thus, can be computed
very quickly even for complex shape objects with no exhaust pair-wise test; and
4) time integration with PMI (passive mid-point integration), whose
discrete-time passivity improves overall simulation accuracy, stability, and
speed. We then implement our proposed framework for two

class information to the model. Prior work along this vein have largely used
expensive per-instance annotation or singular class-level descriptions, but
per-instance descriptions are hard to scale and single class descriptions may
not be rich enough. Furthermore, these works have used natural-language
descriptions exclusively, simple bi-encoders models, and modality or
task-specific methods. These approaches have several limitations: text
supervision may not always be available or optimal and bi-encoders may only
learn coarse relations between inputs and class descriptions. In this work, we
present SemSup, a novel approach that uses (1) a scalable multiple description

alternative description formats such as JSON that are easy to generate and
outperform text on certain settings, and (3) hybrid lexical-semantic similarity

public cooperation among human beings and other species has been widely
accepted by the public. However, the positive role of altruistic punishment in
enhancing cooperation will be undermined if corruption is considered. Recently,
behavioral experiments have confirmed this finding and further investigated the
effects of the leader's punitive power and the economic potential.
Nevertheless, there are relatively few studies focusing on how these factors
affect the evolution of cooperation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we
combine institutional punishment public goods games with bribery games to
investigate the effects of the above factors on the evolution of cooperation.
Theoretical and numerical results reveal that the existence of corruption will
reduce the level of cooperation when cooperators are more inclined to provide
bribes. In addition, we demonstrate that stronger leader and richer economic
potential are both important to enhance cooperation. In particular, when
defectors are more inclined to provide bribes, stronger leaders can sustain the
contributions of public goods from cooperators if the economic potential is
weak.

diversified to such an extent that identifying candidate libraries for specific

prominent, actively-developed visualisation libraries in the Python ecosystem

produce near-identical thematic maps across static and an interactive 'tracks'

ultra-thin layers with 10B atoms is presented. The reaction between a thermal
neutron and a 10B atom releases 2 secondary particles, namely a 7Li ion and an
alpha particle, which due to momentum conservation are emitted in opposite
directions, along the same line (back to back). Current boron coated neutron
detectors are equipped with 10B films with thicknesses of several micrometers,
deposited on very thick substrate plates. However, since the ranges of the 7Li
ion and the alpha particle are of few micrometeres in most materials, one of
these particles is always lost in the 10B layer or substrate. As such, these
detectors lose the ability to reconstruct the reaction line of action and to
precisely determine the neutron position, as only one of the two secondary
particles track can be measured. With the technique now presented, the sum of
the 10B layer and the substrate thicknesses is small enough to allow for both
secondary particles to escape and ionize the gas in opposite sides of the 10B
converter foil. Independent readout structures, one on each side of the 10B
converter foil, detect each secondary particle and determine its track centroid
and the deposited energy. Since the two secondary particles are emitted back to
back, the neutron position can be obtained by combining the information
recorded by the two readout structures. Through GEANT4 simulations, we verified
that the spatial resolution can be significantly improved: our results show
that, by using a B4C layer with a thickness of 1 micron on a 0.9 micron Mylar
substrate, the spatial resolution can by improved by a factor of 8, compared to
conventional detectors with thick 10B detection layers.

To mitigate the network interference and thus enhance the system performance,
some highly-effective resource partitioning mechanisms are introduced for

association and resource allocation parameters are coupling in such a

initiation algorithm according to the conventional best channel association,

to train the noise detection module in an adversarial fashion; and ii) the main
training phase for which the trained noise detection module is used to identify

  Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals","16 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The article proposes an approach to complete-type and related
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals that neither requires knowledge of the
delay-Lyapunov matrix function nor does it involve linear matrix inequalities.
The approach is based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
approximate the time-delay system. The ODEs are derived via spectral methods,
e.g., the Chebyshev collocation method (also called pseudospectral
discretization) or the Legendre tau method. A core insight is that the
Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem resembles a theorem for Lyapunov-Rumyantsev partial
stability in ODEs. For the linear approximating ODE, only a Lyapunov equation
has to be solved to obtain a partial Lyapunov function. The latter approximates
the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Results are validated by applying
Clenshaw-Curtis and Gauss quadrature to a semi-analytical result of the
functional, yielding a comparable finite dimensional approximation. In
particular, the article provides a formula for a tight quadratic lower bound,
which is important in applications. Examples confirm that this new bound is
significantly less conservative than known results.

  Distillation","AAAI2022 oral accepted",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generally, humans are more skilled at perceiving differences between
high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images than directly judging the quality
of a single LQ image. This situation also applies to image quality assessment
(IQA). Although recent no-reference (NR-IQA) methods have made great progress
to predict image quality free from the reference image, they still have the
potential to achieve better performance since HQ image information is not fully
exploited. In contrast, full-reference (FR-IQA) methods tend to provide more
reliable quality evaluation, but its practicability is affected by the
requirement for pixel-level aligned reference images. To address this, we
firstly propose the content-variant reference method via knowledge distillation
(CVRKD-IQA). Specifically, we use non-aligned reference (NAR) images to
introduce various prior distributions of high-quality images. The comparisons
of distribution differences between HQ and LQ images can help our model better
assess the image quality. Further, the knowledge distillation transfers more
HQ-LQ distribution difference information from the FR-teacher to the
NAR-student and stabilizing CVRKD-IQA performance. Moreover, to fully mine the
local-global combined information, while achieving faster inference speed, our
model directly processes multiple image patches from the input with the
MLP-mixer. Cross-dataset experiments verify that our model can outperform all
NAR/NR-IQA SOTAs, even reach comparable performance with FR-IQA methods on some
occasions. Since the content-variant and non-aligned reference HQ images are
easy to obtain, our model can support more IQA applications with its relative
robustness to content variations. Our code and more detailed elaborations of
supplements are available: https://github.com/guanghaoyin/CVRKD-IQA.

collaboratively evolved based on their complementarity throughout the training,
which again results in generating more accurate consensus iteratively. After
training, we convert the multi-branch architecture back to the original target
model by removing the auxiliary heads, thus there is no extra inference cost
for the deployment. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that ConCF significantly improves the generalization of the model
by exploiting the complementarity from heterogeneous objectives.

state-independent advantage for systems of $n\ge 2$ qubits and are, therefore,
fundamental tools for investigating the interface between classical and quantum
physics. A theorem by Arkhipov (arXiv:1209.3819) states that $n$-qubit magic
sets in which each observable is in exactly two subsets of compatible
observables can be reduced either to the two-qubit magic square or the
three-qubit magic pentagram [N. D. Mermin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 3373 (1990)].
An open question is whether there are magic sets that cannot be reduced to the
square or the pentagram. If they exist, a second key question is whether they
require $n >3$ qubits, since, if this is the case, these magic sets would
capture minimal state independent quantum advantage that is specific for
$n$-qubit systems with specific values of $n$. Here, we answer both questions
affirmatively. We identify magic sets which cannot be reduced to the square or
the pentagram and require $n=3,4,5$, or $6$ qubits. In addition, we prove a
generalized version of Arkhipov's theorem providing an efficient algorithm for,
given a hypergraph, deciding whether or not it can accommodate a magic set, and
solve another open problem, namely, given a magic set, obtaining the tight
bound of its associated noncontextuality inequality.

  High-Resolution Priors","Accepted to ACM MM2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A key challenge of real-world image super-resolution (SR) is to recover the
missing details in low-resolution (LR) images with complex unknown degradations
(e.g., downsampling, noise and compression). Most previous works restore such
missing details in the image space. To cope with the high diversity of natural
images, they either rely on the unstable GANs that are difficult to train and
prone to artifacts, or resort to explicit references from high-resolution (HR)
images that are usually unavailable. In this work, we propose Feature Matching
SR (FeMaSR), which restores realistic HR images in a much more compact feature
space. Unlike image-space methods, our FeMaSR restores HR images by matching
distorted LR image {\it features} to their distortion-free HR counterparts in
our pretrained HR priors, and decoding the matched features to obtain realistic
HR images. Specifically, our HR priors contain a discrete feature codebook and
its associated decoder, which are pretrained on HR images with a Vector
Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN). Notably, we incorporate a
novel semantic regularization in VQGAN to improve the quality of reconstructed
images. For the feature matching, we first extract LR features with an LR
encoder consisting of several Swin Transformer blocks and then follow a simple
nearest neighbour strategy to match them with the pretrained codebook. In
particular, we equip the LR encoder with residual shortcut connections to the
decoder, which is critical to the optimization of feature matching loss and
also helps to complement the possible feature matching errors. Experimental
results show that our approach produces more realistic HR images than previous
methods. Codes are released at \url{https://github.com/chaofengc/FeMaSR}.

captured under diverse illumination conditions to ensure consistent
performance. However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination
conditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using
synthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the
drawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current
state-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain
gap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average
performance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source
domain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step
framework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the
domain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized
images are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to
the same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain
gap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a
style mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed
to construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain
generalized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without
prior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based
on extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA $\to$

systems, connecting systems that differ in their number of Cooper pairs. This
paper presents a model-independent derivation of pairing rotations within an
effective theory that exploits the emergent breaking of U(1) phase symmetries.
The symmetries are realized nonlinearly and the Nambu-Goldstone modes depend
only on time because the system is finite. Semi-magic nuclei exhibit pairing
rotational bands while the pairing spectrum becomes an elliptical paraboloid
for open-shell nuclei. Model-independent relations between double
charge-exchange reactions and alpha particle capture or knockout in open-shell
nuclei are in analogy to the pair transfer reactions in a single superfluid.
Odd semi-magic nuclei are described by coupling a fermion to the superfluid.
The leading-order theories reproduce data for pairing rotational bands within
uncertainty estimates.

aggregated claims data including medical diagnoses from the statutory health
insurance with roughly 70 million insurants will be published on a regular
basis. Validity of the diagnoses in such big data sets can hardly be assessed.
In case the data set comprises prevalence, incidence and mortality, it is
possible to estimate the proportion of false positive diagnoses using
mathematical relations from the illness-death model. We apply the method to
age-specific aggregated claims data from 70 million Germans about type 2
diabetes in Germany stratified by sex and report the findings in terms of the
ratio of false positive diagnoses of type 2 diabetes (FPR) in the data set. The
age-specific FPR for men and women changes with age. In men, the FPR increases
linearly from 1 to 3 per mil in the age 30 to 50. For ages between 50 to 80
years, FPR remains below 4 per mil. After 80 years of age, we have an increase
to about 5 per mil. In women, we find a steep increase from age 30 to 60, the
peak FPR is reached at about 12 per mil between 60 and 70 years of age. After
age 70, the FPR of women drops tremendously. In all age-groups, the FPR is
higher in women than in men. In terms of absolute numbers, we find that there
are 217 thousand people with a false-positive diagnosis in the data set (95%
confidence interval, CI: 204 to 229), the vast majority women (172 thousand,
95% CI: 162 to 180). Our work indicates that possible false positive (and
negative) diagnoses should appropriately be dealt with in claims data, e.g., by
inclusion of age- and sex-specific error terms in statistical models, to avoid
potentially biased or wrong conclusions.

exploits the Set Shaping Theory whose goal is the study the bijection functions
f(X)=Y that transform a set of strings into a set of equal size made up of
strings of greater length. In this way, this type of function transforms the
independent variable x into the dependent variable y whose emission probability
is conditioned by the previously emitted variables. Thus, if the decoder
decodes a symbol associated with a conditional probability equal to zero, we
detect an error in the message. If the function f used is the one that
minimizes the average information content, we develop a code that can be tested

matrix completion. We study both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed regimes, where
the underlying distribution of heavy-tailed data is assumed to have bounded
moments of some order. We propose new estimators based on 1-bit quantized data.
In sub-Gaussian regime, our estimators achieve near minimax rates, indicating
that our quantization scheme costs very little. In heavy-tailed regime, while
the rates of our estimators become essentially slower, these results are either

type soundness should address not only the semantics of a single language, but
how it interacts with others. Even between type-safe languages, disparate
features frustrate interoperability, as invariants from one language can easily
be violated in the other. In their seminal 2007 paper, Matthews and Findler
proposed a multi-language construction that augments the interoperating
languages with a pair of boundaries that allow code from one language to be
embedded in the other. While the technique has been widely applied, their
syntactic source-level interoperability doesn't reflect practical
implementations, where behavior of interaction is defined after compilation to
a common target, and any safety must be ensured by target invariants or
inserted target-level ""glue code.""
  In this paper, we present a framework for the design and verification of
sound language interoperability that follows an
interoperation-after-compilation strategy. Language designers specify what data
can be converted between types of the languages via a relation $\tau_A \sim
\tau_B$ and specify target glue code implementing conversions. Then, by giving
a semantic model of source types as sets of target terms, we can establish
soundness of conversions: i.e., whenever $\tau_A \sim \tau_B$, the
corresponding pair of conversions convert target terms that behave as $\tau_A$
to target terms that behave as $\tau_B$, and vice versa. We can then prove
semantic type soundness for the entire system. We illustrate our framework via
a series of case studies that demonstrate how our semantic
interoperation-after-compilation approach allows us both to account for complex
differences in language semantics and make efficiency trade-offs based on
particularities of compilers or targets.

capability of imaging the internal body by using a noninvasive, radiation safe
technique, and the absence of known hazards. In this paper we introduce a novel
idea of using EIT in microelectrodes during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
surgery in order to obtain an image of the electrical conductivities of the
brain tissues surrounding the microelectrodes. DBS is a surgical treatment
involving the implantation of a medical probe inside the brain. For such
application, the EIT reconstruction method has to offer both high quality and
robustness against noise. Methods: A post-processing method for open-domain EIT
is introduced in this paper, which combines linear and nonlinear methods in
order to use the advantages of both with limited drawbacks. The reconstruction
method is a two-steps method, the first solves the inverse problem with a
linear algorithm and the second brings the nonlinear aspects back into the
image. Results: The proposed method is tested on both simulation and phantom
data, and compared to three widely used method for EIT imaging. Resulting
images and errors gives a strong advantage to the proposed solution.
Conclusion: High quality reconstruction from phantom data validates the
efficiency of the novel reconstruction method. Significance: This feasibility
study presents an efficient method for open domain EIT and opens the way to
clinical trials.

does not influence the state of a classical equilibrium system: there is no
equilibrium classical magnetism, since the magnetic field does not do work. We
revisit this famous no-go result and consider a classical charged Brownian
particle interacting with an equilibrium bath. We confirm that the Bohr-Van
Leeuwen theorem holds for the long-time (equilibrium) state of the particle.
But the external static, homogeneous magnetic field does influence the
long-time state of the thermal bath, which is described via the
Caldeira-Leggett model. In particular, the magnetic field induces an average
angular momentum for the (uncharged!) bath, which separates into two sets
rotating in opposite directions. The effect relates to the bath going slightly
out of equilibrium under the influence of the Brownian particle and persists
for arbitrarily long times. In this context we studied the behavior of the two
other additive integrals of motion, energy and linear momentum. The situation
with linear momentum is different, because it is dissipated away by (and from)
the bath modes. The average energy of the bath mode retains the magnetic field
as a small correction. Thus, only the bath angular momentum really feels the
magnetic field for long times.

Nonetheless, conventional large-sample theory for quantile regression does not
apply sufficiently far in the tails of the probability distribution of the
dependent variable. To overcome this limitation that could be crucial when the
interest lies on flood events, hydrological post-processing through extremal
quantile regression is introduced here for estimating the extreme quantiles of
hydrological model's responses. In summary, the new hydrological
post-processing method exploits properties of the Hill's estimator from the
extreme value theory to extrapolate quantile regression's predictions to high
quantiles. As a proof of concept, the new method is here tested in
post-processing daily streamflow simulations provided by three process-based
hydrological models for 180 basins in the contiguous United States (CONUS) and
is further compared to conventional quantile regression. With this large-scale
comparison, it is demonstrated that hydrological post-processing using
conventional quantile regression severely underestimates high quantiles (at the
quantile level 0.9999) compared to hydrological post-processing using extremal
quantile regression, although both methods are equivalent at lower quantiles
(at the quantile level 0.9700). Moreover, it is shown that, in the same

for simulating domains with homogeneous features, whereas the expensive
high-fidelity (fine) model describes microscopic features with refined
discretization, often making the overall cost prohibitively high, especially
for time-dependent problems. In this work, we explore the idea of multiscale
modeling with machine learning and employ DeepONet, a neural operator, as an
efficient surrogate of the expensive solver. DeepONet is trained offline using
data acquired from the fine solver for learning the underlying and possibly
unknown fine-scale dynamics. It is then coupled with standard PDE solvers for
predicting the multiscale systems with new boundary/initial conditions in the

fashion datasets, and how computer vision supports cultural representation and

  with Rejection from ECG Recordings",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of deep learning-based methods, automated classification
of electrocardiograms (ECGs) has recently gained much attention. Although the
effectiveness of deep neural networks has been encouraging, the lack of
information given by the outputs restricts clinicians' reexamination. If the
uncertainty estimation comes along with the classification results,
cardiologists can pay more attention to ""uncertain"" cases. Our study aims to
classify ECGs with rejection based on data uncertainty and model uncertainty.
We perform experiments on a real-world 12-lead ECG dataset. First, we estimate
uncertainties using the Monte Carlo dropout for each classification prediction,
based on our Bayesian neural network. Then, we accept predictions with
uncertainty under a given threshold and provide ""uncertain"" cases for
clinicians. Furthermore, we perform a simulation experiment using varying
thresholds. Finally, with the help of a clinician, we conduct case studies to
explain the results of large uncertainties and incorrect predictions with small
uncertainties. The results show that correct predictions are more likely to
have smaller uncertainties, and the performance on accepted predictions
improves as the accepting ratio decreases (i.e. more rejections). Case studies
also help explain why rejection can improve the performance. Our study helps
neural networks produce more accurate results and provide information on
uncertainties to better assist clinicians in the diagnosis process. It can also
enable deep-learning-based ECG interpretation in clinical implementation.

extensive growth of heterogeneous wireless devices. Wireless signal recognition
is becoming increasingly more significant for spectrum monitoring, spectrum
management, secure communications, among others. Consequently, comprehensive
spectrum awareness on the edge has the potential to serve as a key enabler for
the emerging beyond 5G networks. State-of-the-art studies in this domain have
(i) only focused on a single task - modulation or signal (protocol)
classification - which in many cases is insufficient information for a system
to act on, (ii) consider either radar or communication waveforms (homogeneous
waveform category), and (iii) does not address edge deployment during neural
network design phase. In this work, for the first time in the wireless
communication domain, we exploit the potential of deep neural networks based
multi-task learning (MTL) framework to simultaneously learn modulation and
signal classification tasks while considering heterogeneous wireless signals
such as radar and communication waveforms in the electromagnetic spectrum. The
proposed MTL architecture benefits from the mutual relation between the two
tasks in improving the classification accuracy as well as the learning
efficiency with a lightweight neural network model. We additionally include
experimental evaluations of the model with over-the-air collected samples and
demonstrate first-hand insight on model compression along with deep learning
pipeline for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We demonstrate
significant computational, memory, and accuracy improvement of the proposed
model over two reference architectures. In addition to modeling a lightweight
MTL model suitable for resource-constrained embedded radio platforms, we
provide a comprehensive heterogeneous wireless signals dataset for public use.

interpolation points and apply it to linear algebra. For instance, $A$ be a
linear operator satisfying a degree $n$ polynomial equation $P(A)=0$. One can
see that the evaluation of a meromorphic function $F$ at $A$ is equal to
$Q(A)$, where $Q$ is the degree $<n$ interpolation polynomial of $F$ with the
the set of interpolation points equal to the set of roots of the polynomial
$P$. In particular, for $A$ an $n \times n$ matrix, there is a common belief
that for computing $F(A)$ one has to reduce $A$ to its Jordan form. Let $P$ be
the characteristic polynomial of $A$. Then by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem,
$P(A)=0$. And thus the matrix $F(A)$ can be found without reducing $A$ to its
Jordan form. Computation of the Jordan form for $A$ involves many extra
computations. In the paper we show that it is not needed. One application is to
compute the matrix exponential for a matrix with repeated eigenvalues, thereby
solving arbitrary order linear differential equations with constant
coefficients.

under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different
parties in terms of the election result.

and 1 in 4 men experiencing some form of partner-related violence every year.
Existing research has shown a strong association between alcohol use and DV at
the individual level. Accordingly, alcohol use could also be a predictor for DV
at the neighborhood level, helping identify the neighborhoods where DV is more
likely to happen. However, it is difficult and costly to collect data that can
represent neighborhood-level alcohol use especially for a large geographic
area. In this study, we propose to derive information about the alcohol outlet
visits of the residents of different neighborhoods from anonymized mobile phone
location data, and investigate whether the derived visits can help better
predict DV at the neighborhood level. We use mobile phone data from the company
SafeGraph, which is freely available to researchers and which contains
information about how people visit various points-of-interest including alcohol
outlets. In such data, a visit to an alcohol outlet is identified based on the
GPS point location of the mobile phone and the building footprint (a polygon)
of the alcohol outlet. We present our method for deriving neighborhood-level
alcohol outlet visits, and experiment with four different statistical and
machine learning models to investigate the role of the derived visits in
enhancing DV prediction based on an empirical dataset about DV in Chicago. Our
results reveal the effectiveness of the derived alcohol outlets visits in
helping identify neighborhoods that are more likely to suffer from DV, and can
inform policies related to DV intervention and alcohol outlet licensing.

of the considered system is very sensitive to tracking errors. Therefore, to
assess the benefits of MRR-based UAV deployment for FSO communications, the
MRR-based UAV FSO channel is characterized by taking into account tracking
system errors along with UAV's orientation fluctuations, link length, UAV's
height, optical beam divergence angle, effective area of MRR, atmospheric
turbulence and optical channel loss in the double-pass channels. To enable
effective performance analysis, tractable and closed-form expressions are
derived for probability density function of end-to-end signal to noise ratio,
outage probability and bit error rate of the considered system under both
weak-to-moderate and moderate-to-strong atmospheric turbulence conditions. The
accuracy of the analytical expressions is verified by extensive simulations.
Analytical results are then used to study the relationship between the optimal
