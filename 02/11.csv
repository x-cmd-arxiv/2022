of a probabilistic learning inference that allows for estimating a posterior
probability model for a stochastic boundary value problem from a prior
probability model. The given targets are statistical moments for which the
underlying realizations are not available. Under these conditions, the
Kullback-Leibler divergence minimum principle is used for estimating the
posterior probability measure. A statistical surrogate model of the implicit
mapping, which represents the constraints, is introduced. The MCMC generator
and the necessary numerical elements are given to facilitate the implementation
of the methodology in a parallel computing framework. In a second part, an
application is presented to illustrate the proposed theory and is also, as
such, a contribution to the three-dimensional stochastic homogenization of
heterogeneous linear elastic media in the case of a non-separation of the
microscale and macroscale. For the construction of the posterior probability
measure by using the probabilistic learning inference, in addition to the
constraints defined by given statistical moments of the random effective
elasticity tensor, the second-order moment of the random normalized residue of
the stochastic partial differential equation has been added as a constraint.
This constraint guarantees that the algorithm seeks to bring the statistical
moments closer to their targets while preserving a small residue.

related systems, which can be compared with experiment. We start with the
concept of real-space pairing, combined with strong correlations. The
discussion of concrete properties relies on variational approach, based on
renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) in the form of statistically-consistent
Gutzwiller approximation (SGA), and Diagrammatic Expansion of the Variational
Wave Function (DE-GWF). Two energy scales appear, one involving quasiparticles
close to the Fermi energy, and the other reflecting the correlated state. Those
two regimes are separated by a kink in the dispersion relation, observed in
photoemission. One obtains both the doping dependent properties and
renormalized quasiparticles. The reviewed ground-state characteristics for
high-$T_c$ systems encompass superconductivity, nematicity, charge- (and pair-)
density-wave effects, as well as non-BCS kinetic energy gain in the paired
state, all in quantitative manner. Calculated dynamic properties are: universal
Fermi velocity, Fermi wave-vector, effective mass enhancement, pseudogap, and
$d$-wave gap magnitude. The minimal realistic model is represented by the
$t$-$J$-$U$ Hamiltonian. Inadequacy of the $t$-$J$ and Hubbard models is
discussed. For heavy fermion systems we summarize superconducting, Kondo
insulating, ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic states. We overview also coexistent
ferromagnetic (spin-triplet) superconducting phases observed for
$\mathrm{UGe_2}$. Finally, we extend our scheme to collective spin and charge
fluctuations in high-$T_c$ systems, starting from variational approach,
combined with $1/N$ expansion (beyond random phase approximation). Spectrum of
collective spin and charge excitations is determined for the Hubbard and
$t$-$J$-$U$ models, and compared quantitatively with recent experiments.

these connections from the conceptual to the operational level unlocks access
to a powerful set of tools, which can be pivotal towards the formulation of a
consistent theory of quantum gravity. Here, we review recent progress on the
role and applications of quantum informational methods, in particular tensor
networks, for quantum gravity models. We focus on spin network states dual to
finite regions of space, represented as entanglement graphs in the group field
theory approach to quantum gravity, and illustrate how techniques from random
tensor networks can be exploited to investigate their holographic properties.
In particular, spin network states can be interpreted as maps from bulk to
boundary, whose holographic behaviour increases with the inhomogeneity of their
geometric data (up to becoming proper quantum channels). The entanglement
entropy of boundary states, which are obtained by feeding such maps with
suitable bulk states, is then proved to follow a bulk area law, with
corrections due to the entanglement of the bulk state. We further review how
exceeding a certain threshold of bulk entanglement leads to the emergence of a
black hole-like region, revealing intriguing perspectives for quantum
cosmology.

Current dispatching methods in ridehailing platforms are dominantly based on
myopic or rule-based non-myopic approaches. Reinforcement learning enables
dispatching policies that are informed of historical data and able to employ
the learned information to optimize returns of expected future trajectories.
Previous studies in this field yielded promising results, yet have left room
for further improvements in terms of performance gain, self-dependency,
transferability, and scalable deployment mechanisms. The present study proposes
a standalone RL-based dispatching solution that is equipped with multiple
mechanisms to ensure robust and efficient on-policy learning and inference
while being adaptable for full-scale deployment. A new form of value updating
based on temporal difference is proposed that is more adapted to the inherent
uncertainty of the problem. For the driver-order assignment, a customized
utility function is proposed that when tuned based on the statistics of the
market, results in remarkable performance improvement and interpretability. In
addition, for reducing the risk of cancellation after drivers' assignment, an
adaptive graph pruning strategy based on the multi-arm bandit problem is
introduced. The method is evaluated using offline simulation with real data and
yields notable performance improvement. In addition, the algorithm is deployed
online in multiple cities under DiDi's operation for A/B testing and is
launched in one of the major international markets as the primary mode of
dispatch. The deployed algorithm shows over 1.3% improvement in total driver
income from A/B testing. In addition, by causal inference analysis, as much as
5.3% improvement in major performance metrics is detected after full-scale

such that $\| A(I -ZZ^\top)\|_{S_p} \leq (1+\epsilon)\min_{U^\top U = I_k}
\|A(I - U U^\top)\|_{S_p}$, where $\|M\|_{S_p}$ denotes the $\ell_p$ norm of
the the singular values of $M$. For the special cases of $p=2$ (Frobenius norm)
and $p = \infty$ (Spectral norm), Musco and Musco (NeurIPS 2015) obtained an
algorithm based on Krylov methods that uses $\tilde{O}(k/\sqrt{\epsilon})$
matrix-vector products, improving on the na\""ive $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$
dependence obtainable by the power method, where $\tilde{O}$ suppresses
poly$(\log(dk/\epsilon))$ factors.
  Our main result is an algorithm that uses only
$\tilde{O}(kp^{1/6}/\epsilon^{1/3})$ matrix-vector products, and works for all
$p \geq 1$. For $p = 2$ our bound improves the previous
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/2})$ bound to $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/3})$. Since the
Schatten-$p$ and Schatten-$\infty$ norms are the same up to a $(1+
\epsilon)$-factor when $p \geq (\log d)/\epsilon$, our bound recovers the
result of Musco and Musco for $p = \infty$. Further, we prove a matrix-vector
query lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ for any fixed constant $p \geq
1$, showing that surprisingly $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$ is the optimal
complexity for constant~$k$.
  To obtain our results, we introduce several new techniques, including
optimizing over multiple Krylov subspaces simultaneously, and pinching
inequalities for partitioned operators. Our lower bound for $p \in [1,2]$ uses
the Araki-Lieb-Thirring trace inequality, whereas for $p>2$, we appeal to a

eddy viscosity model, represented as a tensor basis neural network, from
velocity data. Data-driven turbulence models have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional models for providing closure mapping from the mean
velocities to Reynolds stresses. Most data-driven models in this category need
full-field Reynolds stress data for training, which not only places stringent
demand on the data generation but also makes the trained model ill-conditioned
and lacks robustness. This difficulty can be alleviated by incorporating the
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver in the training process. However,
this would necessitate developing adjoint solvers of the RANS model, which
requires extra effort in code development and maintenance. Given this
difficulty, we present an ensemble Kalman method with an adaptive step size to
train a neural network-based turbulence model by using indirect observation
data. To our knowledge, this is the first such attempt in turbulence modelling.
The ensemble method is first verified on the flow in a square duct, where it
correctly learns the underlying turbulence models from velocity data. Then, the
generalizability of the learned model is evaluated on a family of separated
flows over periodic hills. It is demonstrated that the turbulence model learned
in one flow can predict flows in similar configurations with varying slopes.

is always larger than a given threshold. Under such type of performance
limitation, we formally prove the minimum required bounding box enlargement

mathematically adjusted to a smaller value, provided that the motion planner
takes a fixed-length buffer in making its decisions. Finally, observing the
difference between an empirically measured enlargement factor and our formally

the quantitative evidence (demonstrated by statistics) and the qualitative

(MSA), a rare neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, is characterized by various
combinations of progressive autonomic failure and motor dysfunction, and a very
poor prognosis. Describing the progression of such complex and
multi-dimensional diseases is particularly difficult. One has to simultaneously
account for the assessment of multivariate markers over time, the occurrence of
clinical endpoints, and a highly suspected heterogeneity between patients. Yet,
such description is crucial for understanding the natural history of the
disease, staging patients diagnosed with the disease, unravelling
subphenotypes, and predicting the prognosis. Through the example of MSA
progression, we show how a latent class approach modeling multiple repeated
markers and clinical endpoints can help describe complex disease progression
and identify subphenotypes for exploring new pathological hypotheses. The
proposed joint latent class model includes class-specific multivariate mixed
models to handle multivariate repeated biomarkers possibly summarized into
latent dimensions and class-and-cause-specific proportional hazard models to
handle time-to-event data. Maximum likelihood estimation procedure, validated
through simulations is available in the lcmm R package. In the French MSA
cohort comprising data of 598 patients during up to 13 years, five
subphenotypes of MSA were identified that differ by the sequence and shape of
biomarkers degradation, and the associated risk of death. In posterior
analyses, the five subphenotypes were used to explore the association between

O(\min \{ k^4+|T|, k\cdot |T|\})$ space to encode the distances between $S$ and
a subset of terminal vertices $T \subseteq V$. This is known as the
Okamura-Seymour metric compression problem.
  We give an alternative proof of the $x=O(k^3)$ bound that exploits planarity
beyond the VC-dimension argument. Namely, our proof relies on cut-cycle
duality, as well as on the fact that distances among vertices of $S$ are
bounded by $k$. Our method implies the following:

argues that both perspectives could be coupled within the learning of autotelic
agents to foster their skill acquisition. To this end, we make two
contributions: 1) a novel social interaction protocol called Help Me Explore
(HME), where autotelic agents can benefit from both individual and socially
guided exploration. In social episodes, a social partner suggests goals at the
frontier of the learning agent knowledge. In autotelic episodes, agents can
either learn to master their own discovered goals or autonomously rehearse
failed social goals; 2) GANGSTR, a graph-based autotelic agent for manipulation
domains capable of decomposing goals into sequences of intermediate sub-goals.
We show that when learning within HME, GANGSTR overcomes its individual
learning limits by mastering the most complex configurations (e.g. stacks of 5
blocks) with only few social interventions.

of mobile communication and beyond (5G+). One of the important challenges in
the NwS is information uncertainty which mainly involves demand and channel
state information (CSI). Demand uncertainty is divided into three types: number
of users requests, amount of bandwidth, and requested virtual network functions
workloads. Moreover, the CSI uncertainty is modeled by three methods:
worst-case, probabilistic, and hybrid. In this paper, our goal is to maximize
the utility of the infrastructure provider by exploiting deep reinforcement
learning algorithms in end-to-end NwS resource allocation under demand and CSI
uncertainties. The proposed formulation is a nonconvex mixed-integer non-linear
programming problem. To perform robust resource allocation in problems that
involve uncertainty, we need a history of previous information. To this end, we
use a recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm, a recurrent and
memory-based approach in deep reinforcement learning. Then, we compare the RDPG
method in different scenarios with soft actor-critic (SAC), deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG), distributed, and greedy algorithms. The simulation
results show that the SAC method is better than the DDPG, distributed, and
greedy methods, respectively. Moreover, the RDPG method out performs the SAC
approach on average by 70%.

the total amount of involved data may be constrained. In addition, existing VFL
studies usually assume only one platform has task labels and can benefit from
the collaboration, making it difficult to attract other platforms to join in
the collaborative learning. In this paper, we study the platform collaboration
problem in VFL under privacy constraint. We propose to incent different
platforms through a reciprocal collaboration, where all platforms can exploit
multi-platform information in the VFL framework to benefit their own tasks.
With limited privacy budgets, each platform needs to wisely allocate its data
quotas for collaboration with other platforms. Thereby, they naturally form a
multi-party game. There are two core problems in this game, i.e., how to
appraise other platforms' data value to compute game rewards and how to
optimize policies to solve the game. To evaluate the contributions of other
platforms' data, each platform offers a small amount of ""deposit"" data to
participate in the VFL. We propose a performance estimation method to predict
the expected model performance when involving different amount combinations of
inter-platform data. To solve the game, we propose a platform negotiation
method that simulates the bargaining among platforms and locally optimizes
their policies via gradient descent. Extensive experiments on two real-world

Our hierarchical method consists of a high-level intention identification
policy and a low-level trajectory generation policy. We introduce a novel
semantic sub-task definition and generic state representation for each
sub-task. With these techniques, the hierarchical framework is transferable
across different driving scenarios. Besides, our model is able to capture
variations of driving behaviors among individuals and scenarios by an online
adaptation module. We demonstrate our algorithms in the task of trajectory
prediction for real traffic data at intersections and roundabouts from the
INTERACTION dataset. Through extensive numerical studies, it is evident that
our method significantly outperformed other methods in terms of prediction
accuracy, transferability, and adaptability. Pushing the state-of-the-art
performance by a considerable margin, we also provide a cognitive view of
understanding the driving behavior behind such improvement. We highlight that
in the future, more research attention and effort are deserved for

performance elevation of prediction and planning algorithms, but more
fundamentally, they are crucial for the scalable and general deployment of
autonomous vehicles.

more than two decades of meteor observations from visual, optical and radar
measurements we present the Taurids average activity, annual variations in
strength, radiant drift and orbital variations as a function of solar longitude
and particle size. The Taurid showers are detected over several weeks in the
spring and autumn, but their annual activity level is generally low (less than
15 visual meteors per hour). We find the STA to be predominant in autumn, while
its twin the ZPE dominates over the BTA in spring. Due to their long duration,
the position of each shower's radiant and orbital elements are variable with
time. Optical measurements have previously recorded enhanced STA activity and
increased fireball rates caused by the return of a swarm of meteoroids trapped
in the 7:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. However, we find no presence of
the swarm in radar data, suggesting that small meteoroids are removed from the
resonance faster than fireball-producing meteoroids. We also find the STA to be
enriched in smaller particles early in their activity period. The differences
we identify in our analysis between the showers at different particle sizes
provide strong observational constraints to future dynamical modelling of the
Taurid Meteoroid Complex.

propelled by a uniform magnetic field. Therefore, reported skyrmion motions
have been induced using other sorts of stimuli; typically, electric currents in
magnetic metals as well as spin waves, thermal gradient, and field gradient
have manifested their ability to drive skyrmion motion. Here, we demonstrate,
through micromagnetic simulations and analytically, that magnetic skyrmions can
be displaced by a uniform perpendicular magnetic field via a domain-wall (DW)

in terms of 1 / (1 + Ns) with Ns denoting the number of skyrmions. Based on
Thiele's model, we reproduce the velocity-Ns relation first identified from

offer the direct driving force for skyrmion motion. This study underlines the
role of spin textures' interaction in skyrmion dynamics, and opens an

consumers an active role in the energy sector, raise awareness on the
importance of renewable energy (RE) technologies and increase their share in

viability of RECs though, depends on multiple interdependent factors that
require careful examination for each individual context. This study aims at
investigating the impact of electricity tariffs, ratio of electrification of
heating and transportation sectors, prices of RE technologies and storage
systems, and internal electricity exchange prices on the annual cost for
electricity provision of a REC. A mixed-integer linear model is developed to
minimize energy provision costs for a representative REC in Flanders, Belgium.
The results indicate that RECs have the potential to reduce these costs by 10
to 26% compared to business-as-usual. This cost reduction depends on the type
of electricity tariffs and the level of uptake of flexible assets such as heat
pumps and electric vehicles. The shift towards a higher power component in the
electricity tariff makes electricity storage systems more attractive, which
leads to higher electricity self-consumption. The introduction of flexible
assets adds the possibility to shift demand when tariffs are lower and makes
larger sizes of photovoltaic systems economically viable due to the increase in
the total electricity demand. However, RECs cost reduction compared to
individual smart-homes amounts to only 4% - 6% in the best cases. Uncertainties
stemming from the regulation and the costs of setting up a REC may reduce the
estimated benefits.

layers of the neural architecture, in addition to the common data augmentation
applied on the input images. By introducing small perturbations to activation
maps (features) at various levels, we develop the capacity of the neural
network to cope with such transformations. We conduct experiments on three
image classification benchmarks (Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256 and Food-101),
considering two different convolutional architectures (ResNet-18 and
DenseNet-121). When compared with two state-of-the-art stabilization methods,
the empirical results show that our approach consistently attains the best
trade-off between accuracy and mean flip rate.

intervention on, psychological complications that arise in stressful situations

facial emotion recognition in children. In this paper, we study the application
of data augmentation-based contrastive learning to overcome data scarcity in
facial emotion recognition for children. We explore the idea of ignoring
generational gaps, by adding abundantly available adult data to pediatric data,
to learn better representations. We investigate different ways by which adult
facial expression images can be used alongside those of children. In
particular, we propose to explicitly incorporate within each mini-batch adult
images as augmentations for children's. Out of $84$ combinations of learning
approaches and training set sizes, we find that supervised contrastive learning
with the proposed training scheme performs best, reaching a test accuracy that
typically surpasses the one of the second-best approach by 2% to 3%. Our
results indicate that adult data can be considered to be a meaningful
augmentation of pediatric data for the recognition of emotional facial
expression in children, and open up the possibility for other applications of
contrastive learning to improve pediatric care by complementing data of
children with that of adults.

reviewers to different harmful content categories. We use tools from fair

forecasted workload of different content categories. We show how a formulation
that is inspired by the celebrated Eisenberg-Gale program allows us to find an

allocates the remaining reviewing hours among all content categories. The
resulting allocation is also robust as the additional allocation provides a
guardrail in cases where the actual workload deviates from the predicted

is motivated by the fact that partners need scheduling guidance for the
reviewers across days to achieve efficiency.

fair allocation approaches for the single-time period setting, and we show that
many properties extend in essence, albeit with some modifications. Related to
the time component, we additionally investigate how to satisfy markets' desire
for smooth allocation (e.g., partners for content reviewers prefer an
allocation that does not vary much from time to time, to minimize staffing
switch). We demonstrate the performance of our proposed approaches through

hull formulations: a computationally light formulation with a tight relaxation.
The ""$P$-split"" formulations are based on a lifted transformation that splits
convex additively separable constraints into $P$ partitions and forms the
convex hull of the linearized and partitioned disjunction. We analyze the
continuous relaxation of the $P$-split formulations and show that, under
certain assumptions, the formulations form a hierarchy starting from a big-M
equivalent and converging to the convex hull. The goal of the $P$-split
formulations is to form a strong approximation of the convex hull through a
computationally simpler formulation. We computationally compare the $P$-split
formulations against big-M and convex hull formulations on 320 test instances.
The test problems include K-means clustering, P_ball problems, and optimization
over trained ReLU neural networks. The computational results show promising
potential of the $P$-split formulations. For many of the test problems,
$P$-split formulations are solved with a similar number of explored nodes as
the convex hull formulation, while reducing the solution time by an order of
magnitude and outperforming big-M both in time and number of explored nodes.

have a cup-product cubic form on the second integral cohomology, a linear form
given by the second Chern class, and the integral middle cohomology, and if $X$
is simply connected with torsion free homology this information determines
precisely the diffeomorphism class of the underlying 6-manifold by a result of
Wall. For simplicity, we assume that the cubic form defines a smooth real
elliptic curve whose Hessian is irreducible. Under a further relatively mild
assumption that there are no non-movable surfaces $E$ on $X$ with $1 \le E^3

components rather than one, and that the K\""ahler cone is contained in the open
positive cone on the bounded component; we show moreover that the second Chern

third Betti number we therefore have an abundance of examples of smooth compact

when the cubic defines a real elliptic curve with one or two connected

matrix. Developing diagrammatic perturbation theory, invoking Wick's theorem in

by an irreducible kernel. Unlike the Nakajima-Zwanzig and standard approaches,
the Dyson equation is equivalent to a general non-Markovian master equation for
the reduced density matrix, incorporating secular effects and independent of
the initial preparation. The kernel is determined by a systematic diagrammatic
expansion in powers of the interaction. We consider the Born approximation for
the kernel. Applying a condensed-matter pole or, equivalently, a
quasiparticle-type approximation, equivalent to the usual assumption of a
timescale separation, we derive a master equation of the Markov type.
Furthermore, imposing the rotating-wave approximation,we obtain a Markov master
equation of the Lindblad form. To illustrate the method, we consider the

strategies it is important to understand how the various building factors
contribute to energy usage of a building, right at design time. The growth of
artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years provides an unprecedented
opportunity to advance sustainable design by learning complex relationships
between building factors from available data. However, rich training datasets
are needed for AI-based solutions to achieve good prediction accuracy.
Unfortunately, obtaining training datasets are time consuming and expensive in
many real-world applications. Motivated by these reasons, we address the
problem of accurately predicting the energy usage of new or unknown building
types, i.e., those building types that do not have any training data. We
propose a novel approach based on zero-shot learning (ZSL) to solve this
problem. Our approach uses side information from building energy modeling
experts to predict the closest building types for a given new/unknown building
type. We then obtain the predicted energy usage for the k-closest building
types using the models learned during training and combine the predicted values
using a weighted averaging function. We evaluated our approach on a dataset
containing five building types generated using BuildSimHub, a popular platform
for building energy modeling. Our approach achieved better average accuracy
than a regression model (based on XGBoost) trained on the entire dataset of
known building types.

bridging the gap between verifiers and interactive theorem provers (ITPs).
  In this paper we present Vehicle, our solution to this problem. Vehicle is
equipped with an expressive domain specific language for stating neural network
specifications which can be compiled to both verifiers and ITPs. It overcomes
previous issues with maintainability and scalability in similar ITP
formalisations by using a standard ONNX file as the single canonical

connect the neural network verifier Marabou to Agda and then formally verifying
that a car steered by a neural network never leaves the road, even in the face
of an unpredictable cross wind and imperfect sensors. The network has over
20,000 nodes, and therefore this proof represents an improvement of 3 orders of

The emergence of new features with no equilibrium counterpart, such as
dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), has attracted wide attention. In
this work, we depart from the well known Ising model and showcase an
experimentally accessible configuration of a negatively charged
Nitrogen-Vacancy center that interacts with nearby Carbon-13 nuclear spins. We
provide new insights into this system in the context of DQPT. We show that
nuclear spins undergo DQPT by appropriately choosing the relation between the
transverse and longitudinal components of an external magnetic field.
Furthermore, we can steer the DQPT via a time-dependent longitudinal magnetic
field and apply this control to enhance the estimation of the coupling strength
between the nuclear spins. Moreover, we propose a novel quenched dynamics that
originates from the rotation of the central electron spin, which controls the
DQPT relying on the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling.

in an interacting one dimensional system of spinless fermions with aperiodic
potential. We consider a large number of initial states characterized by the
number of kinks, $N_{kinks}$, in the density profile. On the delocalized side
of the MBL transition the dynamics becomes faster with increase in $N_{kinks}$
such that the decay exponent, $\gamma$, in the density imbalance increases with
increase in $N_{kinks}$. The growth exponent of the mean square displacement
which shows a power-law behaviour $\langle x^2(t) \rangle \sim t^\beta$ in the
long time limit is much larger than the exponent $\gamma$ for 1-kink and other
low kink states though $\beta \sim 2\gamma$ for a charge density wave state. As
the disorder strength increases $\gamma_{N_{kink}} \rightarrow 0$ at some
critical disorder, $h_{N_{kinks}}$ which is a monotonically increasing function
of $N_{kinks}$. A 1-kink state always underestimates the value of disorder at
which the MBL transition takes place but $h_{1-kink}$ coincides with the onset
of the sub-diffusive phase preceding the MBL phase. This is consistent with the
dynamics of interface broadening for the 1-kink state. We show that the
bipartite entanglement entropy has a logarithmic growth $a \ln(Vt)$ not only in
the MBL phase but also in the delocalised phase and in both the phases the
coefficient $a$ increases with $N_{kinks}$ as well as with the interaction
strength $V$. We explain this dependence of dynamics on the number of kinks in
terms of the normalized participation ratio of initial states in the eigenbasis
of the interacting Hamiltonian.

a pre-analysis plan, we produce 90 linked weather-household datasets that vary
by the spatial anonymization method and the remote sensing weather product. By
varying the data along with the econometric model we quantify the magnitude and
significance of measurement error coming from the loss of accuracy that results
from protect privacy measures. We find that spatial anonymization techniques

the relationship between weather and agricultural productivity. However, the
degree to which spatial anonymization introduces mismeasurement is a function
of which remote sensing weather product is used in the analysis. We conclude
that care must be taken in choosing a remote sensing weather product when
looking to integrate it with publicly available survey data.

self-regulating process (AGN feedback) that shapes the evolution of galaxies.
This is believed to operate along two modes: on galactic scales by clearing the
interstellar medium via outflows, and on circumgalactic scales by preventing
the cooling and accretion of gas onto the host galaxy. Radio jets associated
with radiatively-inefficient AGN are known to contribute to the latter mode of
feedback. However, such jets could also play a role on circum-nuclear and
galactic scales, blurring the distinction between the two modes. We have
discovered a spatially-resolved, massive molecular outflow, carrying $\sim75\%$
of the gas in the central region of the host galaxy of a
radiatively-inefficient AGN. The outflow coincides with the radio jet 540 pc
offset from the core, unambiguously pointing to the jet as the driver of this
phenomenon. The modest luminosity of the radio source ($L\rm_{1.4 GHz}=2.1
\times 10\rm^{23}~\rm W~\rm Hz^{-1}$) confirms predictions of simulations that
jets of low-luminosity radio sources carry enough power to drive such outflows.
Including kpc-scale feedback from such sources -- comprising of the majority of
the radio AGN population -- in cosmological simulations may assist in resolving
some of their limitations.

  In this paper, we present Reliabuild, an auto-tuning framework that

sampling to select good configurations with fewer samples. We demonstrate
Reliabuild's effectiveness by evaluating 31,186 build configurations of 61

selects good configurations efficiently. For example, Reliabuild selects 3X the

select all the high-fidelity builds in half the number of samples required by

rigid spacecraft using unit quaternions, where the motion equations of a
spacecraft are described by a four degrees of freedom Lagrangian dynamics
subject to a holonomic constraint imposed by the norm of a unit quaternion. The
basic energy-conservation property as well as some additional useful properties
of the Lagrangian dynamics are explored, enabling to develop quaternion-based
attitude tracking controllers by taking full advantage of a broad class of
tracking control designs for mechanical systems based on energy-shaping
methodology. Global tracking of a desired attitude on the unit sphere is
achieved by designing control laws that render the tracking error on the
four-dimensional Euclidean space to converge to the origin. The topological
constraints for globally exponentially tracking by a quaternion-based
continuous controller and singularities in controller designs based on any
three-parameter representation of the attitude are then avoided. Using this
approach, a full-state feedback controller is first developed, and then several
important issues, such as robustness to noise in quaternion measurements,
unknown on-orbit torque disturbances, uncertainty in the inertial matrix, and
lack of angular-velocity measurements are addressed progressively, by designing
a hybrid state-feedback controller, an adaptive hybrid state-feedback
controller, and an adaptive hybrid attitude-feedback controller. Global
asymptotic stability is established for each controller. Simulations are

high-precision INT32 or full-precision multiplication during inference for
scaling or dequantization. This introduces a noticeable cost in terms of

novel quantization framework consisting of only fixed-point 8-bit

fixed-point multiplication with different formats of fixed-point numbers and
study the statistical behavior of the associated fixed-point numbers. Second,
based on the statistical and algorithmic analysis, we apply different
fixed-point formats for weights and activations of different layers. We
introduce a novel algorithm to automatically determine the right format for
each layer during training. Third, we analyze a previous quantization algorithm
-- parameterized clipping activation (PACT) -- and reformulate it using
fixed-point arithmetic. Finally, we unify the recently proposed method for
quantization fine-tuning and our fixed-point approach to show the potential of
our method. We verify F8Net on ImageNet for MobileNet V1/V2 and ResNet18/50.

across two different robots with significantly different parameters such as
kinematics and morphology. Existing approaches that train a new policy by
matching the action or state transition distribution, including imitation
learning methods, fail due to optimal action and/or state distribution being
mismatched in different robots. In this paper, we propose a novel method named
$REvolveR$ of using continuous evolutionary models for robotic policy transfer
implemented in a physics simulator. We interpolate between the source robot and
the target robot by finding a continuous evolutionary change of robot
parameters. An expert policy on the source robot is transferred through
training on a sequence of intermediate robots that gradually evolve into the
target robot. Experiments on a physics simulator show that the proposed
continuous evolutionary model can effectively transfer the policy across robots
and achieve superior sample efficiency on new robots. The proposed method is
especially advantageous in sparse reward settings where exploration can be
significantly reduced. Code is released at https://github.com/xingyul/revolver.

average treatment effect (CATE), with linear regression models. As the
development of machine learning for causal inference, a wide range of
large-scale models for causality are gaining attention. One problem is that
suspicions have been raised that the large-scale models are prone to
overfitting to observations with sample selection, hence the large models may
not be suitable for causal prediction. In this study, to resolve the
suspicious, we investigate on the validity of causal inference methods for
overparameterized models, by applying the recent theory of benign overfitting
(Bartlett et al., 2020). Specifically, we consider samples whose distribution
switches depending on an assignment rule, and study the prediction of CATE with
linear models whose dimension diverges to infinity. We focus on two methods:
the T-learner, which based on a difference between separately constructed
estimators with each treatment group, and the inverse probability weight
(IPW)-learner, which solves another regression problem approximated by a
propensity score. In both methods, the estimator consists of interpolators that
fit the samples perfectly. As a result, we show that the T-learner fails to
achieve the consistency except the random assignment, while the IPW-learner
converges the risk to zero if the propensity score is known. This difference
stems from that the T-learner is unable to preserve eigenspaces of the
covariances, which is necessary for benign overfitting in the overparameterized
setting. Our result provides new insights into the usage of causal inference
methods in the overparameterizated setting, in particular, doubly robust
estimators.

generalization capacity of learning algorithms. Intuitively, one expects the
error rate to decrease as the amount of training-data increases. Perhaps
surprisingly, natural attempts to formalize this intuition give rise to
interesting and challenging mathematical questions. For example, in their
classical book on pattern recognition, Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi (1996) ask
whether there exists a {monotone} Bayes-consistent algorithm. This question
remained open for over 25 years, until recently Pestov (2021) resolved it for
binary classification, using an intricate construction of a monotone
Bayes-consistent algorithm.
  We derive a general result in multiclass classification, showing that every
learning algorithm A can be transformed to a monotone one with similar
performance. Further, the transformation is efficient and only uses a black-box
oracle access to A. This demonstrates that one can provably avoid non-monotonic
behaviour without compromising performance, thus answering questions asked by
Devroye et al (1996), Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019), Viering and Loog (2021),
and by Mhammedi (2021).
  Our transformation readily implies monotone learners in a variety of
contexts: for example it extends Pestov's result to classification tasks with
an arbitrary number of labels. This is in contrast with Pestov's work which is
tailored to binary classification.
  In addition, we provide uniform bounds on the error of the monotone
algorithm. This makes our transformation applicable in distribution-free
settings. For example, in PAC learning it implies that every learnable class
admits a monotone PAC learner. This resolves questions by Viering, Mey, and
Loog (2019); Viering and Loog (2021); Mhammedi (2021).

the critical case, that is the lower $\infty$-dimension of $\nu$ equals $d-2$,
such that for one case the form approach breaks down, another case, where the

the third case, where the spectral dimension exists. We provide additional
regularity assumptions on the spectral partition function, guaranteeing that
the Neumann spectral dimension exists and coincides with the Dirichlet spectral

prominent examples -- namely absolutely continuous measures, Ahlfors-David

which the spectral partition function is essentially given by its
$L^{q}$-spectrum and both the Dirichlet and Neumann spectral dimensions exist.
Moreover, we provide general bounds for the upper Neumann spectral dimension in

restoring loads during extended duration outages. At such times, the CMG is
challenged with limited resource availability, absence of robust grid support,
and heightened demand-supply uncertainty. This paper proposes a secure and
adaptive three-stage hierarchical multi-timescale framework for scheduling and
real-time (RT) dispatch of CMGs with hybrid PV systems to address these
challenges. The framework enables the CMG to dynamically expand its boundary to
support the neighboring grid sections and is adaptive to the changing forecast
error impacts. The first stage solves a stochastic extended duration scheduling
(EDS) problem to obtain referral plans for optimal resource rationing. The
intermediate near-real-time (NRT) scheduling stage updates the EDS schedule
closer to the dispatch time using newly obtained forecasts, followed by the RT
dispatch stage. To make the dispatch decisions more secure and robust against
forecast errors, a novel concept called delayed recourse is proposed. The
methodology is evaluated via numerical simulations on a modified IEEE 123-bus
system and validated using OpenDSS/hardware-in-loop simulations. The results
show superior performance in maximizing load supply and continuous secure CMG

is investigated on the basis of the key idea of the neural tangent kernel
regime, a recent development in the machine learning theory of
over-parameterized networks; for most randomly connected neural networks, it is
shown that global minima always exist in their small neighborhoods. We
numerically show that this claim also holds for our neural fields. In more
detail, our model has two structures: i) each neuron in a field has a
continuously distributed receptive field, and ii) the initial connection
weights are random but not independent, having correlations when the positions
of neurons are close in each layer. We show that such a multilayer neural field
is more robust than conventional models when input patterns are deformed by
noise disturbances. Moreover, its generalization ability can be slightly
superior to that of conventional models.

chemical rule that diagnoses with a high accuracy whether a material is
topological using only its chemical formula. This heuristic rule is based on a
notion that we term topogivity, a machine-learned numerical value for each
element that loosely captures its tendency to form topological materials. We
next implement a high-throughput procedure for discovering topological
materials based on the heuristic topogivity-rule prediction followed by ab
initio validation. This way, we discover new topological materials that are not
diagnosable using symmetry indicators, including several that may be promising
for experimental observation.

in disruptive behavior. However, malicious users can easily create a new
account to evade such bans. Previous research has focused on other forms of
online deception, like the simultaneous operation of multiple accounts by the
same entities (sockpuppetry), impersonation of other individuals, and studying
the effects of de-platforming individuals and communities. Here we conduct the
first data-driven study of ban evasion, i.e., the act of circumventing bans on
an online platform, leading to temporally disjoint operation of accounts by the
same user.
  We curate a novel dataset of 8,551 ban evasion pairs (parent, child)
identified on Wikipedia and contrast their behavior with benign users and
non-evading malicious users. We find that evasion child accounts demonstrate
similarities with respect to their banned parent accounts on several behavioral
axes - from similarity in usernames and edited pages to similarity in content
added to the platform and its psycholinguistic attributes. We reveal key
behavioral attributes of accounts that are likely to evade bans. Based on the
insights from the analyses, we train logistic regression classifiers to detect
and predict ban evasion at three different points in the ban evasion lifecycle.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in predicting future
evaders (AUC = 0.78), early detection of ban evasion (AUC = 0.85), and matching
child accounts with parent accounts (MRR = 0.97). Our work can aid moderators
by reducing their workload and identifying evasion pairs faster and more
efficiently than current manual and heuristic-based approaches. Dataset is

coherently controlled quantum computations. We extend the PBS-calculus, a

obtain a more resource-sensitive language, it manipulates abstract gates --
that can be interpreted as queries to an oracle -- and more importantly, it
avoids the representation of useless wires by allowing unsaturated polarising

Instead, the Casimir singular and Casimir regular terms are extracted

states in the presence of many uncontrolled environmental degrees of freedom --
requiring careful orchestration of how the relevant degrees of freedom interact
with that environment. These interactions are often viewed as detrimental, as
they dissipate energy and decohere quantum states. Nonetheless, when
controlled, dissipation is an essential tool for manipulating quantum
information: Dissipation engineering enables quantum measurement, quantum state
preparation, and quantum state stabilization. The progress of quantum device
technology, marked by improvements of characteristic coherence times and
extensible architectures for quantum control, has coincided with the
development of such dissipation engineering tools which interface quantum and
classical degrees of freedom. This Review presents dissipation as a fundamental
aspect of the measurement and control of quantum devices and highlights the
role of dissipation engineering for quantum error correction and quantum
simulation that enables quantum information processing on a practical scale.

discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 2018

the re-reduction of a SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) spectrum.
This spectrum, taken by the Spectral Classification of Astronomical Transients

line. Here we present roughly six years of optical survey photometry beginning
before the TDE to constrain AGN activity, optical spectroscopy of the
transient, and a detailed study of the host galaxy properties through analysis
of archival photometry and a host spectrum. ATLAS18mlw was detected in
ground-based light curves for roughly two months. From a blackbody fit to the
transient spectrum and bolometric correction of the optical light curve, we
conclude that ATLAS18mlw is likely a low-luminosity TDE with a peak luminosity
of log(L [erg s$^{-1}$]) = $43.5 \pm 0.2$. The TDE classification is further
supported by the quiescent Balmer strong nature of the host galaxy. We also
calculated the TDE decline rate from the bolometric light curve and find
$\Delta L_{40} = -0.7 \pm 0.2$ dex, making ATLAS18mlw a member of the growing
class of ""faint and fast"" TDEs with low peak luminosities and fast decline
rates.

Rotation Equivariant Normalizing Flow (TRENF), a generative Normalizing Flow
(NF) model which explicitly incorporates these symmetries, defining the data
likelihood via a sequence of Fourier space-based convolutions and pixel-wise
nonlinear transforms. TRENF gives direct access to the high dimensional data
likelihood p(x|y) as a function of the labels y, such as cosmological
parameters. In contrast to traditional analyses based on summary statistics,
the NF approach has no loss of information since it preserves the full
dimensionality of the data. On Gaussian random fields, the TRENF likelihood
agrees well with the analytical expression and saturates the Fisher information
content in the labels y. On nonlinear cosmological overdensity fields from
N-body simulations, TRENF leads to significant improvements in constraining
power over the standard power spectrum summary statistic. TRENF is also a
generative model of the data, and we show that TRENF samples agree well with
the N-body simulations it trained on, and that the inverse mapping of the data
agrees well with a Gaussian white noise both visually and on various summary
statistics: when this is perfectly achieved the resulting p(x|y) likelihood
analysis becomes optimal. Finally, we develop a generalization of this model

'bins' of momentum (or frequency) space. This gives rise to a pair of conserved
quantities (e.g. CR number and energy) which are exchanged between cells or
bins, that in turn give the update to the normalization and slope of the
spectrum in each bin. While these methods can be evolved exactly in
momentum-space (considering injection, absorption, continuous losses/gains),
numerical challenges arise dealing with spatial fluxes, if the scattering rates
depend on momentum. This has often been treated by either by neglecting
variation of those rates 'within the bin,' or sacrificing conservation --
introducing significant errors. Here, we derive a rigorous treatment of these
terms, and show that the variation within the bin can be accounted for
accurately with a simple set of scalar correction coefficients that can be
written entirely in terms of other, explicitly-evolved 'bin-integrated'
quantities. This eliminates the relevant errors without added computational
cost, has no effect on the numerical stability of the method, and retains
manifest conservation. We derive correction terms both for methods which
explicitly integrate flux variables (two-moment or M1-like) methods, as well as
single-moment (advection-diffusion, FLD-like) methods, and approximate

sudden increase in the outFOV MOS2 rate and a spectral change. These facts
support the fact that MeV electrons can generate an unfocused background
signal. The correlation between MOS2 outFOV data and the SOHO EPHIN data
reveals a term constant in time and isotropic similar to the one found in the

acceleration at electron-ion shocks because their Larmor radii are smaller than
the shock transition width: this is the well-known electron injection problem
of diffusive shock acceleration. Instead, an efficient pre-acceleration process
must exist that scatters electrons off of electromagnetic fluctuations on
scales much shorter than the ion gyro radius. The recently found
intermediate-scale instability provides a natural way to produce such
fluctuations in parallel shocks. The instability drives comoving (with the
upstream plasma) ion-cyclotron waves at the shock front and only operates when
the drift speed is smaller than half of the electron Alfven speed. Here, we
perform particle-in-cell simulations with the SHARP code to study the impact of
this instability on electron acceleration at parallel non-relativistic,
electron-ion shocks. To this end, we compare a shock simulation in which the
intermediate-scale instability is expected to grow to simulations where it is
suppressed. In particular, the simulation with an Alfvenic Mach number large
enough to quench the intermediate instability shows a great reduction (by two
orders of magnitude) of the electron acceleration efficiency. Moreover, the
simulation with a reduced ion-to-electron mass ratio (where the intermediate
instability is also suppressed) not only artificially precludes electron
acceleration but also results in erroneous electron and ion heating in the
downstream and shock transition regions. This finding opens up a promising
route for a plasma physical understanding of diffusive shock acceleration of
electrons, which necessarily requires realistic mass ratios in simulations of
collisionless electron-ion shocks.

In order to understand this dichotomy, we design an idealized three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation of a cluster, to assess which of these carriers can
dissipate energy in and around the core ($\gtrsim 100$ kpc) . Specifically, we
explore how gentle (long-duration outbursts) and intermediate (shorter duration
outbursts) feedback modes can function efficiently mediated by compressible
(sound waves) and incompressible (g-modes/instabilities/turbulence)
disturbances. Since g-modes are confined tightly to the central core, we
attempt to maximise the flux of fast sound waves to distribute the feedback
energy over a large distance. We find that the contribution to heat dissipation
from sound and turbulence varies on the basis of the aforementioned feedback
modes, namely: turbulence contributes relatively more than sound in the
slow-piston regime and vice versa for the intermediate regime. For the first
time in a 3D simulation, we show that up to $\lesssim 20\%$ (in some
directions) of the injected power can be carried away by sound flux in the
intermediate feedback but it reduces to $\lesssim 10 \%$ (in some directions)
in the slow-piston regime. Lastly, we find that sound waves can be elusive if
we deduce the equation-of-state (isobaric/isentropic) of the fluctuations from

we study a model where organisms of two prey species do not compete for space
but share a common predator. Our outcomes elucidate the central role played by
the predator in the pattern formation and coarsening dynamics in apparent

persistence of the species, we find a crossover between a curvature driven
scaling regime and a coexistence scenario. For low predator mortality, spatial
domains mainly inhabited by one type of prey arise, surrounded by interfaces
that mostly contain predators. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the
interface network are curvature driven whose coarsening follows a scaling law
common to other nonlinear systems. The effects of the apparent competition
decrease for high predator mortality, allowing organisms of two prey species to
share a more significant fraction of lattice. Finally, our results reveal that
predation capacity in single-prey domains influences the scaling power law that
characterises the coarsening dynamics. Our findings may be helpful to

has long been a problem of interest. Many conventional solutions utilize an
estimation-theoretic interpretation, in which a waveform-specific
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound on measurement error is used to select the optimal
waveform for each tracking step. However, this approach is only valid in the
high SNR regime, and requires a rather restrictive set of assumptions regarding
the target motion and measurement models. Further, due to computational
concerns, many traditional approaches are limited to near-term, or myopic,
optimization, even though radar scenes exhibit strong temporal correlation.
More recently, reinforcement learning has been proposed for waveform selection,
in which the problem is framed as a Markov decision process (MDP), allowing for
long-term planning. However, a major limitation of reinforcement learning is
that the memory length of the underlying Markov process is often unknown for
realistic target and channel dynamics, and a more general framework is
desirable. This work develops a universal sequential waveform selection scheme
which asymptotically achieves Bellman optimality in any radar scene which can
be modeled as a $U^{\text{th}}$ order Markov process for a finite, but unknown,
integer $U$. Our approach is based on well-established tools from the field of
universal source coding, where a stationary source is parsed into variable
length phrases in order to build a context-tree, which is used as a
probabalistic model for the scene's behavior. We show that an algorithm based
on a multi-alphabet version of the Context-Tree Weighting (CTW) method can be
used to optimally solve a broad class of waveform-agile tracking problems while
making minimal assumptions about the environment's behavior.

nonstationary algorithms. However, damping can be useful and is sometimes

acceleration algorithm with optimized damping (AAoptD) in each iteration to
further speed up linear and nonlinear iterations by applying one extra

tattoos. To better understand and mitigate the effect of facial tattoos in
facial analysis systems, large datasets of images of individuals with and
without tattoos are needed. To this end, we propose a generator for
automatically adding realistic tattoos to facial images. Moreover, we
demonstrate the feasibility of the generation by using a deep learning-based
model for removing tattoos from face images. The experimental results show that
it is possible to remove facial tattoos from real images without degrading the

physiological processes. Despite centuries of investigations, whether or not
water's structure is drastically changed by dissolved ions is still debated.
Based on density functional theory, we employ machine learning based molecular
dynamics to model sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bromide
solutions at different concentrations. The resulting reciprocal-space structure
factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide
clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of
water in the same way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the
computed structural changes are restricted to the ionic first solvation shells
intruding into the hydrogen bond network, beyond which the oxygen
radial-distribution function does not undergo major change relative to neat
water. Our findings suggest that the widely cited pressure-like effect on the
solvent in Hofmeister series ionic solutions should be carefully revisited.

in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three
spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum ($\alpha\le-0.5$) sources; 10 flat-spectrum
($-0.5<\alpha\le0.2$) sources; and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having
$\alpha>0.2$, assuming $S\propto\nu^\alpha$. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely
represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal
compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The
surface-density distribution of the HCRs as function of radial distance ($R$)
from Sgr~A* can be described as a steep power-law $\Sigma (R) \propto
R^{-\Gamma}$, with $\Gamma=1.6\pm0.2$, along with presence of a localized
order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of
the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the
concentration massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC
magnetar SGR~J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum sub-sample. We find
that two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of
SGR~J1745-2900, separated at $\nu\sim30$ GHz. The centimeter-component is
fitted to a power-law with $\alpha_{cm}=-1.5\pm0.6$. The enhanced
millimeter-component shows a rising spectrum $\alpha_{mm}=1.1\pm0.2$. Based on
the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly
variable on a day-to-day time scale, showing variations up to a factor of 6.
Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and
polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are
associated with stellar remnants.

informed by the properties of accretion flows onto protostellar cores in

anisotropic infall perturbs the disk and readily launches the Rossby wave

zone where material is deposited. These vortices drive spiral waves and angular
momentum transport, with some models able to drive stresses corresponding to a
viscosity parameter on the order of $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$. The resulting
azimuthal shear forms robust pressure bumps that act as barriers to radial
drift of dust grains, as demonstrated by post-processing calculations of
drift-dominated dust evolution. We discuss how a self-consistent model of

fundamental problems in applied machine learning. Our processes for evaluating
AI trustworthiness have substantial ramifications for ML's impact on science,
health, and humanity, yet confusion surrounds foundational concepts. What does
it mean to trust an AI, and how do humans assess AI trustworthiness? What are
the mechanisms for building trustworthy AI? And what is the role of
interpretable ML in trust? Here, we draw from statistical learning theory and
sociological lenses on human-automation trust to motivate an AI-as-tool
framework, which distinguishes human-AI trust from human-AI-human trust.
Evaluating an AI's contractual trustworthiness involves predicting future model
behavior using behavior certificates (BCs) that aggregate behavioral evidence
from diverse sources including empirical out-of-distribution and out-of-task
evaluation and theoretical proofs linking model architecture to behavior. We
clarify the role of interpretability in trust with a ladder of model access.
Interpretability (level 3) is not necessary or even sufficient for trust, while
the ability to run a black-box model at-will (level 2) is necessary and
sufficient. While interpretability can offer benefits for trust, it can also
incur costs. We clarify ways interpretability can contribute to trust, while
questioning the perceived centrality of interpretability to trust in popular
discourse. How can we empower people with tools to evaluate trust? Instead of
trying to understand how a model works, we argue for understanding how a model
behaves. Instead of opening up black boxes, we should create more behavior
certificates that are more correct, relevant, and understandable. We discuss
how to build trusted and trustworthy AI responsibly.

function with very high accuracy up to very long times and large distances.
Each term in the series corresponds to the contribution of all scattering
states of an even number of excitations. These excitations can be interpreted
in terms of an equal number of particles and holes. The lowest term in the

determines the long-time large-distance asymptotic behaviour which can be

the one-particle, one-hole contribution, equivalently interpreted as a

under-fitting the other modalities. Such behavior is counter-intuitive and
hurts the models' generalization, as we observe empirically. To estimate the
model's dependence on each modality, we compute the gain on the accuracy when
the model has access to it in addition to another modality. We refer to this
gain as the conditional utilization rate. In the experiments, we consistently
observe an imbalance in conditional utilization rates between modalities,
across multiple tasks and architectures. Since conditional utilization rate
cannot be computed efficiently during training, we introduce a proxy for it
based on the pace at which the model learns from each modality, which we refer
to as the conditional learning speed. We propose an algorithm to balance the
conditional learning speeds between modalities during training and demonstrate
that it indeed addresses the issue of greedy learning. The proposed algorithm
improves the model's generalization on three datasets: Colored MNIST,

posterior sampling with promising results. However, such methods are not yet

empirical sampling methods may be computationally feasible for large-scale

repeatedly solving an optimization problem in the latent space of a style-based

the major challenges in product search is the vocabulary mismatch between query
and products, which may be a larger vocabulary gap problem compared to other
information retrieval domains. While there is a growing collection of neural
learning to match methods aimed specifically at overcoming this issue, they do
not leverage the recent advances of large language models for product search.
On the other hand, product ranking often deals with multiple types of
engagement signals such as clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases, while most of
the existing works are focused on optimizing one single metric such as
click-through rate, which may suffer from data sparsity. In this work, we
propose a novel end-to-end multi-task learning framework for product ranking
with BERT to address the above challenges. The proposed model utilizes
domain-specific BERT with fine-tuning to bridge the vocabulary gap and employs
multi-task learning to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, which
yields a general end-to-end learning framework for product search. We conduct a
set of comprehensive experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset and
demonstrate significant improvement of the proposed approach over the
state-of-the-art baseline methods.

placement algorithms often based upon the discovery of linear, low-rank
sub-spaces and the QR algorithm. QR is a computationally efficient greedy
search algorithm which selects sensor locations from candidate positions with
maximal variance exhibited in a training data set. More recently, neural
networks, specifically shallow decoder networks (SDNs), have been shown to be
very successful in mapping sensor measurements to the original high-dimensional
state space. SDNs outperform linear subspace representations in reconstruction
accuracy, noise tolerance, and robustness to sensor locations. However, SDNs
lack principled mathematical techniques for determining sensor placement. In
this work, we develop two algorithms for optimizing sensor locations for use
with SDNs: one which is a linear selection algorithm based upon QR (Q-SDN), and
one which is a nonlinear selection algorithm based upon neural network pruning
(P-SDN). Such sensor placement algorithms promise to enhance the already
impressive reconstruction capabilities of SDNs. We demonstrate our sensor
selection algorithms on two example data sets from fluid dynamics. Moreover, we
provide a detailed comparison between our linear (Q-SDN) and nonlinear (P-SDN)

planetary systems with a single detected transiting planet in the Kepler
catalog -- reflects an intrinsic bimodality in the mutual inclinations of
planetary orbits. After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed
by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent
dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation
of planetary semimajor axes into distinct ""clusters"". We find that our
simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital
periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a
migration trap -- a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant
co-rotation torque prevents inward migration -- which splits the system into
two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains
dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability
of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass
systems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster
that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high
mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent
Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer
planets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play
only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems
with Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture
by co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the
structure of protoplanetary discs.

for stabilizing moduli without leaving the domain of perturbative control,
thereby evading the `Dine-Seiberg' problem. The only required nonperturbative
information comes from the standard renormalization-group resummation of
leading logarithms that allow us simultaneously to work to a fixed order in the
perturbative parameter $\alpha$ and to all orders in $\alpha \ln\tau$ where
$\tau$ is a large extra-dimensional modulus. The resulting potential is
naturally minimized for moduli of order $\tau\sim e^{1/\alpha}$ and so can be
exponentially large given ${\cal O}(10)$ input parameters. The mechanism relies
on accidental low-energy scaling symmetries known to be generic and so is
robust against UV details. The resulting compactifications generically break
supersymmetry and 4D de Sitter solutions are relatively easy to achieve without
additional uplifting. Variations on the theme lead to inflationary scenarios
for which the size of the stabilized moduli differ significantly before and
after inflation and so provide a dynamical mechanism whereby inflationary
scales are much larger than late-time physical ($e.g.$~supersymmetry breaking)
scales, with this hierarchy contingent on past cosmic evolution with the
inflaton playing a secondary late-time role as a relaxation field. We apply
this formalism to warped $\hbox{D3}$-$\overline{\hbox{D3}}$ inflation using
non-linearly realized supersymmetry to describe the antibrane tension and the
Coulomb interaction, and show how doing so our perturbative modulus
stabilization mechanism evades the $\eta$-problem that usually plagues this

excellent soft-tissue contrast without using harmful ionising radiation.
Dynamic MRI is an essential tool for interventions to visualise movements or
changes of the target organ. However, such MRI acquisition with high temporal
resolution suffers from limited spatial resolution - also known as the
spatio-temporal trade-off of dynamic MRI. Several approaches, including deep
learning based super-resolution approaches, have been proposed to mitigate this
trade-off. Nevertheless, such an approach typically aims to super-resolve each
time-point separately, treating them as individual volumes. This research
addresses the problem by creating a deep learning model which attempts to learn
both spatial and temporal relationships. A modified 3D UNet model, DDoS-UNet,
is proposed - which takes the low-resolution volume of the current time-point
along with a prior image volume. Initially, the network is supplied with a
static high-resolution planning scan as the prior image along with the
low-resolution input to super-resolve the first time-point. Then it continues
step-wise by using the super-resolved time-points as the prior image while
super-resolving the subsequent time-points. The model performance was tested
with 3D dynamic data that was undersampled to different in-plane levels. The
proposed network achieved an average SSIM value of 0.951$\pm$0.017 while
reconstructing the lowest resolution data (i.e. only 4\% of the k-space
acquired) - which could result in a theoretical acceleration factor of 25. The
proposed approach can be used to reduce the required scan-time while achieving
high spatial resolution.

calorimetry (DSC) accompanied with investigation of magnetic properties under
applied hydrostatic pressure up to 12 kbar. It has been found that the
orthorhombic crystal structure of the TiNiSi-type, which is dominant at low
temperatures, turns into the hexagonal Ni$_2$In-type one, slightly above 200 K.
The structural transition is of the first-order type as confirmed by presence
of distinct thermal hysteresis exceeding 20 K. The ac magnetic measurements
indicate a ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature $T_C$ of 238 K,
followed by additional anomaly at lower temperatures - the latter one being
related to the structural transition. Application of hydrostatic pressure leads
to temperature separation of the purely magnetic transition, whose Curie
temperature $T_C$ slowly increases with applied pressure, and the
magnetostructural transition characterized by critical temperature showing much
rapid decrease with increasing pressure. Comparison of the DSC data for the
investigated compound and the isostructural CoMn$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$Ge one has
made it possible to determine both the structural and magnetic components of
entropy change.

distances cannot arise more than $C_{\epsilon}n^{1+\epsilon}$ times (for any
$\epsilon>0$) among $n$ points in the Euclidean plane (see e.g. \cite{SST84}
and the references contained therein). In three dimensions, the conjectured
bound is $Cn^{\frac{4}{3}}$ (see e.g. \cite{KMSS12} and \cite{Z19}). In
dimensions four and higher, this problem, in its general formulation, loses
meaning because the Lens example shows that one can construct a set of $n$
points in dimension $4$ and higher where the unit distance arises $\approx n^2$
times (see e.g. \cite{B97}). However, the Lens example is one-dimension in
nature, which raises the possibility that the unit distance conjecture is still
quite interesting in higher dimensions under additional structural assumptions
on the point set. This point of view was explored in \cite{I19}, \cite{IS16},
\cite{IMT12}, \cite{IRU14}, \cite{OO15} and has led to some interesting
connections between the unit distance problem and its continuous counterparts,
especially the Falconer distance conjecture (\cite{Falc85}).
  In this paper, we study the unit distance problem and its variants under the
assumption that the underlying family of point sets is uniformly distributed.
We prove several incidence bounds in this setting and clarify some key
properties of uniformly distributed sequences in the context of incidence
problems in combinatorial geometry.

electrons and long-wavelength longitudinal optical phonons induces a many-body
renormalization of the carrier effective masses and the appearence of
characteristic phonon sidebands in the spectral function, commonly dubbed
'polaron satellites'. The simplest model that captures these effects is the
Fr\""ohlich model, whereby electrons in a parabolic band interact with a
dispersionless longitudinal optical phonon. The Fr\""ohlich model has been
employed in a number of seminal papers, from early perturbation-theory
approaches to modern diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. One limitation of
this model is that it focuses on undoped systems, thus ignoring carrier
screening and Pauli blocking effects that are present in real experiments on
doped samples. To overcome this limitation, we here extend the Fr\""ohlich model
to the case of doped systems, and we provide exact solutions for the electron
spectral function, mass enhancement, and polaron satellites. We perform the
analysis using two approaches, namely Dyson's equation with the Fan-Migdal
self-energy, and the second-order cumulant expansion. We find that these two
approaches provide qualitatively different results. In particular, the Dyson's
approach yields better quasiparticle masses and worse satellites, while the
cumulant approach provides better satellite structures, at the price of worse
quasiparticle masses. Both approaches yield an anomalous enhancement of the
electron effective mass at finite doping levels, which in turn leads to a
breakdown of the quasiparticle picture in a significant portion of the phase

the occurrence of superpositions of physical states in such a way that, when

qubits, particularly as a quantum memory. Their 4f-4f transitions are shielded
by filled 5s and 5p orbitals, offering a degree of protection from external
electric fields. Embedded within a thin film oxide host, REIs could enable a
qubit platform with significant memory capabilities. Furthermore, a
silicon-compatible thin film form factor would enable the use of standard
semiconductor fabrication processes to achieve chip-based integrability and
scalability for functional quantum networks. Towards this goal, we have carried
out optical and microstructural studies of erbium-doped polycrystalline and
epitaxial TiO$_2$ thin films on Si (100), r-sapphire, and SrTiO$_3$ (100). We
observe that the inhomogeneous optical linewidth of the Er photoluminescence is
comparable or better for polycrystalline Er:TiO$_2$(grown on Si) in comparison
to single crystal epitaxial films on sapphire or SrTiO$_3$, implying a relative
insensitivity to extended defects. We investigated the effect of the
film/substrate and film/air interface and found that the inhomogeneous
linewidth and spectral diffusion can be significantly improved via bottom
buffer and top capping layers of undoped TiO$_2$. Using such approaches, we
obtain inhomogeneous linewidths of 5.2 GHz and spectral diffusion of 180 MHz in
Er:TiO$_2$ /Si(100) films and have demonstrated the engineerability of
quantum-relevant properties in these thin films.

different crystals described via the 32 point groups, and perform the full

First, our model performs data augmentation followed by label guessing for

by sharpening of the guessed labels and convex combinations of the unlabeled

are performed. To rigorously test our model, we compare PARSE to several

The experiments show that our proposed framework achieves the overall best
results with varying amounts of limited labeled samples in SEED, SEED-IV and
AMIGOS (valence), while approaching the overall best result (reaching the

reducing the distribution alignment between unlabeled and labeled data,

cognitively engage with the information they receive and process this
information thoughtfully. How do people process the information and advice they
receive from AI, and do they engage with it deeply enough to enable learning?
To answer these questions, we conducted three experiments in which individuals
were asked to make nutritional decisions and received simulated AI
recommendations and explanations. In the first experiment, we found that when
people were presented with both a recommendation and an explanation before
making their choice, they made better decisions than they did when they
received no such help, but they did not learn. In the second experiment,
participants first made their own choice, and only then saw a recommendation
and an explanation from AI; this condition also resulted in improved decisions,
but no learning. However, in our third experiment, participants were presented
with just an AI explanation but no recommendation and had to arrive at their
own decision. This condition led to both more accurate decisions and learning
gains. We hypothesize that learning gains in this condition were due to deeper
engagement with explanations needed to arrive at the decisions. This work
provides some of the most direct evidence to date that it may not be sufficient
to include explanations together with AI-generated recommendation to ensure
that people engage carefully with the AI-provided information. This work also
presents one technique that enables incidental learning and, by implication,
can help people process AI recommendations and explanations more carefully.

Uniform proofs of these supercongruences were given in 2019 by Long, Tu, Yui,
and Zudilin. Using p-adic techniques of Dwork, they reduce the original
supercongruences to related congruences which involve only the hypergeometric
series. We generalize their techniques to consider six further supercongruences
recently conjectured by Long. In particular we prove an analogous version of
Long, Tu, Yui, and Zudilin's reduced congruences for each of these six cases.
We also conjecture a generalization of Dwork's work which has been observed

representations associated to our hypergeometric data, yield a full proof of

Our implementation not only enables single-point total energy and
electronic-structure calculations but also provides access to atomic forces and
stresses, hence allowing for full structure relaxations of periodic systems.
Furthermore, our implementation allows one to deal with non-collinear spin
texture, with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect treated self-consistently.
The key aspect behind our implementation is a suitable definition of the
correlated subspace when multiple atomic orbitals with the same angular
momentum are used, and this is addressed via the ""Mulliken charge projector""
constructed in terms of the first (most localized) atomic orbital within the
$d/f$ angular momentum channel. The important Hubbard $U$ and Hund $J$
parameters can be estimated from a screened Coulomb potential of the Yukawa
type, with the screening parameter either chosen semi-empirically or determined
from the Thomas-Fermi screening model. Benchmark calculations are performed for
four late transition metal monoxide bulk systems, i.e., MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO,
and for the 5$d$-electron compounds IrO$_2$. For the former type of systems, we
check the performance of our DFT+$U$ implementation for calculating band gaps,
magnetic moments, electronic band structures, as well as forces and stresses;
for the latter, the efficacy of our DFT+$U$+SOC implementation is assessed.
Systematic comparisons with available experimental results, and especially with
the results from other implementation schemes are carried out, which

proposes a novel scheme named FAAG as an iterative optimization-based method to
generate targeted adversarial examples quickly. By injecting the noise over the
beginning part of the audio, FAAG generates adversarial audio in high quality
with a high success rate timely. Specifically, we use audio's logits output to
map each character in the transcription to an approximate position of the
audio's frame. Thus, an adversarial example can be generated by FAAG in
approximately two minutes using CPUs only and around ten seconds with one GPU
while maintaining an average success rate over 85%. Specifically, the FAAG
method can speed up around 60% compared with the baseline method during the
adversarial example generation process. Furthermore, we found that appending
benign audio to any suspicious examples can effectively defend against the
targeted adversarial attack. We hope that this work paves the way for inventing
new adversarial attacks against speech recognition with computational

Imaging Cherenkov Telescope (MAGIC), and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging
Telescope Array System (VERITAS) have observed diffuse gamma-ray emission
strongly correlated with the central molecular zone in the Galactic center. The
most accepted scenario to generate this emission is via a hadronic interaction
between cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas, where CRs are accelerated from a
central and continuous source of 1 PeV protons (PeVatron). We explore the
influence of the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the central molecular zone on
the indirect observation of the CR energy density via gamma-ray detection. We
simulated synthetic gamma-ray maps using a CR diffusion model with spherical
injection, one isotropic diffusion coefficient, no advection, and
mono-energetic particles of 1 PeV. Also, we used two different 3D gas
distributions considering the observed gas column density, both with and
without an inner cavity. We find that when using a persistent CR source, a
disk-like gas distribution is needed to reproduce the existing CR indirect
observations. This is in agreement with the continuous gas distribution implied
by some dynamical models and studies based on the comparison of emission and
absorption molecular lines. However, it contradicts several models of the
central molecular zone, which imply that this structure has a significant inner
cavity. This tension can be reconciled by an additional, impulsive CR
injection. If the central molecular zone has a cavity, a composite CR
population, coming from the stellar winds of the Wolf-Rayet stars in the
central 0.5 pc and the supernova Sgr A East, produces a good match to the
observed gamma-ray morphology in the Galactic center.

evaluated under an unknown test distribution which potentially differs from the

family of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of
the training distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically
studied under the name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We
consider the problem of deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory

guarantee uniformly small regret under distribution shift. We instead propose
an alternative method called Minimax Regret Optimization (MRO), and show that
under suitable conditions this method achieves uniformly low regret across all
test distributions. We also adapt our technique to have stronger guarantees

from star clusters to galactic stellar haloes to clusters of galaxies. It
derives the cumulative mass profile, M(<r), from kinematics of tracers of the
potential under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and dynamical
equilibrium. We consider the application of Jeans modeling to mapping the dark
matter distribution in the outer reaches of the Milky Way using field halo
stars. We present a novel non-parametric routine for solving the spherical
Jeans equation by fitting B-splines to the velocity and density profiles of
halo stars. While most implementations assume parametric forms for these
profiles, B-splines provide non-parametric fitting curves with analytical
derivatives. Our routine recovers the mass profiles of equilibrium systems with
flattened haloes or a stellar disc and bulge excellently (<~ 10% error at most
radii). Tests with non-equilibrium, Milky Way-like galaxies from the Latte
suite of FIRE-2 simulations perform quite well (<~ 15% error for r <~ 100 kpc).
We also create observationally motivated datasets for the Latte suite by
imposing selection functions and errors on phase space coordinates
characteristic of Gaia and the DESI Milky Way Survey. The resulting imprecise
and incomplete data require us to introduce an MCMC-based subroutine to obtain
deconvolved density and velocity dispersion profiles from the tracer
population. With these observational effects taken into account, the accuracy
of the Jeans mass estimate remains at the level 20% or better.

out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on Euclidean data (e.g., images),
studies on graph data are still limited. Different from images, the complex
nature of graphs poses unique challenges to adopting the invariance principle.
In particular, distribution shifts on graphs can appear in a variety of forms
such as attributes and structures, making it difficult to identify the
invariance. Moreover, domain or environment partitions, which are often
required by OOD methods on Euclidean data, could be highly expensive to obtain
for graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework, called Causality
Inspired Invariant Graph LeArning (CIGA), to capture the invariance of graphs
for guaranteed OOD generalization under various distribution shifts.
Specifically, we characterize potential distribution shifts on graphs with
causal models, concluding that OOD generalization on graphs is achievable when
models focus only on subgraphs containing the most information about the causes
of labels. Accordingly, we propose an information-theoretic objective to
extract the desired subgraphs that maximally preserve the invariant intra-class
information. Learning with these subgraphs is immune to distribution shifts.
Extensive experiments on 16 synthetic or real-world datasets, including a
challenging setting -- DrugOOD, from AI-aided drug discovery, validate the
superior OOD performance of CIGA.

and sufficient conditions under which efficient reinforcement learning is
possible. From this line of work, a remarkably simple minimal sufficient
condition has emerged for sample efficient reinforcement learning: MDPs with
optimal value function $V^*$ and $Q^*$ linear in some known low-dimensional
features. In this setting, recent works have designed sample efficient
algorithms which require a number of samples polynomial in the feature
dimension and independent of the size of state space. They however leave
finding computationally efficient algorithms as future work and this is
considered a major open problem in the community.

NP=RP, no randomized polynomial time algorithm exists for deterministic
transition MDPs with a constant number of actions and linear optimal value
functions. To prove this, we show a reduction from Unique-Sat, where we convert

exhibits the first computational-statistical gap in reinforcement learning with

the Heisenberg model which treats electron spins as localized moments, or by
the itinerant-electron model where the exchange interaction between electrons
leads to unequal numbers of electrons with up and down spins. However, it has
been elusive when both local moments and itinerant electrons are present in the
intermediate range. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we provide direct
spectroscopic evidence on the coexistence of and interplay between local
moments and itinerant electrons in a van der Waals metallic ferromagnet
Fe$_{2.72}$GeTe$_{2}$, which can sustain tunable room-temperature
ferromagnetism down to the monolayer limit. We find that there exist
ferromagnetic spin-wave excitations dispersing from the zone center at low
energies resulting from local moments, and a column-like broad continuum at the
zone boundary at high energies up to over 100 meV resulting from itinerant
electrons. Unlike the two-dimensional crystal structure, the low-energy mode
exhibits a three-dimensional nature, and the high-energy mode also has an
out-of-plane dependence. Both modes persist well above the Curie temperature of
160 K. Our neutron spectroscopic data reveal that the low-energy spin waves at
100 K are more coherent than those at 4 K, which is evidence of the weakening
of the Kondo screening at high temperatures. These results unambiguously
demonstrate the coexistence of local moments and itinerant electrons, and the
Kondo effect between these two components in Fe$_{2.72}$GeTe$_{2}$. Such
behaviors are generally expected in heavy-fermion systems with heavy $f$
electrons but rarely clearly observed in materials with light $d$ electrons.
These findings shed light on the understanding of magnetism in transition-metal

concerned with providing faster learning dynamics for correlated and coarse

significantly more challenging setting of extensive-form games, which can
capture both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect
information. In this paper we establish faster no-regret learning dynamics for
\textit{extensive-form correlated equilibria (EFCE)} in multiplayer general-sum
imperfect-information extensive-form games. When all players follow our
accelerated dynamics, the correlated distribution of play is an
$O(T^{-3/4})$-approximate EFCE, where the $O(\cdot)$ notation suppresses
parameters polynomial in the description of the game. This significantly
improves over the best prior rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$. To achieve this, we develop
a framework for performing accelerated \emph{Phi-regret minimization} via
predictions. One of our key technical contributions -- that enables us to
employ our generic template -- is to characterize the stability of fixed points
associated with \emph{trigger deviation functions} through a refined
perturbation analysis of a structured Markov chain. Furthermore, for the
simpler solution concept of extensive-form \emph{coarse} correlated equilibrium
(EFCCE) we give a new succinct closed-form characterization of the associated
fixed points, bypassing the expensive computation of stationary distributions
required for EFCE. Our results place EFCCE closer to \emph{normal-form coarse
correlated equilibria} in terms of the per-iteration complexity, although the
former prescribes a much more compelling notion of correlation. Finally,
experiments conducted on standard benchmarks corroborate our theoretical
findings.

as meaningful topics for researchers. The former originates from the innate
characteristics of various services supported by 5G networks, and the latter
matters because slices are instantiated on shared physical equipment. However,
the two issues are mainly investigated separately in the literature or do not
receive sufficient research simultaneously. In this work, we study the SAC
problem in 5G/B5G networks, aiming at enhancing the fairness degree on the
premise of satisfying the necessary priority requirements. We first reinterpret
priority as a higher cumulative service acceptance ratio (CSAR), and adopt the
uniformity of adjacent CSAR gaps to reflect the fairness. Based on these
adjustments, the SAC problem is formulated as a non-linear and non-convex
multi-objective optimization. Thus, we propose a heuristic algorithm called
Prioritized Slice Admission Control Considering Fairness (PSACCF) to solve it.
It introduces the resource efficiency of services to amend priority violations,
then promotes fairness by setting the target CSARs for each service type and
pushing their actual CSARs toward. Numerous simulations are carried out to
compare the performance of PSACCF with two existing algorithms, termed MHPF and
AHPF. Results show that our algorithm can achieve a nearly identical priority
indicator to the comparisons, as well as at least a 33.6% improvement in
fairness degree and a higher minimum average resource utilization.

highly desirable in practice due to the smaller number of interactive rounds

typically pays the price of a reduced adaptivity, leading to suboptimal
results. In this paper we propose a solution which requires a careful trade off
between the informativeness of the queried points and their diversity. We
theoretically investigate batch active learning in the practically relevant
scenario where the unlabeled pool of data is available beforehand ({\em
pool-based} active learning). We analyze a novel stage-wise greedy algorithm
and show that, as a function of the label complexity, the excess risk of this
algorithm matches the known minimax rates in standard statistical learning

arise from gyrosynchrotron emission by energetic electrons trapped in the
circumstellar magnetosphere. Recent empirical analyses show that the onset and
strength of the observed radio emission scale with both the magnetic field
strength and the stellar rotation rate. This challenges the existing paradigm
that the energetic electrons are accelerated in the current sheet between
opposite-polarity field lines in the outer regions of magnetised stellar winds,
which includes no role for stellar rotation. Building on recent success in
explaining a similar rotation-field dependence of H$\alpha$ line emission in
terms of a model in which magnetospheric density is regulated by centrifugal
breakout (CBO), we examine here the potential role of the associated CBO-driven
magnetic reconnection in accelerating the electrons that emit the observed
gyrosynchrotron radio. We show in particular that the theoretical scalings for
energy production by CBO reconnection match well the empirical trends for
observed radio luminosity, with a suitably small, nearly constant conversion
efficiency $\epsilon \approx 10^{-8}$. We summarize the distinct advantages of
our CBO scalings over previous associations with an electromotive force, and
discuss the potential implications of CBO processes for X-rays and other

items for a given query item. Existing CIRS models consider the item
co-purchase signal as a proxy of the complementary relationship due to the lack
of human-curated labels from the huge transaction records. These methods
represent items in a complementary embedding space and model the complementary
relationship as a point estimation of the similarity between items vectors.
However, co-purchased items are not necessarily complementary to each other.
For example, customers may frequently purchase bananas and bottled water within
the same transaction, but these two items are not complementary. Hence, using
co-purchase signals directly as labels will aggravate the model performance. On
the other hand, the model evaluation will not be trustworthy if the labels for
evaluation are not reflecting the true complementary relatedness. To address
the above challenges from noisy labeling of the copurchase data, we model the
co-purchases of two items as a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes
the co-purchases from the complementary relatedness, and covariance denotes the
co-purchases from the noise. To do so, we represent each item as a Gaussian
embedding and parameterize the Gaussian distribution of co-purchases by the
means and covariances from item Gaussian embedding. To reduce the impact of the
noisy labels during evaluation, we propose an independence test-based method to
generate a trustworthy label set with certain confidence. Our extensive

scattering results on an alternating antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic chain
compound Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$ that the excited quasiparticles can counter
thermal decoherence and maintain strong correlations at elevated temperatures.
At low temperatures, we observe clear dispersive singlet-triplet excitations
arising from the dimers formed along the crystalline $b$-axis. The excitation
gap is of $\sim$18 meV and the bandwidth is about half of the gap. The band top
energy has a weak modulation along the [100] direction, indicative of a small
interchain coupling. The gap increases while the bandwidth decreases with
increasing temperature, leading to a strong reduction in the available phase
space for the triplons. As a result, the Lorentzian-type energy broadening
becomes highly asymmetric as the temperature is raised. These results are
associated with a strongly correlated state resulting from hard-core constraint
and quasiparticle interactions. We consider these results to be not only
evidence for strong correlations at finite temperatures in Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$,
but also for the universality of the strongly correlated state in a broad range

the privacy of the training data. Membership inference attacks can measure the

meets the needs of differential privacy. Instead of adding noise to the model
output or tampering with the training process of the target model, we directly
process the original data. We first map the source data to the latent space
through the VAE model to get the latent code, then perform noise process
satisfying metric privacy on the latent code, and finally use the VAE model to

the machine learning model trained with newly generated synthetic data can

to regularly retrain using samples collected from the wild. Recent work has
demonstrated the feasibility of backdoor attacks against malware classifiers,
and yet the stealthiness of such attacks is not well understood. In this paper,
we investigate this phenomenon under the clean-label setting (i.e., attackers
do not have complete control over the training or labeling process).
Empirically, we show that existing backdoor attacks in malware classifiers are
still detectable by recent defenses such as MNTD. To improve stealthiness, we
propose a new attack, Jigsaw Puzzle (JP), based on the key observation that
malware authors have little to no incentive to protect any other authors'
malware but their own. As such, Jigsaw Puzzle learns a trigger to complement
the latent patterns of the malware author's samples, and activates the backdoor
only when the trigger and the latent pattern are pieced together in a sample.
We further focus on realizable triggers in the problem space (e.g., software
code) using bytecode gadgets broadly harvested from benign software. Our
evaluation confirms that Jigsaw Puzzle is effective as a backdoor, remains
stealthy against state-of-the-art defenses, and is a threat in realistic
settings that depart from reasoning about feature-space only attacks. We
conclude by exploring promising approaches to improve backdoor defenses.

and sparse observations as the loss function of the network to capture the

it is now able to predict the solutions on domains with unseen geometries from

birefringence that incorporates the effects of the weaker electric field added
to the extremely strong magnetic field. To do so, we first derive a closed
analytical expression for the one-loop effective Lagrangian for the combined
magnetic and electric fields by using an explicit formula of the one-loop
effective Lagrangian for an arbitrarily strong magnetic field. We then employ
the expression to derive the polarization and magnetization of the vacuum, from
which the permittivity and permeability for weak probe fields are obtained.
Finally, we find the refractive indices and the associated polarization vectors
for the case of parallel magnetic and electric fields. The proposed formulation
predicts that an electric field along the magnetic field reduces the
birefringence and rotates the polarization vectors. Such effects should be
taken into account for accurate polarimetry of the x-rays from magnetized
neutron stars, which will prove the fundamental aspect of the strong field
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and explore the extreme fields of astrophysical

  matching problem under lexicographic preferences",,,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a multiple partners matching problem the agents can have multiple partners
up to their capacities. In this paper we consider both the two-sided
many-to-many stable matching problem and the one-sided stable fixtures problem
under lexicographic preferences. We study strong core and Pareto-optimal
solutions for this setting from a computational point of view. First we provide
an example to show that the strong core can be empty even under these severe
restrictions for many-to-many problems, and that deciding the non-emptiness of
the strong core is NP-hard. We also show that for a given matching checking
Pareto-optimality and the strong core properties are co-NP-complete problems
for the many-to-many problem, and deciding the existence of a complete
Pareto-optimal matching is also NP-hard for the fixtures problem. On the
positive side, we give efficient algorithms for finding a near feasible strong
core solution, where the capacities are only violated by at most one unit for
each agent, and also for finding a half-matching in the strong core of
fractional matchings. These polynomial time algorithms are based on the Top
Trading Cycle algorithm. Finally, we also show that finding a maximum size
matching that is Pareto-optimal can be done efficiently for many-to-many
problems, which is in contrast with the hardness result for the fixtures
problem.

  on RandStart and GradAlign",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  PGD-based and FGSM-based are two popular adversarial training (AT) approaches
for obtaining adversarially robust models. Compared with PGD-based AT,
FGSM-based one is significantly faster but fails with catastrophic overfitting
(CO). For mitigating CO in such Fast AT, there are two popular existing
strategies: random start (RandStart) and Gradient Alignment (GradAlign). The
former works only for a relatively small perturbation 8/255 with the l_\infty
constraint, and GradAlign improves it by extending the perturbation size to
16/255 (with the l_\infty constraint) but at the cost of being 3 to 4 times
slower. How to avoid CO in Fast AT for a large perturbation size but without
increasing the computation overhead remains as an unsolved issue, for which our
work provides a frustratingly simple (yet effective) solution. Specifically,
our solution lies in just noise augmentation (NoiseAug) which is a non-trivial
byproduct of simplifying GradAlign. By simplifying GradAlign we have two
findings: (i) aligning logit instead of gradient in GradAlign requires half the
training time but achieves higher performance than GradAlign; (ii) the
alignment operation can also be removed by only keeping noise augmentation
(NoiseAug). Simplified from GradAlign, our NoiseAug has a surprising
resemblance with RandStart except that we inject noise on the image instead of
perturbation. To understand why injecting noise to input prevents CO, we verify
that this is caused not by data augmentation effect (inject noise on image) but
by improved local linearity. We provide an intuitive explanation for why
NoiseAug improves local linearity without explicit regularization. Extensive
results demonstrate that our NoiseAug achieves SOTA results in FGSM AT. The
code will be released after accepted.

learning, owing to its attractive properties. One important approach to
extending this distance is using low-dimensional projections of distributions
to avoid a high computational cost and the curse of dimensionality in empirical
estimation, such as the sliced Wasserstein or max-sliced Wasserstein distances.
Despite their practical success in machine learning tasks, the availability of
statistical inferences for projection-based Wasserstein distances is limited
owing to the lack of distributional limit results. In this paper, we consider
distances defined by integrating or maximizing Wasserstein distances between
low-dimensional projections of two probability distributions. Then we derive
limit distributions regarding these distances when the two distributions are
supported on finite points. We also propose a bootstrap procedure to estimate
quantiles of limit distributions from data. This facilitates asymptotically
exact interval estimation and hypothesis testing for these distances. Our
theoretical results are based on the arguments of Sommerfeld and Munk (2018)
for deriving distributional limits regarding the original Wasserstein distance
on finite spaces and the theory of sensitivity analysis in nonlinear
programming. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the
theoretical results and demonstrate the applicability of our inferential

of data made available by public health authorities (missing data, outliers and
pseudoseasonalities, notably), that calls for cumbersome and ad-hoc
preprocessing (denoising) prior to estimation. Recently, the estimation of the
reproduction number, a measure of the pandemic intensity, was formulated as an
inverse problem, combining data-model fidelity and space-time regularity
constraints, solved by nonsmooth convex proximal minimizations. Though
promising, that formulation lacks robustness against the limited quality of the
Covid19 data and confidence assessment. The present work aims to address both
limitations: First, it discusses solutions to produce a robust assessment of

large-scale strain rates and filtered subgrid-stresses. A priori analyses using

invalid locally as subgrid-scale stresses are poorly correlated with the
large-scale strain rates [Bardina et al., AIAA 1980; Meneveau and Liu, Ann.
Rev. Fluid Mech. 2002]. In the present work, a new, non-Boussinesq
subgrid-scale model is presented where the model coefficients are computed
dynamically. Some previous non-Boussinesq models have observed issues in
providing adequate dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy [e.g.: Bardina et
al., AIAA 1980; Clark et al. J. Fluid Mech., 1979; Stolz and Adams, Phys. of
Fluids, 1999]; however, the present model is shown to provide sufficient
dissipation using dynamic coefficients. Modeled subgrid-scale Reynolds stresses
satisfy the consistency requirements of the governing equations for LES, vanish
in laminar flow and at solid boundaries, and have the correct asymptotic
behavior in the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer.
  The new model, referred to as the dynamic tensor-coefficient Smagorinsky
model (DTCSM), has been tested in simulations of canonical flows: decaying and
forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and wall-modeled turbulent
channel flow at high Reynolds numbers; the results show favorable agreement
with DNS data. In order to assess the performance of DTCSM in more complex
flows, wall-modeled simulations of high Reynolds number flow over a Gaussian
bump exhibiting smooth-body flow separation are performed. Predictions of
surface pressure and skin friction, compared against DNS and experimental data,
show improved accuracy from DTCSM in comparison to the existing static

tractable for frameworks with bounded in-degree. Next, we give a bijection
between the preferred extensions of an argumentation framework being
admissible-closed (the intersection of two admissible sets is admissible) and
the naive extensions of another framework on the same set of arguments. On the
other hand, we prove that identifying admissible-closed argumentation

self-defending sets as those that are not the union of others. It turns out
there exists a bijection between the preferred extensions of an argumentation

syntax splitting for inductive inference states that inferences about

captured in work by Kern-Isberner, Beierle, and Brewka in the form of
postulates for inductive inference operators expressing syntax splitting as a
combination of relevance and independence; it was also shown that c-inference
fulfils syntax splitting, while system P inference and system Z both fail to

We show that system W fulfils the syntax splitting postulates for inductive

the third law of thermodynamics. Similarly, if the atomic ions on the

constraint resembling the ice rule. We discover that a model for pyrochlore
molybdates $A_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ ($A=$Y, Dy, Tb) exhibits a ""supercooled ice"" state
of the displacement degrees of freedom of Mo$^{4+}$ ions, when we take account
of the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect. The JT effect occurs when the lattice
distortions reduce the symmetry of the local crystal field, resulting in the
orbital-energy-splitting that causes the local energy gain. Unlike the standard
JT effect that leads to periodic long range ordering, the displacements of
Mo$^{4+}$ ions are disordered following the ice-like rule. We microscopically
derive a model that describes this situation by having the 2nd and 3rd neighbor
interactions between in-out lattice displacements comparably as strong as the
nearest neighbor interactions of standard ice. There, the well-known nearly
flat energy landscape of the ice state is altered to a metastable highly
quasi-degenerate ice-like liquid state coexisting with a crystalline-like
ground state. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that this liquid remains
remarkably stable down to low temperatures by avoiding the putative first order
transition. The relaxation in the supercooled JT ice state exhibits glassy
dynamics with a plateau structure. They fit the feature of a ""good glassformer""
very often found in molecular liquids, but that has never been observed in
material solids. The high glass-forming ability of the interacting lattice

allocating tariff profiles to end consumers. One of the objectives of such
demand response management is to incentivize the consumers to adjust their
consumption so that the overall electricity procurement in the wholesale
markets is minimized, e.g. it is desirable that consumers consume less during
peak hours when cost of procurement for brokers from wholesale markets are
high. We consider a greedy solution to maximize the overall profit for brokers
by optimal tariff profile allocation. This in-turn requires forecasting
electricity consumption for each user for all tariff profiles. This forecasting
problem is challenging compared to standard forecasting problems due to
following reasons: i. the number of possible combinations of hourly tariffs is
high and retailers may not have considered all combinations in the past
resulting in a biased set of tariff profiles tried in the past, ii. the
profiles allocated in the past to each user is typically based on certain
policy. These reasons violate the standard i.i.d. assumptions, as there is a
need to evaluate new tariff profiles on existing customers and historical data
is biased by the policies used in the past for tariff allocation. In this work,
we consider several scenarios for forecasting and optimization under these
conditions. We leverage the underlying structure of how consumers respond to
variable tariff rates by comparing tariffs across hours and shifting loads, and
propose suitable inductive biases in the design of deep neural network based
architectures for forecasting under such scenarios. More specifically, we
leverage attention mechanisms and permutation equivariant networks that allow
desirable processing of tariff profiles to learn tariff representations that
are insensitive to the biases in the data and still representative of the task.

to extract training data. Depending on the nature of the content and the

the narrow assumptions made by popular data protection techniques (data
sanitization and differential privacy), and the broadness of natural language

the electronic structure evolution is well described by self-consistent tight

optical phonons, in agreement with previous reports of a polaronic ground state

that of LAO/STO and comparing both systems, we estimate that the intrinsic
LAO/STO 2DES has a bare band width of ~ 60 meV and a carrier density of ~ 6

applications such as social networks, finance, and e-commerce. Existing efforts
in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single
scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous
patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive
lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to
encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better
representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between
instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the
anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to
the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a
handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in
real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS,
to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive
experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection
settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant
ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark

Its sensitivity to the magnetization of thin films and surfaces may turn it

which support long range magnetic order in atomically thin layers. However,
realistic surfaces can be affected by defects and disorder, which may result in
unexpected artifacts in the SMR, rather than the sole appearance of electrical
noise. Here, we study the SMR response of heterostructures combining a platinum

strong interfacial disorder in the system. We use transmission electron

the formation of a few-nanometer-thick platinum-chalcogen amorphous layer. The
analysis of the transport and TEM measurements suggests that the signal arises
from a disordered magnetic system formed at the Pt/MnPSe3 interface, washing
out the interaction between the spins of the Pt electrons and the MnPSe3

important contribution to SMR, questioning a widespread assumption on the role

able to assess the effect of Marangoni flow due to the missing coupling between

for the evaporation from a micropillar evaporator by coupling the liquid flow
with the energy transfer in both liquid and solid domains at both cell- and

When the Marangoni number is sufficiently high, the model identifies a sharp
reduction in the evaporator temperature attributed to the thermocapillary
convection creating circulations beneath the liquid-vapor interface, which
results in the formation of periodic reverse surface flows on the interface.
This temperature drop cannot be identified when thermocapillarity is switched
off in the model and the model's prediction substantially deviates from
experimental measurement. Therefore, the current study reveals a hitherto
unexplored role of Marangoni flow in the evaporation of water from micropillar

time dimension. Such a bouncing BEC system can exhibit dramatic breaking of
time-translation symmetry, allowing the creation of discrete time crystals
having up to about 100 temporal lattice sites and suitable for hosting a broad
range of temporal condensed matter phenomena. We first consider single-particle
condensed matter phenomena in the time dimension which include Anderson
localization due to temporal disorder, topological time crystals, and
quasi-crystal structures in time. We then discuss many-body temporal condensed
matter phenomena including Mott insulator phases in time, many-body
localization in time, many-body topological time crystals and time crystals
having long-range exotic interactions. We also discuss the construction of two
(or three) dimensional time lattices, involving the bouncing of a BEC between
two (or three) orthogonal oscillating mirrors and between two oscillating
mirrors oriented at 45-degrees. The latter configuration supports a versatile
M\""obius strip geometry which can host a variety of two-dimensional time
lattices including a honeycomb time lattice and a Lieb square time lattice.
Finally, we discuss the construction of a six-dimensional time-space lattice

expected and/or amortised. While insertions into cuckoo hash tables indeed seem
to take $O(1)$ expected time in practice, only polylogarithmic guarantees are
proven in all but the simplest of practically relevant cases. Given the
widespread use of cuckoo hashing to implement compact dictionaries and Bloom
filter alternatives, closing this gap is an important open problem for
theoreticians.
  In this paper, we show that random walk insertions into cuckoo hash tables
take $O(1)$ expected amortised time when any number $k \geq 3$ of hash
functions is used and the load factor is below the corresponding peeling
threshold (e.g. $\approx 0.81$ for $k = 3$). To our knowledge, this is the
first meaningful guarantee for constant time insertion for cuckoo hashing that
works for $k \in \{3,\dots,9\}$.
  In addition to being useful in its own right, we hope that our key-centred
analysis method can be a stepping stone on the path to the true end goal:
$O(1)$ time insertions for all load factors below the load threshold (e.g.
$\approx 0.91$ for $k = 3$).

typically required: work and data must be divided over multiple GPUs by hand,

  We present Lightning: a framework that follows the common GPU programming
paradigm but enables scaling to large problems with ease. Lightning supports
multi-GPU execution of GPU kernels, even across multiple nodes, and seamlessly
spills data to higher-level memories (main memory and disk). Existing CUDA
kernels can easily be adapted for use in Lightning, with data access
annotations on these kernels allowing Lightning to infer their data
requirements and the dependencies between subsequent kernel launches. Lightning
efficiently distributes the work/data across GPUs and maximizes efficiency by
overlapping scheduling, data movement, and kernel execution when possible.
  We present the design and implementation of Lightning, as well as
experimental results on up to 32 GPUs for eight benchmarks and one real-world

numerically optimize design and algorithmic parameters by, and quantify

depends on how ""well-linearizable"" the software is. In this study, we assess
how promising derivative information of a typical proton computed tomography
(pCT) scan computer simulation is for the aforementioned applications.
  Approach. This study is mainly based on numerical experiments, in which we
repeatedly evaluate three representative computational steps with perturbed
input values. We support our observations with a review of the algorithmic
steps and arithmetic operations performed by the software, using debugging
techniques.
  Main results. The model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) subprocedure
(at the end of the software pipeline) and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation (at
the beginning) were piecewise differentiable. Jumps in the MBIR function arose
from the discrete computation of the set of voxels intersected by a proton
path. Jumps in the MC function likely arose from changes in the control flow
that affect the amount of consumed random numbers. The tracking algorithm
solves an inherently non-differentiable problem.
  Significance. The MC and MBIR codes are ready for the integration of AD, and
further research on surrogate models for the tracking subprocedure is
necessary.

and find that they follow a nearly flat mass function, which supports their
unusual formation path. Our results imply that the cluster stars gain their
mass in two different ways, by disk accretion leading to rapid rotation,
contributing to the red MS, or by binary merger leading to slow rotation and
populating the blue MS. We also derive the approximate merger time of the
individual stars of the blue MS component, and find a strong early peak in the
merger rate, with a lower level merger activity prevailing for tens of Myr.
This supports recent binary formation models, and explains new velocity

geometry of slender leaves of many plants, we find that the thin-walled beam
with a U-shaped cross section exhibits asymmetric deformation behaviors under
bending with opposite orientations. Although this novel mechanical property has
been long noticed and utilized in some applications, its mechanism is still
unclear so far. In this study, we attribute this asymmetric bending behavior of
thin-walled U-shaped beams to the buckling of sidewalls caused by the
bending-induced compressive effect. Based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
and Kirchhoff-Love thin plate theory, a simple but efficient model is
established to derive the critical moment for the sidewall buckling in a
semi-analytical form. Finite element analysis simulations and experiments are
employed to validate the theoretical foundations of our findings. The results

symmetry-protected massless bulk excitations. As a special case, Weyl
nodal-line semimetals are realized in materials either having no inversion or
broken time-reversal symmetry and feature bulk nodal lines. The 111-family of
materials, LaNiSi, LaPtSi and LaPtGe (all lacking inversion symmetry), belong
to this class. Here, by combining muon-spin rotation and relaxation with
thermodynamic measurements, we find that these materials exhibit a fully-gapped
superconducting ground state, while spontaneously breaking time-reversal
symmetry at the superconducting transition. Since time-reversal symmetry is
essential for protecting the normal-state topology, its breaking upon entering
the superconducting state should remarkably result in a topological phase
transition. By developing a minimal model for the normal-state band structure
and assuming a purely spin-triplet pairing, we show that the superconducting
properties across the family can be described accurately. Our results
demonstrate that the 111-family reported here provides an ideal test-bed for

matchings and colourings of graphs emerge out of studying the constructability
of general quantum states using modern photonic technologies. He realized that
if we can prove that the \emph{weighted matching index} of a graph, a parameter
defined in terms of perfect matchings and colourings of the graph is at most 2,
that could lead to exciting insights on the potential of resources of quantum
inference. Motivated by this, he conjectured that the {weighted matching index}
of any graph is at most 2. The first result on this conjecture was by Bogdanov,
who proved that the \emph{(unweighted) matching index} of graphs
(non-isomorphic to $K_4$) is at most 2, thus classifying graphs non-isomorphic
to $K_4$ into Type 0, Type 1 and Type 2. By definition, the weighted matching
index of Type 0 graphs is 0. We give a structural characterization for Type 2
graphs, using which we settle Krenn's conjecture for Type 2 graphs. Using this
characterization, we provide a simple $O(|V||E|)$ time algorithm to find the
unweighted matching index of any graph. In view of our work, Krenn's conjecture
remains to be proved only for Type 1 graphs. We give upper bounds for the
weighted matching index in terms of connectivity parameters for such graphs.
Using these bounds, for a slightly simplified version, we settle Krenn's
conjecture for the class of graphs with vertex connectivity at most 2 and the
class of graphs with maximum degree at most 4.
  Krenn has been publicizing his conjecture in various ways since 2017. He has
even declared a reward for a resolution of his conjecture. We hope that this
article will popularize the problem among computer scientists.

solar-like stars. In this sample, the youngest stars $\epsilon$ Eridani (400
Myr) and $\iota$ Horologii (600 Myr) display the shortest X-ray cycles and the
smallest cycle amplitudes. The corona of $\epsilon$ Eridani was modelled in
terms of solar magnetic structures (active regions, cores of active regions and
flares) at varying filling factors. The study revealed that 65-95% of its
corona is covered with magnetic structures, and this was held responsible for
the low X-ray cycle amplitude. It was also hypothesized that the basal surface
coverage with magnetic structures may be higher on the corona of younger
solar-like stars. To investigate this hypothesis, we study the solar-like star
Kepler-63 in the X-rays. With an age of 210 Myr and a photospheric cycle of
1.27 yr, it is so far the youngest star observed in X-rays with the aim of
revealing a coronal cycle. In the long-term X-ray lightcurve we do not reveal a
periodic variation of the X-ray luminosity, but a factor two change would be
possible. As for the case of $\epsilon$ Eridani, we modelled the corona of
Kepler-63 with magnetic structures observed on the Sun. The study suggests that
100% of the corona is composed of cores and flares of Class M, justifying the
absence of an X-ray cycle and confirming the analogous results derived for
$\epsilon$ Eridani. Finally, we establish an empirical relation between the
cycle amplitude and the X-ray surface flux . From the absence of a coronal
cycle in Kepler-63 we infer that stars with higher X-ray flux than Kepler-63
must host a significant fraction of higher-energetic flares than those
necessary to model the corona of Kepler-63. Our study opens new ground for
studies of the solar-stellar analogy and the joint exploration of resolved and
unresolved variability in stellar X-ray lightcurves.

``curse of mobility''. The performance of massive MIMO drops alarmingly when
the velocity level of user increases. In this paper, we tackle the problem in
frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO with a novel Channel State
Information (CSI) acquisition framework. A joint angle-delay-Doppler (JADD)
wideband precoder is proposed for channel training. Our idea consists in the
exploitation of the partial channel reciprocity of FDD and the
angle-delay-Doppler channel structure. More precisely, the base station (BS)
estimates the angle-delay-Doppler information of the UL channel based on UL
pilots using Matrix Pencil (MP) method. It then computes the wideband JADD
precoders according to the extracted parameters. Afterwards, the user estimates
and feeds back some scalar coefficients for the BS to reconstruct the predicted
DL channel. Asymptotic analysis shows that the CSI prediction error converges
to zero when the number of BS antennas and the bandwidth increases. Numerical
results with industrial channel model demonstrate that our framework can well
adapt to high speed (350 km/h), large CSI delay (10 ms) and channel sample
noise.

thermoelectric applications. Since conventional crystallography cannot
distinguish between static disorder and atomic motions, we develop the
energy-resolved variable-shutter pair distribution function technique. This
collects structural snapshots with varying exposure times, on timescales
relevant for atomic motions. In disagreement with previous interpretations, we
find the time-averaged structure of GeTe to be crystalline at all temperatures,
but with anisotropic anharmonic dynamics at higher temperatures that resemble
static disorder at fast shutter speeds, with correlated ferroelectric
fluctuations along the $<$100$>$c direction. We show that this anisotropy
naturally emerges from a Ginzburg-Landau model that couples polarization
fluctuations through long-range elastic interactions. By accessing
time-dependent atomic correlations in energy materials, we resolve the
long-standing disagreement between local and average structure probes, and show
that spontaneous anisotropy is ubiquitous in cubic IV-VI materials.

bandits to formally address the privacy concerns in its associated personalized
services to participating users (e.g., recommendations). Prior work largely
focus on two trust models of DP: the central model, where a central server is
responsible for protecting users sensitive data, and the (stronger) local
model, where information needs to be protected directly on user side. However,
there remains a fundamental gap in the utility achieved by learning algorithms
under these two privacy models, e.g., $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the
central model as compared to $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret in the local model, if
all users are unique within a learning horizon $T$. In this work, we aim to
achieve a stronger model of trust than the central model, while suffering a
smaller regret than the local model by considering recently popular shuffle
model of privacy. We propose a general algorithmic framework for linear
contextual bandits under the shuffle trust model, where there exists a trusted
shuffler in between users and the central server, that randomly permutes a
batch of users data before sending those to the server. We then instantiate
this framework with two specific shuffle protocols: one relying on privacy
amplification of local mechanisms, and another incorporating a protocol for
summing vectors and matrices of bounded norms. We prove that both these
instantiations lead to regret guarantees that significantly improve on that of
the local model, and can potentially be of the order $\tilde{O}(T^{3/5})$ if
all users are unique. We also verify this regret behavior with simulations on
synthetic data. Finally, under the practical scenario of non-unique users, we
show that the regret of our shuffle private algorithm scale as
$\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, which matches that the central model could achieve in
this case.

Finally, simulation results verify the accuracy of the theoretical analyses and

performance, our results showcase that the RIS rotation plays a more important
role. In other words, we can obtain a considerable improvement by properly
rotating the RIS rather than moving it over a wide area. For instance, we can
achieve more than 200\% performance improvement through rotating the RIS by
42.14$^{\circ}$, while an 150\% improvement is obtained by shifting the RIS
over 400 meters.

governed by the application of the voltage to the device contacts. Here, both

interwell correlation. It provides information on the structure of the objects
under study, as it comprises the framework for constructing geological models
and assessing hydrocarbon reserves. Today, the detailed interwell correlation
relies on manual analysis of well-logging data. Thus, it is time-consuming and
of a subjective nature. The essence of the interwell correlation constitutes an
assessment of the similarities between geological profiles. There were many
attempts to automate the process of interwell correlation by means of
rule-based approaches, classic machine learning approaches, and deep learning
approaches in the past. However, most approaches are of limited usage and
inherent subjectivity of experts. We propose a novel framework to solve the
geological profile similarity estimation based on a deep learning model. Our
similarity model takes well-logging data as input and provides the similarity
of wells as output. The developed framework enables (1) extracting patterns and
essential characteristics of geological profiles within the wells and (2) model
training following the unsupervised paradigm without the need for manual
analysis and interpretation of well-logging data. For model testing, we used
two open datasets originating in New Zealand and Norway. Our data-based
similarity models provide high performance: the accuracy of our model is
$0.926$ compared to $0.787$ for baselines based on the popular gradient
boosting approach. With them, an oil\&gas practitioner can improve interwell
correlation quality and reduce operation time.

compressible Navier-Stokes equations (CNS) with zero thermal conductivity is
considered. First, when shear and bulk viscosity coefficients both depend on
the absolute temperature $\theta$ in a power law ($\theta^\nu$ with $\nu>0$) of
Chapman-Enskog, based on some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic
singular structures, we identify one class of initial data admitting a
local-in-time regular solution with far field vacuum in terms of the mass
density $\rho$, velocity $u$ and entropy $S$. Furthermore, it is shown that
within its life span of such a regular solution, the velocity stays in an
inhomogeneous Sobolev space, i.e., $u\in H^3(\mathbb{R}^3)$, $S$ has uniformly
finite lower and upper bounds in the whole space, and the laws of conservation
of total mass, momentum and total energy are all satisfied. Note that due to
the appearance of the vacuum, the momentum equations are degenerate both in the
time evolution and viscous stress tensor, and the physical entropy for
polytropic gases behaves singularly, which make the study on corresponding
well-posedness challenging. For proving the existence, we first introduce an
enlarged reformulated structure by considering some new variables, which can
transfer the degeneracies of the full CNS to the possible singularities of some
special source terms related with $S$, and then carry out some singularly
weighted energy estimates carefully designed for this reformulated system.

interacting ultracold bosonic atoms in a symmetric three-site lattice. The
basic protocol consists in preparing all atoms on one site of the lattice and
then letting the system evolve during a specific time such that collective
tunneling of the atoms to the other two sites takes place. The key point put
forward here is that this evolution time can be reduced by several orders of
magnitude via the application of a periodic driving of the lattice, thereby
rendering this protocol feasible in practice. This driving is suitably tuned
such that classical chaos is generated in the entire accessible phase space
except for the Planck cells that host the states participating at the above
triple-NOON superposition. Chaos-assisted tunneling can then give rise to a
dramatic speed-up of this collective tunneling process, without significantly
affecting the purity of this superposition. A triple-NOON state containing $N =

We also model the delta information as wrinkle maps for the physically-based

scattering amplitudes. This duality implies hidden symmetries for both objects.
We consider closely related infrared finite observables, defined as the Wilson
loop with a Lagrangian insertion, normalized by the Wilson loop itself. Unlike
ratio and remainder functions studied in the literature, this observable is
non-trivial already for four scattered particles and bears close resemblance to
(finite parts of) scattering processes in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
We study the general structure of the Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion,
focusing in particular on its leading singularities and their (hidden) symmetry
properties. We find evidence that the leading singularities can be written as
certain Grassmannian integrals. The latter are manifestly dual conformal. They
also have a conformal symmetry, up to total derivatives. We find that,
surprisingly, the conformal symmetry becomes an invariance in the frame where
the Lagrangian insertion point is sent to infinity. Furthermore, we use
integrability methods to study how higher Yangian charges act on the
Grassmannian integral. We evaluate the $n$-particle observable both at tree-
and at one-loop level, finding compact analytic formulas. These results are
explicitly written in the form of conformal leading singularities, multiplied
by transcendental functions. We then compare these formulas to known
expressions for all-plus amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory. We find a
remarkable new connection: the Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills appears to predict the maximal weight terms of
the planar pure Yang-Mills all-plus amplitude. We test this relationship for
the two-loop $n$-point Yang-Mills amplitude, as well as for the three-loop
four-point amplitude.

powerful tools to predict and control epidemic outbreaks, in many cases helping
to mitigate their impacts. A key quantity for these models is the so-called
Basic Reproduction Number, that measures the number of secondary infections
produced by an initial infected individual in a fully susceptible population.
Some methods have been developed to allow the direct computation of this
quantity provided that some conditions are fulfilled, such that the model has a
pre-pandemic disease-free equilibrium state. This condition is only fulfilled
when the populations are stationary. In the case of vector-borne diseases, this
implies that the vector birth and death rates need to be balanced, what is not
fulfilled in many realistic cases in which the vector population grow or
decrease. Here we develop a vector-borne epidemic model with growing and
decaying vector populations and study the conditions under which the standard
methods to compute $R_0$ work and discuss an alternative when they fail. We
also show that growing vector populations produce a delay in the epidemic
dynamics when compared to the case of the stationary vector population.
Finally, we discuss the conditions under which the model can be reduced to the
SIR model with fewer compartments and parameters, which helps in solving the
problem of parameter unidentifiability of many vector-borne epidemic models.

Te-doped BaTiO3 are investigated by first-principal calculation based on the
density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory implemented in WIEN2K
and BoltzTraP simulation program. This study is carried out by applying LDA +
TB-mBJ potential. Formation energy of each doped structure is calculated to
examine the stability and feasibility of the synthesis. Incorporating Te into
BaTiO3 efficiently reduces the electronic band gap and the level of band gap
reduction can be controlled by varying the amount of dopant. Hence, the
absorption ability is improved in the visible light. Our findings suggest that
all the doped structures are significantly absorbent and productive with an
optical absorption that exceeds 105 cm-1 in the visible range. In addition,
BaTiO3 revealed a smaller dielectric constant at zero frequency compared to Te
doped-BTO: 8.3%, while the optical energy gap is reduced from 3.692 eV to 1.619
eV by growing Te concentration. Then, optical conductivity and Urbach's
parameters are predicted. The transport properties are assessed as a function
of temperature. It is found that the electrical conductivity is considerably
enhanced with increase properties such as Seebeck coefficient and figure of
merit are also investigated. Our theoretical results can be useful for
thermoelectric and visible light photoelectrical device applications.

In our JCMT~Transient monitoring survey, we discovered that a young binary
protostar, HOPS 373, is undergoing a modest $30\%$ brightness increase at 850
$\mu$m, caused by a factor of 1.8$-$3.3 enhancement in the accretion rate. The
initial burst occurred over a few months, with a sharp rise and then shallower
decay. A second rise occurred soon after the decay, and the source is still
bright one year later. The mid-IR emission, the small-scale CO outflow mapped
with ALMA, and the location of variable maser emission indicate that the
variability is associated with the SW component. The near-infrared and NEOWISE
$W1$ and $W2$ emission is located along the blueshifted CO outflow, spatially
offset by $\sim3$ to $4^{\prime\prime}$ from the SW component. The $K$-band
emission imaged by UKIRT shows a compact H$_2$ emission source at the edge of
the outflow, with a tail tracing the outflow back to the source. The $W1$
emission, likely dominated by scattered light, brightens by 0.7 mag, consistent
with expectations based on the sub-mm lightcurve. The signal of continuum
variability in $K$-band and $W2$ is masked by stable H$_2$ emission, as seen in
our Gemini/GNIRS spectrum, and perhaps by CO emission. These differences in
emission sources complicate infrared searches for variability of the youngest

containing corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting methods are
popularly used to alleviate this data bias issue. Most current methods,
however, require to manually pre-specify the weighting schemes as well as their
additional hyper-parameters relying on the characteristics of the investigated
problem and training data. This makes them fairly hard to be generally applied
in practical scenarios, due to their significant complexities and inter-class
variations of data bias situations. To address this issue, we propose a
meta-model capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting scheme directly
from data. Specifically, by seeing each training class as a separate learning
task, our method aims to extract an explicit weighting function with sample
loss and task/class feature as input, and sample weight as output, expecting to
impose adaptively varying weighting schemes to different sample classes based
on their own intrinsic bias characteristics. Synthetic and real data
experiments substantiate the capability of our method on achieving proper
weighting schemes in various data bias cases, like the class imbalance,
feature-independent and dependent label noise scenarios, and more complicated
bias scenarios beyond conventional cases. Besides, the task-transferability of
the learned weighting scheme is also substantiated, by readily deploying the
weighting function learned on relatively smaller-scale CIFAR-10 dataset on much
larger-scale full WebVision dataset. A performance gain can be readily achieved
compared with previous SOAT ones without additional hyper-parameter tuning and
meta gradient descent step. The general availability of our method for multiple
robust deep learning issues, including partial-label learning, semi-supervised

Despite significant efforts, no bound low-lying intruder $f_{7/2}$-state, which
would place $^{29}$Ne firmly inside the island of inversion, has yet been
observed. Here, the first investigation of unbound states of $^{29}$Ne is
reported. The states were populated in $^{30}\mathrm{Ne}(p,pn)$ and
$^{30}\mathrm{Na}(p,2p)$ reactions at a beam energy of around $230$
MeV/nucleon, and analyzed in terms of their resonance properties, partial cross
sections and momentum distributions. The momentum distributions are compared to
calculations using the eikonal, direct reaction model, allowing
$\ell$-assignments for the observed states. The lowest-lying resonance at an
excitation energy of 1.48(4) MeV shows clear signs of a significant
$\ell$=3-component, giving first evidence for $f_{7/2}$ single particle
strength in $^{29}$Ne. The excitation energies and strengths of the observed

researchers due to their fascinating structures and dynamic behaviors. Magnetic
hopfion is a prominent example of 3D magnetic textures. Here, we numerically
study the mutual conversion between a Neel-type hopfion and a Neel-type toron
under an external magnetic field. We also investigate the excitation modes of
hopfions and torons in a film with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. It
is found that the Neel-type hopfion could be a stable state in the absence of
the external magnetic field, and its diameter varies with the out-of-plane
magnetic field. The Neel-type hopfion may transform to a Neel-type toron at an
out-of-plane magnetic field of about 20 mT, where the cross section structure
is a Neel-type skyrmion. The hopfion and toron show different excitation modes
in the presence of an in-plane microwave magnetic field. Our results provide a
method to realize the conversion between a Neel-type hopfion and a Neel-type
toron, which also gives a way to distinguish Bloch-type and Neel-type hopfions.

  Monte-Carlo Study",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hollow-core anti-resonant fibers (HC-ARFs) have earned great attention in the
fiber optics community due to their remarkable light-guiding properties and
broad application spectrum. Particularly nested HC-ARFs have recently reached
competitiveness to standard fibers and even outperform them in certain
categories. Key to their success is a precisely fine-tuned geometry, which
inherently leaves optical characteristics highly susceptible to minimal
structural deviations. When fabricating fibers, these come into play and
manifest themselves in various imperfections to the geometry, ultimately
worsening the fiber performance. In this article, for the first time to the
best of our knowledge, these imperfections have been statistically modeled and
analyzed on their impact to the propagation loss in a Monte-Carlo fashioned
simulation. We have considered randomly varying outer and nested tube wall
thicknesses as well as random tube angle offsets. We found that the loss
increase due to perturbed tube angles dominates that of varying tube
thicknesses by approximately an order of magnitude for FM and two orders of
magnitude for HOM propagation at a wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m. Moreover, the
higher-order-mode-extinction-ratio (HOMER) is proportional to the intensity of
structural variations, indicating an increase in the `single-modeness' of a
fabricated fiber. Furthermore, a bend condition worsens the loss contribution
of both effects applied jointly dramatically to a value of $+50\%$ at a bend
radius of 4 cm compared to $+5\%$ for a straight fiber. We believe that our
work helps to predict the performance of realistic HC-ARFs after fabrication.

investigated the possibility of adapting simultaneously to the norm $U$ of the

showing that there is in fact never a price to pay for adaptivity if we

results cover log loss, (linear and non-parametric) logistic regression, square
loss prediction, and (linear and non-parametric) least-squares regression. We
also fill in several gaps in the literature by providing matching lower bounds

However, each of the three steps becomes non-trivial due to image variations

cause variations among vehicles of the same type. These decorations make
license plate localization and recognition difficult due to severe background
clutter and partial occlusions. Likewise, on most vehicles, specifically
trucks, the position of the license plate is not consistent. Lastly, for
license plate reading, the variations are induced by non-uniform font styles,
sizes, and partially occluded letters and numbers. Our proposed framework takes
advantage of both data availability and performance evaluation of the backbone
deep learning architectures. We gather a novel dataset, \emph{Diverse Vehicle

vehicle types. Each image is then manually annotated for vehicle type, license

intrinsically non-Hermitian systems, often described by reflection and
transmission matrices with complex eigenfrequencies. Here, we show that
Parity-Time symmetry breaking -- either explicit or spontaneous -- moves the
position of Zero singularities of the reflection or transmission matrices from
the real axis to the upper part of the complex frequency plane. A universal 0

frequency excitation is thus realized whenever the discontinuity branch
bridging a Zero and a Pole, i.e a pair of singularities, is crossing the real

these two types of rare stars can be explained by a variant of one of the main
channels forming hot subdwarf stars. The scenario involves the formation and
merging of a He-core white dwarf and a less massive CO-core white dwarf. We
have constructed a simple merger models and computed their subsequent
evolution. The merger products are in agreement with the surface parameters and
composition of CO-sdOs. In addition, we have performed simulations including
the effects of element diffusion and the excitation of pulsations. These
simulations show that less massive merger products can form stellar structures
that have surface parameters, abundances, and pulsation periods similar to
those displayed by He-sdBVs. We conclude that the proposed scenario, or some
variant of it, offers a very plausible explanation for the formation of

algorithms in contextual bandits. While standard methods require a O(CT^3)
complexity where T is the horizon and the constant C is related to optimizing
the UCB rule, we propose an efficient contextual algorithm for large-scale
problems. Specifically, our method relies on incremental Nystrom approximations
of the joint kernel embedding of contexts and actions. This allows us to
achieve a complexity of O(CTm^2) where m is the number of Nystrom points. To
recover the same regret as the standard kernelized UCB algorithm, m needs to be
of order of the effective dimension of the problem, which is at most
O(\sqrt(T)) and nearly constant in some cases.

their valley sensitivity. For this purpose, multivalley IV-VI topological
crystalline insulator (TCI) heterostructures are explored using magneto-optical
Landau level spectroscopy up to 34 teslas. We characterize the topological
interface states emerging from the distinct L-valleys in Pb1-xSnxSe multi
quantum wells grown along the [111] direction. It is shown that the shape of
the 2D Fermi surfaces of topological interface states residing at the
TCI/trivial insulator interfaces are strongly affected by the valley anisotropy
of topologically trivial Pb1-yEuySe barriers. This phenomenon is shown to be
due to the deep penetration of the topological interface states into the
barriers. For the valleys tilted with respect to the confinement direction, a
significant interaction between topological states and the conventional massive
quantum well states is observed, evidenced by the resulting large
anti-crossings between Landau levels. These are theoretically well-described by
a k.p model that takes into account tilt and anisotropy of the valleys in two
dimensions. Therefore, our work provides a precise characterization of the
topological interface state valley splitting, as well as an accurate
determination of the anisotropy of their Dirac cone dispersion.

Low-quality specifications can have expensive consequences during the

requirement engineering are long, leading to artifacts that are not easily
maintainable, are hard to understand, and are inefficient to port to other
system variants. We use the idea of smells to specifications expressed in
natural language, defining a set of specifications for bad smells. We developed
a tool called NALABS (NAtural LAnguage Bad Smells), available on

gravitational wave astronomy is to model the intermediate mass ratio regime and
connect it to the extreme mass ratio regime. A natural approach is to employ
the effective one body (EOB) approach to the two-body dynamics that, by design,
can cover the entire mass ratio range and naturally incorporates the extreme
mass ratio limit. Here we use recently obtained numerical relativity (NR) data
with mass ratios $m_1/m_2=(7,15,\,32,\,64,\,128)$ to test the accuracy of the
state-of-the-art EOB model TEOBResumS in the intermediate mass ratio regime. We
generally find an excellent EOB/NR consistency around merger and ringdown for
all mass ratios and for all available subdominant multipoles, except for the
$\ell=m=5$ one. This mode can be crucially improved using the new large-mass
ratio NR data of this paper. The EOB/NR inspirals are also consistent with the
estimated NR uncertainties. We also use several NR datasets taken by different
public catalogs to probe the universal behavior of the multipolar hierarchy of
waveform amplitudes at merger, that smoothly connects the equal-mass BBH to the
test-mass result. Interestingly, the universal behavior is strengthened if the
nonoscillatory memory contribution is included in the NR waveform. Future NR
simulations with improved accuracy will be necessary to further probe, and
possibly quantitatively refine, the TEOBResumS transition from late inspiral to
plunge in the intermediate mass ratio regime.

improving the joint scheme of estimating the centroid and the separation, but
also some clues to the optimal measurements for the sequential scheme. In

posteriors by optimization. In contrast to MCMC, VI scales to many
observations. In the case of complex posteriors, however, state-of-the-art VI
approaches often yield unsatisfactory posterior approximations. This paper
presents Bernstein flow variational inference (BF-VI), a robust and easy-to-use

combines ideas from normalizing flows and Bernstein polynomial-based

with exact posteriors, MCMC solutions, and state-of-the-art VI methods
including normalizing flow based VI. We show for low-dimensional models that
BF-VI accurately approximates the true posterior; in higher-dimensional models,
BF-VI outperforms other VI methods. Further, we develop with BF-VI a Bayesian
model for the semi-structured Melanoma challenge data, combining a CNN model

ecological questions in biogeography and biodiversity among others. Several
ecological principles, such as the niche hypothesis and the competitive
exclusions, are based on the fact that species compete for resources. More in
general, it is now recognized that species interactions play a crucial role in
determining the coexistence and abundance of species. However, experimentally
controllable platforms, which allow to study and measure competitions among
species, are rare and difficult to implement. In this work, we suggest to
exploit a Molecular Dynamics coarse-grained model to study interactions among
single strands of DNA, representing individuals of different species, which
compete for binding to other oligomers considered as resources. In particular,
the well-established knowledge of DNA-DNA interactions at the nanoscale allows
us to test the hypothesis that the maximum consecutive overlap between pairs of
oligomers measure the species competitive advantages. However, we suggest that
more complex structure also plays a role in the ability of the species to
successfully bind to the target resource oligomer. We complement the
simulations with experiments on populations of DNA strands which qualitatively
confirm our hypotheses. These tools constitute a promising starting point for
further developments concerning the study of controlled, DNA-based, artificial
ecosystems.

those from static experiments, but is in good agreement with recent shock
experiments. Up to ~450 GPa, our melting curve is generally consistent with the
melting points from first-principles calculations using the small-cell
coexistence method. We found that, at high pressures of a few hundred GPa, due
to the strong softening of interatomic interactions in the liquid phase,
solid-liquid coexistence simulations of Mg show some characteristics
distinctively different from other metal systems, such as aluminum. For
example, at a given volume, the pressure and temperature range for maintaining
a stable solid-liquid coexistence state can be very small. The strong softening
in the liquid phase also causes the unusual behavior of reentrant melting to
occur at very high pressures. The onset of reentrant melting is predicted at
~305 GPa, close to that at ~300 GPa from the small-cell coexistence method. We
show that the calculated melting points, considering reentrant melting, can be
excellently fitted to a low-order Kechin equation, thereby making it possible
for us to obtain a first-principles melting curve of Mg at pressures above 50
GPa for the first time. Similar characteristics in solid-liquid coexistence
simulations, as well as reentrant melting, are also expected for other systems
with strong softening in the liquid phase at high pressures.

This suggests the use of first order formalism, where the metric may emerge
from more fundamental constituents and the theory can be consistently extended

interpretations of first order formalism, finding that a fundamental vector or
spinor substructure brings about continuum magnetization and polarization as
integration constants. This effect is analogous to the description of the

superpositions of propagative plane waves. This observation is the foundation
of successful Trefftz methods. However, when too many plane waves are used, the
computation of the expansion is known to be numerically unstable. We prove that
exponentially large coefficients in the expansion are unavoidable and we
explain how this causes instability. In this work, we show that the Helmholtz

Here, by evanescent plane waves, we mean exponential plane waves with
complex-valued propagation vector, whose absolute value decays exponentially in
one direction. In addition, the density in this representation is proved to be
uniformly bounded in a suitable weighted Lebesgue norm, hence overcoming the
instability observed with propagative plane waves and paving the way for stable
discrete expansions. In view of practical implementations, discretization
strategies are investigated. We construct suitable finite-dimensional sets of

proposes an algorithm that uses a limited number of re-reads to characterize
the noise distribution and recover the stored information. Both hard and soft
decoding are considered. For hard decoding, the paper attempts to find a read
threshold minimizing bit-error-rate (BER) and derives an expression for the

  The proposed method does not require any prior knowledge about the noise
distribution, but can take advantage of such information when it is available.
Each read threshold is chosen based on the results of previous reads, following
an optimal policy derived through a dynamic programming backward recursion. The
method and results are studied from the perspective of an SLC Flash memory with

techniques can play a pivotal role for the contextually processing of
multimodal data. However, since the computational power of HA devices is low,
therefore this data must be processed either on the edge or cloud which, in

proposes several techniques for data encryption but their computational

interaction-driven valley-polarized state connecting two superconducting
regions of MATBG would give rise to a long-sought-after purely electric
controlled $\varphi_0$-junction in which the two superconductors acquire a
finite phase difference $\varphi_0$ in the ground state. We point out that the
emergence of the $\varphi_0$-junction stems from the valley-polarized state
which breaks time-reversal symmetry and trigonal warping effects which break
the intravalley inversion symmetry. Importantly, a spatially non-uniform valley
polarization order parameter at the junction can explain the highly
unconventional Fraunhofer patterns observed in the experiment. Our work
explores the novel transport properties of the valley-polarized state and
suggests that gate-defined MATBG Josephson junctions could realize the first
purely electric controlled $\varphi_0$-junctions with applications in
superconducting devices.

Similar to conventional microwave SQUID multiplexing, our multiplexer relies on

linearization. However, instead of utilizing one resonator per SQUID, we couple
multiple SQUIDs to a common readout resonator and encode the SQUID input
signals in sidebands of the microwave carrier by varying the flux ramp
modulation frequency for each SQUID. We prove the suitability of our approach

amount represented in a dataset. In that, classification performance
degradation occurs widely, it is significantly important to have CNNs that work
well on class imbalanced skin lesion image dataset. In this paper, we propose
SuperCon, a two-stage training strategy to overcome the class imbalance problem

training that tries to learn a feature representation that closely aligned
among intra-classes and distantly apart from inter-classes, and (ii) classifier
fine-tuning that aims to learn a classifier that correctly predict the label
based on the learnt representations. In the experimental evaluation, extensive

strategy effectively addresses the class imbalance classification problem, and
significantly improves existing works in terms of F1-score and AUC score,

solve this problem for the first nested inverse case. More precisely, we obtain
a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box RIT algorithm for noncommutative

labeled source domain to a label scarce target domain. Previous research has
either focused on unlabeled domain adaptation without any target supervision or
semi-supervised domain adaptation with few labeled target examples per class.
On the other hand Positive-Unlabeled (PU-) Learning has attracted increasing
interest in the weakly supervised learning literature since in quite some real
world applications positive labels are much easier to obtain than negative
ones. In this work we are the first to introduce the challenge of
Positive-Unlabeled Domain Adaptation where we aim to generalise from a fully
labeled source domain to a target domain where only positive and unlabeled data
is available. We present a novel two-step learning approach to this problem by
firstly identifying reliable positive and negative pseudo-labels in the target
domain guided by source domain labels and a positive-unlabeled risk estimator.
This enables us to use a standard classifier on the target domain in a second
step. We validate our approach by running experiments on benchmark datasets for
visual object recognition. Furthermore we propose real world examples for our
setting and validate our superior performance on parking occupancy data.

responses presenting large spatial gradients or discontinuities. In these
cases, providing high-quality body-fitted finite element analysis meshes and
obtaining accurate solutions remain challenging. Immersed boundary techniques
provide elegant solutions for such problems. Enrichment methods alleviate the
need for generating conforming analysis grids by capturing discontinuities
within mesh elements. Additionally, increased accuracy of physical responses
and geometry description can be achieved with higher-order approximation bases.
In particular, using B-splines has become popular with the development of
IsoGeometric Analysis. In this work, an eXtended IsoGeometric Analysis (XIGA)
approach is proposed for multi-material problems. The computational domain
geometry is described implicitly by level set functions. A novel generalized
Heaviside enrichment strategy is employed to accommodate an arbitrary number of
materials without artificially stiffening the physical response. Higher-order
B-spline functions are used for both geometry representation and analysis.
Boundary and interface conditions are enforced weakly via Nitsche's method, and
a new face-oriented ghost stabilization methodology is used to mitigate
numerical instabilities arising from small material integration subdomains.
Two- and three-dimensional heat transfer and elasticity problems are solved to
validate the approach. Numerical studies provide insight into the ability to
handle multiple materials considering sharp-edged and curved interfaces, as
well as the impact of higher-order bases and stabilization on the solution

that only some of these bumps can be attributed to the dwarf nova outbursts

in favor of its orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$ very long for a CV, about 20-40

temporal drift to each sub-burst in the dynamic spectra. We find a linear
relationship between the sub-burst's drift and its duration. At the same time,
the drifts are consistent with coming from the sad-trombone effect. This has
not been predicted by current models. The energy distribution shows an excess
of high energy bursts and is insufficiently modelled by a single power-law even

much effort has been invested in recent years to constrain their initial
phase-space coordinates. Yet equally important are the assumptions on the
potential that the dwarf galaxies experience over time, especially given the
fact that the MW is currently accreting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In
this work, using a dark matter-only zoom-in simulation, we test whether the use
of common parametric forms of the potential is adequate to successfully
backward integrate the orbits of the subhaloes from their present-day
positions. We parametrise the recovered orbits and compare them with those from
the simulations. We find that simple symmetric parametric forms of the
potential fail to capture the complexities and the inhomogeneities of the true
potential experienced by the subhaloes. More specifically, modelling a recent
massive accretion like that of the LMC as a sum of two spherical parametric
potentials leads to substantial errors in the recovered parameters of the
orbits. These errors rival those caused due to a) a 30\% uncertainty in the
virial mass of the MW and b) not modelling the potential of the recently
accreted massive satellite. Our work suggests that i) the uncertainties in the
parameters of the recovered orbits of some MW dwarfs may be under-estimated and
that ii) researchers should characterise the uncertainties inherent to their
choice of integration techniques and assumptions of the potential against
cosmological zoom-in simulations of the MW, which include a recently-accreted
LMC.

relocate themselves in distinct nodes of an unknown network. The network is
modeled as an anonymous graph $G=(V,E)$, where the nodes of the graph are not

numbers in the range $0,1, \cdots, d-1$ at $v$. The robots have unique ids in
the range $[0,L]$, where $L \ge k$, and are initially placed at a source node

robots or the values of $L,k$. The task of dispersion was traditionally
achieved with the assumption of two types of communication abilities: (a) when
some robots are at the same node, they can communicate by exchanging messages
between them (b) any two robots in the network can exchange messages between
them.
  In this paper, we ask whether this ability of communication among co-located
robots is necessary to achieve dispersion. We show that even if the ability of
communication is not available, the task of dispersion by a set of mobile
robots can be achieved in a much weaker model where a robot at a node $v$ has

$\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a node in $G$. Each robot uses $O(\log L+

range of choice with heterogeneous instances and prices that can provide the
flexibility for different cost-performance needs. However, this flexibility
also leads to the complexity of selecting the right resource configuration
(e.g., instance type, resource demands) for each task in the DAG, while
simultaneously scheduling the tasks with the selected resources to reach the
optimal end-to-end performance and cost. These two decisions are often
codependent resulting in an NP-hard scheduling optimization bottleneck.
Existing solutions only focus solely on either problem and ignore the co-effect
on the end-to-end optimum. We propose AGORA, a scheduler that considers both
task-level resource allocation and execution for DAG workflows as a whole in

heteronuclei (X-SABRE). The conventional analysis of the SABRE effect is based
on level anti-crossings (LACs), which requires very low magnetic fields (~
0.6uT) to achieve resonance and transfer spin order from the para-hydrogen to
target heteronuclei. We have demonstrated in our recent study that the validity
of LACs used in SABRE is very limited, so the maximum SABRE polarization
predicted with LACs is not correct. Here, we present several oscillating pulse
sequences that use magnetic fields far away from the resonance condition and
can commonly triple the polarization. An analysis with average Hamiltonian
theory indicates that the oscillating pulse, in effect, adjusts the J-couplings
between hydrides and target nuclei and that a much weaker coupling produces
maximum polarization. This theoretical treatment, combined with simulations and
experiment, show substantial magnetization improvements relative to traditional
X-SABRE methods. It also shows that, in contrast to most pulse sequence

greatly affect the water temperature of downstream river segments. However, the
information of released water flow is often not available for many reservoirs,
which makes it difficult for data-driven models to capture the impact to
downstream river segments. In this paper, we first build a state-aware graph
model to represent the interactions amongst streams and reservoirs, and then
propose a parallel learning structure to extract the reservoir release
information and use it to improve the prediction. In particular, for reservoirs
with no available release information, we mimic the water managers' release
decision process through a pseudo-prospective learning method, which infers the
release information from anticipated water temperature dynamics. For reservoirs
with the release information, we leverage a physics-based model to simulate the
water release temperature and transfer such information to guide the learning
process for other reservoirs. The evaluation for the Delaware River Basin shows
that the proposed method brings over 10\% accuracy improvement over existing
data-driven models for stream temperature prediction when the release data is
not available for any reservoirs. The performance is further improved after we
incorporate the release data and physical simulations for a subset of

$\dot{M}_\mathrm{j}$ of order the Eddington rate, with maximum velocity
$v_\mathrm{j}$ of order the escape speed, to two spherical sectors with the jet
axis perpendicular to the orbital plane, and supplies kinetic energy at the

the jet on orbital evolution, envelope morphology and envelope unbinding, and
assess the dependence of the results on jet mass-loss rate, launch speed,
companion mass, opening angle, and whether or not subgrid accretion is turned

This places RL practitioners in a position to design systems that have never

could intervene on complex dynamics that were previously too opaque to
deliberate about, and long-held policy ambitions would finally be made
tractable. In this whitepaper we illustrate this potential and how it might be
technically enacted in the domains of energy infrastructure, social media
recommender systems, and transportation. Alongside these unprecedented
interventions come new forms of risk that exacerbate the harms already
generated by standard machine learning tools. We correspondingly present a new
typology of risks arising from RL design choices, falling under four
categories: scoping the horizon, defining rewards, pruning information, and
training multiple agents. Rather than allowing RL systems to unilaterally
reshape human domains, policymakers need new mechanisms for the rule of reason,
foreseeability, and interoperability that match the risks these systems pose.
We argue that criteria for these choices may be drawn from emerging subfields
within antitrust, tort, and administrative law. It will then be possible for
courts, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental organizations to play
more active roles in RL specification and evaluation. Building on the ""model

if there exists $f \in k[\mathcal{V}]^G$ separating $v$ and $w$, then there
exists $f \in S$ separating $v$ and $w$.
  In this article we consider the action of $G = \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ on
the variety $\mathcal{M}_2^n$ of $n$-tuples of $2 \times 2$ matrices by
simultaneous conjugation. Minimal generating sets $S_n$ of
$\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}_2^n]^G$ are well-known, and $|S_n| = \frac16(n^3+11n)$.
In recent work, Kaygorodov, Lopatin and Popov showed that for all $n \geq 1$,
$S_n$ is a minimal separating set by inclusion, i.e. that no proper subset of
$S_n$ is a separating set. This does not necessarily mean that $S_n$ has
minimum cardinality among all separating sets for
$\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}_2^n]^G$. Our main result shows that any separating set
for $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}_2^n]^G$ has cardinality $\geq 5n-5$. In particular,
there is no separating set of size $\dim(\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}_2^n]) = 4n-3$
for $n \geq 3$. Further, $S_3$ has indeed minimum cardinality as a separating
set, but for $n \geq 4$ there may exist a smaller separating set than $S_n$. We
show that for $n \geq 5$ there does, in fact, exist a smaller separating set
than $S_n$. We also prove similar results for the left-right action of
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ on
$\mathcal{M}_2^n$.

to distribution, automatic means of determining media quality are needed.
Protection mechanisms in digital audio processing tools have not eliminated the
need of production entities located downstream the distribution chain to assess
audio quality and detect defects inserted further upstream. Such analysis often
relies on the received audio and scarce meta-data alone. Deliberate use of
artefacts such as clicks in popular music as well as more recent defects
stemming from corruption in modern audio encodings call for data-centric and
context sensitive solutions for detection. We present a convolutional network
architecture following end-to-end encoder decoder configuration to develop
detectors for two exemplary audio defects. A click detector is trained and
compared to a traditional signal processing method, with a discussion on
context sensitivity. Additional post-processing is used for data augmentation
and workflow simulation. The ability of our models to capture variance is
explored in a detector for artefacts from decompression of corrupted MP3
compressed audio. For both tasks we describe the synthetic generation of
artefacts for controlled detector training and evaluation. We evaluate our
detectors on the large open-source Free Music Archive (FMA) and genre-specific
datasets.

much more non-operational ones -- derelict satellites or rocket bodies,
collision debris, or spacecraft payloads, significant part of them being
uncatalogued. They all impact observations of the sky by ground-based
telescopes by producing a large number of streaks polluting the images, as well
as generating false alerts hindering the search for new astrophysical
transients. While the former threat for astronomy is widely discussed nowadays
in regard of rapidly growing satellite mega-constellations, the latter one --
false transients -- still lacks attention on the similar level.
  In this work we assess the impact of satellite glints -- rapid flashes
produced by reflections of a sunlight from flat surfaces of rotating satellites
-- on current and future deep sky surveys such as the ones conducted by the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST). For that, we propose a simple routine that detects, in a
single exposure, a series of repeated flashes along the trajectories of
otherwise invisible satellites, and describe its implementation in FINK alert
broker. Application of the routine to ZTF alert stream revealed about 73,000
individual events polluting 3.6\% of all ZTF science images between November
2019 and December 2021 and linked to more than 300 different glinting
satellites on all kinds of orbits, from low-Earth up to geostationary ones. The
timescales of individual flashes are as short as $0.1$--$10^{-3}$ seconds, with
instant brightness of 4--14 magnitudes, peak amplitudes of at least 2--4
magnitudes, and generally complex temporal patterns of flashing activity. We
expect LSST to see much more such satellite glints of even larger amplitudes
due to its better sensitivity.

our framework for solving SBs requires significantly more involved tools such

solutions of SBs between Gaussian measures are themselves Gaussian processes
with explicit mean and covariance kernels, and thus are readily amenable for
many downstream applications such as generative modeling or interpolation. To
demonstrate the utility, we devise a new method for modeling the evolution of

a result, deep networks are often seen as black boxes with unclear

principles and techniques from information theory to deep learning models to
increase our theoretical understanding and design better algorithms. We first
describe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose
using the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to explain deep learning systems.
The novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered
structure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss
one of the most challenging problems of applying the IB to deep neural networks
- estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, are used to investigate generalization
signals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many
information-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of
infinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how
compression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how
they are related. At the end, we present the dual Information Bottleneck
(dualIB). This new information-theoretic framework resolves some of the IB's
shortcomings by merely switching terms in the distortion function. The dualIB
can account for known data features and use them to make better predictions
over unseen examples. An analytical framework reveals the underlying structure
and optimal representations, and a variational framework using deep neural
network optimization validates the results.

encourages scholars in adopting the quaternions and octonions to study the
physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the
field strength, field source, linear momentum, and angular momentum and so
forth. In the paper, the field strength and angular momentum in the vacuum can
be combined together to become one new physical quantity, that is, the
composite field strength within the material media. Substituting the latter for
the field strength in the vacuum will deduce the field equations within
material media, including the electromagnetic and gravitational equations in
the presence of some material media. In terms of the electromagnetic fields,
the electromagnetic equations in the presence of some electromagnetic media are
able to explore a few new physical properties of electromagnetic media.
Especially, in case the magnetic flux density and magnetization intensity both
fluctuate at a single-frequency, their frequencies must be identical to each
other within electromagnetic media. In some extreme cases, the electromagnetic
equations within electromagnetic media will be degenerated into the Maxwell's
equations in the vacuum. The above reveals that the electromagnetic equations
within electromagnetic media are capable of extending the scope of application
of electromagnetic theory. For the gravitational fields, there are some similar

demanding matrix computation. In a graphic processing unit (GPU), Tensor Core
is a specialized matrix processing hardware equipped with reduced-precision
matrix-multiply-accumulate (MMA) instructions to increase throughput. However,
it is challenging to achieve optimal performance since the best scheduling of
MMA instructions varies for different convolution sizes. In particular,
reduced-precision MMA requires many elements grouped as a matrix operand,
seriously limiting data reuse and imposing packing and layout overhead on the
schedule. This work proposes an automatic scheduling method of
reduced-precision MMA for convolution operation. In this method, we devise a
search space that explores the thread tile and warp sizes to increase the data
reuse despite a large matrix operand of reduced-precision MMA. The search space
also includes options of register-level packing and layout optimization to
lesson overhead of handling reduced-precision data. Finally, we propose a
search algorithm to find the best schedule by learning from the distinctive
candidates. This reduced-precision MMA optimization method is evaluated on
convolution operations of popular neural networks to demonstrate substantial
speedup on Tensor Core compared to the state of the arts with shortened search
time.

  Tree Search","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2007.00391",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a class of methods for solving complex
decision-making problems through the synergy of Monte-Carlo planning and
Reinforcement Learning (RL). The highly combinatorial nature of the problems
commonly addressed by MCTS requires the use of efficient exploration strategies
for navigating the planning tree and quickly convergent value backup methods.
These crucial problems are particularly evident in recent advances that combine
MCTS with deep neural networks for function approximation. In this work, we
propose two methods for improving the convergence rate and exploration based on
a newly introduced backup operator and entropy regularization. We provide
strong theoretical guarantees to bound convergence rate, approximation error,
and regret of our methods. Moreover, we introduce a mathematical framework
based on the use of the $\alpha$-divergence for backup and exploration in MCTS.
We show that this theoretical formulation unifies different approaches,
including our newly introduced ones, under the same mathematical framework,
allowing to obtain different methods by simply changing the value of $\alpha$.
In practice, our unified perspective offers a flexible way to balance between
exploration and exploitation by tuning the single $\alpha$ parameter according
to the problem at hand. We validate our methods through a rigorous empirical
study from basic toy problems to the complex Atari games, and including both
MDP and POMDP problems.

the following baseline scenario: a State, with a set of hospitals, each with
all types of wards at a basic level. The evolution of this baseline scenario
consists in the evolution of hospitals, that is, in the possibility of
hospitals to make some of their wards excel. The State has a budget, for the
evolution of this baseline scenario, which can be used by two financing
systems: either by a ""local financing"", i.e., by splitting the budget among the
hospitals so that each hospital is managing its own portion of the budget by
pursuing the individual benefit, or by a ""central financing"", i.e., by not
splitting the budget among the hospitals so that the State is the sole manager
of the budget, by pursuing the benefit of the whole community. The conclusions
seem to be that: in the local financing system hospitals tend to diversify

create poles of excellence.

their technological advancement and high mobility. The UAVs are equipped with
increasingly advanced capabilities to run computationally intensive

energy and computation constraints, the UAVs face issues hovering in the sky
while performing computation due to weather uncertainty. To overcome the
computation constraints, the UAVs can partially or fully offload their
computation tasks to the edge servers. In ordinary computation offloading
operations, the UAVs can retrieve the result from the returned output.
Nevertheless, if the UAVs are unable to retrieve the entire result from the
edge servers, i.e., straggling edge servers, this operation will fail. In this
paper, we propose a coded distributed computing approach for computation
offloading to mitigate straggling edge servers. The UAVs can retrieve the
returned result when the number of returned copies is greater than or equal to
the recovery threshold. There is a shortfall if the returned copies are less
than the recovery threshold. To minimize the cost of the network, energy
consumption by the UAVs, and prevent over and under subscription of the

the first phase, the appropriate UAVs are allocated to the charging stations

offloaded and computed locally, while taking into account the computation
shortfall and demand uncertainty. By using a real dataset, the simulation
results show that our proposed scheme is fully dynamic, and minimizes the cost
