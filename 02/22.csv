  dynamical evolution of the reactive state","Sumbitted to Nature Communications (under review)",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The photochemically induced ring-opening isomerization reaction of
1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) to 1,3,5-hexatriene (HT) is a textbook example of a
pericyclic reaction, and has been amply investigated with advanced
spectroscopic techniques. The generally accepted description of the
isomerization pathway starts with a valence excitation to the lowest-lying
bright state, followed by a passage through a conical intersection to a dark
doubly excited state, and finally a branching between either the return to the
ground state of the cyclic molecule or the actual ring-opening reaction leading
to the open-chain isomer. It was traditionally assumed that the dark reactive
state corresponds to the second excited state of CHD at the Franck-Condon
geometry. Here in a joint experimental and computational effort we demonstrate
that the evolution of the excitation-deexcitation process is much more complex
than usually described. In particular, we show that an initially high-lying
electronic state smoothly decreasing in energy along the reaction path plays a
key role in the ring-opening reaction. The conceptual basis of our work is that
the dynamics to consider here is determined by diabatic states, whose
populations are the ones closely related to the observed photoelectron signal.

that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or

context, including the expected counterfactual atmospheric evolution for
lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding of planetary context
for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We review
the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen
scenarios may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how
planetary context controls non-biological methane (CH$_4$) production is
limited, even though CH$_4$ biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres may be readily
detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental context
for CH$_4$ biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH$_4$
coexisting with CO$_2$, and CO:CH$_4$ << 1 is suggestive of biological
production, although precise thresholds are dependent on stellar context and
sparsely characterized abiotic CH$_4$ scenarios. A planetary context framework
is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the

when and how to implement various explainability techniques as well as how to
interpret the results. We discuss a system of teaching explainability in
machine learning, by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of various

specific explainability techniques and the various frameworks used to structure

  Cabinets","Submitted to ""Journal of Process Control""",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many applications, e.g. fault diagnostics and optimized control of
supermarket refrigeration systems, it is important to determine the heat demand
of the cabinets. This can easily be achieved by measuring the mass flow through
each cabinet, however, that is expensive and not feasible in large-scale
deployments. Therefore it is important to be able to estimate the valve sizes
from the monitoring data, which is typically measured. The valve size is
measured by an area, which can be used to calculate mass flow through the valve
-- this estimated value is referred to as the valve constant. A novel method
for estimating the cabinet evaporator valve constants is proposed in the
present paper. It is demonstrated using monitoring data from a refrigeration
system in a supermarket consisting of data sampled at a one-minute sampling
rate, however it is shown that a sampling time of around 10-20 minutes is
adequate for the method. Through thermodynamic analysis of a two-stage CO2
refrigeration system, a linear regression model for estimating valve constants
was developed using time series data. The linear regression requires that
transient dynamics are not present in the data, which depends on multiple
factors e.g. the sampling time. If dynamics are not modeled it can be detected
by a significant auto-correlation of the residuals. In order to include the
dynamics in the model, an Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous
variables (ARMAX) was applied, and it is shown how it effectively eliminates
the auto-correlation and provides more unbiased estimates, as well as improved
the accuracy estimates. Furthermore, it is shown that the sample time has a
huge impact on the valve estimates. Thus, a method for selecting the optimal
sampling time is introduced. It works individually for each of the evaporators,
by exploring their respective frequency spectrum.

AQM policies relied on heuristics to approximately provide Quality of Service

threat motivated the creation of new disciplines to handle the issue, such as
post-quantum cryptography, other fields have overlooked the existence of
quantum-enabled adversaries. This is the case of cyber-physical defense
research, a distinct but complementary discipline to cyber-physical protection.
Cyber-physical defense refers to the capability to detect and react in response
to cyber-physical attacks. Concretely, it involves the integration of
mechanisms to identify adverse events and prepare response plans, during and
after incidents occur. In this paper, we make the assumption that the
eventually available quantum computer will provide an advantage to adversaries
against defenders, unless they also adopt this technology. We envision the
necessity for a paradigm shift, where an increase of adversarial resources
because of quantum supremacy does not translate into higher likelihood of
disruptions. Consistently with current system design practices in other areas,
such as the use of artificial intelligence for the reinforcement of attack
detection tools, we outline a vision for next generation cyber-physical defense
layers leveraging ideas from quantum computing and machine learning. Through an
example, we show that defenders of NCSs can learn and improve their strategies

modality in many bioengineering tasks. The image quality of OCTA, however, is
often degraded by Bulk Motion Artifacts (BMA), which are due to micromotion of
subjects and typically appear as bright stripes surrounded by blurred areas.
State-of-the-art methods usually treat BMA removal as a learning-based image
inpainting problem, but require numerous training samples with nontrivial
annotation. In addition, these methods discard the rich structural and
appearance information carried in the BMA stripe region. To address these
issues, in this paper we propose a self-supervised content-aware BMA removal
model. First, the gradient-based structural information and appearance feature
are extracted from the BMA area and injected into the model to capture more
connectivity. Second, with easily collected defective masks, the model is
trained in a self-supervised manner, in which only the clear areas are used for
training while the BMA areas for inference. With the structural information and
appearance feature from noisy image as references, our model can remove larger
BMA and produce better visualizing result. In addition, only 2D images with
defective masks are involved, hence improving the efficiency of our method.
Experiments on OCTA of mouse cortex demonstrate that our model can remove most
BMA with extremely large sizes and inconsistent intensities while previous
methods fail.

data due to their ability to flexibly model the distribution of survival times.
These methods typically employ a nonparametric prior on the survival function

particularly in the presence of covariates, can be challenging and inference
typically relies on computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes.
In this paper, we build on recent work that recasts Bayesian inference as
assigning a predictive distribution on the unseen values of a population
conditional on the observed samples, thus avoiding the need to specify a
complex prior. We describe a copula-based predictive update which admits a
scalable sequential importance sampling algorithm to perform inference that
properly accounts for right-censoring. We provide theoretical justification
through an extension of Doob's consistency theorem and illustrate the method on
a number of simulated and real data sets, including an example with covariates.
Our approach enables analysts to perform Bayesian nonparametric inference

correlations, restricted only by unitarity and translational invariance. From
the induced scattering rates, we obtain the consequences on the thermal
conductivity tensor of the phonons. We find that the lowest-order diagonal
scattering rate, which determines the longitudinal conductivity, is controlled
by two-point correlation functions of the $Q$ field, while the off-diagonal
scattering rates involve a minimum of three to four point correlation
functions. We obtain general and explicit forms for these correlations which
isolate the contributions to the Hall conductivity, and provide a general
discussion of the implications of symmetry and equilibrium. We evaluate these
two- and four-point correlation functions and hence the thermal transport for
the illustrative example of an ordered two dimensional antiferromagnet. In this
case the $Q$ field is a composite of magnon operators arising from spin-lattice
coupling. A numerical evaluation of the required integrals demonstrates that
the results satisfy all the necessary symmetry restrictions but otherwise lead
to non-vanishing scattering and Hall effects, and in particular that this
mechanism leads to comparable thermal Hall conductivity for thermal currents
within and normal to the plane of the antiferromagnetism.

when modelling probabilistic dependencies on relational data. For instance, the
likelihood of a school closure during an epidemic might depend on the
proportion of infected pupils exceeding a threshold. Often, rather than
depending on discrete thresholds, dependencies are continuous: for instance,
the likelihood of any one mosquito bite transmitting an illness depends on the
proportion of carrier mosquitoes. Current approaches usually only consider
probabilities over possible worlds rather than over domain elements themselves.
We introduce two formalisms that explicitly incorporate relative frequencies
into statistical relational artificial intelligence. The first formalism,
Lifted Bayesian Networks for Conditional Probability Logic, expresses discrete
dependencies on probabilistic data. The second formalism, Functional Lifted
Bayesian Networks, expresses continuous dependencies. Incorporating relative
frequencies is not only beneficial to modelling; it also provides a more
rigorous approach to learning problems where training and test or application
domains have different sizes. To this end, we provide a representation of the
asymptotic probability distributions induced by the two formalisms on domains
of increasing sizes. Since that representation has well-understood scaling
behaviour across domain sizes, it can be used to estimate parameters for a
large domain consistently from randomly sampled subpopulations.

bounded short interval sums if and only if $f$ coincides with a ""modified""
Dirichlet character to a prime power modulus. This confirms the function field

GCN-WMMSE applies ideas from graph signal processing and is agnostic to
different wireless network topologies, while exhibiting a low number of

experimental stimuli while recording participant brain activity. They can then
use encoding models to find out which brain ""zone"" (e.g. which region of
interest, volume pixel or electrophysiology sensor) is predicted from the
stimulus properties. Given the assumptions underlying this setup, when stimulus
properties are predictive of the activity in a zone, these properties are
understood to cause activity in that zone.
  In recent years, researchers have used neural networks to construct
representations that capture the diverse properties of complex stimuli, such as
natural language or natural images. Encoding models built using these
high-dimensional representations are often able to significantly predict the
activity in large swathes of cortex, suggesting that the activity in all these
brain zones is caused by stimulus properties captured in the representation. It
is then natural to ask: ""Is the activity in these different brain zones caused
by the stimulus properties in the same way?"" In neuroscientific terms, this
corresponds to asking if these different zones process the stimulus properties
in the same way.
  Here, we propose a new framework that enables researchers to ask if the
properties of a stimulus affect two brain zones in the same way. We use
simulated data and two real fMRI datasets with complex naturalistic stimuli to
show that our framework enables us to make such inferences. Our inferences are
strikingly consistent between the two datasets, indicating that the proposed
framework is a promising new tool for neuroscientists to understand how
information is processed in the brain.

establish that the structure of solutions to the assortative partition problems

asymptotic equivalence between the assortative partition problem and the

single-spin-flip-stable states in spin glasses. In the context of spin glasses,
our results on algorithmic hardness imply a conjecture that gapped single spin

complete a particular task, so they delegate the task to an untrusted agent
whose interests may differ from their own. Given any family of such problems
and space of mechanisms for the principal to choose from, the delegation gap is
the worst-case ratio of the principal's optimal utility when they delegate
versus their optimal utility when solving the problem on their own. In this
work, we consider the delegation gap of the generalized Pandora's box problem,
a search problem in which searching for solutions incurs known costs and
solutions are restricted by some downward-closed constraint. First, we show
that there is a special case when all random variables have binary support for
which there exist constant-factor delegation gaps for matroid constraints.
However, there is no constant-factor delegation gap for even simple non-binary
instances of the problem. Getting around this impossibility, we consider two
variants: the free-agent model, in which the agent doesn't pay the cost of
probing elements, and discounted-cost approximations, in which we discount all
costs and aim for a bicriteria approximation of the discount factor and
delegation gap. We show that there are constant-factor delegation gaps in the
free-agent model with discounted-cost approximations for certain downward
closed constraints and constant discount factors. However, constant delegation
gaps can not be achieved under either variant alone. Finally, we consider
another variant called the shared-cost model, in which the principal can choose
how costs will be shared between them and the agent before delegating the
search problem. We show that the shared-cost model exhibits a constant-factor
delegation gap for certain downward closed constraints.

applications is the detection of unsafe conditions (e.g., release of poisonous

in these applications are often costly, slow to use, and can be inaccurate in
complex, changing, or new environments. In this paper, we explore how machine
learning methods used successfully in cyber domains, such as malware detection,
can be leveraged to substantially enhance physical space detection. We focus on
one important exemplar application--the detection and localization of
radioactive materials. We show that the ML-based approaches can significantly
exceed traditional table-based approaches in predicting angular direction.
Moreover, the developed models can be expanded to include approximations of the
distance to radioactive material (a critical dimension that reference tables
used in practice do not capture). With four and eight detector arrays, we
collect counts of gamma-rays as features for a suite of machine learning models
to localize radioactive material. We explore seven unique scenarios via
simulation frameworks frequently used for radiation detection and with physical
experiments using radioactive material in laboratory environments. We observe
that our approach can outperform the standard table-based method, reducing the
angular error by 37% and reliably predicting distance within 2.4%. In this way,
we show that advances in cyber-detection provide substantial opportunities for
enhancing detection in public safety applications and beyond.

in graphene [Kumar et al., Nat. Comm. 9, 2776 (2018)]. We propose a partonic
wave function at $4/13$ and show it to be a viable candidate to describe the
Coulomb ground state. Using the effective edge theory, we make predictions for
experimentally measurable properties of the state.

open when an unlimited number of delays and general distributed delays (DDs)
are considered. Existing results suffer from theoretical constraints or
numerical barriers, or are unable to cope with the complexity of DD kernels. We
propose an effective method as a first step to solve this open problem for the
case of dissipative full-state feedback using the Krasovski\u{\i} functional
(KF) approach, where all DDs can contain any number of square-integrable
functions. To circumvent the difficulties posed by the infinite dimensionality
of DDs, we introduce an equivalent decomposition-approximation approach that
allows for the factorization or approximation of any DD kernel without
introducing conservatism. The method can be effectively applied to construct a
complete-type KF whose integral kernels can include any number of
differentiable and linearly independent functions, supported by novel integral
inequalities derived from the least-squares principle. The proposed
optimization-based solution is presented in several theorems, along with an
iterative algorithm that can be used together to compute controller gains
without requiring nonlinear solvers. A challenging numerical example, which
cannot be addressed by existing methods, show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

  Completely by Their Periods","45 pages, 8 figures",,,,"nlin.CD math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rational billiards (RB) are classically pseudointegrable, i.e. their
trajectories in the phase space lie on multi-tori. Each such a multi-torus can
be unfolded into elementary polygon pattern (EPP). A rational billiards Riemann
surface (RBRS) corresponding to each RB is then an infinite mosaic made by a
periodic distribution of EPP. Periods of RBRS are directly related to periodic
orbits of RB. It is shown that any stationary solutions (SS) to the
Schr\""odinger equation (SE) in RB can be extended on the whole RBRS. The
extended stationary wave functions (ESS) are then periodic on RBRS with its
periods. Conversely, for each system of boundary conditions (i.e. the Dirichlet
or the the Neumann ones or their mixture) consistent with EPP one can find so
called stationary pre-solutions (SPS) of the Schr\""odinger equation defined on
RBRS and respecting its periodic structure together with their energy spectra.
Using SPS one can easily construct SS of RB for most boundary conditions on it
by a trivial algebra over SPS. It proves therefore that the energy spectra
defined by the boundary conditions for SS corresponding to each RB are totally
determined by $2g$ independent periods of RBRS being homogeneous functions of
these periods. RBRS can be constructed exclusively due to the rationality of
the polygon billiards considered. Therefore the approach developed in the
present paper can be seen as a new way in obtaining SS to SE in RB. SPS can be
constructed explicitly for a class of RB which EPP can be decomposed into a set
of periodic orbit channel (POC) parallel to each other (POCDRB). For such a
class of RB the respective RBRS can be built as a standard multi-sheeted
Riemann surface with a periodic structure. For POCDRB a discussion of the
existence of the superscar states (SSS) can be done thoroughly.

  System for Genome Sequence Analysis","Published at ASPLOS 2022",,,,"cs.AR cs.DC cs.OS q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Read mapping is a fundamental, yet computationally-expensive step in many
genomics applications. It is used to identify potential matches and differences
between fragments (called reads) of a sequenced genome and an already known
genome (called a reference genome). To address the computational challenges in
genome analysis, many prior works propose various approaches such as filters
that select the reads that must undergo expensive computation, efficient
heuristics, and hardware acceleration. While effective at reducing the
computation overhead, all such approaches still require the costly movement of
a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can
significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional
and emerging genomics systems.
  We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for
genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and
computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and
accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to
address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1)
different read lengths and error rates, and 2) different degrees of genetic
variation. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes, we meticulously
design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND
flash-based SSD. Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets
shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern SSDs, significantly
improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware)
baselines by 2.07-6.05$\times$ (1.52-3.32$\times$) for read sets with high

alignment through contrastive losses (e.g., InfoNCE loss). The success of this
alignment strategy is attributed to its capability in maximizing the mutual
information (MI) between an image and its matched text. However, simply
performing cross-modal alignment (CMA) ignores data potential within each
modality, which may result in degraded representations. For instance, although
CMA-based models are able to map image-text pairs close together in the
embedding space, they fail to ensure that similar inputs from the same modality
stay close by. This problem can get even worse when the pre-training data is
noisy. In this paper, we propose triple contrastive learning (TCL) for
vision-language pre-training by leveraging both cross-modal and intra-modal
self-supervision. Besides CMA, TCL introduces an intra-modal contrastive
objective to provide complementary benefits in representation learning. To take
advantage of localized and structural information from image and text input,
TCL further maximizes the average MI between local regions of image/text and
their global summary. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that
takes into account local structure information for multi-modality
representation learning. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is
competitive and achieves the new state of the art on various common down-stream
vision-language tasks such as image-text retrieval and visual question
answering.

the first time to predict exclusive final states of neutrino interactions. This

novelties, including the production of nuclear clusters (e.g., deuterons,
$\alpha$ particles) in the final state. The paper includes a complete
characterization of the final state after FSI, comparisons to available
measurements of single transverse variables, and an assessment of the

by testing how well the pre-trained models perform on the \alpha{}nli task when
just comparing sentence embeddings with cosine similarity to what the
performance that is achieved when training a classifier on top of these

correlates strongly with the accuracy of the classification approach with a
Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.65. Since the similarity computation is
orders of magnitude faster to compute on a given dataset (less than a minute

Galactic latitudes using a preliminary version of the C-BASS intensity map. We
jointly fit for synchrotron, dust, and free-free components between $20$ and
$1000$GHz and look for differences in the Galactic synchrotron spectrum, and
the emissivity of anomalous microwave emission (AME) when using either the
C-BASS map or the 408MHz all-sky map to trace synchrotron emission. We find
marginal evidence for a steepening ($\left<\Delta\beta\right> = -0.06\pm0.02$)
of the Galactic synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies resulting in a mean
spectral index of $\left<\beta\right> = -3.10\pm0.02$ over $4.76-22.8$GHz.
Further, we find that the synchrotron emission can be well modelled by a single
power-law up to a few tens of GHz. Due to this, we find that the AME emissivity
is not sensitive to changing the synchrotron tracer from the 408MHz map to the
4.76GHz map. We interpret this as strong evidence for the origin of AME being
spinning dust emission.

remarkable candidates for the realization of efficient sources of coherent

orientation as a means to further enhance their performance remains largely
unexplored. Here, we first report a two-fold reduction in the threshold of a
polariton laser based on a high-Q microcavity filled with an active layer of

homogeneous nematic alignment of the polymer chains. The resulting transition
dipole moment orientation increases the Rabi energy, bringing the system into
the ultra-strong coupling regime where we observe anisotropic polariton lasing
with an eight-fold reduction in absorbed threshold, down to 1.14 pJ / 0.36

task that has been studied in multiple research areas, with diverse
applications spanning from spectrum access to cyber-security. Anomalous events
are characterized by deviations in data distributions, and thus can be inferred
from noisy observations based on statistical methods. In some scenarios, one
can often obtain noisy observations aggregated from a chosen subset of
processes. Such hierarchical search can further minimize the sample complexity
while retaining accuracy. An anomaly search strategy should thus be designed
based on multiple requirements, such as maximizing the detection accuracy;
efficiency, be efficient in terms of sample complexity; and be able to cope
with statistical models that are known only up to some missing parameters
(i.e., composite hypotheses). In this paper, we consider anomaly detection with
observations taken from a chosen subset of processes that conforms to a
predetermined tree structure with partially known statistical model. We propose
Hierarchical Dynamic Search (HDS), a sequential search strategy that uses two
variations of the Generalized Log Likelihood Ratio (GLLR) statistic, and can be
used for detection of multiple anomalies. HDS is shown to be order-optimal in
terms of the size of the search space, and asymptotically optimal in terms of
detection accuracy. An explicit upper bound on the error probability is
established for the finite sample regime. In addition to extensive experiments
on synthetic datasets, experiments have been conducted on the DARPA intrusion

on tasks such as text classification, where the output space is relatively

explaining language models contrastively: we look for salient input tokens that
explain why the model predicted one token instead of another. We demonstrate
that contrastive explanations are quantifiably better than non-contrastive
explanations in verifying major grammatical phenomena, and that they
significantly improve contrastive model simulatability for human observers. We

interactions and possible self organization. Here, we treat cells as noisy
motile particles that exert contractile dipolar stresses on elastic substrates

cells with a linear elastic model that accounts for substrate mediated cell
cell interactions, we examine emergent collective states that result from the
interplay of cell motility and long range elastic dipolar interactions. In
particular, we show that particles self assemble into flexible, motile chains
which can cluster to form diverse larger scale compact structures with polar
order. By computing key structural and dynamical metrics, we distinguish
between the collective states at weak and strong elastic interactions, as well
as at low and high motility. We also show how these states are affected by
confinement, an important characteristic of the complex mechanical
microenvironment inhabited by cells. Our model predictions are generally

from random data is a fundamental quantity in transport based data analysis. In
this work, we derive novel guarantees for its convergence rate when the
involved measures are different, possibly supported on different spaces. Our
central observation is that the statistical performance of the empirical OT
cost is determined by the less complex measure, a phenomenon we refer to as
lower complexity adaptation of empirical OT. For instance, under Lipschitz
ground costs, we find that the empirical OT cost based on $n$ observations
converges at least with rate $n^{-1/d}$ to the population quantity if one of
the two measures is concentrated on a $d$-dimensional manifold, while the other
can be arbitrary. For semi-concave ground costs, we show that the upper bound
for the rate improves to $n^{-2/d}$. Similarly, our theory establishes the
general convergence rate $n^{-1/2}$ for semi-discrete OT. All of these results
are valid in the two-sample case as well, meaning that the convergence rate is
still governed by the simpler of the two measures. On a conceptual level, our
findings therefore suggest that the curse of dimensionality only affects the
estimation of the OT cost when both measures exhibit a high intrinsic
dimension. Our proofs are based on the dual formulation of OT as a maximization
over a suitable function class $\mathcal{F}_c$ and the observation that the
$c$-transform of $\mathcal{F}_c$ under bounded costs has the same uniform
metric entropy as $\mathcal{F}_c$ itself.

a function of the Riemann tensor and the inverse metric. The results centrally
exploit the benefits of maximally symmetric spaces for the evaluation of
operator traces. The framework is highly versatile and offers a wide range of
new applications to study quantum gravitational effects in extensions of
Einstein gravity, many of which have hitherto been out of reach. The phase
diagram and sample flows for Einstein-Hilbert gravity, Gauss-Bonnet, and
selected higher-order theories of gravity are given. We also provide an
algorithm to find the flow for general polynomial Riemann curvature
interactions. The setup vastly enhances the reach of fixed point searches,
enabling novel types of search strategies including across the operator space
spanned by polynomial curvature invariants, and in extensions of general
relativity relevant for cosmology. Further implications, and links with
unimodular versions of gravity are indicated.

contains a massive corpus of rich and diverse human hand videos. We leverage
this data to train a system that understands human hands and retargets a human

L1-norm minimization have recently been proposed as a powerful technique for
noise removal in gravitational-wave data. In particular, the regularized
Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (rROF) model has proven effective to denoise signals
embedded in either simulated Gaussian noise or actual detector noise. Importing
the rROF model to existing search pipelines seems therefore worth considering.
In this paper, we discuss the implementation of two variants of the rROF
algorithm as two separate plug-ins of the coherent Wave Burst (cWB) pipeline
designed to conduct searches of unmodelled gravitational-wave burst sources.
The first approach is based on a single-step rROF method and the second one
employs an iterative rROF procedure. Both approaches are calibrated using
actual gravitational-wave events from the first three observing runs of the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, namely GW1501914, GW151226, GW170817, and
GW190521, encompassing different types of compact binary coalescences. Our
analysis shows that the iterative version of the rROF denoising algorithm
implemented in the cWB pipeline effectively eliminates noise while preserving
the waveform signals intact. Therefore, the combined approach yields higher
signal-to-noise values than those computed by the cWB pipeline without the rROF
denoising step. The incorporation of the iterative rROF algorithm in the cWB
pipeline might hence impact the detectability capabilities of the pipeline
along with the inference of source properties.

and an additional $b$-jet ($pp \to b+\tau_h + \nu$). Requiring the additional
$b$-tagged jet in the $\tau\nu$ resonance search profits from the suppression
of the Standard Model background, and therefore it allows us to judge the
low-mass $H^-$ interpretation of the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly. To demonstrate
this, we perform a fast collider simulation for the $\tau \nu$ resonance search
with an additional $b$-tagged jet, and find that most of the interesting
parameter region of the whole mass range can already be probed with the current
integrated luminosity of $139\,$fb$^{-1}$.

masses $\log\,(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.5$ from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. For
star-forming galaxies, $\sigma_*$ tends to be larger than $\sigma_{\rm gas}$,
suggesting that stars are in general dynamically hotter than the ionised gas
(asymmetric drift). The difference between $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and $\sigma_*$
($\Delta\sigma$) correlates with various galaxy properties. We establish that
the strongest correlation of $\Delta\sigma$ is with beam smearing, which
inflates $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ more than $\sigma_*$, introducing a dependence of
$\Delta\sigma$ on both the effective radius relative to the point spread
function and velocity gradients. The second-strongest correlation is with the
contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) (or evolved stars) to the ionised
gas emission, implying the gas velocity dispersion is strongly affected by the
power source. In contrast, using the velocity dispersion measured from
integrated spectra ($\sigma_{\rm aper}$) results in less correlation between
the aperture-based $\Delta\sigma$ ($\Delta\sigma_{\rm aper}$) and the power
source. This suggests that the AGN (or old stars) dynamically heat the gas
without causing significant deviations from dynamical equilibrium. Although the
variation of $\Delta\sigma_{\rm aper}$ is much smaller than that of
$\Delta\sigma$, a correlation between $\Delta\sigma_{\rm aper}$ and gas
velocity gradient is still detected, implying there is a small bias in
dynamical masses derived from stellar and ionised gas velocity dispersions.

telescopes is intrinsically limited by speckles induced by uncorrected
aberrations. These aberrations originate from the imperfect correction of the
atmosphere by an extreme adaptive optics system; from static optical defects;
or from small opto-mechanical variations due to changes in temperature,
pressure, or gravity vector. More than the speckles themselves, the performance
of high-contrast imagers is ultimately limited by their temporal stability,
since most post-processing techniques rely on difference of images acquired at
different points in time. Identifying the origin of the aberrations and the
timescales involved is therefore crucial to understanding the fundamental
limits of dedicated high-contrast instruments. We previously demonstrated the
use of a Zernike wavefront sensor called ZELDA for sensing non-common path
aberrations (NCPA) in VLT/SPHERE. We now use ZELDA to investigate the stability
of the instrumental aberrations using 5 long sequences of measurements obtained
at high cadence on the internal source. Our study reveals two regimes of
decorrelation of the NCPA. The first, with a characteristic timescale of a few
seconds and an amplitude of a few nanometers, is induced by a fast internal
turbulence within the enclosure. The second is a slow quasi-linear
decorrelation on the order of a few $10^{-3}$ nm rms/s that acts on timescales
from minutes to hours. We use coronagraphic image reconstruction to demonstrate
that these two NCPA contributions have a measurable impact on differences of
images, and that the fast internal turbulence is a dominating term over to the
slow linear decorrelation. We also use dedicated sequences where the derotator
and atmospheric dispersion compensators emulate a real observation to
demonstrate the importance of performing observations symmetric around the
meridian.

experimental work [G\""{u}l et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021057 (2022)] provided
evidence for such coupling, in the form of a crossed Andreev reflection signal,
in which electrons enter a superconductor from one chiral mode and are
reflected as holes to another, counter-propagating chiral mode. Remarkably,
while the probability for crossed Andreev reflection was small, it was stronger
for $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hall edges than for integer ones. We
theoretically explain these findings, including the relative strengths of the
signals in the two cases and their qualitatively different temperature
dependencies. An essential part of our model is the coupling of the edge modes
to normal states in the cores of Abrikosov vortices induced by the magnetic
field, which provide a fermionic bath. We find that the stronger crossed
Andreev reflection in the fractional case originates from the suppression of
electronic tunneling between the fermionic bath and the fractional quantum Hall
edges. Our theory shows that the mere observation of crossed Andreev reflection
signal does not necessarily imply the presence of localized parafermion
zero-modes, and suggests ways to identify their presence from the behavior of
this signal in the low temperature regime.

enrichment in galaxies. Recent transient surveys like the All-Sky Automated
Survey for Supernova (ASAS-SN) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) find that the
specific Ia rate at z ~ 0 may be ~ 15-50 times higher in lower-mass galaxies
than at Milky Way-mass. Independently, Milky Way observations show that the
close-binary fraction of solar-type stars is higher at lower metallicity.
Motivated by these observations, we use the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in
simulations to explore the impact of varying Ia rate models, including
metallicity dependence, on galaxies across a range of stellar masses: 10^7 Msun
- 10^{11} Msun. First, we benchmark our simulated star-formation histories
(SFHs) against observations. We show that assumed SFHs and stellar mass
functions play a major role in determining the degree of tension between
observations and metallicity-independent Ia rate models, and potentially cause
ASAS-SN and DES observations to be much more consistent with each other than
might naively appear. Models in which the Ia rate increases with decreasing
metallicity (as ~ Z^{-0.5} to Z^{-1}) provide significantly better agreement
with observations. Encouragingly, these increases in Ia rate (> 10 times in
low-mass galaxies) do not significantly impact galaxy stellar masses and
morphologies: effective radii, axis ratios, and v/sigma remain largely
unaffected except for our most extreme rate models. We explore implications for
both [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] enrichment: metallicity-dependent Ia rate models can
improve agreement with observed stellar mass-metallicity relations in low-mass
galaxies. Our results demonstrate that a wide range of metallicity-dependent Ia
models are viable for galaxy formation and motivate future work in this area.

the class of optical transients believed to accompany such merger/common
envelope events. Past works typically model LRNe using analytic formulae for
supernova light curves which make assumptions (e.g., radiation dominated
ejecta, neglect of hydrogen recombination energy) not justified in stellar
mergers due to the lower velocities and specific thermal energy of the ejecta.
We present a one-dimensional model of LRN light curves, which accounts for
these effects. Consistent with observations, we find that LRNe typically
possess two light curve peaks, an early phase powered by initial thermal energy
of the hot, fastest ejecta layers and a later peak powered by hydrogen
recombination from the bulk of the ejecta. We apply our model to a sample of
LRNe to infer their ejecta properties (mass, velocity, and launching radius)
and compare them to the progenitor donor star properties from pre-transient
imaging. We define a maximum luminosity achievable for a given donor star in
the limit that the entire envelope is ejected, finding that several LRNe
violate this limit. Shock interaction between the ejecta and pre-dynamical
mass-loss, may provide an additional luminosity source to alleviate this
tension. Our model can also be applied to the merger of planets with stars or

face three critical challenges: i) measuring redshifts from the supernova or

present here a novel approach that addresses each challenge. In the context of
the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we analyze a SNIa sample with host galaxies in
the redMaGiC galaxy catalog, a selection of Luminous Red Galaxies. Photo-$z$
estimates for these galaxies are expected to be accurate to $\sigma_{\Delta
z/(1+z)}\sim0.02$. The DES-5YR photometrically classified SNIa sample contains
approximately 1600 SNe and 125 of these SNe are in redMaGiC galaxies. We
demonstrate that redMaGiC galaxies almost exclusively host SNe Ia, reducing
concerns with classification uncertainties. With this subsample, we find
similar Hubble scatter (to within $\sim0.01$ mag) using photometric redshifts
in place of spectroscopic redshifts. With detailed simulations, we show the
bias due to using photo-$z$s from redMaGiC host galaxies on the measurement of
the dark energy equation-of-state $w$ is up to $\Delta w \sim 0.01-0.02$. With
real data, we measure a difference in $w$ when using redMaGiC photometric
redshifts versus spectroscopic redshifts of $\Delta w = 0.005$. Finally, we
discuss how SNe in redMaGiC galaxies appear to be a more standardizable
population due to a weaker relation between color and luminosity ($\beta$)
compared to the DES-3YR population by $\sim5\sigma$; this finding is consistent
with predictions that redMaGiC galaxies exhibit lower reddening ratios
($\textrm{R}_\textrm{V}$) than the general population of SN host galaxies.
These results establish the feasibility of performing redMaGiC SN cosmology
with photometric survey data in the absence of spectroscopic data.

the direction opposite to conventional non-Hermitian pumping and
non-perturbatively modify the entire spectrum, despite having a manifestly

they appear almost universally in the long-time steady state, unlike Hermitian
polarons which only exist in the ground state. In our numerics, we also found
that, unlike well-known topological or skin localized states, squeezed polarons
exist in the bulk, independently of boundary conditions. Our findings could

is to show that there are universal correlations between the matrix elements of
local observables and the many-body level spectrum. This reveals how the matrix

us to show that these energies are power-law distributed. Using these results
we calculate analytically the distributions of local polarisations and of
eigenstate fidelity susceptibilities. The first of these quantities
characterises the proximity of MBL systems to noninteracting ones, while the
second highlights their extreme sensitivity to local perturbations. Our
theoretical approach is to consider the effect of varying a local field, which

properties of the models that contain purely virtual particles. We argue
against the LW premise that unstable particles can be removed from the sets of
incoming and outgoing states in scattering processes. The removal leads to a
non-Hermitian classical limit, besides clashing with the observation of the
muon. If, on the other hand, all the states are included, the LW models have a
Hamiltonian unbounded from below or negative norms. Purely virtual particles,
on the contrary, lead to a Hermitian classical limit and are absent from the
sets of incoming and outgoing states without implications on the observation of
long-lived unstable particles. We give a vademecum to summarize the properties
of most options to treat abnormal particles. We study a method to remove the LW
ghosts only partially, by saving the physical particles they contain.
Specifically, we replace a LW ghost with a certain superposition of a purely
virtual particle and an ordinary particle, and drop only the former from the
sets of the external states. The trick can be used to make the Pauli-Villars
fields consistent and observable, without sending their masses to infinity, or
to build a finite QED, by tweaking the original Lee-Wick construction. However,
it has issues with general covariance, so it cannot be applied as is to quantum
gravity, where a manifestly covariant decomposition requires the introduction
of a massive spin-2 multiplet.

initial-value problems in which different components evolve on distinct time
scales, and thus use of different step sizes for these components can result in
increased computational efficiency. Generally, such methods select these
different step sizes based on experimentation or stability considerations. For
problems that evolve on a single time scale, adaptivity approaches that strive
to control local temporal error are widely used to achieve numerical results of
a desired accuracy with minimal computational effort, while alleviating the
need for manual experimentation with different time step sizes. However, there
is a notable gap in the publication record on the development of adaptive
time-step controllers for multirate methods. In this paper, we extend the
single-rate controller work of Gustafsson (1994) to the multirate method
setting. Specifically, we develop controllers based on polynomial
approximations to the principal error functions for both the ""fast"" and ""slow""
time scales within multirate infinitesimal (MRI) methods. We additionally
investigate a variety of approaches for estimating the errors arising from each
time scale within MRI methods. We then numerically evaluate the proposed
multirate controllers and error estimation strategies on a range of multirate
test problems, comparing their performance against an estimated optimal
performance. Through this work, we combine the most performant of these
approaches to arrive at a set of multirate adaptive time step controllers that
robustly achieve desired solution accuracy with minimal computational effort.

  Journal (PSJ)",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A near surface thermal model for Arrokoth is developed based on the recently
released $10^5$ facet model of the body. This thermal solution takes into
account Arrokoth's surface re-radiation back onto itself. The solution method
exploits Arrokoth's periodic orbital character to develop a thermal response
using a time-asymptotic solution method, which involves a Fourier transform
solution of the heat equation, an approach recently used by others. We display
detailed thermal solutions assuming that Arrokoth's near surface material's
thermal inertia ${\cal I} = $ 2.5 W/m$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{1/2}$. We predict that
at New Horizons' encounter with Arrokoth its encounter hemisphere surface
temperatures were $\sim$ 57-59 K in its polar regions, 30-40 K on its
equatorial zones, and 11-13 K for its winter hemisphere. Arrokoth's orbitally
averaged temperatures are around 30-35 K in its polar regions, and closer to 40
K near its equatorial zones. Thermal reradiation from the surrounding surface
amounts to less than 5\% of the total energy budget, while the total energy
ensconced into and exhumed out Arrokoth's interior via thermal conduction over
one orbit is about 0.5\% of the total energy budget. As a generalized
application of this thermal modeling together with other KBO origins
considerations, we favor the interpretation that New Horizons' REX instrument's
$29 \pm 5$K brightness temperature measurement is consistent with Arrokoth's
near surface material's being made of sub-to-few mm sized tholin-coated
amorphous \water ice grains with 1 W/m$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{1/2}$ $< {\cal I} <

is natural to rescale parameters as $(u,v)=t^{-1/3}(a,b)$ to study the critical

particularly relevant in the bound phase ($a<0$) but not in the unbound phase.
For instance, starting from the flat or droplet initial data, the height field

qualitatively similar to that of pure MgB$_2$, undergoing a field-and
temperature-driven $30^{\circ}$ rotation transition, indicating only a modest
effect on the vortex-vortex interaction. In contrast, the vortex lattice
rotation transition is completely suppressed in the C-doped case, likely due to
a change in the electronic structure which affects the two-band/two-gap nature
of superconductivity in MgB2. The vortex lattice longitudinal correlation
length shows the opposite behavior, remaining roughly unchanged between pure
and C-doped MgB$_2$ while it is significantly reduced in the Mn-doped case.
However, the extensive vortex lattice metastability and related activated
behavior, observed in conjunction with the vortex lattice transition in pure

lattice disordering is not associated with a substantially increased vortex
pinning.

close to coplanar or close to polar to the binary orbit. Planets around a
circular binary form coplanar while planets around an eccentric binary can form
coplanar or polar depending on the initial disk misalignment and the binary
eccentricity. The more massive a terrestrial planet is, the more aligned it is
(to coplanar or polar) since it has undergone more mergers that lead on average
to smaller misalignment angles. Nodal precession of particle disks with very
large initial inclinations lead to high mutual inclinations between the
particles. This produces high relative velocities between particles that leads

Distinguishing between asymptotically localized or delocalized dynamics based
on numerical results is however nontrivial due to finite-size effects.
Numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCE) provide a means to tackle quantum
systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, but are challenging for models
without translational invariance. Here, we demonstrate that NLCE provide a
powerful tool to explore MBL by simulating quench dynamics in disordered
spin-$1/2$ two-leg ladders and Fermi-Hubbard chains. Combining NLCE with an
efficient real-time evolution of pure states, we obtain converged results for
the decay of the imbalance on long time scales and show that, especially for
intermediate disorder below the putative MBL transition, NLCE outperform direct
simulations of finite systems with open or periodic boundaries. Furthermore,
while spin is delocalized even in strongly disordered Hubbard chains with
frozen charge, we unveil that an additional tilted potential leads to a drastic
slowdown of the spin imbalance and nonergodic behavior on accessible times. Our
work sheds light on MBL in systems beyond the well-studied disordered
Heisenberg chain and emphasizes the usefulness of NLCE for this purpose.

the theory with target space equivariance corresponding to a supersymmetric

one free transverse dimension, the only monochromatic diffraction-free spatial

recently formulated that are propagation-invariant and localized in the
in-plane dimensions by virtue of a tight spectral association between their
spatial and temporal frequencies, which have thus been dubbed `space-time' (ST)
SPPs. Because of the spatio-temporal spectral structure unique to ST-SPPs, the
optimal launching strategy of such novel plasmonic field configurations remains
an open question. We present here a critical step towards realizing ST-SPPs by
reporting observations of ultrabroadband striped ST-SPPs. These are SPPs in
which each wavelength travels at a prescribed angle with respect to the
propagation axis to produce a periodic (striped) transverse spatial profile
that is diffraction-free. We start with a free-space ST wave packet that is
coupled to a ST-SPP at a gold-dielectric interface, and unambiguously identify
the ST-SPP via an axial beating detected in two-photon fluorescence produced by
the superposition of incident ST wave packet and the excited surface-bound
ST-SPP. These results highlight a viable approach for efficient and reliable
coupling to ST-SPPs, and thus represent the first crucial step towards

representation learning and cluster assignment. However, most existing deep
clustering methods suffer from two major drawbacks. First, most cluster
assignment methods are based on simple distance comparison and highly dependent
on the target distribution generated by a handcrafted nonlinear mapping. These
facts largely limit the possible performance that deep clustering methods can
reach. Second, the clustering results can be easily guided towards wrong
direction by the misassigned samples in each cluster. The existing deep
clustering methods are incapable of discriminating such samples. To address
these issues, a novel modular Self-Evolutionary Clustering (Self-EvoC)
framework is constructed, which boosts the clustering performance by
classification in a self-supervised manner. Fuzzy theory is used to score the
sample membership with probability which evaluates the intermediate clustering
result certainty of each sample. Based on which, the most reliable samples can
be selected and augmented. The augmented data are employed to fine-tune an
off-the-shelf deep network classifier with the labels from the clustering,
which results in a model to generate the target distribution. The proposed
framework can efficiently discriminate sample outliers and generate better
target distribution with the assistance of self-supervised classifier.
Extensive experiments indicate that the Self-EvoC remarkably outperforms
state-of-the-art deep clustering methods on three benchmark datasets.

models have mainly been calibrated from observables connected to the surface of
stars. Period-spacing patterns caused by gravity modes are a particularly
powerful asteroseismic tool that are useful for probing the near-core rotation
and mixing of chemical elements in main-sequence stars with convective cores.
Aims: we aim to compose a catalog of intermediate-mass stars in the TESS
southern continuous viewing zone to reveal period-spacing patterns caused by
gravity modes for use in future asteroseismic modeling. Methods: TESS full
frame images were inspected to select stars of intermediate- and high-mass
using color-magnitude criteria. Light curves were extracted from custom masks
per star, adopting stringent constraints on the aperture masks and
contamination. The extracted light curves were subject to iterative
prewhitening to detect gravity modes. We developed a method based on the
assumption that period spacings are an approximately linear function of the
mode periods to build a template pattern. This template was used to extract the
patterns and their bootstrap uncertainties. Results: our TESS catalog of
high-quality period-spacing patterns is the first of its kind and contains 140
gravity-mode patterns in 106 Gamma Doradus stars and 2 slowly pulsating B-type
stars. Half of these patterns contain 7 or more measured mode periods and the
longest pattern contains 20 modes. We provide the community with a convenient

a transportation network given that many instances of origin to destination
(OD) travel demand and link flows of the network are available. Instead of
estimating traffic flow patterns assuming certain user behavior (e.g., user
equilibrium or system optimal), here we explore the idea of learning those flow
patterns directly from the data. To implement this idea, we have formulated the
traffic-assignment problem as a data-driven learning problem and developed a
neural network-based framework known as Graph Convolutional Neural Network
(GCNN) to solve it. The proposed framework represents the transportation
network and OD demand in an efficient way and utilizes the diffusion process of
multiple OD demands from nodes to links. We validate the solutions of the model
against analytical solutions generated from running static user
equilibrium-based traffic assignments over Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts
networks. The validation result shows that the implemented GCNN model can learn
the flow patterns very well with less than 2% mean absolute difference between
the actual and estimated link flows for both networks under varying congested
conditions. When the training of the model is complete, it can instantly
determine the traffic flows of a large-scale network. Hence this approach can
overcome the challenges of deploying traffic assignment models over large-scale
networks and open new directions of research in data-driven network modeling.

collection of timestamped interaction events (i.e., temporal edges) between
vertices. Temporal motifs are defined as classes of (small) isomorphic induced
subgraphs on graph streams, considering both edge ordering and duration. As
with motifs in static networks, temporal motifs are the fundamental building
blocks for temporal structures in dynamic networks. Several methods have been
designed to count the occurrences of temporal motifs in graph streams, with
recent work focusing on estimating the count under various sampling schemes
along with concentration properties. However, little attention has been given
to the problem of uncertainty quantification and the asymptotic statistical
properties for such count estimators. In this work, we establish the
consistency and the asymptotic normality of a certain Horvitz-Thompson type of
estimator in an edge sampling framework for deterministic graph streams, which
can be used to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis testing
for the temporal motif count under sampling. We also establish similar results
under an analogous stochastic model. Our results are relevant to a wide range

high dual rank, and we can extract the coloring from the corresponding low-rank

then no sufficiently high rank dual optimal solution can exist. This allows us
to completely characterize the planar graphs for which dual optimal solutions
have sufficiently high dual rank. We then modify the semidefinite program to
have an objective function with costs, and explore when we can create a cost
function whose optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank. We show that
it is always possible to construct such a cost function given the graph

privacy requirements and data points of data holders with lower requirements
can contribute more information to the training process of the ML models. To

polarimetric studies of FRB 121102, and yield the highest burst Faraday
rotation measure (RM) to date, RM = 1.27*10^5 rad m^-2, consistent with the
decreasing RM trend. The fractional polarization of the burst emission is 15%
at 1.7 GHz. This can be reconciled with the high fractional polarization at
higher frequencies if the Faraday width of the burst environment is 150 rad
m^-2 - a bare 0.1% of the total Faraday rotation. The width may originate from
minor non-uniformities in the Faraday screen, or from effects in the emitting
region itself. The upper limit on the persistent source size is 1 pc, barely
consistent with a young supernova (SN) scenario. The flux variability limit of
<10% is not in favor of the young SN scenario, and challenges other
interpretations as well. The fractional polarization of the faint persistent
source is constrained at <25% at 4.8 GHz ruling out a common origin with the
highly polarized individual bursts.

additional complexity, making it difficult to compute for a large input. In
this paper, I propose a probabilistic approach which approximates the solution

Since this problem is an extension of the subset sum, our approximation also

We harness distributional approximations to model the number of subsets which
sum to a certain size. These distributional approximations are formulated in
two ways: using bounds to justify normal approximation, and approximating the
empirical distribution via density estimation. These approximations can be
computed in $O(n)$ complexity, and can increase in accuracy with the size of

this type of DQPT occurs, the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes and the rate
function remains singular after the second quench, meaning the final state
continually has no overlap with the initial state. This type of DQPT is named
metamorphic DQPT to differentiate it from ordinary DQPTs that only exhibit zero
Loschmidt amplitude and singular rate function at discrete time points. The
metamorphic DQPTs occur at zero as well as finite temperatures. Our examples of
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and Kitaev chain illustrate the conditions
and behavior of the metamorphic DQPT. Since ordinary DQPTs have been
experimentally realized in many systems, similar setups with double quenches
will demonstrate the metamorphic DQPT. Our findings thus provide additional

the GPU projects to the screen. They are discretized by sampling each triangle
at regular space intervals to generate fragments which are then added texture
and lighting effects by a shader program. Realistic scenes require detailed
geometric models, complex shaders, high-resolution displays and high screen
refreshing rates, which all come at a great compute time and energy cost. This
cost is often dominated by the fragment shader, which runs for each sampled
fragment. Conventional GPUs sample the triangles once per pixel, however, there
are many screen regions containing low variation that produce identical
fragments and could be sampled at lower than pixel-rate with no loss in
quality. Additionally, as temporal frame coherence makes consecutive frames
very similar, such variations are usually maintained from frame to frame. This
work proposes Dynamic Sampling Rate (DSR), a novel hardware mechanism to reduce
redundancy and improve the energy efficiency in graphics applications. DSR
analyzes the spatial frequencies of the scene once it has been rendered. Then,
it leverages the temporal coherence in consecutive frames to decide, for each
region of the screen, the lowest sampling rate to employ in the next frame that
maintains image quality. We evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art
mobile GPU architecture extended with DSR for a wide variety of applications.
Experimental results show that DSR is able to remove most of the redundancy
inherent in the color computations at fragment granularity, which brings
average speedups of 1.68x and energy savings of 40%.

MCS is dynamically generated due to CC division, which implies that the CC
dynamics should be minimally altered by the TPs. Here using theory and
simulations, we show that although the TP dynamics is unusual, exhibiting
sub-diffusive behavior on times less than the CC division times and
hyper-diffusive dynamics on in the long-time limit, they do not affect the
long-time CC dynamics or the local CC stress distributions. The CC pressure
profile within the MCS, which decays from a high value at the core to the

exists. We use a Bayesian framework to examine how uncertainties in measured
parameters influence the odds ratios of competing hypotheses for the source of
an observed trend. We analyze three reported trends from the literature. In
each application, while uncertainties do affect the numerical value of the odds
ratios, our conclusions remain the same whether or not uncertainties are taken
into account: hot Jupiter eccentricities are circularized over time,
obliquities of hot Jupiter hosts are driven by stellar temperature, and there
is not enough evidence to favor a trend of 2:1 orbital resonances with age over
a chance relation. Updated samples for the 2:1 resonances and obliquities cases
do not change the original conclusions. Simulated 2:1 resonance data show that
sample size may be more important than measurement precision for drawing a firm
conclusion. However, if 2:1 resonances get disrupted on a wide range of
timescales, an age trend will be inherently difficult to confirm over a chance
relation, even with a large sample. For some applications, full incorporation
of measurement uncertainties may be too computationally expensive, making it
preferable to use the framework without uncertainties and perform additional
tests to examine the effects of highly uncertain measurements.

recently. In particular, several works have established a non-asymptotic
superlinear rate of $\mathcal{O}((1/\sqrt{t})^t)$ for the (classic) BFGS method
by exploiting the fact that its error of Newton direction approximation
approaches zero. Moreover, a greedy variant of BFGS was recently proposed which
accelerates its convergence by directly approximating the Hessian, instead of
the Newton direction, and achieves a fast local quadratic convergence rate.
Alas, the local quadratic convergence of Greedy-BFGS requires way more updates
compared to the number of iterations that BFGS requires for a local superlinear
rate. This is due to the fact that in Greedy-BFGS the Hessian is directly
approximated and the Newton direction approximation may not be as accurate as
the one for BFGS. In this paper, we close this gap and present a novel BFGS
method that has the best of both worlds in that it leverages the approximation
ideas of both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS to properly approximate the Newton direction
and the Hessian matrix simultaneously. Our theoretical results show that our
method out-performs both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS in terms of convergence rate,
while it reaches its quadratic convergence rate with fewer steps compared to

2403, have been poorly studied to date. As a low mass galaxy (M$_{\ast}$ = 7
$\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$), cosmological simulations predict NGC 2403 to
contain few, if any, accreted GCs. It is also isolated, with a remarkably
undisturbed HI disk. Based on candidates from the literature, Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging, we selected several GCs for follow-up
spectroscopy using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. From their radial velocities,
and other properties, we identify 8 bona-fide GCs associated with either the
inner halo or the disk of this bulgeless galaxy. A stellar population analysis
suggests a wide range of GC ages from shortly after the Big Bang until the
present day. We find all of the old GCs to be metal-poor with [Fe/H] $\le$ --1.
The age--metallicity relation for the observed GCs suggests that they were
formed over many Gyr from gas with a low effective yield, similar to that
observed in the SMC. Outflows of enriched material may have contributed to the
low yield. With a total system of $\sim$50 GCs expected, our study is the first
step in fully mapping the star cluster history of NGC 2403 in both space and
time.

($\textbf{LFI}$s) to systems dealing with the concept of incompatibility,
expressed by means of a binary connective. The basic idea is that having two
incompatible formulas to hold trivializes a deduction, and as a special case, a
formula becomes consistent (in the sense of $\textbf{LFI}$s) when it is
incompatible with its own negation. We show how this notion extends that of
consistency in a non-trivial way, presenting conservative translations for many
simple $\textbf{LFI}$s into some of the most basic logics of incompatibility,
what evidences in a precise way how the notion of incompatibility generalizes
that of consistency. We provide semantics for the new logics, as well as
decision procedures, based on restricted non-deterministic matrices. The use of
non-deterministic semantics with restrictions is justified by the fact that, as
proved here, these systems are not algebraizable according to Blok-Pigozzi nor
are they characterizable by finite Nmatrices. Finally, we briefly compare our
logics to other systems focused on treating incompatibility, specially those
pioneered by Brandom and further developed by Peregrin.

can address application requirements through computation offloading. The
decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization
problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and
workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). On the other hand, deep learning model
optimization provides another source of tradeoff between latency and model

In addition, we statistically characterize the number of users per AP that is

  through Active Learning","This preprint has been submitted as a manuscript to ASME Journal of
  Mechanical Design",,,,"cs.CE cs.DB cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inspired by the recent achievements of machine learning in diverse domains,
data-driven metamaterials design has emerged as a compelling paradigm that can
unlock the potential of multiscale architectures. The model-centric research
trend, however, lacks principled frameworks dedicated to data acquisition,
whose quality propagates into the downstream tasks. Often built by naive
space-filling design in shape descriptor space, metamaterial datasets suffer
from property distributions that are either highly imbalanced or at odds with
design tasks of interest. To this end, we present t-METASET: an
active-learning-based data acquisition framework aiming to guide both diverse
and task-aware data generation. Distinctly, we seek a solution to a commonplace
yet frequently overlooked scenario at early stages of data-driven design of
metamaterials: when a massive (~O(10^4 )) shape-only library has been prepared
with no properties evaluated. The key idea is to harness a data-driven shape
descriptor learned from generative models, fit a sparse regressor as a start-up
agent, and leverage metrics related to diversity to drive data acquisition to
areas that help designers fulfill design goals. We validate the proposed
framework in three deployment cases, which encompass general use, task-specific
use, and tailorable use. Two large-scale mechanical metamaterial datasets are
used to demonstrate the efficacy. Applicable to general image-based design
representations, t-METASET could boost future advancements in data-driven
design.

the proposed MUD algorithms for a large number of devices is supported by

generalized into several concepts (e.g. equicontinuity, variants of almost

groups and semi-groups. Some concepts for group actions also are introduced for
decomposition (e.g. foliated spaces). Though the studies of decomposition can
be applied to foliated spaces and group actions, they can not be applied to
semi-group actions in general because the set of orbits of a semi-group need
not be a decomposition of the base space. This paper introduces
semi-decomposition to analyze semi-group actions and decompositions in a
unified manner. Then we show that characteristic $0$ properties and
$R$-closedness (i.e. closedness of the orbit element relation) coincide for
semi-decompositions on Hausdorff spaces. Each of weak equicontinuity and weak
almost periodicity for semi-decompositions on metrizable spaces implies
characteristic $0$ property and Hausdorff separation axiom for the class space.
In addition, the weak almost periodicity implies weak upper semi-continuity for
the class decomposition.

and neglects continuous dynamics. In this paper, we found that the recent
emerging paradigm of implicit neural representations (INRs) that encodes a
continuous signal into a parameterized neural network effectively mitigates the
issue. By utilizing INRs of video, we propose dynamics-aware implicit
generative adversarial network (DIGAN), a novel generative adversarial network
for video generation. Specifically, we introduce (a) an INR-based video

coordinates differently and (b) a motion discriminator that efficiently
identifies the unnatural motions without observing the entire long frame
sequences. We demonstrate the superiority of DIGAN under various datasets,
along with multiple intriguing properties, e.g., long video synthesis, video
extrapolation, and non-autoregressive video generation. For example, DIGAN
improves the previous state-of-the-art FVD score on UCF-101 by 30.7% and can be

universe is experiencing a rapid decline in star formation rate density. We
detect CO(3-2) emission in four targets and these galaxies fall between the

similar redshifts, we find they all have similar molecular gas budgets with the
difference in their star formation rates (SFR) driven by the star formation
efficiency (SFE). This suggests that at these redshifts large molecular gas
reservoirs must coincide with an increased SFE to transition a galaxy into the
starburst regime. We studied the structure and kinematics and found our four
detections are either interacting or have disturbed morphology which may be
driving the SFE. One of the CO(3-2) non-detections has a strong continuum

applications (increasing affordability for new tasks, new ideas in what 3D data

to automatically, reliably, and cheaply, register together individual point
clouds. The volume of data to handle, and still elusive need to have the
registration occur fully reliably and fully automatically, mean there is a need
to innovate further. One largely untapped area of innovation is that of
exploiting the {\em semantic information} of the points in question. Points on
a tree should match points on a tree, for example, and not points on car.
Moreover, such a natural restriction is clearly human-like - a human would
generally quickly eliminate candidate regions for matching based on semantics.
Employing semantic information is not only efficient but natural. It is also
timely - due to the recent advances in semantic classification capabilities.
This paper advances this theme by demonstrating that state of the art
registration techniques, in particular ones that rely on ""preservation of
length under rigid motion"" as an underlying matching consistency constraint,
can be augmented with semantic information. Semantic identity is of course also
preserved under rigid-motion, but also under wider motions present in a scene.
We demonstrate that not only the potential obstacle of cost of semantic
segmentation, and the potential obstacle of the unreliability of semantic
segmentation; are both no impediment to achieving both speed and accuracy in
fully automatic registration of large scale point clouds.

adversarial attacks is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model. An
adversarial attack might entail presenting a model with inaccurate or
fabricated samples as it's training data, or introducing maliciously designed
data to deceive an already trained model. While focusing on speech recognition
for machine-critical applications, in this paper, we first review existing
speech recognition techniques, then, we investigate the effectiveness of
adversarial attacks and defenses against these systems, before outlining
research challenges, defense recommendations, and future work. This paper is
expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them in
understanding the challenges, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to
improve existing models of speech recognition for mission-critical
applications. Keywords: Mission-Critical Applications, Adversarial AI, Speech
Recognition Systems.

commonly observed in complex systems, such as glasses and a collection of
cells, is hard to describe theoretically. In the context of cancer, intra-tumor
heterogeneity (ITH), characterized by cells with genetic and phenotypic
variability that co-exist within a single tumor, is often the cause of
ineffective therapy and recurrence of cancer. Multi-region sequencing (M-Seq),
obtained by sampling multiple regions of a single tumor, has vividly
demonstrated the pervasive nature of ITH, raising the need for a theory that
accounts for evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Here, we develop a statistical
mechanical theory to quantify ITH, using the Hamming distance, between genetic
mutations in distinct regions within a single tumor. An analytic expression for
ITH, expressed in terms of cell division probability ($\alpha$) and mutation
probability ($p$), is validated using cellular-automaton type simulations.
Application of the theory successfully captures ITH extracted from M-seq data
in patients with exogenous cancers (melanoma and lung). The theory, based on
punctuated evolution at the early stages of the tumor followed by neutral
evolution, is accurate provided the spatial variation in the tumor mutation
burden is not large. We show that there are substantial variations in ITH in
distinct regions of a single solid tumor, which supports the notion that
distinct subclones could co-exist. The simulations show that there are
substantial variations in the sub-populations, with the ITH increasing as the
distance between the regions increases. The analytical and simulation framework
developed here could be used in the quantitative analyses of the experimental
(M-Seq) data. More broadly, our theory is likely to be useful in analyzing
dynamic heterogeneity in complex systems such as super-cooled liquids.

with the orientation matrix and therefore eschews the need for generalized

is informed by the fact that rotation matrices belong to the SO(3) Lie matrix
group. The second approach employs Euler parameters, while the third uses Euler
angles. In all cases, the index 3 DAE problem is solved via a first order
implicit numerical integrator. We note a roughly twofold speedup of $
\mathbf{rA} $ over $ \mathbf{r\epsilon} $, and a 1.2 -- 1.3 times speedup of $
\mathbf{r\epsilon} $ over $ \mathbf{rp} $. The tests were carried out in
conjunction with four 3D mechanisms. The improvements in simulation speed of
the $ \mathbf{rA} $ approach are traced back to a simpler form of the equations
of motion and more concise Jacobians that enter the numerical solution. The
contributions made herein are twofold. First, we provide first order variations
of all the quantities that enter the $ \mathbf{rA} $ formulation when used in
the context of implicit integration; i.e., sensitivity of the kinematic

other contribution that compares head to head the solution efficiency of $
\mathbf{rA} $, $ \mathbf{rp} $, and $ \mathbf{r\epsilon} $ in the context of

state-of-the-art performance on all these three tasks, which demonstrates the

Protein-protein binding is steered by electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding,

intermolecular attractions between proteins in intracellular and extracellular
fluid. Low-entropy regions of hydration shells around proteins drive
hydrophobic attraction among them that essentially coordinate protein-protein

guidance stage of the binding. Here, an innovative method was developed for
identifying the low-entropy regions of hydration shells of given proteins, and
we discovered that the largest low-entropy regions of hydration shells on

perception of environment in a fair and adaptive way. In our model, both the
current message and historical observation are taken into account, and they are
handled in the same recurrent model but in different forms. We present a
dual-level recurrent communication framework for multi-agent systems, in which
the first recurrence occurs in the communication sequence and is used to
transmit communication data among agents, while the second recurrence is based
on the time sequence and combines the historical observations for each agent.
The developed communication flow separates communication messages from memories
but allows agents to share their historical observations by the dual-level
recurrence. This design makes agents adapt to changeable communication objects,
while the communication results are fair to these agents. We provide a
sufficient discussion about our method in both partially observable and fully
observable environments. The results of several experiments suggest our method
outperforms the existing decentralized communication frameworks and the
corresponding centralized training method.

  Spaces",,"PhD Thesis, Imperial College London, 2022",,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bayesian learning using Gaussian processes provides a foundational framework
for making decisions in a manner that balances what is known with what could be
learned by gathering data. In this dissertation, we develop techniques for
broadening the applicability of Gaussian processes. This is done in two ways.
Firstly, we develop pathwise conditioning techniques for Gaussian processes,
which allow one to express posterior random functions as prior random functions
plus a dependent update term. We introduce a wide class of efficient
approximations built from this viewpoint, which can be randomly sampled once in
advance, and evaluated at arbitrary locations without any subsequent
stochasticity. This key property improves efficiency and makes it simpler to
deploy Gaussian process models in decision-making settings. Secondly, we
develop a collection of Gaussian process models over non-Euclidean spaces,
including Riemannian manifolds and graphs. We derive fully constructive
expressions for the covariance kernels of scalar-valued Gaussian processes on
Riemannian manifolds and graphs. Building on these ideas, we describe a
formalism for defining vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian
manifolds. The introduced techniques allow all of these models to be trained
using standard computational methods. In total, these contributions make
Gaussian processes easier to work with and allow them to be used within a wider
class of domains in an effective and principled manner. This, in turn, makes it
possible to potentially apply Gaussian processes to novel decision-making
settings.

surrounding vehicles are essential to the decision-making and path-planning of
intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a novel framework based on ensemble
learning to improve the performance of trajectory predictions in interactive
scenarios. The framework is termed Interactive Ensemble Trajectory Predictor
(IETP). IETP assembles interaction-aware trajectory predictors as base learners
to build an ensemble learner. Firstly, each base learner in IETP observes
historical trajectories of vehicles in the scene. Then each base learner
handles interactions between vehicles to predict trajectories. Finally, an
ensemble learner is built to predict trajectories by applying two ensemble
strategies on the predictions from all base learners. Predictions generated by
the ensemble learner are final outputs of IETP. In this study, three
experiments using different data are conducted based on the NGSIM dataset.
Experimental results show that IETP improves the predicting accuracy and
decreases the variance of errors compared to base learners. In addition, IETP
exceeds baseline models with 50% of the training data, indicating that IETP is
data-efficient. Moreover, the implementation of IETP is publicly available at

our algorithms work over integers/reals, which may allow for additional

scalable qubit system with long coherence time and good controls, which is
harsh for most current platforms. Here, we demonstrate that the information

information via the polarization state of classical beams, the optical
computing elements that corresponds to the universal gate set are presented and
their combination for a general information process are theoretically

characterised by a high degree of collective behaviour of equities, whereas
periods of financial stability exhibit less collective behaviour. We argue that
during times of increased collective behaviour, risk reduction via sector-based
portfolio diversification is ineffective. Using the degree of collectivity as a
proxy for the benefit of diversification, we perform an extensive sampling of
equity portfolios to confirm the old financial adage that 30-40 stocks provide
sufficient diversification. Using hierarchical clustering, we discover a `best

and trapped ions are promising candidates to generate graph states, it is
technologically hard to entangle a large number of them due to several types of
noise. Since they must be sufficiently cooled to maintain their quantum
properties, thermal noise is one of major ones. In this paper, we show that for
any temperature $T$, the fidelity $\langle G|\rho_T|G\rangle$ between an ideal
graph state $|G\rangle$ at zero temperature and a thermal graph state $\rho_T$,
which is a graph state at temperature $T$, can be efficiently estimated by
using only one measurement setting. A remarkable property of our protocol is
that it is passive, while existing protocols are active, namely they switch
between at least two measurement settings. Since thermal noise is equivalent to
an independent phase-flip error, our estimation protocol also works for that
error. By generalizing our protocol to hypergraph states, we apply our protocol
to the quantum-computational-supremacy demonstration with instantaneous quantum
polynomial time circuits. Our results should make the characterization of

Internet without careful check due to the unacceptable cost, which brings
potential risks of backdoor attacks. A backdoored model always predicts a
target class in the presence of a predefined trigger pattern, which can be
easily realized via poisoning a small amount of data. In general, adversarial
training is believed to defend against backdoor attacks since it helps models
to keep their prediction unchanged even if we perturb the input image (as long
as within a feasible range). Unfortunately, few previous studies succeed in
doing so. To explore whether adversarial training could defend against backdoor
attacks or not, we conduct extensive experiments across different threat models
and perturbation budgets, and find the threat model in adversarial training
matters. For instance, adversarial training with spatial adversarial examples
provides notable robustness against commonly-used patch-based backdoor attacks.
We further propose a hybrid strategy which provides satisfactory robustness

cons. Cloud computing provides enhanced data storage and computing power but
causes high communication latency. Edge and fog computing provide similar
services with lower latency but with limited capacity, capability, and
coverage. A single computing paradigm cannot fulfil all the requirements of IoT
devices and a federation between them is needed to extend their capacity,
capability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and
providers and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between
clouds, edges, and fogs. Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the
problem of traffic offloading. However, in such a complex federated system,
traditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency requirements of
decision making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds. Machine learning
approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are consequently becoming
popular because they can quickly solve offloading problems in dynamic
environments with large amounts of unknown information. This study provides a
novel federal classification between cloud, edge, and fog and presents a
comprehensive research roadmap on offloading for different federated scenarios.
We survey the relevant literature on the various optimization approaches used
to solve this offloading problem, and compare their salient features. We then
provide a comprehensive survey on offloading in federated systems with machine
learning approaches and the lessons learned as a result of these surveys.
Finally, we outline several directions for future research and challenges that
have to be faced in order to achieve such a federation.

following challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model

target network by emulating real active adversaries. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is seen as a promising solution to automating the process of
penetration tests by reducing human effort and improving reliability. Existing
RL solutions focus on finding a specific attack path to impact the target
hosts. However, in reality, a diverse range of attack variations are needed to
provide comprehensive assessments of the target network's security level.
Hence, the attack agents must consider multiple objectives when penetrating the
network. Nevertheless, this challenge is not adequately addressed in the
existing literature. To this end, we formulate the automatic penetration
testing in the Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) framework and
propose a Chebyshev decomposition critic to find diverse adversary strategies
that balance different objectives in the penetration test. Additionally, the
number of available actions increases with the agent consistently probing the
target network, making the training process intractable in many practical
situations. Thus, we introduce a coverage-based masking mechanism that reduces
attention on previously selected actions to help the agent adapt to future
exploration. Experimental evaluation on a range of scenarios demonstrates the
superiority of our proposed approach when compared to adapted algorithms in
terms of multi-objective learning and performance efficiency.

(US)-based medical imaging modality with promise for diagnosing various types
of disease based on the tissue's speed of sound (SoS). It is developed for
conventional pulse-echo US using handheld probes and can thus be implemented in
state-of-the-art medical US systems. One promising application is the
quantification of the liver fat fraction in fatty liver disease. So far, CUTE
was demonstrated using linear array probes where the imaging depth is
comparable to the aperture size. For liver imaging, however, convex probes are
preferred since they provide a larger penetration depth and a wider view angle
allowing to capture a large area of the liver. With the goal of liver imaging
in mind, we adapt CUTE to convex probes, with a special focus on discussing
strategies that make use of the convex geometry in order to make our
implementation computationally efficient. We then demonstrate in an abdominal
imaging phantom that accurate quantitative SoS using convex probes is feasible,
in spite of the smaller aperture size in relation to the image area compared to
linear arrays. A preliminary in vivo result of liver imaging confirms this
outcome, but also indicates that deep quantitative imaging in the real liver
can be more challenging, probably due to the increased complexity of the tissue

recently proposed as a good platform for the hardware emulation of P-Bit. Here,
we report, for the first time, a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) Ising
computer using single tunable true random number generator which is comprised
of a Spin Torque Nano-Oscillator (STNO). First, the intrinsic frequency
fluctuation of the STNO is utilized to design a simple digital true random
number generator (TRNG). The true random number generator is further evolved
into a tunable random number generator to act as a P-Bit. Second, in order to
accomplish combinational optimization with our proposed P-Bit under Ising

between P-Bit array, high fidelity NOT and XOR logic gate is demonstrated.
Third, it is proposed that our digital TRNG can be simply reused acting as a
P-Bit array by time division multiplexing. The whole Ising computer can be
implemented by one single STNO, and integer factorization of as high as 87%
accuracy rate is achieved.

receiver is to obtain the likelihood of the received samples under different
state transitions of the trellis diagram, which relies on the channel state
information (CSI) and the distribution of the channel noise. We propose to
learn the trellis diagram real-time using an artificial neural network (ANN)
trained by a pilot sequence. This approach, termed as the online learning of
trellis diagram (OLTD), requires neither the CSI nor statistics of the noise,
and can be incorporated into the classic Viterbi and the BCJR algorithm.
%Compared with the state-of-the-art ViterbiNet and BCJRNet algorithms in the
literature, it It is shown to significantly outperform the model-based methods
in non-Gaussian channels. It requires much less training overhead than the
state-of-the-art methods, and hence is more feasible for real implementations.
As an illustrative example, the OLTD-based BCJR is applied to a Bluetooth low

the OLTD-based BCJR can accommodate for turbo equalization, while the
state-of-the-art BCJRNet/ViterbiNet cannot. As an interesting by-product, we
propose an enhancement to the BLE standard by introducing a bit interleaver to
its physical layer; the resultant improvement of the receiver sensitivity can
make it a better fit for some Internet of Things (IoT) communications.

The known mechanism for evaporation is ""thermal evaporation"" which highlights
the energy input for evaporation is via heat. Due to the weak absorption of
water to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water
is usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes
via additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we
report here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the
water-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we
call photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the
water-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular
evaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the
polarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase
further support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths
of visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer

filters are local and distributed linear operations, whose output depends only
on the local neighborhood of each node. Moreover, a graph filter's output can
be computed separately at each node by carrying out repeated exchanges with
immediate neighbors. Graph filters can be compactly written as polynomials of a
graph shift operator (typically, a sparse matrix description of the graph).
This has led to relating the properties of the filters with the spectral
properties of the corresponding matrix -- which encodes global structure of the
graph. In this work, we propose a framework that relies solely on the local
distribution of the neighborhoods of a graph. The crux of this approach is to
describe graphs and graph signals in terms of a measurable space of rooted

spectral densities, transferability of filters across arbitrary graphs, and
continuity of graph signal properties with respect to the distribution of local

solids. Due to the intrinsic entangling of three local atomic motions: shear,
dilatation and rotation, the precise physical process of shear band emergence
is still an enigma. To unveil this mystery, we formulate for the first time a
theoretical protocol covering both affine and non-affine components of
deformation, to decode these highly entangled local atomic-scale events. In
contrast to the broad concept of shear transformation zone, plastic behavior
can be demonstrated comprehensively as the operative manipulation of more exact
shear-dominated zones (SDZs), dilatation-dominated zones (DDZs) and
rotation-dominated zones (RDZs). Their spatiotemporal evolution exhibits a
novel transition from synchronous motion to separate distribution at the onset
of shear band, which is in striking resemblance with the transition from
laminar flow to turbulent flow in flow dynamics. The hidden mechanism is
revealed with the help of extreme value theory (EVT) and percolation analysis.
Analysis of EVT indicates dilatation is the dominant mode at the embryo of
initial plastic units. The percolation analysis points towards the critical
power-law scaling nature at the transition from stochastic activation to
percolation of plastic regions. Then the comprehensive pictures of shear
banding emergence are uncovered. Firstly, dilatation triggers initial shear and
rotation in soft regions, leading to embryo of flow units, which is followed by
the inhomogeneous turbulent-like pattern manifesting as the secondary
activation of rotation in neighboring hard material. Such rotation activation
contributes to further perturbation, and ultimately, leads to shear band
formation. Our findings also reinforce that the discussion of plastic behavior
in disordered materials must take into account both affine and non-affine
component deformation.

mathematically encoded using stochastic control barrier functions and safe

achieved by augmenting to each agent's optimization variables, copy variables,
for its neighbors. This allows us to decouple the centralized multi-agent
optimization problem. However, to ensure safety, neighboring agents must agree
on ""what is safe for both of us"" and this creates a need for consensus. To
enable safe consensus solutions, we incorporate an ADMM-based approach.
Specifically, we propose a Merged CADMM-OSQP implicit neural network layer,
that solves a mini-batch of both, local quadratic programs as well as the
overall consensus problem, as a single optimization problem. This layer is
embedded within a Deep FBSDEs network architecture at every time step, to
facilitate end-to-end differentiable, safe and decentralized stochastic optimal

weights correlated through latent geometries, extending a recent line of
research on random graph matching with independent edge weights to geometric
models. Specifically, given a random permutation $\pi^*$ on $[n]$ and $n$ iid
pairs of correlated Gaussian vectors $\{X_{\pi^*(i)}, Y_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$
with noise parameter $\sigma$, the edge weights are given by
$A_{ij}=\kappa(X_i,X_j)$ and $B_{ij}=\kappa(Y_i,Y_j)$ for some link function
$\kappa$. The goal is to recover the hidden vertex correspondence $\pi^*$ based
on the observation of $A$ and $B$. We focus on the dot-product model with
$\kappa(x,y)=\langle x, y \rangle$ and Euclidean distance model with
$\kappa(x,y)=\|x-y\|^2$, in the low-dimensional regime of $d=o(\log n)$ wherein
the underlying geometric structures are most evident. We derive an approximate
maximum likelihood estimator, which provably achieves, with high probability,
perfect recovery of $\pi^*$ when $\sigma=o(n^{-2/d})$ and almost perfect
recovery with a vanishing fraction of errors when $\sigma=o(n^{-1/d})$.
Furthermore, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically optimal
even when the latent coordinates $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ are observed,
complementing the recent results of [DCK19] and [KNW22] in geometric models of
the planted bipartite matching problem. As a side discovery, we show that the
celebrated spectral algorithm of [Ume88] emerges as a further approximation to
the maximum likelihood in the geometric model.

  2022",,,,"cs.LG stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal inference from observational datasets often relies on measuring and
adjusting for covariates. In practice, measurements of the covariates can often
be noisy and/or biased, or only measurements of their proxies may be available.
Directly adjusting for these imperfect measurements of the covariates can lead
to biased causal estimates. Moreover, without additional assumptions, the
causal effects are not point-identifiable due to the noise in these
measurements. To this end, we study the partial identification of causal
effects given noisy covariates, under a user-specified assumption on the noise
level. The key observation is that we can formulate the identification of the
average treatment effects (ATE) as a robust optimization problem. This
formulation leads to an efficient robust optimization algorithm that bounds the
ATE with noisy covariates. We show that this robust optimization approach can
extend a wide range of causal adjustment methods to perform partial
identification, including backdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score
weighting, double machine learning, and front door adjustment. Across synthetic
and real datasets, we find that this approach provides ATE bounds with a higher
coverage probability than existing methods.

  Verification in the Deepfake Era","Accepted as a full paper at USENIX Security '22",,,,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facial Liveness Verification (FLV) is widely used for identity authentication
in many security-sensitive domains and offered as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
by leading cloud vendors. Yet, with the rapid advances in synthetic media
techniques (e.g., deepfake), the security of FLV is facing unprecedented
challenges, about which little is known thus far.
  To bridge this gap, in this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on
the security of FLV in real-world settings. Specifically, we present
LiveBugger, a new deepfake-powered attack framework that enables customizable,
automated security evaluation of FLV. Leveraging LiveBugger, we perform a
comprehensive empirical assessment of representative FLV platforms, leading to
a set of interesting findings. For instance, most FLV APIs do not use
anti-deepfake detection; even for those with such defenses, their effectiveness
is concerning (e.g., it may detect high-quality synthesized videos but fail to
detect low-quality ones). We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the factors
impacting the attack performance of LiveBugger: a) the bias (e.g., gender or
race) in FLV can be exploited to select victims; b) adversarial training makes
deepfake more effective to bypass FLV; c) the input quality has a varying
influence on different deepfake techniques to bypass FLV. Based on these
findings, we propose a customized, two-stage approach that can boost the attack
success rate by up to 70%. Further, we run proof-of-concept attacks on several
representative applications of FLV (i.e., the clients of FLV APIs) to
illustrate the practical implications: due to the vulnerability of the APIs,
many downstream applications are vulnerable to deepfake. Finally, we discuss
potential countermeasures to improve the security of FLV. Our findings have
been confirmed by the corresponding vendors.

independent of both BCG+ICL and halo masses, with an average of 60$\pm$40 kpc,
in good agreement with previous observational measurements, but given the large
scatter, it can be considered as a sort of physical separation between the two
components only on cluster scale. From the analysis of $M_{ICL}-M_{BCG+ICL}$
relation, we build a method able to extract the ICL mass directly from the
knowledge of the BCG+ICL one. Given the large scatter on low mass systems, such
method under/overpredicts the true value of the ICL in a significant way, up to
a factor of three in the worst cases. On the other hand, for $\log
M_{BCG+ICL}>12$ or $\log M_{Halo}>14$, the difference between the true value
and the one extracted from the $M_{ICL}-M_{BCG+ICL}$ relation ranges between
$\pm$30\%. We therefore suggest this relation as a reliable test for
observational works aiming to isolate the ICL from the BCG, for systems hosted

The CME results from a non-radial eruption of a filament-carrying flux rope in
NOAA active region 11236. The eruption is observed in EUV wavelengths by the
EUVI on board the ahead and behind STEREO spacecrafts and the AIA on board SDO.
The CME is observed by the COR1 coronagraph on board STEREO and the C2
coronagraph on board SOHO/LASCO. The revised cone model is slightly modified,
with the top of the cone becoming a sphere, which is internally tangent to the
legs. Using the multi-point observations, the cone model is applied to derive
the morphological and kinematic properties of the CME. The cone shape fits
nicely with the CME observed by EUVI and COR1 on board STEREO twin spacecraft
and LASCO/C2 coronagraph. The cone angle increases sharply from 54$^{\circ}$ to
130$^{\circ}$ in the initial phase, indicating a rapid expansion. A relation
between the cone angle and heliocentric distance of CME leading front is
derived, $\omega=130\degr-480d^{-5}$, where $d$ is in unit of $R_{\odot}$. The
inclination angle decreases gradually from $\sim$51$^{\circ}$ to
$\sim$18$^{\circ}$, suggesting a trend of radial propagation. The heliocentric
distance increases gradually in the initial phase and quickly in the later
phase up to $\sim$11\,$R_{\odot}$. The true speed of CME reaches $\sim$1140 km
s$^{-1}$, which is $\sim$1.6 times higher than the apparent speed in the
LASCO/C2 field of view. The revised model is promising in tracking the complete
evolution of CMEs.

the sequential information design problem to align its long term interest with
incentives of the gig service providers. This paper proposes a novel model of
sequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs),
where a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of
myopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative
utilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and
utility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding
a signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers
and inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender.
Nevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out
that we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. $\epsilon$-optimal) policy
with finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified
formulation of the Bellman equation.
  Our main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online
reinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal
signaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the
knowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the
Markov transition kernels. We design a provably efficient no-regret learning
algorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which
features a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. Our
algorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear $\sqrt{T}$-regret
upper bound. Furthermore, both our algorithm and theory can be applied to MPPs
with large space of outcomes and states via function approximation, and we
showcase such a success under the linear setting.

unbiased feature estimation of persons. The network updates the feature vector
self-adaptively and utilizes the feature similarity for the regression of crowd

novel test to assess the quality of the proxy vector based on comparisons of
pretrial misconduct rates among released defendants -- suggest that the
discrimination estimates are not driven by omitted variable bias and that, if
anything, failing to fully account for differences in misconduct potential
leads to an underestimation of discrimination. Our estimates suggest that
discrimination stems from an informational problem because judges do not

slides, the pathologist annotate the slides by marking the rough boundary
around the suspected tumour region. The marking or annotation is generally
represented as a polygonal boundary that covers the extent of the tumour in the
slide. These polygonal markings are difficult to imitate through CAD techniques
since the tumour regions are heterogeneous and hence segmenting them would
require exhaustive pixel wise ground truth annotation. Therefore, for CAD
analysis, the ground truths are generally annotated by pathologist explicitly
for research purposes. However, this kind of annotation which is generally
required for semantic or instance segmentation is time consuming and tedious.
In this proposed work, therefore, we have tried to imitate pathologist like
annotation by segmenting tumour extents by polygonal boundaries. For polygon
like annotation or segmentation, we have used Active Contours whose vertices or
snake points move towards the boundary of the object of interest to find the
region of minimum energy. To penalize the Active Contour we used modified U-Net

traditional Active Contours segmentation technique. The model is tested against
both state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and hybrid models for performance
evaluation against contemporary work. The results obtained show that the

Active Contours and global knowledge through semantic segmentation deep

limited to ordinary images, and RSIs have not been studied. To explore the
basic characteristics of UAPs of RSIs, this paper proposes a novel method
combining an encoder-decoder network with an attention mechanism to generate
the UAP of RSIs. Firstly, the former is used to generate the UAP, which can
learn the distribution of perturbations better, and then the latter is used to
find the sensitive regions concerned by the RSI classification model. Finally,
the generated regions are used to fine-tune the perturbation making the model
misclassified with fewer perturbations. The experimental results show that the
UAP can make the classification model misclassify, and the attack success rate
of our proposed method on the RSI data set is as high as 97.09%.

becoming increasingly popular. A meal delivery platform aims to provide
excellent and stable services for customers and restaurants. However, in
reality, several hundred thousand orders are canceled per day in the Meituan
meal delivery platform since they are not accepted by the crowd soucing
drivers. The cancellation of the orders is incredibly detrimental to the
customer's repurchase rate and the reputation of the Meituan meal delivery
platform. To solve this problem, a certain amount of specific funds is provided
by Meituan's business managers to encourage the crowdsourcing drivers to accept
more orders. To make better use of the funds, in this work, we propose a
framework to deal with the multi-stage bonus allocation problem for a meal
delivery platform. The objective of this framework is to maximize the number of
accepted orders within a limited bonus budget. This framework consists of a
semi-black-box acceptance probability model, a Lagrangian dual-based dynamic
programming algorithm, and an online allocation algorithm. The semi-black-box
acceptance probability model is employed to forecast the relationship between
the bonus allocated to order and its acceptance probability, the Lagrangian
dual-based dynamic programming algorithm aims to calculate the empirical
Lagrangian multiplier for each allocation stage offline based on the historical
data set, and the online allocation algorithm uses the results attained in the
offline part to calculate a proper delivery bonus for each order. To verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, both offline experiments on a
real-world data set and online A/B tests on the Meituan meal delivery platform
are conducted. Our results show that using the proposed framework, the total

realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from
the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This paper alleviates
the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation
(ATPG) for the robust quantum circuit testing. We introduce the stabilizer
projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern, and
construct the test application using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather
robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation.
However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing

an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques which
can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of
our algorithms are validated by 1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable

of similar molecules in the cell. But despite a firm physical understanding of
binding interactions, we lack a general theory of how proteins evolve high
specificity. Here, we present such a model that combines chemistry, mechanics
and genetics, and explains how their interplay governs the evolution of
specific protein-ligand interactions. The model shows that there are many
routes to achieving molecular discrimination - by varying degrees of
flexibility and shape/chemistry complementarity - but the key ingredient is
precision. Harder discrimination tasks require more collective and precise
coaction of structure, forces and movements. Proteins can achieve this through
correlated mutations extending far from a binding site, which fine-tune the
localized interaction with the ligand. Thus, the solution of more complicated
tasks is enabled by increasing the protein size, and proteins become more
evolvable and robust when they are larger than the bare minimum required for
discrimination. The model makes testable, specific predictions about the role
of flexibility and shape mismatch in discrimination, and how evolution can
independently tune affinity and specificity. Thus, the proposed theory of
specific binding addresses the natural question of ""why are proteins so big?"".
A possible answer is that molecular discrimination is often a hard task best
performed by adding more layers to the protein.

resolution gigapixel images using Convolutional Neural Networks. Therefore,
such images are divided into patches or tiles. Since, these high resolution
patches are encoded with discriminative information therefore; CNNs are trained
on these patches to perform patch-level predictions. However, the problem with
patch-level prediction is that pathologist generally annotates at image-level
and not at patch level. Due to this limitation most of the patches may not
contain enough class-relevant features. Through this work, we tried to
incorporate patch descriptive capability within the deep framework by using Bag
of Visual Words (BoVW) as a kind of regularisation to improve generalizability.
Using this hypothesis, we aim to build a patch based classifier to discriminate
between four classes of breast biopsy image patches (normal, benign, \textit{In
situ} carcinoma, invasive carcinoma). The task is to incorporate quality deep
features using CNN to describe relevant information in the images while
simultaneously discarding irrelevant information using Bag of Visual Words
(BoVW). The proposed method passes patches obtained from WSI and microscopy
images through pre-trained CNN to extract features. BoVW is used as a feature
selector to select most discriminative features among the CNN features.
Finally, the selected feature sets are classified as one of the four classes.
The hybrid model provides flexibility in terms of choice of pre-trained models
for feature extraction. The pipeline is end-to-end since it does not require
post processing of patch predictions to select discriminative patches. We
compared our observations with state-of-the-art methods like ResNet50,
DenseNet169, and InceptionV3 on the BACH-2018 challenge dataset. Our proposed

use of images from multiple non-visual and privacy-preserving modalities such
as depth, long-wave infrared (LWIR) and pressure maps for the task of in-bed
pose estimation in two settings. First, we explore the effective fusion of
information from different imaging modalities for better pose estimation.
Secondly, we propose a framework that can estimate in-bed pose estimation when
visible images are unavailable, and demonstrate the applicability of fusion
methods to scenarios where only LWIR images are available. We analyze and
demonstrate the effect of fusing features from multiple modalities. For this
purpose, we consider four different techniques: 1) Addition, 2) Concatenation,
3) Fusion via learned modal weights, and 4) End-to-end fully trainable
approach; with a state-of-the-art pose estimation model. We also evaluate the
effect of reconstructing a data-rich modality (i.e., visible modality) from a
privacy-preserving modality with data scarcity (i.e., long-wavelength infrared)
for in-bed human pose estimation. For reconstruction, we use a conditional
generative adversarial network. We conduct ablative studies across different
design decisions of our framework. This includes selecting features with
different levels of granularity, using different fusion techniques, and varying
model parameters. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our method

comes to providing provable security guarantees for classical computations.
More recently, the concept was generalized to quantum computations. While
classical computations are essentially noiseless and differential privacy is
often achieved by artificially adding noise, near-term quantum computers are
inherently noisy and it was observed that this leads to natural differential
privacy as a feature.
  In this work we discuss quantum differential privacy in an information
theoretic framework by casting it as a quantum divergence. A main advantage of
this approach is that differential privacy becomes a property solely based on
the output states of the computation, without the need to check it for every
measurement. This leads to simpler proofs and generalized statements of its
properties as well as several new bounds for both, general and specific, noise
models. In particular, these include common representations of quantum circuits
and quantum machine learning concepts. Here, we focus on the difference in the
amount of noise required to achieve certain levels of differential privacy
versus the amount that would make any computation useless. Finally, we also
generalize the classical concepts of local differential privacy, Renyi
differential privacy and the hypothesis testing interpretation to the quantum
setting, providing several new properties and insights.

source domains to an unlabeled target domain. MDA is a challenging task due to
the severe domain shift, which not only exists between target and source but
also exists among diverse sources. Prior studies on MDA either estimate a mixed
distribution of source domains or combine multiple single-source models, but
few of them delve into the relevant information among diverse source domains.
For this reason, we propose a novel MDA approach, termed Pseudo Target for MDA
(PTMDA). Specifically, PTMDA maps each group of source and target domains into
a group-specific subspace using adversarial learning with a metric constraint,
and constructs a series of pseudo target domains correspondingly. Then we align
the remainder source domains with the pseudo target domain in the subspace
efficiently, which allows to exploit additional structured source information
through the training on pseudo target domain and improves the performance on
the real target domain. Besides, to improve the transferability of deep neural
networks (DNNs), we replace the traditional batch normalization layer with an
effective matching normalization layer, which enforces alignments in latent
layers of DNNs and thus gains further promotion. We give theoretical analysis
showing that PTMDA as a whole can reduce the target error bound and leads to a
better approximation of the target risk in MDA settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PTMDA's effectiveness on MDA tasks, as it outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in most experimental settings.

light and can be measured by a transverse shift \lambda of photons with
opposite spins. The precise measurement of transverse shifts can enable many
spin-related applications, such as precise metrology and optical sensing.
However, this transverse shift is generally small (i.e. \delta /\lambda
<{10}^{-1}, \lambda is the wavelength), which impedes its precise measurement.
To-date proposals to generate giant spin Hall effect (namely with \delta
/\lambda >{10}^{2}) have severe limitations, particularly its occurrence only
over a narrow angular cone (with a width of \Delta \theta <{1}^{\circ}). Here
we propose a universal scheme to realize the wide-angle giant photonic spin
Hall effect with \Delta \theta >{70}^{\circ} by exploiting the interface
between free space and uniaxial epsilon-near-zero media. The underlying
mechanism is ascribed to the almost-perfect polarization splitting between s
and p polarized waves at the designed interface. Remarkably, this
almost-perfect polarization splitting does not resort to the interference
effect and is insensitive to the incident angle, which then gives rise to the
wide-angle giant photonic spin Hall effect.

Quadratic Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator provides the optimal estimates of
power spectra, but it is computationally very expensive. The hybrid pseudo-Cl
estimator is computationally fast but performs poorly on large scales. As a
natural extension of previous work (Chen et al. 2021), in this article, we
present a new unbiased estimator based on the Smith-Zaldarriaga (SZ) approach
of E-B separation and scalar QML approach to reconstruct the cross-correlation
power spectrum, called QML-SZ estimator. Our new estimator relies on the
ability to construct scalar maps, which allows us to use a scalar QML estimator
to obtain the cross-correlation power spectrum. By reducing the pixel number
and algorithm complexity, the computational cost is nearly one order of
magnitude smaller and the running time is nearly two orders of magnitude faster
in the test situations.

systems under both multiple networks and event-triggered mechanisms. Multiple
networks are to connect multiple agents and reference systems with
decentralized controllers to guarantee their information transmission, whereas
the event-triggered mechanisms are to reduce the information transmission via
the networks. In this paper, each agent has a network to communicate with its
controller and reference system, and all networks are independent and
asynchronous and have local event-triggered mechanisms, which are based on
local measurements and determine whether the local measurements need to be
transmitted via the corresponding network. To address this scenario, we first
implement the emulation-based approach to develop a novel hybrid model for the
tracking control of networked multi-agent systems. Next, sufficient conditions
are derived and decentralized event-triggered mechanisms are designed to
guarantee the desired tracking performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach
is applied to derive novel results for the event-triggered observer design
problem of networked multi-agent systems. Finally, two numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the validity of the developed results.

interesting information at large scale, in particular Land Surface Temperature

which prevents from an analysis at fine scales. For example, MODIS satellite
provides daily acquisitions with 1Km spatial resolutions which is not
sufficient to deal with highly heterogeneous environments as agricultural
parcels. Therefore, image super-resolution is a crucial task to better exploit
MODIS LSTs. This issue is tackled in this paper. We introduce a deep
learning-based algorithm, named Multi-residual U-Net, for super-resolution of
MODIS LST single-images. Our proposed network is a modified version of U-Net
architecture, which aims at super-resolving the input LST image from 1Km to
250m per pixel. The results show that our Multi-residual U-Net outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods.

feed energy to the solar wind. In this study, we tested the WTD model with
global measurement of wind speed from interplanetary scintillation (IPS)
observations. For Carrington rotations in minimal and maximal activity phases,
we selected field lines calculated by the potential-field source-surface method
in high- and mid-latitudes and compared the simulated and observed wind
velocities. The simulation was performed in a self-consistent manner by solving
the magnetohydrodynamic equations from the photosphere to the solar wind. In
high-latitude regions, the simulated solar wind velocity agrees better with the
IPS observation than with the classical Wang--Sheeley empirical estimation,
both in maximal and minimal activity phases. In mid-latitude regions, the
agreement worsens, possibly because of the inaccuracy of the WTD model and/or
the magnetic-field extrapolation. Our results indicate that the high-latitude
solar wind is likely to be driven by waves and turbulence, and that the
physics-based prediction of the solar wind velocity is highly feasible with an

drawing great both theoretical and experimental attention. The vacuum states of
variety of fields, subject to special boundary conditions, may contribute to
non-trivial macroscopic vacuum energy, i.e. the Casimir effect, which become an
interdisciplinary subject and plays an important role in a variety of fields of
physics. We adopt Schwinger's source theory and study the Casimir effect due to
the quantization of gravitation, i.e. the gravitational Casimir effect (GCE),
in inspiraling neutron star (NS) binaries with wide separation of $10^9 \rm m$.
By considering gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) arising from the spiral-in orbital
motion and evaluating the contributions of GEM to the vacuum energy of
gravitons radiated during the orbital decay, we demonstrate that, when the
orbital separation of the binary decay a distance of $L$ in radial direction,
the GEM results in a small Casimir correction to the gravitational vacuum
energy, which contributes to an attractive gravitational Casimir force to the
binary, in addition the gravitational force. The gravitational waves (GWs),
emitted from wide inspiraling NS binaries, locate in the low-frequency band of
$10^{-4}-1$ Hz. For a characteristic GW frequency of $10^{-3}$ Hz, the
gravitational Casimir correction to the signals is estimated as of the order of
$\sim10^{-24}$, which corresponds to a force of $10^{-20}$ N. By considering
that the sensitivity of space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA/eLISA

different distribution or target domain. In this work, we address the complex
case of deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation
across EM datasets from different tissues and species. We present three
unsupervised domain adaptation strategies to improve mitochondria segmentation
in the target domain based on (1) state-of-the-art style transfer between
images of both domains; (2) self-supervised learning to pre-train a model using
unlabeled source and target images, and then fine-tune it only with the source
labels; and (3) multi-task neural network architectures trained end-to-end with
both labeled and unlabeled images. Additionally, we propose a new training
stopping criterion based on morphological priors obtained exclusively in the
source domain. We carried out all possible cross-dataset experiments using
three publicly available EM datasets. We evaluated our proposed strategies on
the mitochondria semantic labels predicted on the target datasets. The methods
introduced here outperform the baseline methods and compare favorably to the
state of the art. In the absence of validation labels, monitoring our proposed
morphology-based metric is an intuitive and effective way to stop the training
process and select in average optimal models.

voice samples. Nevertheless, further classification had rarely been attempted.
This study proposes a novel approach, using continuous Mandarin speech instead
of a single vowel, to classify four common voice disorders (i.e. functional
dysphonia, neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy). Methods: In the proposed
framework, acoustic signals are transformed into mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients, and a bi-directional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) is
adopted to model the sequential features. The experiments were conducted on a
large-scale database, wherein 1,045 continuous speech were collected by the
speech clinic of a hospital from 2012 to 2019. Results: Experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant accuracy and
unweighted average recall improvements of 78.12-89.27% and 50.92-80.68%,
respectively, compared with systems that use a single vowel. Conclusions: The
results are consistent with other machine learning algorithms, including gated
recurrent units, random forest, deep neural networks, and LSTM. The
sensitivities for each disorder were also analyzed, and the model capabilities
were visualized via principal component analysis. An alternative experiment
based on a balanced dataset again confirms the advantages of using continuous

  The catalogue was generated using a hybrid approach. Two neural networks were
trained to perform binary merger non-merger classifications: one for galaxies
with $z < 0.15$ and another for $0.15 \leq z < 0.30$. Each network used the
image and morphological parameters of a galaxy as input. The galaxies that were
identified as merger candidates by the network were then visually checked by
experts. The resulting mergers will be used to calculate the merger fraction as
a function of redshift and compared with literature results.
  We found that 86.3% of galaxy mergers at $z < 0.15$ and 79.0% of mergers at
$0.15 \leq z < 0.30$ are expected to be correctly identified by the networks.
Of the 34 264 galaxies classified by the neural networks, 10 195 were found to

(DNNs) can often generalize fairly well, in part due to the ""implicit
regularization"" induced by the learning algorithm. Nonetheless, various forms
of regularization, such as ""explicit regularization"" (via weight decay), are
often used to avoid overfitting, especially when the data is corrupted. There
are several challenges with explicit regularization, most notably unclear
convergence properties. Inspired by convergence properties of stochastic mirror
descent (SMD) algorithms, we propose a new method for training DNNs with
regularization, called regularizer mirror descent (RMD). In highly
overparameterized DNNs, SMD simultaneously interpolates the training data and
minimizes a certain potential function of the weights. RMD starts with a
standard cost which is the sum of the training loss and a convex regularizer of
the weights. Reinterpreting this cost as the potential of an ""augmented""
overparameterized network and applying SMD yields RMD. As a result, RMD
inherits the properties of SMD and provably converges to a point ""close"" to the
minimizer of this cost. RMD is computationally comparable to stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and weight decay, and is parallelizable in the same
manner. Our experimental results on training sets with various levels of
corruption suggest that the generalization performance of RMD is remarkably
robust and significantly better than both SGD and weight decay, which
implicitly and explicitly regularize the $\ell_2$ norm of the weights. RMD can
also be used to regularize the weights to a desired weight vector, which is
particularly relevant for continual learning.

communication and sensing in systems jointly performing both operations.
Specifically, a discrete memoryless state-dependent broadcast channel model is
studied in which (i) the presence of feedback enables a transmitter to convey
information, while simultaneously performing channel state estimation; (ii) one
of the receivers is treated as an eavesdropper whose state should be estimated
but which should remain oblivious to part of the transmitted information. The
model abstracts the challenges behind security for joint communication and
sensing if one views the channel state as a sensitive attribute, e.g.,
location. For independent and identically distributed states, perfect output
feedback, and when part of the transmitted message should be kept secret, a
partial characterization of the secrecy-distortion region is developed. The
characterization is exact when the broadcast channel is either
physically-degraded or reversely-physically-degraded. The partial
characterization is also extended to the situation in which the entire
transmitted message should be kept secret. The benefits of a joint approach
compared to separation-based secure communication and state-sensing methods are
illustrated with a binary joint communication and sensing model.

granular material is subjected to compression by a piston in a closed
container, on-ground and in microgravity. Results show that piston-probing
densifies the packing, eventually leading to jamming of the material compressed
by the piston, regardless of the gravitational environment. The onset of
jamming is found to appear at lower packing fraction in microgravity
($\varphi^{\textrm{$\mu$-g}}_J = 0.567 \pm 0.014$) than on-ground
($\varphi^{\text{gnd}}_J = 0.579 \pm 0.014 $). We interpret these findings as
the manifestation of a granular fabric altered by the gravitational force
field: in absence of a secondary load (due to gravitational acceleration) to
stimulate reorganization in a different direction to the major compression
stress, the particles' configuration becomes stable at lower density, as the
particles have no external drive to promote reorganization into a denser
packing. This is coupled with a change in interparticular force balance which
takes place under low gravity, as cohesive interactions become predominant. We
propose a combination of microscopic and continuum arguments to rationalize our
results.

manifold at small scales in order to hypothesize idealized general relativistic

solutions are remarkably successful in accounting for data, they introduce a
number of puzzles in cosmology, and their foundational assumptions are
therefore important to test. In this paper, we go beyond the usual assumptions
in cosmology and propose a formalism for averaging the local general
relativistic spacetime on an observer's past null cone: we formulate average
properties of light fronts as they propagate from a cosmological emitter to an
observer. The energy-momentum tensor is composed of an irrotational dust source
and a cosmological constant -- the same components as in the $\Lambda$CDM model
for late cosmic times -- but the metric solution is not \emph{a
priori}constrained to be locally homogeneous or isotropic. This generally makes
the large-scale dynamics depart from that of a simple Friedmann--Lema\^\i
tre--Robertson--Walker solution through \emph{backreaction} effects. Our
formalism quantifies such departures through a fully covariant system of
area-averaged equations on the light fronts propagating towards an observer,
which can be directly applied to analytical and numerical investigations of
cosmic observables. For this purpose, we formulate light front averages of
observable quantities, including the effective angular diameter distance and
the cosmological redshift drift and we also discuss the backreaction effects
for these observables.

energy-momentum vectors defined on $M$. Such a tensor is compared with
different ones obtained by using a Lagrangian approach. The notion of
divergence is revised from a geometric viewpoint and, then, the conservation
laws of $T$ for each observer field are revisited. We introduce a natural {\em

the volume element and the non-linear connection associated with $L$ alone. The
computation of this divergence selects the Chern anisotropic connection, thus
giving a geometric interpretation to previous choices in the literature.

classical hydrodynamic closure of kinetic theory. This approach allows to
obtain simplified models in which the competence and learning of the agents

considered,including deception attacks, accidental faults and link failures. We
characterize the adverse impact of misbehaving nodes in a distributed manner
via two-hop communication information and develop a deterministic
detection-compensation-based consensus (D-DCC) algorithm with a decaying
fault-tolerant error bound. Considering scenarios where information sets are
intermittently available due to link failures, a stochastic extension named
stochastic detection-compensation-based consensus(S-DCC) algorithm is proposed.
We prove that D-DCC and S-DCC allow nodes to asymptotically achieve resilient

Wasserstein distance is introduced to analyze the accuracy ofS-DCC. Finally,
extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed

the isotopic differences between the Earth and Mars may be readily accounted

increasing depth of neural networks. This work explores whether extending
neural network depth may be beneficial in a life-long learning setting.
  Methods: We propose a novel approach based on adding new layers on top of
existing ones to enable the forward transfer of knowledge and adapting
previously learned representations. We employ a method of determining the most
similar tasks for selecting the best location in our network to add new nodes
with trainable parameters. This approach allows for creating a tree-like model,
where each node is a set of neural network parameters dedicated to a specific
task. The Progressive Neural Network concept inspires the proposed method.
Therefore, it benefits from dynamic changes in network structure. However,
Progressive Neural Network allocates a lot of memory for the whole network
structure during the learning process. The proposed method alleviates this by
adding only part of a network for a new task and utilizing a subset of
previously trained weights. At the same time, we may retain the benefit of PNN,
such as no forgetting guaranteed by design, without needing a memory buffer.
  Results: Experiments on Split CIFAR and Split Tiny ImageNet show that the
proposed algorithm is on par with other continual learning methods. In a more
challenging setup with a single computer vision dataset as a separate task, our
method outperforms Experience Replay.
  Conclusion: It is compatible with commonly used computer vision architectures
and does not require a custom network structure. As an adaptation to changing
data distribution is made by expanding the architecture, there is no need to
utilize a rehearsal buffer. For this reason, our method could be used for
sensitive applications where data privacy must be considered.

charging costs due to peak-demand charges. This paper proposes a novel charging
algorithm which exploits typically long plugin sessions for domestic chargers
and reduces the overall charging power by boost charging the EV for a short
duration, followed by low-power charging for the rest of the plugin session.
The optimal parameters for boost and low-power charging phases are obtained
using reinforcement learning by training on EV's past charging sessions.
Compared to some prior work, the proposed algorithm does not attempt to predict
the plugin session duration, which can be difficult to accurately predict in
practice due to the nature of human behavior, as shown in the analysis.
Instead, the charging parameters are controlled directly and are adapted
transparently to the user's charging behavior over time. The performance
evaluation on a UK dataset of 3.1 million charging sessions from 22,731
domestic charge stations, demonstrates that the proposed algorithm results in
31% of aggregate peak reduction. The experiments also demonstrate the impact of
history size on learning behavior and conclude with a case study by applying
the algorithm to a specific charge point.

(visual relationship) acts as a bridge between computer vision and natural
language processing. Existing models on the scene graph generation task
notoriously require tens or hundreds of labeled samples. By contrast, human
beings can learn visual relationships from a few or even one example. Inspired
by this, we design a task named One-Shot Scene Graph Generation, where each
relationship triplet (e.g., ""dog-has-head"") comes from only one labeled
example. The key insight is that rather than learning from scratch, one can
utilize rich prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose Multiple Structured
Knowledge (Relational Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge) for the one-shot
scene graph generation task. Specifically, the Relational Knowledge represents
the prior knowledge of relationships between entities extracted from the visual
content, e.g., the visual relationships ""standing in"", ""sitting in"", and ""lying
in"" may exist between ""dog"" and ""yard"", while the Commonsense Knowledge encodes
""sense-making"" knowledge like ""dog can guard yard"". By organizing these two
kinds of knowledge in a graph structure, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are
used to extract knowledge-embedded semantic features of the entities. Besides,
instead of extracting isolated visual features from each entity generated by
Faster R-CNN, we utilize an Instance Relation Transformer encoder to fully
explore their context information. Based on a constructed one-shot dataset, the
experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Ablation studies also verify the
effectiveness of the Instance Relation Transformer encoder and the Multiple
Structured Knowledge.

Existing works have revealed that if the links between objects are given as

this observation, in this article, we propose a relation regularized network
(R2-Net), which can predict whether there is a relationship between two objects

Specifically, we first construct an affinity matrix among detected objects to
represent the probability of a relationship between two objects. Graph
convolution networks (GCNs) over this relation affinity matrix are then used as
object encoders, producing relation-regularized representations of objects.
With these relation-regularized features, our R2-Net can effectively refine
object labels and generate scene graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on
the visual genome dataset for three SGG tasks (i.e., predicate classification,
scene graph classification, and scene graph detection), demonstrating the

  VAR approach",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The Great Recession highlighted the role of financial and uncertainty shocks
as drivers of business cycle fluctuations. However, the fact that uncertainty
shocks may affect economic activity by tightening financial conditions makes
empirically distinguishing these shocks difficult. This paper examines the
macroeconomic effects of the financial and uncertainty shocks in the United
States in an SVAR model that exploits the non-normalities of the time series to
identify the uncertainty and the financial shock. The results show that
macroeconomic uncertainty and financial shocks seem to affect business cycles
independently as well as through dynamic interaction. Uncertainty shocks appear
to tighten financial conditions, whereas there appears to be no causal
relationship between financial conditions and uncertainty. Moreover, the
results suggest that uncertainty shocks may have persistent effects on output
and investment that last beyond the business cycle.

inelastic collisions. To determine how these affect analogue Hawking radiation,
we numerically simulate creation of the latter in a Bose-Einstein Condensate in
the presence of atomic losses. In particular we explore modifications of
density-density correlations through which the radiation has been analyzed so

the modification of the white hole instability pattern.

classified as layered oxides using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The
CoOx films showed a constant decrease in the catalytic activity during cycling,
confirmed by oxygen detection, while that of (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox slightly increased
as measured by electrochemical metrics. These trends were rationalized based on
XAS analysis of the metal oxidation states, which were Co2.8+ and Mn3.7+ near
the surface after cycling. Thus, adding Mn to CoOx successfully stabilized the
catalyst material and its activity during OER cycling. The development of
stabilization approaches is essential to extend the durability of OER

GNSS-provided time and the network time. The challenge lies in having reliably
both accurate and trustworthy network time as the basis for the GNSS attack
detection. Here, we provide a concrete proposal that leverages, together with
the network time servers, the nearly ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
infrastructure. Our framework supports application-layer, secure and robust
real time broadcasting by Wi-Fi Access Points (APs), based on hash chains and
infrequent digital signatures verification to minimize computational and
communication overhead, allowing mobile nodes to efficiently obtain
authenticated and rich time information as they roam. We pair this method with
Network Time Security (NTS), for enhanced resilience through multiple sources,
available, ideally, simultaneously. We analyze the performance of our scheme in
a dedicated setup, gauging the overhead for authenticated time data (Wi-Fi
timestamped beacons and NTS). The results show that it is possible to provide
security for the external to GNSS time sources, with minimal overhead for
authentication and integrity, even when the GNSS-equipped nodes are mobile, and
thus have short interactions with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and possibly
intermittent Internet connectivity, as well as limited resources.

colonoscopy can cause discomfort to patients due to the forces occurring
between colonoscopes and the walls of the colon. Robotic solutions have been
proposed to reduce discomfort, and improve accessibility and image quality.
Aiming at addressing the limitations of traditional and robotic colonoscopy, in
this paper, we present the SoftSCREEN System, a novel Soft Shapeshifting
Capsule Robot for Endoscopy based on Eversion Navigation. A plurality of tracks
surrounds the body of the system. These tracks are driven by a single motor
paired with a worm gear and evert from the internal rigid chassis, enabling
fullbody track-based navigation. Two inflatable toroidal chambers enclosing
this rigid chassis and passing through the tracks, cause them to displace when
inflated. This displacement can be used to regulate the contact with the
surrounding wall, thus enabling traction control and adjustment of the overall
system diameter to match the local lumen size. The design of the first tethered
prototype at 2:1 scale of the SoftSCREEN system is presented in this work. The
experimental results show efficient navigation capabilities for different lumen
diameters and curvatures, paving the way for a novel robot capable of robust
navigation and reliable control of the imaging, with potential for applications

properties of neural network architectures, inspired by the functional

the GW source parameters could be measured with much better accuracy. In this

aLIGO and ET by comparing the measurement errors. We apply the TaylorF2
waveform model defined in the frequency domain to the Fisher matrix method
which is a semi-analytic approach for estimating GW parameter measurement
errors. We adopt as our sources low-mass binary black holes with the total
masses of $M\leq 16 M_{\odot} $ and the effective spins of $-0.9 \leq \chi_{\rm

parameters using $10^4$ Monte-Carlo samples randomly distributed in our mass

$\sim 14$ times better signal-to-noise ratio than aLIGO and the error ratios
($\sigma_{\lambda, \rm ET}/\sigma_{\lambda, \rm aLIGO}$) for the chirp-mass,
symmetric mass ratio, and effective spin parameters can be lower than $7\%$ for
all binaries. We also consider the equal-mass binary neutron stars with the

the measurement error of the tidal deformability $\tilde{\Lambda}$ can also be
significantly reduced by ET, with the error ratio of $3.6 - 6.1 \%$.

function $Q$, as a core part of optimization and learning algorithms. Our
algorithms are designed for the cluster-based model, which combines
message-passing and shared-memory communication layers. Processes may fail by
crashing, and the algorithm inside each cluster is wait-free, using only reads
and writes.
  For a strongly convex function $Q$, our algorithm tolerates any number of
failures, and provides convergence rate that yields the maximal distributed
acceleration over the optimal convergence rate of sequential SGD.
  For arbitrary functions, the convergence rate has an additional term that
depends on the maximal difference between the parameters at the same iteration.
(This holds under standard assumptions on $Q$.) In this case, the algorithm
obtains the same convergence rate as sequential SGD, up to a logarithmic
factor. This is achieved by using, at each iteration, a multidimensional
approximate agreement algorithm, tailored for the cluster-based model.
  The algorithm for arbitrary functions requires that at least a majority of
the clusters contain at least one nonfaulty process. We prove that this
condition is necessary when optimizing some non-convex functions.

motion in terms of input parameters, namely energy ($E$), angular momentum
($\lambda$), spin ($a_{\rm k}$) and deformation parameter ($\varepsilon$),
respectively. We find that global transonic accretion solutions continue to
exist in non-Kerr spacetime. Depending on the input parameters, accretion flow
is seen to experience shock transition and we find that shocked induced
accretion solutions are available for a wide range of the parameter space in
$\lambda-E$ plane. We examine the modification of the shock parameter space
with $\varepsilon$, and find that as $\varepsilon$ is increased, the effective
region of the parameter space is reduced, and gradually shifted towards the
higher $\lambda$ and lower $E$ domain. In addition, for the first time in the
literature, we notice that accretion flow having zero angular momentum admits
shock transition when spacetime deformation is significantly large.
Interestingly, beyond a critical limit of $\varepsilon^{\rm max}$, the nature
of the central object alters from black hole (BH) to naked singularity (NS) and
we identify $\varepsilon^{\rm max}$ as function of $a_{\rm k}$. Further, we
examine the accretion solutions and its properties around the naked singularity
as well. Finally, we indicate the implications of the present formalism in the
context of astrophysical applications.

crucial information on their emission models. In the past, several missions
have shown evidence of polarized emission from the Crab. The significance of
these measurements remains however limited. New measurements are therefore
required. POLAR is a wide Field of View Compton-scattering polarimeter
(sensitive in 50-500 keV) onboard the Chinese spacelab Tiangong-2 which took
data from September 2016 to April 2017. Although not designed to perform
polarization measurements of pulsars, we present here a novel method which can
be applied to POLAR as well as that of other wide Field of View polarimeters.
The novel polarimetric joint-fitting method for the Crab pulsar observations
with POLAR, allows us to obtain constraining measurements of the pulsar
component. The best fitted values and corresponding 1$\sigma$ deviations for
the averaged phase interval: (PD=$14\substack{+15 \\ -10}$\%,
PA=$108\substack{+33 \\ -54} ^{\circ}$), for Peak 1: (PD=$17\substack{+18 \\
-12}$\%, PA=$174\substack{+39 \\ -36} ^{\circ}$) and for Peak 2:
(PD=$16\substack{+16 \\ -11}$\%, PA=$78\substack{+39 \\ -30} ^{\circ}$).
Further more, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the polarization degree are for the
averaged phase interval (55\%), Peak 1 (66\%) and Peak 2 (57\%). Finally, to
illustrate the capabilities of this method in the future, we simulated two
years observation to the Crab pulsar with POLAR-2. The results show that
POLAR-2 is able to confirm the emission to be polarized with $5\sigma$ and
$4\sigma$ confidence level if the Crab pulsar is polarized at $20\%$ and $10\%$
respectively.

assigns flow to paths where an arc failure or delay affects a whole path. We
provide a unifying framework by presenting novel general models, in which we
assign flow to subpaths. These models contain the known models as special cases

a centralized system to adjust their poses automatically and collaboratively so

each camera only receives partial information from its observation, which may
mislead cameras to take locally optimal action. Besides, the global goal, i.e.,
maximum coverage of objects, is hard to be directly optimized. To address the
above issues, we propose a coordinate-aligned multi-camera collaboration system
for AMOT. In our approach, we regard each camera as an agent and address AMOT
with a multi-agent reinforcement learning solution. To represent the
observation of each agent, we first identify the targets in the camera view
with an image detector, and then align the coordinates of the targets in 3D

as well as four individual reward terms. The action policy of the agents is
derived with a value-based Q-network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the

we build a virtual yet credible 3D environment, named ""Soccer Court"", to mimic

the imbalance in the covariates with respect to different treatment options,
caused by treatment selection bias. To address this issue, recent literature
has explored domain-invariant representation learning based on different domain
divergence metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy,
position-dependent metric, and domain overlap). In this paper, we reveal the
weaknesses of these strategies, i.e., they lead to the loss of predictive
information when enforcing the domain invariance; and the treatment effect
estimation performance is unstable, which heavily relies on the characteristics
of the domain distributions and the choice of domain divergence metrics.
Motivated by information theory, we propose to learn the Infomax and
Domain-Independent Representations to solve the above puzzles. Our method
utilizes the mutual information between the global feature representations and
individual feature representations, and the mutual information between feature
representations and treatment assignment predictions, in order to maximally
capture the common predictive information for both treatment and control
groups. Moreover, our method filters out the influence of instrumental and
irrelevant variables, and thus it effectively increases the predictive ability
of potential outcomes. Experimental results on both the synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on causal effect inference. Moreover, our method exhibits reliable prediction
performances when facing data with different characteristics of data
distributions, complicated variable types, and severe covariate imbalance.

case in the ultrarelativistic limit for the initial atomic state
$\theta\in(0,\frac{\pi}{2})\cup(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$, then equals to the
circular acceleration case in a certain acceleration, and finally, is larger
than the circular acceleration case. The spontaneous transition rates show a
similar feature. This result is different from the case of a bath of
fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields that has been studied. Considering
the initial atomic state $\theta \in(0,\pi)$, we find that the geometric phase
acquired purely due to linear acceleration always equals to the circular
acceleration case for the certain acceleration. The feature implies that, in a
certain condition, one can simulate the case of the uniformly accelerated
two-level atom by studying the properties of the two-level atom in circular
motion. Adding a reflecting boundary, we observe that a larger value of a
geometric phase can be obtained compared to the absence of a boundary. Besides,
the geometric phase fluctuates along $z$, and the maximum of geometric phase is
closer to the boundary for a larger acceleration. We also find that geometric
phases can be acquired purely due to the linear acceleration case and circular

information. In this context, we first overview the relevant literature about
Quantum Internet protocol stack. Then, stemming from this, we sheds the light
on the open problems and required efforts toward the design of an effective and
complete Quantum Internet protocol stack. To the best of authors' knowledge, a
survey of this type is the first of its own. What emerges from this analysis is
that the Quantum Internet, though still in its infancy, is a disruptive
technology whose design requires an inter-disciplinary effort at the border
between quantum physics, computer and telecommunications engineering.

crack propagation through heterogeneous structures, as e.g. metallic

of the proposed algorithm is to combine the advantages of the Finite Cell
Method allowing for a convenient integration of heterogeneous finite element
problems with the eigenerosion approach to still enable the mesh-independent
simulation of crack propagation. The major component is to switch from finite
subcells to finite elements wherever the crack progresses, thereby
automatically adaptively refining at the crack tip by managing the newly
appearing nodes as hanging nodes. Technically relevant problems of crack
propagation at the microscale are mostly linked with sub-critical crack growth
where the crack moves fast and stepwise with subsequent load cycles. Therefore,
inertia may become important which is why dynamics are taken into account by
spreading the mass of the eroded elements to the nodes to avoid a loss in mass
resulting from the erosion procedure. Furthermore, a certain treatment for the
finite cell decomposition is considered in order to ensure efficiency and
accuracy. The numerical framework as well as the voxel decomposition techniques

objects because of the confinement of the vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations
occurring even at zero temperature. Their generalization at finite temperature
and in material media are referred to as Casimir--Lifshitz forces. These forces
are typically attractive, leading to the widespread problem of stiction between
the metallic parts of micro- and nanodevices. Recently, repulsive Casimir
forces have been experimentally realized but their reliance on specialized
materials prevents their dynamic control and thus limits their further
applicability. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that repulsive critical
Casimir forces, which emerge in a critical binary liquid mixture upon
approaching the critical temperature, can be used to actively control
microscopic and nanoscopic objects with nanometer precision. We demonstrate
this by using critical Casimir forces to prevent the stiction caused by the
Casimir--Lifshitz forces. We study a microscopic gold flake above a flat
gold-coated substrate immersed in a critical mixture. Far from the critical
temperature, stiction occurs because of dominant Casimir--Lifshitz forces. Upon
approaching the critical temperature, however, we observe the emergence of
repulsive critical Casimir forces that are sufficiently strong to counteract
stiction. This experimental demonstration can accelerate the development of
micro- and nanodevices by preventing stiction as well as providing active
control and precise tunability of the forces acting between their constituent
parts.

Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) system has attracted growing interests in recent
years. In this work, we provide an optimal rate convergence analysis and error
estimate for finite difference schemes based on the Slotboom reformulation.
Different options of mobility average at the staggered mesh points are
considered in the finite-difference spatial discretization, such as the
harmonic mean, geometric mean, arithmetic mean, and entropic mean. A
semi-implicit temporal discretization is applied, which in turn results in a
non-constant coefficient, positive-definite linear system at each time step. A
higher order asymptotic expansion is applied in the consistency analysis, and
such a higher order consistency estimate is necessary to control the discrete
maximum norm of the concentration variables. In convergence estimate, the
harmonic mean for the mobility average, which turns out to bring lots of
convenience in the theoretical analysis, is taken for simplicity, while other
options of mobility average would also lead to the desired error estimate, with
more technical details involved. As a result, an optimal rate convergence
analysis on concentrations, electric potential, and ionic fluxes is derived,
which is the first such results for the structure-preserving numerical schemes
based on the Slotboom reformulation. It is remarked that the convergence
analysis leads to a theoretical justification of the conditional energy
dissipation analysis, which relies on the maximum norm bounds of the
concentration and the gradient of the electric potential. Some numerical
results are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and structure-preserving
performance of the associated schemes.

recent years many examples of SiC photonic platforms have been shown, like
photonic crystal cavities, film-on-insulator waveguides and micro-ring
resonators. However, all these examples rely on separating thin films of SiC
from substrate wafers. This introduces significant surface roughness, strain

tuning optical properties via charge carrier concentration. We fabricated
monolithic SiC n-i-n and p-i-n junctions where the intrinsic layer acts as
waveguide core, and demonstrate the waveguide functionality for these samples.
The propagation losses are below 14 dB/cm. These waveguide types allow for
addressing color-centers over a broad wavelength range with low strain-induced

scheme for the generation of multi-bit random numbers using path-entangled
single photons. Without losing their intrinsic randomness, the protocol allows
us to engineer the distribution from which we sample random numbers. For the
experimental demonstration, we use single photons generated using spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC), and assign a multi-bit commitment along the
path. One-bit and two-bit random numbers are then generated from measuring
entangled states in the path basis. In addition to passing the NIST tests for
randomness, we also demonstrate the certification of quantumness and
self-certification of quantum random number generator (QRNG) using Clauser,
Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality violation. The path-entangled states
can generate higher bitrates compared to heralded single photon or entangled
photon schemes which are limited by the coincidence counts. The scheme involves
distribution of photons along multiple paths resulting in multiple bits from
one photon and avoids the limitation imposed by the detection dead time of one
detector. We demonstrate this by generating a high rate of about 80 Mbps when
the single photon detector saturates at around 28 Mcps.

ELBO (MISELBO), a \textit{versatile} yet \textit{simple} framework. MISELBO is
applicable in both amortized and classical VI, and it uses ensembles, e.g.,
deep ensembles, of independently inferred variational approximations. As far as
we are aware, the concept of deep ensembles in amortized VI has not previously
been established. We prove that MISELBO provides a tighter bound than the
average of standard ELBOs, and demonstrate empirically that it gives tighter
bounds than the average of IWELBOs. MISELBO is evaluated in density-estimation
experiments that include MNIST and several real-data phylogenetic tree
inference problems. First, on the MNIST dataset, MISELBO boosts the
density-estimation performances of a state-of-the-art model, nouveau VAE.
Second, in the phylogenetic tree inference setting, our framework enhances a
state-of-the-art VI algorithm that uses normalizing flows. On top of the
technical benefits of MISELBO, it allows to unveil connections between VI and
recent advances in the importance sampling literature, paving the way for
further methodological advances. We provide our code at

epidemic would squash ""the anti-vaccine movement"". However, when vaccines
started arriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine
hesitancy might be an issue even in the context of this major epidemic. Does it
mean that the mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one
of the main causes of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this
paper, we wish to contribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the
COVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause
reticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to
influence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates
over the COVID-19 vaccine on the French Twittosphere, during two first years of
the pandemic, with a particular attention to the spreading capacity of
vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did
vaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the
central actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debates over vaccines
experienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share of
vaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited
number of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing
the community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the
mesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing
the major communities of users. We analyze their role in the information
ecosystem: the largest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior
collecting all the vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it
inside the community. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to
vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.

machine type communications (MTC) devices pose critical challenges over MTC
network in recent years. It is imperative to support massive MTC devices with
limited resources. To this end, Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based
random access network has been deemed as a prospective candidate for MTC
network. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based
approach for NOMA-based random access network with truncated channel inversion
power control. Specifically, each MTC device randomly selects a pre-defined
power level with a certain probability for data transmission. Devices are using
channel inversion power control yet subject to the upper bound of the
transmission power. Due to the stochastic feature of the channel fading and the
limited transmission power, devices with different achievable power levels have
been categorized as different types of devices. In order to achieve high
throughput with considering the fairness between all devices, two objective
functions are formulated. One is to maximize the minimum long-term expected
throughput of all MTC devices, the other is to maximize the geometric mean of
the long-term expected throughput for all MTC devices. A Policy based deep
reinforcement learning approach is further applied to tune the transmission
probabilities of each device to solve the formulated optimization problems.
Extensive simulations are conducted to show the merits of our proposed
approach.

condensate (GC) matrix element, which is analogous to implementations of
short-distance heavy-quark mass renormalization schemes existing in the
literature already for a long time. Because the scheme is based on a
perturbative subtraction at the level of the matrix element, with a freely
adaptable infrared factorization scale, it can be implemented with little
effort for any observable where the GC is relevant. The scheme depends on the
renormalon norm of the GC which has to be supplemented independently. We apply
the scheme to the fixed-order (FOPT) and contour-improved (CIPT) perturbative
expansions of $\tau$ hadronic spectral function moments. These expansions
exhibit a long-standing discrepancy for moments used in high-precision
determinations of the strong coupling in the commonly used GC scheme that is
not renormalon-free. We show that the scheme is capable of resolving the
FOPT-CIPT discrepancy problem. At the same time, the perturbative behaviour of
the moments that previously showed bad convergence properties and for which the
non-perturbative corrections from the GC are sizeable, is substantially
improved. The new GC scheme may provide a powerful theoretical tool for future
phenomenological applications.

form allows to build the weight functions, $G_i(\gamma,z)$, for the Nakanishi

the decomposition of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude in terms of Dirac operators,
Such scalar amplitudes can also be used to obtain the pion valence light-front

(2021) represents magnetic
reconnection in a braided field, thus clearly identifying the
reconnection-driven nanoflares. Due to their small scale (500 km in widths,
1500 km in lengths) and short timescales ($<$ 15 s), it is unclear how
pervasive nanojets are in the solar corona. In this paper, we present IRIS and
SDO observations of nanojets found in multiple coronal structures, namely in a
coronal loop powered by a blowout jet, and in two other coronal loops with
coronal rain. In agreement with previous findings, we observe that nanojets are
accompanied by small nanoflare-like intensity bursts in the (E)UV, have
velocities of 150-250 km s$^{-1}$ and occur transversely to the field line of
origin, which is sometimes observed to split. However, we find a variety of
nanojet directions in the plane transverse to the loop axis. These nanojets are
found to have kinetic and thermal energies within the nanoflare range, and
often occur in clusters. In the blowout jet case study, the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI) is directly identified as the reconnection driver. For the
other two loops, we find that both, the KHI and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
(RTI) are likely to be the drivers. However, we find that the KHI and RTI are
each more likely in one of the other two cases. These observations of nanojets
in a variety of structures and environments support nanojets being a general
result of reconnection, that are driven here by dynamic instabilities.

linear programming solvers with the goal of selecting a subset of generated
cuts that induce optimal solver performance. These solvers have millions of

Cut selection scoring rules are usually weighted sums of different
measurements, where the weights are parameters. We present a parametric family
of mixed-integer linear programs together with infinitely many family-wide
valid cuts. Some of these cuts can induce integer optimal solutions directly
after being applied, while others fail to do so even if an infinite amount are

of the parameter space will always miss all parameter values, which select
integer optimal inducing cuts in an infinite amount of our problems. We propose
a variation on the design of existing graph convolutional neural networks,
adapting them to learn cut selection rule parameters. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for selecting cuts, and train our design using
said framework over MIPLIB 2017 and a neural network verification data set. Our

to an outcome-dependent payment scheme (called contract) so as to incentivize
the agent to take a costly, unobservable action leading to favorable outcomes.
In particular, we focus on Bayesian settings where the agent has private
information. This is collectively encoded by the agent's type, which is unknown
to the principal, but randomly drawn according to a finitely-supported,
commonly-known probability distribution. In Bayesian principal-agent problems,
the principal may be better off by committing to a menu of contracts specifying
a contract for each agent's type, rather than committing to a single contract.
This induces a two-stage process that resembles interactions studied in
classical mechanism design: after the principal has committed to a menu, the
agent first reports a type to the principal, and, then, the latter puts in
place the contract in the menu that corresponds to the reported type. Thus, the
principal's computational problem boils down to designing a menu of contracts
that incentivizes the agent to report their true type and maximizes expected
utility. Previous works showed that computing an optimal menu of contracts is
APX-hard. Crucially, previous works focus on menus of deterministic contracts.
Surprisingly, we show that, if one considers menus of randomized contracts
defined as probability distributions over payment vectors, then an
""almost-optimal"" menu can be computed in polynomial time. Indeed, the problem
of computing a principal-optimal menu of randomized contracts may not admit a
maximum, but only a supremum. Nevertheless, we show how to design a
polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees the principal with an expected
utility arbitrarily close to the supremum. Besides this main result, we also
close several gaps in the analysis of menus of deterministic contracts.

consist of $O(\log(n))$ qubits. We give a general framework for implementing
quantum query algorithms in Quantum CONGEST, using the concept of
parallel-queries. We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries in two
settings: when data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical
problems where the network defines the input. The first is slightly unusual in
CONGEST but our results follow almost directly. The second is more traditional
for the CONGEST model but here we require some classical CONGEST steps to get
our results.
  In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can schedule a
meeting in one of $k$ dates using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{kD}+D)$ rounds, with $D$ the
network diameter. We also give an algorithm for element distinctness: if all
nodes together hold a list of $k$ numbers, they can find a duplicate in $\tilde
O(k^{2/3}D^{1/3}+D)$ rounds. We also generalize the protocol for the
distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting considered in
[arXiv:quant-ph/9802040] to general networks, giving a novel separation between
exact classical and exact quantum protocols in CONGEST.
  When the input is the network structure itself, we almost directly recover
the $O(\sqrt{nD})$ round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez

the problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a

Methods: In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to enhance abnormal
chest x-ray (CXR) identification performance through segmentations. Our
approach is designed in a cascaded manner and incorporates two modules: a deep
neural network with criss-cross attention modules (XLSor) for localizing lung
region in CXR images and a CXR classification model with a backbone of a
self-supervised momentum contrast (MoCo) model pre-trained on large-scale CXR
data sets. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on Shenzhen Hospital (SH) data
set for the segmentation module, and COVIDx data set for both segmentation and
classification modules. Novel statistical analysis is conducted in addition to
regular evaluation metrics for the segmentation module. Furthermore, the
results of the optimized approach are analyzed with gradient-weighted class
activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to investigate the rationale behind the
classification decisions and to interpret its choices. Results and Conclusion:
Different data sets, methods, and scenarios for each module of the proposed
pipeline are examined for designing an optimized approach, which has achieved
an accuracy of 0.946 in distinguishing abnormal CXR images (i.e., Pneumonia and
COVID-19) from normal ones. Numerical and visual validations suggest that
applying automated segmentation as a pre-processing step for classification

reproduce these artifacts and perform meta-learning across them. We store
context from multiple stages of the AI development lifecycle including
datasets, pipelines, how each is configured, and training runs with information
about their runtime environment. The standardized nature of the stored metadata
allows for querying and aggregation, especially in terms of ranking artifacts
by performance metrics. We exhibit the capabilities of the LDE by reproducing
an existing meta-learning study and storing the reproduced metadata in our
system. Then, we perform two experiments on this metadata: 1) examining the
reproducibility and variability of the performance metrics and 2) implementing
a number of meta-learning algorithms on top of the data and examining how
variability in experimental results impacts recommendation performance. The
experimental results suggest significant variation in performance, especially
depending on dataset configurations; this variation carries over when
meta-learning is built on top of the results, with performance improving when
using aggregated results. This suggests that a system that automatically
collects and aggregates results such as the LDE not only assists in
implementing meta-learning but may also improve its performance.

Once a payment schedule has been defined, where we assume that a bank cannot
refuse a payment towards one of its lenders if it has sufficient funds, the
liquidity of the system is defined as the sum of total payments made in the
network. Maximizing systemic liquidity is a natural objective of any financial
authority, so, we study the setting where the financial authority offers
bailout money to some bank(s) or forgives the debts of others in order to
maximize liquidity, and examine efficient ways to achieve this. We investigate
the approximation ratio provided by the greedy bailout policy compared to the
optimal one, and we study the computational hardness of finding the optimal
debt-removal and budget-constrained optimal bailout policy, respectively.
  We also study financial systems from a game-theoretic standpoint. We observe
that the removal of some incoming debt might be in the best interest of a bank,
if that helps one of its borrowers remain solvent and avoid costs related to
default. Assuming that a bank's well-being (i.e., utility) is aligned with the
incoming payments they receive from the network, we define and analyze a game

60^{\circ}$) in the two-point angular temperature correlations of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation, measured by WMAP and Planck, stands in
sharp contrast to the prediction of standard inflationary cosmology, in which
the correlations should extend across the full sky (i.e., $180^{\circ}$). The
introduction of a hard lower cutoff ($k_{min}$) in the primordial power
spectrum, however, leads naturally to the existence of $\theta_{max}$. Among
other cosmological anomalies detected in these data, an apparent dominance of
odd-over-even parity multipoles has been seen in the angular power spectrum of
the CMB. This feature, however, may simply be due to observational
contamination in certain regions of the sky.
  Aims. In attempting to provide a more detailed assessment of whether this
odd-over-even asymmetry is intrinsic to the CMB, we therefore proceed in this
paper, first, to examine whether this odd-even parity imbalance also manifests
itself in the angular correlation function and, second, to examine in detail
the interplay between the presence of $\theta_{max}$ and this observed anomaly.
  Methods. We employed several parity statistics and recalculated the angular
correlation function for different values of the cutoff $k_{min}$ in order to
optimize the fit to the different Planck 2018 data.
  Results. We find a phenomenological connection between these features in the
data, concluding that both must be considered together in order to optimize the
theoretical fit to the Planck 2018 data.
  Conclusions. This outcome is independent of whether the parity imbalance is
intrinsic to the CMB, but if it is, the odd-over-even asymmetry would clearly
point to the emergence of new physics.

cyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care.
Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of
performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through
computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a
communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system
parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g.,
inputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer
opportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a
challenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of
trial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and
resource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that
reduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining
model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference
orchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal
orchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate
the RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings. We
demonstrate efficacy of our HL strategy through experimental comparison with
state-of-the-art RL-based inference orchestration, demonstrating that our HL
strategy accelerates the learning process by up to 166.6x.

  Two-Dimensional Fluids Using Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.CV physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the super-resolution (SR) of velocity fields in
two-dimensional fluids from the viewpoint of rotational equivariance. SR refers
to techniques that estimate high-resolution images from those in low resolution
and has lately been applied in fluid mechanics. The rotational equivariance of
SR models is defined as the property in which the super-resolved velocity field
is rotated according to a rotation of the input, which leads to the inference
covariant to the orientation of fluid systems. Generally, the covariance in
physics is related to symmetries. To clarify a relationship to symmetries, the
rotational consistency of datasets for SR is newly introduced as the invariance
of pairs of low- and high-resolution velocity fields with respect to rotation.
This consistency is sufficient and necessary for SR models to acquire
rotational equivariance from large datasets with supervised learning. Such a
large dataset is not required when rotational equivariance is imposed on SR
models through weight sharing of convolution kernels as prior knowledge. Even
if a fluid system has rotational symmetry, this symmetry may not carry over to
a velocity dataset, which is not rotationally consistent. This inconsistency
can occur when the rotation does not commute with the generation of
low-resolution velocity fields. These theoretical suggestions are supported by
the results from numerical experiments, where two existing convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) are converted into rotationally equivariant CNNs and the
inferences of the four CNNs are compared after the supervised training.

aggregating model parameters updated independently on edge devices without
accessing users' private data. However, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks
where a small fraction of malicious agents inject a targeted misclassification
behavior in the global model by uploading polluted model updates to the server.
In this work, we propose DifFense, an automated defense framework to protect an
FL system from backdoor attacks by leveraging differential testing and two-step
MAD outlier detection, without requiring any previous knowledge of attack
scenarios or direct access to local model parameters. We empirically show that
our detection method prevents a various number of potential attackers while
consistently achieving the convergence of the global model comparable to that
trained under federated averaging (FedAvg). We further corroborate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our method against prior defense
techniques, such as Multi-Krum and coordinate-wise median aggregation. Our
detection method reduces the average backdoor accuracy of the global model to
below 4% and achieves a false negative rate of zero.

gene transcription and translation, have been shown to play an important role
in cellular dynamics. Time delays, motivated by the gene expression process,
can also greatly affect the behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems. In this
dissertation, we explore their effects on Turing pattern mechanisms. By
incorporating time delays, modelled as both a fixed parameter and as a
continuous distribution, into classical reaction-diffusion systems that exhibit
Turing instabilities, we investigate the changing behaviour of these systems.
We find that an introduction of increasing time delay increases the time taken
for spatially inhomogeneous patterns to stabilise, and the two are related
linearly. We also present results to show, through a linear stability analysis,
that an increasing time delay can act both to expand or shrink the Turing space
of a certain reaction-diffusion mechanism, depending on the placement of
time-delayed terms. Significantly, we find that modelling time delays as a
continuous distribution has a negligible impact on qualitative or quantitative
aspects of the results seen compared with a fixed time delay of the mean of the
distribution. These findings serve to highlight the importance of considering
gene expression time delays when modelling biological patterning events, as
well as requiring a complete understanding of the cellular dynamics before
attempting to apply Turing mechanisms to explain biological phenomena. The
results also suggest, at least for the distributions considered in this
dissertation, that fixed delay and distributed delay models have almost
identical dynamics. This allows one to use simpler fixed delay models rather
than the more complicated distributed delay variants.

predict the ground truth occupation of given candidates with and without the
help of three different NLP classifiers (random, bag-of-words, and deep neural

significantly improve human performance in a hybrid setting, some models
mitigate hybrid bias while others accentuate it. We examine these findings

choices have an impact on human-AI conformity and bias, motivating the explicit

  Wearables","updated",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergence of self-supervised learning in the field of wearables-based
human activity recognition (HAR) has opened up opportunities to tackle the most
pressing challenges in the field, namely to exploit unlabeled data to derive
reliable recognition systems for scenarios where only small amounts of labeled
training samples can be collected. As such, self-supervision, i.e., the
paradigm of 'pretrain-then-finetune' has the potential to become a strong
alternative to the predominant end-to-end training approaches, let alone
hand-crafted features for the classic activity recognition chain. Recently a
number of contributions have been made that introduced self-supervised learning
into the field of HAR, including, Multi-task self-supervision, Masked
Reconstruction, CPC, and SimCLR, to name but a few. With the initial success of
these methods, the time has come for a systematic inventory and analysis of the
potential self-supervised learning has for the field. This paper provides
exactly that. We assess the progress of self-supervised HAR research by
introducing a framework that performs a multi-faceted exploration of model
performance. We organize the framework into three dimensions, each containing
three constituent criteria, such that each dimension captures specific aspects
of performance, including the robustness to differing source and target
conditions, the influence of dataset characteristics, and the feature space
characteristics. We utilize this framework to assess seven state-of-the-art
self-supervised methods for HAR, leading to the formulation of insights into
the properties of these techniques and to establish their value towards
learning representations for diverse scenarios.

connectionist temporal classification (CTC) have achieved impressive results,
especially when fine-tuned from wav2vec2.0 models. Due to the conditional
independence assumption, CTC-based models are always weaker than
attention-based encoder-decoder models and require the assistance of external
language models (LMs). To solve this issue, we propose two knowledge
transferring methods that leverage pre-trained LMs, such as BERT and GPT2, to
improve CTC-based models. The first method is based on representation learning,
in which the CTC-based models use the representation produced by BERT as an
auxiliary learning target. The second method is based on joint classification
learning, which combines GPT2 for text modeling with a hybrid CTC/attention
architecture. Experiment on AISHELL-1 corpus yields a character error rate
(CER) of 4.2% on the test set. When compared to the vanilla CTC-based models
fine-tuned from the wav2vec2.0 models, our knowledge transferring method
reduces CER by 16.1% relatively without external LMs.

There has been an increasing interest in Korean speech recognition, but not
many studies have been focused on the decoding procedure. In this paper, we

for external LM as the ASR model, we show that it may not be the best choice
for Korean. We propose a new tokenization method that inserts a special token,
SkipTC, when there is no trailing consonant in a Korean syllable. By utilizing
the proposed SkipTC token, the input sequence for LM becomes very regularly
patterned so that the LM can better learn the linguistic characteristics. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a lower word error rate
compared to the same LM model without SkipTC. In addition, we are the first to
report the ASR performance for the recently introduced large-scale 7,600h

in diffeology, one of the challenges is providing suitable analogous for
submersions, immersions, and \'{e}tale maps (i.e., local diffeomorphisms)
consistent with the classical versions of these maps between manifolds. In this
paper, we consider diffeological submersions, immersions, and \'{e}tale maps as
an adaptation of these maps to diffeology by a nonlinear approach. In the case
of manifolds, there is no difference between the classical and diffeological
versions of these maps. Moreover, we study their diffeological properties from
different aspects in a systematic fashion with respect to the germs of plots.
We also discuss notions of embeddings of diffeological spaces and regard
diffeological embeddings similar to those of manifolds. In particular, we show
that diffeological embeddings are inductions.
  In order to characterize the considered maps from their linear behaviors, we
introduce a class of diffeological spaces, so-called diffeological \'etale
manifolds, which not only contains the usual manifolds but also includes
irrational tori. We state and prove versions of the rank and implicit function
theorems, as well as the fundamental theorem on flows in this class. As an
application, we use the results of this work to facilitate the computations of
the internal tangent spaces and diffeological dimensions in a few interesting
cases.

16 common diseases from 3 departments and 70 corresponding common medications.
Furthermore, we propose a Dialogue structure and Disease knowledge aware

dialogue structure and the knowledge graph is used to introduce external
disease knowledge. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is a promising solution to recommend medications with medical

Riemann-Lanczos and Weyl-Lanczos problems have brought our attention on the
importance of revisiting the algebraic structure of the Bianchi identities in
Riemannian geometry. We also discovered in the meantime that, in our first book
of 1978, we had already used a new way for studying the various compatibility
conditions (CC) of an operator that may not be necessarily formally integrable
(FI) in order to construct canonical formally exact differential sequences on
the jet level. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the combination of
these two facts clearly shows the specific importance of the Spencer operator
and the Spencer $\delta$-cohomology, totally absent from mathematical physics
today. The results obtained are unavoidable because they only depend on
elementary combinatorics and diagram chasing. They also provide for the first
time the purely intrinsic interpretation of the respective numbers of
successive first, second, third and higher order generating CC. However, if
they of course agree with the linearized Killing operator over the Minkowski
metric, they largely disagree with recent publications on the respective
numbers of generating CC for the linearized Killing operator over the
Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics. Many similar examples are illustrating these
new techniques, providing in particular the only symbol existing in the
literature which is 2-ayclic witout being of finite type, contrary to the
conformal situation.

enhancements for ultra-dense networks (UDNs). Unfortunately, shrinking cell
coverage and severe penetration loss experienced at higher spectrum render
mobility management a critical issue in UDNs, especially optimizing beam
blockages and frequent handover (HO). Mobility management challenges have
become prevalent in city centres and urban areas. To address this, we propose a
novel mechanism driven by exploiting wireless signals and on-road surveillance
systems to intelligently predict possible blockages in advance and perform
timely HO. This paper employs computer vision (CV) to determine obstacles and
users' location and speed. In addition, this study introduces a new HO event,
called block event {BLK}, defined by the presence of a blocking object and a
user moving towards the blocked area. Moreover, the multivariate regression
technique predicts the remaining time until the user reaches the blocked area,
hence determining best HO decision. Compared to typical wireless networks
without blockage prediction, simulation results show that our BLK detection and
