which enables to temporally interpret traffic scenes. Autonomous vehicles
clearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360{\deg}
panoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic
cameras, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize
satisfactorily to 360{\deg} panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a
novel network framework--PanoFlow, to learn optical flow for panoramic images.
To overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in
panoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA)
method, which contains radial flow distortion (FDA-R) or equirectangular flow
distortion (FDA-E). We further look into the definition and properties of
cyclic optical flow for panoramic videos, and hereby propose a Cyclic Flow
Estimation (CFE) method by leveraging the cyclicity of spherical images to
infer 360{\deg} optical flow and converting large displacement to relatively
small displacement. PanoFlow is applicable to any existing flow estimation
method and benefits from the progress of narrow-FoV flow estimation. In
addition, we create and release a synthetic panoramic dataset FlowScape based
on CARLA to facilitate training and quantitative analysis. PanoFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the public OmniFlowNet and the established
FlowScape benchmarks. Our proposed approach reduces the End-Point-Error (EPE)
on FlowScape by 27.3%. On OmniFlowNet, PanoFlow achieves a 55.5% error
reduction from the best published result. We also qualitatively validate our
method via a collection vehicle and a public real-world OmniPhotos dataset,
indicating strong potential and robustness for real-world navigation
applications. Code and dataset are publicly available at

visuotactile feedback, either based on ultrasound or real interpersonal touch,
boosts the illusion of being affectively touched and embodied in a virtual body
compared to conditions only based on visual feedback. However, real
interpersonal touch led to the strongest behavioral and emotional responses
compared to the other conditions. Moreover, arousal and the desire to withdraw
the caressed hand was highest when being touched by a female avatar compared to

one-manifolds with defects and values in the Boolean semiring and automata and

we associate a topological theory for one-dimensional manifolds with
zero-dimensional defects labelled by letters of the language. This theory takes
values in the Boolean semiring. Universal construction of topological theories
gives rise in this case to a monoidal category of Boolean semilinear
combinations of one-dimensional cobordisms with defects modulo skein relations.
The latter category can be interpreted as a semilinear rigid monoidal closure
of standard structures associated to a regular language, including minimal
deterministic and nondeterministic finite state automata for the language and
the syntactic monoid. The circular language plays the role of a regularizer,
allowing to define the rigid closure of these structures. When the state space

there is a unique associated circular language such that the resulting theory
is a Boolean TQFT.

the action of surface tension. If the film is surrounded by air, the retraction
velocity is known to approach the constant Taylor-Culick velocity. However,
when surrounded by an external viscous medium, the dissipation within that
medium dictates the magnitude of the retraction velocity. In the present work,
we study the retraction of a liquid (water) film in a viscous oil ambient
(\emph{two-phase} Taylor-Culick retractions), and that sandwiched between air
and a viscous oil (\emph{three-phase} Taylor-Culick retractions). In the latter
case, the experimentally-measured retraction velocity is observed to have a
weaker dependence on the viscosity of the oil phase as compared to the
configuration where the water film is surrounded completely by oil. Numerical
simulations indicate that this weaker dependence arises from the localization
of viscous dissipation near the three-phase contact line. The speed of
retraction only depends on the viscosity of the surrounding medium and not on
that of the film. From the experiments and the numerical simulations, we reveal
unprecedented regimes for the scaling of the Weber number $We_f$ of the film
(based on its retraction velocity) or the capillary number $Ca_s$ of the
surroundings vs. the Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ of the surroundings in the regime
of large viscosity of the surroundings ($Oh_s \gg 1$), namely $We_f \sim
Oh_s^{-2}$ and $Ca_s \sim Oh_s^{0}$ for the two-phase Taylor-Culick

query the indexed search engine to retrieve candidate entities. Our approach
complements the traditional approach of using a Wikipedia anchor-text

and distributed ledgers. We propose a new paradigm for designing BFT protocols
called DQBFT that addresses three major performance and scalability challenges
that plague past protocols: (i) high communication costs to reach
geo-distributed agreement, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering
performance, and (iii) performance degradation under varying node and network
conditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus
into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2)
consistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this
by decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the
ordering process.
  Under the new paradigm, we develop a new protocol, Destiny that uses a
combination of three techniques to achieve high performance and scalability:
using a trusted subsystem to decrease consensus's quorum size, using threshold
signatures to attain linear communication costs, reducing client communication.
Our evaluations on 300-replica geo-distributed deployment reveal that DQBFT
protocols achieve significant performance gains over prior art: $\approx$3x
better throughput and $\approx$50\% better latency.

  Based I/O Buffers",,,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Performance and reliability are two prominent factors in the design of data
storage systems. To achieve higher performance, recently storage system
designers use DRAM-based buffers. The volatility of DRAM brings up the
possibility of data loss, so a part of the main storage is conventionally used
as the journal area to be able of recovering unflushed data pages in the case
of power failure. Moreover, periodically flushing buffered data pages to the
main storage is a common mechanism to preserve a high level of reliability,
which leads to an increase in storage write traffic. To address this
shortcoming, recent studies offer a small NVM as the Persistent Journal Area
(PJA) along with DRAM as an efficient approach, named NVM-Backed Buffer
(NVB-Buffer). This approach aims to address DRAM vulnerability against power
failure while reducing storage write traffic. In this paper, we use the most
promising technologies for PJA among the emerging technologies, which is
STT-MRAM to meet the requirements of PJA (high endurance, non-volatility, and
DRAM-like latency). However, STT-MRAM faces major reliability challenges, i.e.
Retention Failure, Read Disturbance, and Write Failure. In this paper, we first
show that retention failure is the dominant source of errors in NVB-Buffers as
it suffers from long and unpredictable page idle intervals. Then, we propose a
novel NVB-Buffer management scheme, named, Cold Page Awakening (CoPA), which
predictably reduces the idle time of PJA pages. To this aim, CoPA employs
Distant Refreshing to periodically overwrite the vulnerable PJA page contents
by using their replica in DRAM-based buffer. We compare CoPA with the
state-of-the-art schemes over several workloads based on physical journaling.
Our evaluations show that employing CoPA leads to three orders of magnitude
lower failure rate with negligible performance degradation (1.1%) and memory
overhead (1.2%).

assessed 311 papers that spanned a decade of research on Information
Architecture. We found 25 papers that utilized Information Architecture in the
context of Human Computer Interaction. Then, we followed a Background Reference

the eligibility of the reference list of all 25 papers and found eight
additional papers that were relevant to our research question. Results of our
review show that, IAinHCI papers fall under seven main categories, from IoT to
the semantic web and ubiquitous technology. The website category, however, was
both the most consistent over the years and the most prevalent category
accounting for 67% of the papers. Our findings suggest that IA has not yet

theory are formulated within a curvilinear coordinate system, which allows the

Kirchhoff-Love theory and the discretization makes use of isogeometric shape
functions. A multiplicative split of the surface deformation gradient is
employed, such that an intermediate surface configuration is introduced. The
surface metric and curvature of this intermediate configuration follow from the
solution of nonlinear evolution laws - ordinary differential equations (ODEs) -
that stem from a generalized viscoelastic solid model. The evolution laws are
integrated numerically with the implicit Euler scheme and linearized within the
Newton-Raphson scheme of the nonlinear finite element framework. The
implementation of membrane and bending viscosity is verified with the help of
analytical solutions and shows ideal convergence behavior. The chosen numerical
examples capture large deformations and typical viscoelasticity behavior, such
as creep, relaxation, and strain rate dependence. It is also shown that the
proposed formulation can be straightforwardly applied to model boundary
viscoelasticity of 3D bodies.

predictive inference for arbitrary machine learning models. Its validity relies
on the assumptions of exchangeability of the data, and symmetry of the given
model fitting algorithm as a function of the data. However, exchangeability is
often violated when predictive models are deployed in practice. For example, if
the data distribution drifts over time, then the data points are no longer
exchangeable; moreover, in such settings, we might want to use a nonsymmetric
algorithm that treats recent observations as more relevant. This paper
generalizes conformal prediction to deal with both aspects: we employ weighted
quantiles to introduce robustness against distribution drift, and design a new
randomization technique to allow for algorithms that do not treat data points
symmetrically. Our new methods are provably robust, with substantially less
loss of coverage when exchangeability is violated due to distribution drift or
other challenging features of real data, while also achieving the same coverage
guarantees as existing conformal prediction methods if the data points are in
fact exchangeable. We demonstrate the practical utility of these new tools with
simulations and real-data experiments on electricity and election forecasting.

velocity technique, in which the Doppler shift of a star due to an orbiting
planet is measured. These measurements are typically performed using
cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs. Unfortunately such spectrographs are
large and expensive and their accurate calibration continues to be challenging.
The aim is to develop a different way to provide a calibration signal. A
commonly used way to introduce a calibration signal is to insert an iodine cell
in the beam. Disadvantages of this include that the lines are narrow, do not
cover the entire spectrum and that light is absorbed. Here I show that
inserting a birefringent element or an imaging Michelson, combined with
Wollaston prisms eliminates these three shortcomings, while maintaining most of
the benefits of the iodine approach. The proposed designs can be made very
compact, thereby providing a convenient way of calibrating a spectrograph.
Similar to the iodine cell approach, the calibration signal travels with the
stellar signal, thereby reducing the sensitivity to spectrograph stability. The
imposed signal covers the entire visible range and any temperature drifts will
be consistent and describable by a single number. Based on experience with
similar devices used, in a different configuration, by the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager, it is shown that the calibration device can be made stable at
the 0.1 m/s level, over a significant wavelength range, on short to medium time
scales. While promising, many details still need to be worked out. In
particular a number of laboratory measurements are required in order to
finalize a design and estimate actual performance and it would be desirable to
make a proof of concept.

the stack temperature is disturbed by load fluctuations, and the temperature
overshoot phenomenon occurs which can exceed the upper limit and harm the

alkaline electrolysis system under dynamic operating conditions. A
control-oriented thermal model is established in the form of a third-order
time-delay process, which is used for simulation and controller design. Based
on this model, we propose two novel controllers to reduce temperature
overshoot: one is a current feed-forward PID controller (PID-I), the other is a
model predictive controller (MPC). Their performances are tested on a lab-scale
system and the experimental results are satisfying: the temperature overshoot
is reduced by 2.2 degree with the PID-I controller, and no obvious overshoot is
observed with the MPC controller. Furthermore, the thermal dynamic performance
of an MW-scale alkaline electrolysis system is analyzed by simulation, which
shows that the temperature overshoot phenomenon is more general in large
systems. The proposed method allows for higher temperature set points which can
improve system efficiency by 1%.

this gap by proposing a novel framework for maximum-mutual-information input
selection for discrete latent variable regression models. We first apply our
method to a class of models known as ""mixtures of linear regressions"" (MLR).
While it is well known that active learning confers no advantage for
linear-Gaussian regression models, we use Fisher information to show
analytically that active learning can nevertheless achieve large gains for
mixtures of such models, and we validate this improvement using both
simulations and real-world data. We then consider a powerful class of
temporally structured latent variable models given by a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) with generalized linear model (GLM) observations, which has recently been
used to identify discrete states from animal decision-making data. We show that
our method substantially reduces the amount of data needed to fit GLM-HMM, and
outperforms a variety of approximate methods based on variational and amortized
inference. Infomax learning for latent variable models thus offers a powerful
for characterizing temporally structured latent states, with a wide variety of

improved performance over traditional architectures. However, current methods
tend to be limited by simple features, despite the rich information provided by
the full graph structure, which leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal
performance in downstream tasks. We propose the use of features derived from
meta-paths, walks across different types of edges, in ST-graphs to improve the
performance of Structural Recurrent Neural Network. In this paper, we present
the Meta-path Enhanced Structural Recurrent Neural Network (MESRNN), a generic
framework that can be applied to any spatio-temporal task in a simple and
scalable manner. We employ MESRNN for pedestrian trajectory prediction,
utilizing these meta-path based features to capture the relationships between
the trajectories of pedestrians at different points in time and space. We
compare our MESRNN against state-of-the-art ST-graph methods on standard
datasets to show the performance boost provided by meta-path information. The
proposed model consistently outperforms the baselines in trajectory prediction
over long time horizons by over 32\%, and produces more socially compliant
trajectories in dense crowds. For more information please refer to the project

representations of nodes and an entire graph. Recently, research on the
expressive power of GNN attracted growing attention. A highly-expressive GNN
has the ability to generate discriminative graph representations. However, in
the end-to-end training process for a certain graph learning task, a
highly-expressive GNN risks generating graph representations overfitting the
training data for the target task, while losing information important for the
model generalization. In this paper, we propose Distribution Preserving GNN
(DP-GNN) - a GNN framework that can improve the generalizability of expressive
GNN models by preserving several kinds of distribution information in graph
representations and node representations. Besides the generalizability, by
applying an expressive GNN backbone, DP-GNN can also have high expressive
power. We evaluate the proposed DP-GNN framework on multiple benchmark datasets
for graph classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our

clusters have been used to constrain the strength of magnetic fields in galaxy
clusters, following the assumption that, as magnetic field lines drape around
the interface between the cold and hot phases, their magnetic tension resists
the growth of perturbations. This has been observed in simulations of rigid
objects moving through magnetised media and sloshing galaxy clusters, and then
applied in interpreting observations of merger cold fronts. Using a suite of
MHD simulations of binary cluster mergers, we show that even magnetic field
strengths stronger than yet observed ($\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_B = 50$) show
visible KHI features. This is because our initial magnetic field is tangled,
producing Alfven waves and associated velocity fluctuations in the ICM;
stronger initial fields therefore seed larger fluctuations, so that even a
reduced growth rate due to magnetic tension produces a significant KHI. The net
result is that a stronger initial magnetic field produces more dramatic
fluctuations in surface brightness and temperature, not the other way around.
We show that this is hard to distinguish from the evolution of turbulent
perturbations of the same initial magnitude. Therefore, in order to use
observations of KHI in the ICM to infer magnetic field strengths by comparing
to idealized simulations, the perturbations which seed the KHI must be
well-understood and (if possible) carefully controlled.

performed a Simon Says activity and a target touch activity in person, using

respect to constraints and risk-based objectives such as conditional

models of the state transitions to guide policy adjustments. The framework is
particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource allocation problems
since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints cannot be

adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate
the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the
portfolio optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial

dynamic repositioning problem in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class
of supply-demand matching problems. We show that the NP framework produces
policies that are better than deep RL and other baseline approaches, adapting

computational systems biology. The control of RNs is currently receiving a lot
of attention because it provides a computational basis for cell reprogramming
-- an attractive technology developed in regenerative medicine. By solving the
control problem, we learn which parts of a biological system should be
perturbed to stabilise the system in the desired phenotype.
  We allow the specification of the Boolean model representing a given RN to be
incomplete. To that end, we utilise the formalism of partially specified
Boolean networks which covers every possible behaviour of unspecified parts of
the system. Such an approach causes a significant state explosion. This problem
is addressed by using symbolic methods to represent both the unspecified model
parts and all possible perturbations of the system.
  Additionally, to make the control design efficient and practically
applicable, the optimal control should be minimal in terms of size. Moreover,
in a partially specified model, a control may achieve the desired stabilisation
only for a subset of the possible fully specified model instantiations. To
address these aspects, we utilise several quantitative measures. Apart from the
size of perturbation, we also examine its robustness -- a portion of
instantiations for which the control is applicable.
  We show that proposed symbolic methods solving the control problem for
partially specified BNs are efficient and scale well. We also evaluate the
robustness metrics in cases of all three studied control types. The robustness
metric tells us how big a proportion of fully defined systems the given
perturbation works. Our experiments support the hypothesis that one-step
perturbations may be less robust than temporary or permanent perturbations.

items receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper,
we examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings
may be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known

overcome the drawbacks of the thermal lattice Boltzmann models. However, as a

present paper firstly derives the macroscopic equations of TLBFS (MEs-TLBFS)
with actual numerical dissipation terms by approximating its computational

TLBFS (RTLBFS) is proposed. Detailed analyses prove that these actual numerical
dissipation terms are the mechanism of the good numerical stability of TLBFS
for high Rayleigh number thermal flows. More detailed numerical tests indicate
RTLBFS has similar performances as TLBFS for stability, accuracy, and

of [Ben83, Bra87] is that they terminate in $2^{\Theta(n)}$ rounds in

  King and Saia [KS16, KS18(arXiv:1812.10169)] developed a polynomial protocol
(polynomial rounds, polynomial computation) that is resilient to $f <

detect -- and blacklist -- coalitions of likely-bad players by analyzing the
deviations of random variables generated by those players over many rounds.
  In this work we design a simple collective coin-flipping protocol such that
if any coalition of faulty players repeatedly does not follow protocol, then
they will eventually be detected by one of two simple statistical tests. Using
this coin-flipping protocol, we solve Byzantine Agreement in a polynomial

decentralisation and asynchronicity of navigation decisions. Each robot
maintains an independent virtual pheromone map, which is continuously updated
with the robot's deposits and pheromone evaporation. Moreover, the individual
pheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that
are exploring nearby areas. Thus, individual and independent maps replace the
need of a centralising agent that controls and distributes the pheromone
information, which is not always practicable. Pheromone information propagation
is inspired by ants' vibroacoustic communication, which, in turn, is
characterised as an indirect communication through a type of gossip protocol.
The proposed model was evaluated through an agent simulation software,
implemented by the authors, and in the Webots platform. Experiments were
carried out to validate the model in different environments, with different
shapes and sizes, as well as varying the number of robots. The analysis of the

from FRB 20190520B for the host galaxy's plasma properties. A sample of 75
bursts detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
shows scattering on two scales: a mean temporal delay $\tau(1.41\ {\rm

scintillation bandwidth $\nu_{\rm d}(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=0.21\pm0.01$ MHz, which
is attributed to the Milky Way. Balmer line measurements for the host imply an
H$\alpha$ emission measure (galaxy frame) $\rm EM_s=620$ pc cm$^{-6} \times
(T/10^4 {\rm K})^{0.9}$, implying $\rm DM_{\rm H\alpha}$ of order the value
inferred from the FRB DM budget, $\rm DM_h=1121^{+89}_{-138}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for
plasma temperatures greater than the typical value $10^4$ K. Combining $\tau$
and $\rm DM_h$ yields a nominal constraint on the scattering amplification from
the host galaxy $\tilde{F} G=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}$ (pc$^2$ km)$^{-1/3}$, where
$\tilde{F}$ describes turbulent density fluctuations and $G$ represents the
geometric leverage to scattering that depends on the location of the scattering
material. For a two-screen scattering geometry where $\tau$ arises from the
host galaxy and $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$ from the Milky Way, the implied distance
between the FRB source and dominant scattering material is $\lesssim100$ pc.
The host galaxy scattering and DM contributions support a novel technique for
estimating FRB redshifts using the $\tau-\rm DM$ relation, and are consistent
with previous findings that scattering of localized FRBs is largely dominated
by plasma within host galaxies and the Milky Way.

systems with metastable states, where high free energy barriers impede proper
sampling of the free energy landscapes when using conventional molecular
dynamics simulations. One such method is variationally enhanced sampling (VES),
which is based on a variational principle where a bias potential in the space
of some chosen slow degrees of freedom, or collective variables, is constructed
by minimizing a convex functional. In practice, the bias potential is taken as
a linear expansion in some basis function set. So far, primarily basis
functions delocalized in the collective variable space, like plane waves,
Chebyshev, or Legendre polynomials, have been used. However, there has not been
an extensive study of how the convergence behavior is affected by the choice of
the basis functions. In particular, it remains an open question if localized
basis functions might perform better. In this work, we implement, tune, and
validate Daubechies wavelets as basis functions for VES\@. The wavelets
construct orthogonal and localized bases that exhibit an attractive
multiresolution property. We evaluate the performance of wavelet and other
basis functions on various systems, going from model potentials to the calcium
carbonate association process in water. We observe that wavelets exhibit
excellent performance and much more robust convergence behavior than all other
basis functions, as well as better performance than metadynamics. In
particular, using wavelet bases yields far smaller fluctuations of the bias
potential within individual runs and smaller differences between independent
runs. Based on our overall results, we can recommend wavelets as basis
functions for VES.

investigate the calcium dynamics of neuronal cells that form confluent

Granger inference to reconstruct the underlying causal relations between the

profile of the external stimuli, where short periods, or long periods with
small duty fractions, lead to reduced connectivity and fractured network

confirmed by the experiments. Together, our results show that information
transfer between neuronal cells is externally regulated by the temporal profile

fatalities suggest deficiencies in current roadway design in protecting these
vulnerable road users. The lack of cycling data is a common challenge for
studying bicyclists' safety, behavior, and comfort levels under different
design contexts. To understand bicyclists' behavioral and physiological
responses in an efficient and safe way, this study uses a bicycle simulator
within an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Off-the-shelf sensors are
utilized to evaluate bicyclists' cycling performance (speed and lane position)
and physiological responses (eye tracking and heart rate (HR)). Participants
bike in a simulated virtual environment modeled to scale from a real-world
street with a shared bike lane (sharrow) to evaluate how introduction of a bike
lane and a protected bike lane with pylons may impact perceptions of safety, as
well as behavioral and psycho-physiological responses. Results from 50
participants show that the protected bike lane design received the highest
perceived safety rating and exhibited the lowest average cycling speed.
Furthermore, both the bike lane and the protected bike lane scenarios show a
less dispersed gaze distribution than the as-built sharrow scenario, reflecting
a higher gaze focus among bicyclists on the biking task in the bike lane and
protected bike lane scenarios, compared to when bicyclists share right of way
with vehicles. Additionally, heart rate change point results from the study
suggest that creating dedicated zones for bicyclists (bike lanes or protected
bike lanes) has the potential to reduce bicyclists' stress levels.

unsupervised contrastive learning framework for context-aware phrase
representations and topic mining. UCTopic is pretrained in a large scale to
distinguish if the contexts of two phrase mentions have the same semantics. The
key to pretraining is positive pair construction from our phrase-oriented
assumptions. However, we find traditional in-batch negatives cause performance
decay when finetuning on a dataset with small topic numbers. Hence, we propose
cluster-assisted contrastive learning(CCL) which largely reduces noisy
negatives by selecting negatives from clusters and further improves phrase
representations for topics accordingly. UCTopic outperforms the
state-of-the-art phrase representation model by 38.2% NMI in average on four

UCTopic can extract coherent and diverse topical phrases.

widely used in practice, including $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and
$t$-closeness. We present three new attacks on QI-deidentification: two
theoretical attacks and one practical attack on a real dataset. In contrast to
prior work, our theoretical attacks work even if every attribute is a
quasi-identifier. Hence, they apply to $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity,
$t$-closeness, and most other QI-deidentification techniques.
  First, we introduce a new class of privacy attacks called downcoding attacks,
and prove that every QI-deidentification scheme is vulnerable to downcoding
attacks if it is minimal and hierarchical. Second, we convert the downcoding
attacks into powerful predicate singling-out (PSO) attacks, which were recently
proposed as a way to demonstrate that a privacy mechanism fails to legally
anonymize under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Third, we use
LinkedIn.com to reidentify 3 students in a $k$-anonymized dataset published by
EdX (and show thousands are potentially vulnerable), undermining EdX's claimed
compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
  The significance of this work is both scientific and political. Our
theoretical attacks demonstrate that QI-deidentification may offer no
protection even if every attribute is treated as a quasi-identifier. Our
practical attack demonstrates that even deidentification experts acting in
accordance with strict privacy regulations fail to prevent real-world
reidentification. Together, they rebut a foundational tenet of
QI-deidentification and challenge the actual arguments made to justify the
continued use of $k$-anonymity and other QI-deidentification techniques.

statistics in the quantum Hall effect. The interference phase is interpreted as
a combination of a quantized statistical phase and an Aharonov-Bohm phase,
proportional to the device area and the charge of the anyons propagating along
the device edge. This interpretation faces two challenges. First, the edge
states have a finite width and hence the device area is ill-defined. Second,
multiple localized anyons may be present in states that overlap with the edge,
and it may not be clear whether a second anyon traveling along the edge will go
inside or outside the region with a localized anyon and therefore whether or
not it should pick up a statistical phase. We show how one may overcome both
challenges. In a case where only one chiral edge mode passes through the
constrictions defining the interferometer, as when electrons in a constriction
are in a Laughlin state with $\nu=1/(2n+1)$ or the integer state at $\nu=1$, we
show that the interference phase can be directly related to the total electron
charge contained in the interferometer. This holds for arbitrary
electron-electron interactions and holds even if the bulk of the interferometer
has a higher electron density than the region of the constrictions. In contrast
to the device area or to the number of anyons inside a propagating edge
channel, the total charge is well-defined. We examine, at the microscopic
level, how the relation between charge and phase is maintained when there is a
soft confining potential and disorder near the edge of the interferometer, and
we discuss briefly the complications that can occur when multiple chiral modes
can pass through the constriction.

drifts of the system states across domains. In this sense, causal DA is
transformed as a causal discovery problem that finds invariant representation

that feature learning--in which relevant features are optimized from data--is
critical to achieving high accuracy. We introduce models that reduce the error

hand-crafted features. Feature learning is useful not only because it improves
performance on prediction tasks; the results provide valuable information about

mitigation strategies. Learning in high-dimensional settings is challenging.

variety of content-creation, social networking, and shopping activities. With
the rapid proliferation of such online services, learning data-driven user
behavior models is indispensable to enable personalized user experiences.
Recently, representation learning has emerged as an effective strategy for user
modeling, powered by neural networks trained over large volumes of interaction
data. Despite their enormous potential, we encounter the unique challenge of
data sparsity for a vast majority of entities, e.g., sparsity in ground-truth
labels for entities and in entity-level interactions (cold-start users, items
in the long-tail, and ephemeral groups).
  In this dissertation, we develop generalizable neural representation learning
frameworks for user behavior modeling designed to address different sparsity
challenges across applications. Our problem settings span transductive and
inductive learning scenarios, where transductive learning models entities seen
during training and inductive learning targets entities that are only observed
during inference. We leverage different facets of information reflecting user
behavior (e.g., interconnectivity in social networks, temporal and attributed
interaction information) to enable personalized inference at scale. Our
proposed models are complementary to concurrent advances in neural
architectural choices and are adaptive to the rapid addition of new
applications in online platforms.

observed diseases in ambulatory and hospital settings. Resistance of diverse
bacterial pathogens to antibiotics is a significant cause of severe SSTIs, and
treatment failure results in morbidity, mortality, and increased cost of
hospitalization. Therefore, antimicrobial surveillance is essential to predict
antibiotic resistance trends and monitor the results of medical interventions.
To address this, we developed machine learning (ML) models (deep and
conventional algorithms) to predict antimicrobial resistance using antibiotic
susceptibility testing (ABST) data collected from patients clinically diagnosed
with primary and secondary pyoderma over a period of one year. We trained an
individual ML algorithm on each antimicrobial family to determine whether a
Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) or Gram-Negative Bacilli (GNB) bacteria will resist
the corresponding antibiotic. For this purpose, clinical and demographic
features from the patient and data from ABST were employed in training. We
achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68-0.98 in GPC and 0.56-0.93 in GNB
bacteria, depending on the antimicrobial family. We also conducted a
correlation analysis to determine the linear relationship between each feature
and antimicrobial families in different bacteria. ML techniques suggest that a
predictable nonlinear relationship exists between patients'
clinical-demographic characteristics and antibiotic resistance; however, the
accuracy of this prediction depends on the type of the antimicrobial family.

of the main challenges of HSI classification is the lack of reliable labelled
samples. Various semi-supervised and unsupervised classification methods are
proposed to handle the low number of labelled samples. Chief among them are
graph convolution networks (GCN) and their variants. These approaches exploit
the graph structure for semi-supervised and unsupervised classification. While
several of these methods implicitly construct edge-weights, to our knowledge,
not much work has been done to estimate the edge-weights explicitly. In this
article, we estimate the edge-weights explicitly and use them for the
downstream classification tasks - both semi-supervised and unsupervised. The
proposed edge-weights are based on two key insights - (a) Ensembles reduce the
variance and (b) Classes in HSI datasets and feature similarity have only
one-sided implications. That is, while same classes would have similar
features, similar features do not necessarily imply the same classes.
Exploiting these, we estimate the edge-weights using an aggregate of ensembles
of watersheds over subsamples of features. These edge weights are evaluated for
both semi-supervised and unsupervised classification tasks. The evaluation for
semi-supervised tasks uses Random-Walk based approach. For the unsupervised
case, we use a simple filter using a graph convolution network (GCN). In both
these cases, the proposed edge weights outperform the traditional approaches to
compute edge-weights - Euclidean distances and cosine similarities.
Fascinatingly, with the proposed edge-weights, the simplest GCN obtained
results comparable to the recent state-of-the-art.

redshifts of galaxies from a radio-selected survey. Using a radio-selected
sample with broadband photometry at infrared and optical wavelengths, we test
the k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Random Forest machine learning algorithms,
testing them both in their regression and classification modes. Further, we
test different distance metrics used by the kNN algorithm, including the
standard Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and a learned distance
metric for both the regression mode (the Metric Learning for Kernel Regression
metric) and the classification mode (the Large Margin Nearest Neighbour
metric). We find that all regression-based modes fail on galaxies at a redshift
$z > 1$. However, below this range, the kNN algorithm using the Mahalanobis
distance metric performs best, with an $\eta_{0.15}$ outlier rate of 5.85\%. In
the classification mode, the kNN algorithm using the Mahalanobis distance
metric also performs best, with an $\eta_{0.15}$ outlier rate of 5.85\%,
correctly placing 74\% of galaxies in the top $z > 1.02$ bin. Finally, we also
tested the effect of training in one field and applying the trained algorithm
to similar data from another field and found that variation across fields does
not result in statistically significant differences in predicted redshifts.
Importantly, we find that while we may not be able to predict a continuous
value for high-redshift radio sources, we can identify the majority of them
using the classification modes of existing techniques.

bipolar power devices based on the 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC). It is well
established that heavy nitrogen (N) doping promotes the conversion of BPDs to
threading edge dislocations (TEDs) and improves the reliability of 4H-SiC-based
bipolar power devices. However, the interaction between N and BPDs, and the
effect of N on the electronic properties of BPDs are still ambiguous, which
significantly hinder the understanding on the electron-transport mechanism of
4H-SiC-based bipolar power devices. Combining molten-alkali etching and the
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, we demonstrate that BPDs create
acceptor-like states in undoped 4H-SiC, while acting as donors in N-doped
4H-SiC. First-principles calculations verify that BPDs create occupied defect
states above the valence band maximum (VBM) and unoccupied defect states under
the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of undoped 4H-SiC. The electron transfer from
the defect states of intrinsic defects and native impurities to the unoccupied
defect states of BPDs gives rise to the acceptor-like behavior of BPDs in
undoped 4H-SiC. Defect formation energies indicate that N atoms can
spontaneously decorate BPDs during the N doping of 4H-SiC. The binding between
N and BPD is strong against decomposition. The accumulation of N dopants at the
core of BPDs results in the accumulation of donor-like states at the core of
BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC. This work not only enriches the understanding on the
electronic behavior of BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC, but also helps understand the
electron transport mechanism of 4H-SiC-based bipolar power devices.

safety components like Out-of-Distribution detectors and risk estimators, which
require labeled data from different operating modes of the system that belong
to scenes with adverse operating conditions, sensors, and actuator faults.
Collecting real-world data of these scenes can be expensive and sometimes not
feasible. So, scenario description languages with samplers like random and grid
search are available to generate synthetic data from simulators, replicating
these real-world scenes. However, we point out three limitations in using these
conventional samplers. First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the
feedback of previous results in the sampling process. Second, the variables to
be sampled may have constraints that are often not included. Third, they do not
balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, which we hypothesize
is necessary for better search space coverage. We present a scene generation
approach with two samplers called Random Neighborhood Search (RNS) and Guided
Bayesian Optimization (GBO), which extend the conventional random search and
Bayesian Optimization search to include the limitations. Also, to facilitate
the samplers, we use a risk-based metric that evaluates how risky the scene was

number of tables. An optimal query plan for such queries is crucial for being
able to run these queries within acceptable time bounds. However, with queries
involving many tables, finding the optimal join order becomes a bottleneck in
query optimization. Due to the exponential nature of join order optimization,
optimizers resort to heuristic solutions after a threshold number of tables.
Our objective is two fold: (a) reduce the optimization time for generating
optimal plans; and (b) improve the quality of the heuristic solution. In this
paper, we propose a new massively parallel algorithm, MPDP, that can
efficiently prune the large search space (via a novel plan enumeration
technique) while leveraging the massive parallelism offered by modern hardware
(Eg: GPUs). When evaluated on real-world benchmark queries with PostgreSQL,
MPDP is at least an order of magnitude faster compared to state-of-the-art
techniques for large analytical queries. As a result, we are able to increase
the heuristic-fall-back limit from 12 relations to 25 relations with same time
budget in PostgreSQL. Also, in order to handle queries with even larger number
of tables, we augment MPDP to a well known heuristic, IDP$_2$ (iterative DP
version 2) and a novel heuristic UnionDP. By systematically exploring a much
larger search space, these heuristics provides query plans that are up to 7
times cheaper as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques while being faster

strong and fair baseline for the MOT community. Moreover, two lightweight and
plug-and-play algorithms are proposed to address two inherent ""missing""
problems of MOT: missing association and missing detection. Specifically,

at high computation complexity, we propose an appearance-free link model
(AFLink) to perform global association without appearance information, and
achieve a good balance between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a
Gaussian-smoothed interpolation (GSI) based on Gaussian process regression to
relieve the missing detection. AFLink and GSI can be easily plugged into
various trackers with a negligible extra computational cost (1.7 ms and 7.1 ms

leaky resonant waveguide and transverse modes. These coupling mechanisms cause
light to be absorbed directly from the top and indirectly as light scatters
from one nanowire to neighbouring ones. This work leads to the possible
development of a new generation of quantum detectors with unprecedented
broadband near-unity absorption in the infrared, while operating near room

LDCT denoising was little explored so far. To fill this gap, we propose a
Convolution-free Token2Token Dilated Vision Transformer for low-dose CT
denoising. The CTformer uses a more powerful token rearrangement to encompass
local contextual information and thus avoids convolution. It also dilates and
shifts feature maps to capture longer-range interaction. We interpret the
CTformer by statically inspecting patterns of its internal attention maps and
dynamically tracing the hierarchical attention flow with an explanatory graph.
Furthermore, an overlapped inference mechanism is introduced to effectively
eliminate the boundary artifacts that are common for encoder-decoder-based

learn the object affordance without dense labels. As such, the fundamental
question to devise a computational model is: What is the natural way to learn
the object affordance from visual appearance and geometry with humanlike sparse
supervision? In this work, we present a new task of part-level affordance
discovery (PartAfford): Given only the affordance labels per object, the
machine is tasked to (i) decompose 3D shapes into parts and (ii) discover how
each part of the object corresponds to a certain affordance category. We
propose a novel learning framework for PartAfford, which discovers part-level
representations by leveraging only the affordance set supervision and geometric
primitive regularization, without dense supervision. The proposed approach
consists of two main components: (i) an abstraction encoder with slot attention
for unsupervised clustering and abstraction, and (ii) an affordance decoder
with branches for part reconstruction, affordance prediction, and cuboidal
primitive regularization. To learn and evaluate PartAfford, we construct a
part-level, cross-category 3D object affordance dataset, annotated with 24

attention owing to the presence of LiDAR sensors in 3D vision. However, the
existing methods based on deep neural networks focus mainly on training
different models for different categories, which makes them unable to perform
well in real-world applications when encountering classes unseen during the
training phase. In this work, we investigate a more challenging task in the
LiDAR point clouds, class-agnostic tracking, where a general model is supposed
to be learned for any specified targets of both observed and unseen categories.
In particular, we first investigate the class-agnostic performances of the
state-of-the-art trackers via exposing the unseen categories to them during
testing, finding that a key factor for class-agnostic tracking is how to
constrain fused features between the template and search region to maintain
generalization when the distribution is shifted from observed to unseen

propulsion, perception, planning and control. These are traditionally designed
separately which makes performance optimization of the integrated system a
significant challenge. In this paper, we study the problem of using
gradient-free optimization methods to jointly optimize the multiple domains of
an autonomous system to find the set of optimal architectures for both hardware
and software. We specifically perform multi-domain, multi-parameter
optimization on an autonomous vehicle to find the best decision-making process,
motion planning and control algorithms, and the physical parameters for
autonomous racing. We detail the multi-domain optimization scheme, benchmark
with different core components, and provide insights for generalization to new
autonomous systems. In addition, this paper provides a benchmark of the
performances of six different gradient-free optimizers in three different
operating environments.
  Our approach is validated with a case study where we describe the autonomous
vehicle system architecture, optimization methods, and finally, provide an
argument on gradient-free optimization being a powerful choice to improve the
performance of autonomous systems in an integrated manner.

for data with irregular structures. However, simply stacking more GCN layers
does not improve performance; instead, the output converges to an uninformative
low-dimensional subspace, where the convergence rate is characterized by the
graph spectrum -- this is the known over-smoothing problem in GCN. In this
paper, we propose a sparse graph learning algorithm incorporating a new
spectrum prior to compute a graph topology that circumvents over-smoothing
while preserving pairwise correlations inherent in data. Specifically, based on
a spectral analysis of multilayer GCN output, we derive a spectrum prior for
the graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$ to robustify the model expressiveness
against over-smoothing. Then, we formulate a sparse graph learning problem with
the spectrum prior, solved efficiently via block coordinate descent (BCD).
Moreover, we optimize the weight parameter trading off the fidelity term with
the spectrum prior, based on data smoothness on the original graph learned
without spectrum manipulation. The output $\mathbf{L}$ is then normalized for
supervised GCN training. Experiments show that our proposal produced deeper
GCNs and higher prediction accuracy for regression and classification tasks

friction whose origin is rigorously explained using the stochastic Lagrangian
formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. This formulation permits the exact
analysis of vorticity dynamics in individual realizations of a viscous
incompressible fluid flow. The Lagrangian reconstruction formula for vorticity
is here extended for the first time to Neumann boundary conditions (Lighthill
source). We can thus express the wall vorticity, and therefore the wall stress,
as the expectation of a stochastic Cauchy invariant in backward time, with
contributions from (a) wall-vorticity flux (Lighthill source) and (b) interior
vorticity that has been evolved by nonlinear advection, viscous diffusion,
vortex stretching and tilting. We consider the origin of stress maxima in the
transitional region, examining a sufficient number of events to represent the
increased skin friction. The stochastic Cauchy analysis is applied to each
event to trace the origin of the wall vorticity. We find that the Lighthill
source, vortex tilting, diffusion and advection of outer vorticity make minor
contributions. They are less important than spanwise stretching of near-wall
spanwise vorticity, which is the dominant source of skin-friction increase
during laminar-to-turbulent transition. Our analysis should assist more
generally in understanding drag generation and reduction strategies and flow
separation in terms of near-wall vorticity dynamics.

instability, a classic model problem, is explored with conservative high-order
discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to both the quasilinear equations and to
a direct simulation of the Vlasov-Poisson equations. The initial condition is
chosen in the regime of beam parameters for which quasilinear theory should be
applicable. Quasilinear diffusion is initially in good agreement with the
direct simulation but later underestimates the turbulent momentum flux. The
direct simulation corrects from quasilinear evolution by quenching the
instability in a finite time and producing a robust state of oscillation. Flux
enhancement above quasilinear levels occurs as the phase space eddy turnover
time in the largest amplitude wavepackets becomes comparable to the transit
time of resonant phase fluid through wavepacket potentials. In this regime
eddies effectively turn over during wavepacket transit so that phase fluid
predominantly disperses by eddy phase mixing rather than by randomly phased
waves. The enhanced turbulent flux of resonant phase fluid leads in turn,
through energy conservation, to an increase in non-resonant turbulent flux and
thus to an enhanced heating of the main thermal body above quasilinear
predictions. These findings shed light on the kinetic turbulence fluctuation
spectrum and support the theory that collisionless momentum diffusion beyond
the quasilinear approximation can be understood through the dynamics of phase
space eddies (or clumps and granulations).

knowledge memorization and identification abilities: traditional KBs can store
various types of entities and relationships; do PLMs have a high knowledge
capacity to store different types of knowledge? Secondly, reasoning ability: a
qualified knowledge source should not only provide a collection of facts, but
support a symbolic reasoner. Can PLMs derive new knowledge based on the
correlations between facts? To evaluate these features of PLMs, we propose a
benchmark, named Knowledge Memorization, Identification, and Reasoning test

domain-specific knowledge, and commonsense, and provides 184,348 well-designed

calculate a transformation to an alternative set of global eigenfunctions for

long-term benefits. Typical examples include subsidized job training programs
and provisions of preventive health products, in which both behavioral
responses and associated gains can exhibit heterogeneity. This study uses the
marginal treatment effect (MTE) framework to study personalized assignments of
subsidies based on individual characteristics. First, we derive the optimality
condition for a welfare-maximizing subsidy rule by showing that the welfare can
be represented as a function of the MTE. Next, we show that subsidies generally
result in better welfare than directly mandating the encouraged behavior
because subsidy rules implicitly target individuals through unobserved
heterogeneity in the behavioral response. When there is positive selection,
that is, when individuals with higher returns are more likely to select the
encouraged behavior, the optimal subsidy rule achieves the first-best welfare,
which is the optimal welfare if a policy-maker can observe individuals' private
information. We then provide methods to (partially) identify the optimal
subsidy rule when the MTE is identified and unidentified. Particularly,
positive selection allows for the point identification of the optimal subsidy
rule even when the MTE curve is not. As an empirical application, we study the
optimal wage subsidy using the experimental data from the Jordan New
Opportunities for Women pilot study.

Recently,

machine-learning methods almost universally relies on either vast amounts of
labeled experimental data or the ability to numerically simulate realistic
datasets. However, the data produced by experiments are often challenging to
label and cannot be easily reproduced numerically. Here, we propose a novel
deep-learning method, named LodeSTAR (Low-shot deep Symmetric Tracking And
Regression), that learns to tracks objects with sub-pixel accuracy from a
single unlabeled experimental image. This is made possible by exploiting the
inherent roto-translational symmetries of the data. We demonstrate that
LodeSTAR outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we
analyze challenging experimental data containing densely packed cells or noisy
backgrounds. We also exploit additional symmetries to extend the measurable
particle properties to the particle's vertical position by propagating the
signal in Fourier space and its polarizability by scaling the signal strength.
Thanks to the ability to train deep-learning models with a single unlabeled
image, LodeSTAR can accelerate the development of high-quality microscopic
analysis pipelines for engineering, biology, and medicine.

Specifically, we reveal the root cause of this degree-related unfairness by
analyzing the gradients of weight matrices in GCN. Guided by the gradients of
weight matrices, we further propose a pre-processing method RawlsGCN-Graph and
an in-processing method RawlsGCN-Grad that achieves fair predictive accuracy in
low-degree nodes without modification on the GCN architecture or introduction

Langevin equations for the ion densities and flow velocity. The nonlinearity of
the Langevin equations generally leads to effective kinetic coefficients for
the deterministic dynamics of the average ion densities and flow velocity; the
effective coefficients generally differ from the counterparts in the Langevin
equations and are frequency-dependent. Using the path-integral formalism
involving auxiliary fields, we perform systematic perturbation calculations of
the effective kinetic coefficients for ion diffusion, shear viscosity, and
electrical conductivity, which govern the dynamics on the large length scales.
As novel contributions, we study the frequency dependence of the viscosity and
conductivity in the one-loop approximation. Regarding the conductivity at
finite frequencies, we derive the so-called electrophoretic part in addition to
the relaxation part, where the latter has been obtained by Debye and
Falkenhagen; it is predicted that the combination of these two parts gives rise
to the frequency $\omega_{\rm max}$ proportional to the salt density, at which
the real part of the conductivity exhibits a maximum. The zero-frequency limits
of the conductivity and shear viscosity coincide with the classical limiting
laws for dilute solutions, derived in different means by Debye, Falkenhagen,

in large length scales, our straightforward calculation yields the cross
kinetic coefficient between cations and anions. Further, we discuss the

In a direct solver, one factorizes the system matrix. Since the system matrix

important computational consideration in terms of time complexity and memory
requirements. As a result, it is of great interest to determine ways in which
this fill-in can be systematically reduced. In this paper, we show that in the
context of commonly used perfectly matched boundary layer methods, the choice

With recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep
learning (DL), assistance in precise anatomy identification through semantic
segmentation essential for the reliable assessment of growth and
neurodevelopment, and detection of structural abnormalities have been proposed.
However, existing works only identify certain structures (e.g., cavum septum

(transventricular, transcerebellar), limiting the scope for a thorough
anatomical assessment as per practice guidelines necessary for the screening of
CNS anomalies. Further, existing works do not analyze the generalizability of
these DL algorithms across images from multiple ultrasound devices and centers,
thus, limiting their real-world clinical impact. In this study, we propose a DL
based segmentation framework for the automated segmentation of 10 key fetal
brain structures from 2 axial planes from fetal brain USG images (2D). We
developed a custom U-Net variant that uses inceptionv4 block as a feature

major design challenges of the IoEV charging control lie in the randomness of
charging events and the mobility of EVs. In this article, we present a holistic

Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), we introduce the charging control problem in two
scenarios: 1) Operation of a single charging station and 2) Operation of
multiple charging stations in coupled transportation and power networks. For
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), we discuss how EVs can perform energy trading in the
electricity market and provide ancillary services to the power grid. Besides, a
case study is provided to illustrate the economic benefit of the joint
optimization of routing and charging scheduling of multiple EVs in the IoEV.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of network non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) technique
to coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems has attracted significant attention
due to its superior capability to improve connectivity and maintain reliable
transmission for CoMP users simultaneously. Based on the concept of
quasi-degraded channel for N-NOMA, this paper studies the precoding design for
downlink N-NOMA scenarios with two base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple
antennas. In specific, under quasi-degraded channels, simple linear precoding
based N-NOMA can achieve the same minimal total transmission power as
theoretically optimal but complicated dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme, when the
users' target rates and minimal transmission power of each BS are given. In
this paper, the channel quasi-degradation (QD) condition is first rigorously
derived for the scenario with single CoMP user and two NOMA users. The
closed-form optimal precoders for N-NOMA under quasi-degraded channels are also
provided. Then, based on QD condition, a novel hybrid N-NOMA (H-N-NOMA) scheme
is proposed, which is a mixture of N-NOMA and conventional zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF) scheme. Further, for the scenarios with more users, a
low-complexity QD based user pairing (QDUP) algorithm is proposed. Numerical
results are presented to reveal the impact factors of QD channels, and also
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed H-N-NOMA/QDUP scheme. It
is shown that the proposed H-N-NOMA/QDUP scheme can effectively exploit the
benefit of multi user diversity.

through deforming optical fibres. As a first result, it establishes an exact
relation between observable phase changes and the deformation tensor along the
fibre. This relation is non-linear, and it includes effects related to both
local changes in fibre length and deformation-induced changes of the local
speed of light or refractive index. In seismic applications, where the norm of
the earthquake-induced deformation tensor is orders of magnitude smaller than
1, a useful first-order relation can be derived. It simply connects phase
changes to an integral over in-line strain along the fibre times the local
refractive index. Under the assumption that spatial variations of the
refractive index are fast compared to the seismic wavelength, this permits a
direct synthesis of phase change measurements from distributed strain
measurements, for instance, from Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). A more
detailed analysis of the first-order relation reveals that a perfectly straight
fibre would produce zero phase change measurements, unless deformation was
sufficiently widespread to affect the starting and end points of the fibre. If
this condition is not met, non-zero measurements can only result from curvature
of the fibre or from a heterogeneous distribution of the refractive index.
Segments of the fibre that are strongly curved generally make larger
contributions to the observed phase change.

more. In a single beam configuration, the location of the highest-pressure zone

effect of the shock-wave pressure from photo-induced and plasma relaxation
effect. To circumvent this difficulty, we consider two spatially separated
focused beams that individually act as quasi-simultaneous pressure-wave
emitters. The zone where both shock-waves interfere constructively forms a
region of extreme pressure range, physically separated from the regions under
direct laser exposure. Here, we present evidences of pressured-induced
densification in fused silica in between the foci of the two beams, which can
be exclusively attributed to the superposition of the pressure waves emitted by
each focused laser-beam. Specifically, we show how the beams gap and pulses
time-delay affect the structural properties of fused silica using Raman
characterization, beam deflection technique, and selective etching techniques.

in many real-world applications, there are practical challenges that need to be
addressed for model maintenance. One such challenge is to 'undo' the effect of
a specific subset of dataset used for training a model. This specific subset
may contain malicious or adversarial data injected by an attacker, which
affects the model performance. Another reason may be the need for a service
provider to remove data pertaining to a specific user to respect the user's
privacy. In both cases, the problem is to 'unlearn' a specific subset of the
training data from a trained model without incurring the costly procedure of
retraining the whole model from scratch. Towards this goal, this paper presents
a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based machine unlearning (MCU) algorithm. MCU helps
to effectively and efficiently unlearn a trained model from subsets of training
dataset. Furthermore, we show that with MCU, we are able to explain the effect
of a subset of a training dataset on the model prediction. Thus, MCU is useful
for examining subsets of data to identify the adversarial data to be removed.
Similarly, MCU can be used to erase the lineage of a user's personal data from
trained ML models, thus upholding a user's ""right to be forgotten"". We
empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed MCU algorithm on
real-world phishing and diabetes datasets. Results show that MCU can achieve a
desirable performance by efficiently removing the effect of a subset of
training dataset and outperform an existing algorithm that utilizes the
remaining dataset.

representation learning, which aims to learn general and useful point cloud
representations from unlabelled point cloud data, has recently attracted
increasing attention due to the constraint in large-scale point cloud

cloud representation learning using DNNs. It first describes the motivation,
general pipelines as well as terminologies of the recent studies. Relevant
background including widely adopted point cloud datasets and DNN architectures
is then briefly presented. This is followed by an extensive discussion of
existing unsupervised point cloud representation learning methods according to
their technical approaches. We also quantitatively benchmark and discuss the

encoding (RLE), which represents each maximal run of the same characters $a$ by
$a^p$ where $p$ is the length of the run. Let $m$ be the RLE-size of string

composing the building blocks of life. The physics of the carbon nucleus in its
predominant isotope, $^{12}$C, is similarly full of multifaceted complexity.
Some nuclear states of $^{12}$C can be preferentially treated as a collection
of independent particles held by the mean field of the nucleus, while other
states behave more as a collection of three alpha-particle clusters. But these
two pictures are not mutually exclusive, and some states can be described in
either fashion$^{1,2}$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent
tomographic scan of the three-dimensional geometry of the nuclear states of
$^{12}$C using the {\it ab initio} framework of nuclear lattice effective field
theory. We find that the well-known but enigmatic Hoyle state is composed of a
""bent-arm"" or obtuse triangular arrangement of alpha clusters. We identify all
of the low-lying nuclear states of $^{12}$C as having an intrinsic shape
composed of three alpha clusters forming either an equilateral triangle or an
obtuse triangle. From these basic structural formations, the various nuclear
states correspond to different rotational and vibrational excitations as well
as either distortions or large-amplitude displacements of the alpha clusters.
The states with the equilateral triangle formation also have a dual description
in terms of particle-hole excitations in the mean-field picture. We compare our
theoretical calculations with experimental data for binding energies,
quadrupole moments, electromagnetic transitions, charge densities, and form
factors. The overall agreement is good, and further studies using
higher-fidelity interactions are planned.

exponential control barrier functions(ECBFs) are developed to handle safety
constraints for limited playground, collision avoidance, and saturation of the
velocity. While designing the nominal controller and ECBFs, an estimated
braking time and robust inequality constraints are derived to deal with the
system uncertainty. Consequently, a controller guaranteeing safety barrier
certificates of each robot has been formulated by a quadratic programming with

nonlinear structure of the system makes the interaction between bubbles so
strong, so the determination process of the blow-up rates and locations is
completely different from that of the classical Lane-Emden equation. If $p \ge

as) that of the classical Lane-Emden equation, and only one-bubble solutions

the metasurface from dust or clean the unavoidable contaminants during daily

exhibit self-cleaning properties, we show a versatile dielectric metasurface
benefiting from the obtained superhydrophilic or quasi-superhydrophobic states.
The design is realized by embedding the metasurface inside a large area of
wettability supporting structures, which is highly efficient in fabrication,
and achieves both optical and wettability functionality at the same time. The
superhydrophilic state enables an enhanced optical response with water, while
the quasi-superhydrophobic state imparts the fragile antennas an ability to
self-clean dust contamination. Furthermore, the metasurface can be easily
switched and repeated between these two wettability or functional states by
appropriate treatments in a repeatable way, without degrading the optical
performance. The proposed design strategy will bring new opportunities to smart
metasurfaces with improved optical performance, versatility and physical

Specifically, we propose CoVGS-IL, which uses a graph-structured task function

task generalization by selecting geometric features from different objects
whose inner connection relationships define the same task in geometric
constraints. The learned task representation is then transferred to a robot

Recommending high-quality news to users is important for keeping good user
experiences and news platforms' reputations. However, existing news
recommendation methods mainly aim to optimize news clicks while ignoring the
quality of news they recommended, which may lead to recommending news with
uninformative content or even clickbaits. In this paper, we propose a
quality-aware news recommendation method named QualityRec that can effectively
improve the quality of recommended news. In our approach, we first propose an
effective news quality evaluation method based on the distributions of users'
reading dwell time on news. Next, we propose to incorporate news quality
information into user interest modeling by designing a content-quality
attention network to select clicked news based on both news semantics and
qualities. We further train the recommendation model with an auxiliary news
quality prediction task to learn quality-aware recommendation model, and we add
a recommendation quality regularization loss to encourage the model to
recommend higher-quality news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
show that QualityRec can effectively improve the overall quality of recommended
news and reduce the recommendation of low-quality news, with even slightly
better recommendation accuracy.

  Diagnosis of PV Stations",,,"10.1109/TNSE.2022.3150182",,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CE cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to the different losses caused by various photovoltaic (PV) array faults,
accurate diagnosis of fault types is becoming increasingly important. Compared
with a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but
their data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of
interest. Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a
collaborative fault diagnosis model. However, the modeling efficiency is
seriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a
different computing capability and amount of data. Moreover, for the safe and
stable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling
must be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server. To
address these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning
(ADFL) framework is proposed. Each PV station not only trains its local model
but also participates in collaborative fault diagnosis by exchanging model
parameters to improve the generalization without losing accuracy. The global
model is aggregated distributedly to avoid central node failure. By designing
the asynchronous update scheme, the communication overhead and training time
are greatly reduced. Both the experiments and numerical simulations are carried
out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

recommendation performance. They are usually learned on historical user
behavior data to infer user interest and predict future user behaviors (e.g.,
clicks). In fact, the behaviors of heavy users with more historical behaviors
can usually provide richer clues than cold users in interest modeling and
future behavior prediction. Big models may favor heavy users by learning more
from their behavior patterns and bring unfairness to cold users. In this paper,
we study whether big recommendation models are fair to cold users. We
empirically demonstrate that optimizing the overall performance of big
recommendation models may lead to unfairness to cold users in terms of
performance degradation. To solve this problem, we propose a BigFair method
based on self-distillation, which uses the model predictions on original user
data as a teacher to regularize predictions on augmented data with randomly
dropped user behaviors, which can encourage the model to fairly capture
interest distributions of heavy and cold users. Experiments on two datasets
show that BigFair can effectively improve the performance fairness of big

devising mechanisms to detect malicious activities originating security
threats. Amongst the many solutions, network intrusion detection emerged as one
of the most popular to analyze network traffic and detect ongoing intrusions
based on rules or by means of Machine Learners (MLs), which process such
traffic and learn a model to suspect intrusions. Supervised MLs are very
effective in detecting known threats, but struggle in identifying zero-day
attacks (unknown during learning phase), which instead can be detected through
unsupervised MLs. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers on the
combined use of both approaches for network intrusion detection. In this paper
we first expand the problem of zero-day attacks and motivate the need to
combine supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We propose the adoption of
meta-learning, in the form of a two-layer Stacker, to create a mixed approach
that detects both known and unknown threats. Then we implement and empirically
evaluate our Stacker through an experimental campaign that allows i) debating
on meta-features crafted through unsupervised base-level learners, ii) electing
the most promising supervised meta-level classifiers, and iii) benchmarking
classification scores of the Stacker with respect to supervised and
unsupervised classifiers. Last, we compare our solution with existing works
from the recent literature. Overall, our Stacker reduces misclassifications
with respect to (un)supervised ML algorithms in all the 7 public datasets we
considered, and outperforms existing studies in 6 out of those 7 datasets. In
particular, it turns out to be more effective in detecting zero-day attacks
than supervised algorithms, limiting their main weakness but still maintaining
adequate capabilities in detecting known attacks.

the ALMA Bands 6 and 8. We measure the redshift of this galaxy as
$z_{\rm{sys}}=7.133\pm0.005$ based on the [C II] and [O III] emission lines,
consistent with that adopted by Bakx et al. (2021). The observed
$L_{[\rm{O\,III]}}/L_{[\rm{C\,II]}}$ ratio is $2.09\pm0.09$, higher than most
of the local galaxies, but consistent with other $z\sim7$ galaxies. The
moderate-spatial resolution of ALMA data provided us with a precious
opportunity to investigate spatial variation of
$L_{[\rm{O\,III]}}/L_{[\rm{C\,II]}}$. In contrast to the average value of 2.09,
we find a much higher $L_{[\rm{O\,III]}}/L_{[\rm{C\,II]}}$ of $\sim 7$ at the
center of the galaxy. This spatial variation of
$L_{[\rm{O\,III]}}/L_{[\rm{C\,II]}}$ was seldom reported for other high-z

with optical peaks. Possible physical reasons include a central AGN, shock
heating from merging, and starburst. Our moderate-spatial resolution data also
reveals that in addition to the observed two clumps shown in previous HST
images, there is a redshifted segment to the west of the northern optical
clump. Such a structure is consistent with previous claims that A1689-zD1 is a

are the results of complex phenomena such as the stellar magnetic field
reconnection, low-level variability or in some cases even star-planet
interactions. The radiation arising from these events is often highly energetic
and, in stars hosting planets, may interact with the planetary atmospheres.
Studying the rate of these energetic phenomena is fundamental to understand
their role in modifying the chemical composition or, in some extreme cases, to
the disruption of the planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a new procedure
developed to identify the impulsive events in TESS light curves. Our goal is to
have a simple and effective tool to study the short-term activity of a star
using only its light curve, in order to derive its distribution and energetic.
As our first case, we studied the system DS Tuc. Our technique consists of
fitting the TESS light curves using iteratively Gaussian processes in order to
remove all the long-term stellar activity contributions. Then, we identify the
impulsive events and, derive amplitudes, time scales and the amount of energy
emitted. We validate our procedure using the AU Mic TESS light curves obtaining
results consistent with those presented in the literature. We estimate the
frequency distribution of energetic events for DS Tuc. In particular, we find
that there are approx 2 events per day with energy greater than 2x10^32 erg. We
find evidence for a favoured stellar phase for short term activity on AU Mic,
and also indications of short term activity in phase with the planetary orbit.
For DS Tuc we find that the events distribution is not equally spaced in time
but often grouped. The resulting distribution may be used to estimate the
impact of short term variability on planetary atmosphere chemical compositions.

important role in modern recommender systems. Neural sequential recommendation
models, which formulates learning the user-item relevance as a sequential

both industry and academic due to their substantial practical value. Though
achieving many practical successes, we argue that the intrinsic {\bf
incompleteness} and {\bf inaccuracy} of user behaviors in implicit feedback
data is ignored and conduct preliminary experiments for supporting our claims.
Motivated by the observation that model-free methods like behavioral
retargeting (BR) and item-based collaborative filtering (ItemCF) hit different
parts of the user-item relevance compared to neural sequential recommendation
models, we propose a novel model-agnostic training approach called WSLRec,
which adopts a three-stage framework: pre-training, top-$k$ mining, and
fine-tuning. WSLRec resolves the incompleteness problem by pre-training models
on extra weak supervisions from model-free methods like BR and ItemCF, while
resolves the inaccuracy problem by leveraging the top-$k$ mining to screen out
reliable user-item relevance from weak supervisions for fine-tuning.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets and online A/B tests verify the
rationality of our claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of WSLRec.

would be expected based on the reported radiology findings. Materials and
Methods. A deidentified data set from an academic hospital containing 258
mammography reports supplemented by 120 reports found on the web was used for
training and evaluation. Spell checking and term normalization was used to
unambiguously determine the reported BI-RADS descriptors. The resulting data
were input into seven classifiers that classify mammography reports, based on
their Findings sections, into seven BI-RADS final assessment categories.
Finally, the semantic similarity score of a report to each BI-RADS category is
reported. Results. Our term normalization algorithm correctly identified 97% of
the BI-RADS descriptors in mammography reports. Our system provided 76%
precision and 83% recall in correctly classifying the reports according to

relies on providing high importance to BI-RADS terms in the summarization

by exploiting the interplay of higher-order topological insulator (HOTI)
physics and the so-called non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). The higher-order
topology allows for the amplification and hence lasing of a single-mode
protected by a band gap; whereas the NHSE, widely known to accumulate
population in a biased direction in non-Hermitian systems, is introduced to
compete with the topological localization of corner modes. By tuning the system
parameters appropriately and pumping at one site only, a single topologically
protected lasing mode delocalized across over two dimensions emerges, with its
power widely tunable by adjusting the pump strength. Computational studies
clearly indicate that the lasing mode thus engineered is stable, and the phase
difference between nearest lasing sites is locked at zero, even after the
disorder is accounted for. The total power of the lasing mode forming a 2D
topological laser array is proportional to the area of the 2D lattice
accommodating a HOTI phase. Based on existing experiments, we further propose
to use coupled optical ring resonators as a promising platform to realize

optimising, and reasoning about programs over inductive and coinductive
datatypes. Their plain forms, catamorphisms and anamorphisms, are restricted in
expressiveness. Thus many generalisations have been proposed, which further
lead to several unifying frameworks of structured recursion schemes. However,
the existing work on unifying frameworks typically focuses on the categorical
foundation, and thus is perhaps inaccessible to practitioners who are willing
to apply recursion schemes in practice but are not versed in category theory.
To fill this gap, this expository paper introduces structured recursion schemes
from a practical point of view: a variety of recursion schemes are motivated
and explained in contexts of concrete programming examples. The categorical
duals of these recursion schemes are also explained.

self-similar structure in certain specified circumstances. In the semiclassical
regime, when the spectral parameter and the number of vertices tend to
infinity, we derive an asymptotic condition for the Mellin transform of a
specified function arising from the set of bond lengths which yields an
asymptotic for the Renyi entropy associated with an eigenfunction. We apply
this result to show that one may construct simple quantum star graphs which
satisfy a multifractal scaling law. In the low frequency regime we prove
multifractality by computing the Renyi entropy in terms of a zeta function
associated with the set of bond lengths. In certain arithmetic cases the
fractal exponent D_q satisfies a symmetry relation around q=1/4 which arises
from the functional equation of the zeta function. Our results are, in some
sense, analogous to the multifractal scaling law that the authors recently
proved for arithmetic Seba billiards. However, unlike in that case, we do not
require arithmetic conditions to be satisfied, and nor do we rely on delicate

estimating precision with spectrum analysis is about $10 ^{-5}$ nm by using a
currently available spectrometer with the resolution of $\Delta \lambda= 0.04$
pm and the corresponding sensitivity is better than 0.1 THz/nm. And the
precision and sensitivity of the light intensity analysis scheme achieve as

particular, simple mass action kinetics cannot describe chemical reactions
since phase separation requires non-ideal fluids. Instead, thermodynamics
implies that passive chemical reactions reduce the complexity of phase diagrams
and provide only limited control over the system's behavior. However, driven
chemical reactions, which use external energy input to create spatial fluxes,
can circumvent thermodynamic constraints. Such active systems can suppress the
typical droplet coarsening, control droplet size, and localize droplets. This

variability from sequential beat-to-beat intervals (BBI) and pulse wave
velocity from spatially resolved recorded pulse waves. In either case,
sufficient temporal accuracy is essential.
  The presented work investigates the temporal accuracy of BBI estimation from
photoplethysmographic signals. Within comprehensive numerical simulation, we
systematically assess the impact of sampling rate, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
and beat-to-beat shape variations on the root mean square error (RMSE) between
real and estimated BBI.
  Our results show that at sampling rates beyond 14 Hz only small errors exist
when interpolation is used. For example, the average RMSE is 3 ms for a
sampling rate of 14 Hz and an SNR of 18 dB. Further increasing the sampling
rate only results in marginal improvements, e.g. more than tripling the
sampling rate to 50 Hz reduces the error by approx. 14%. The most important
finding relates to the SNR, which is shown to have a much stronger influence on
the error than the sampling rate. For example, increasing the SNR from 18 dB to
24 dB at 14 Hz sampling rate reduced the error by almost 50% to 1.5 ms. Subtle
beat-to-beat shape variations, moreover, increase the error decisively by up to
800%.
  Our results are highly relevant in three regards: first, they partially
explain different results in the literature on minimum sampling rates. Second,
they emphasize the importance to consider SNR and possibly shape variation in
investigations on the minimal sampling rate. Third, they underline the
importance of appropriate processing techniques to increase SNR. Importantly,
though our motivation is PPGI, the presented work immediately applies to
contact PPG and PPG in other settings such as wearables. To enable further
investigations, we make the scripts used in modelling and simulation freely

of this problem and the difficulty to solve it using conventional methods, we
propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
framework, called DeepRAT, to solve it efficiently and learn system dynamics.
In particular, the DeepRAT framework decomposes the problem into two main
stages; the RATs-EDs assignment stage, which implements a single-agent Deep Q
Network (DQN) algorithm, and the power allocation stage, which utilizes a
multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Using
simulations, we demonstrate how the various DRL agents efficiently interact to
learn system dynamics and derive the global optimal policy. Furthermore, our
simulation results show that the proposed DeepRAT algorithm outperforms
existing state-of-the-art heuristic approaches in terms of network utility.
Finally, we quantitatively show the ability of the DeepRAT model to quickly and
dynamically adapt to abrupt changes in network dynamics, such as EDs mobility.

state-of-the-art monolingual pre-trained models. In this paper, we aim to
improve the multilingual model's supervised and zero-shot performance
simultaneously only with the resources from supervised languages. Our approach
is based on transferring knowledge from high-performance monolingual models
with a teacher-student framework. We let the multilingual model learn from
multiple monolingual models simultaneously. To exploit the model's
cross-lingual transferability, we propose MBLM (multi-branch multilingual
language model), a model built on the MPLMs with multiple language branches.
Each branch is a stack of transformers. MBLM is trained with the
zero-shot-aware training strategy that encourages the model to learn from the
mixture of zero-shot representations from all the branches. The results on two
cross-lingual classification tasks show that, with only the task's supervised
data used, our method improves both the supervised and zero-shot performance of
MPLMs.

Images are first processed by the encoder to extract features. Then, to account
for perspective distortion, the highest-level feature map is fed to extra
components to extract multiscale features, which are the input to the decoder
to generate crowd densities. However, in these methods, features extracted at
earlier stages during encoding are underutilised, and the multiscale modules
can only capture a limited range of receptive fields, albeit with considerable
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel crowd counting architecture
(FusionCount), which exploits the adaptive fusion of a large majority of

obtain multiscale features. Thus, it can cover a more extensive scope of
receptive field sizes and lower the computational cost. We also introduce a new

suitable analogue of treewidth that is based on edge cuts instead of vertex
separators. While tree-cut width has been coined as such an analogue of
treewidth for edge cuts, its algorithmic applications have often led to
disappointing results: out of twelve problems where one would hope for
fixed-parameter tractability parameterized by an edge-cut based analogue to

  As our main contribution, we develop an edge-cut based analogue to treewidth
called edge-cut width. Edge-cut width is, intuitively, based on measuring the
density of cycles passing through a spanning tree of the graph. Its benefits
include not only a comparatively simple definition, but mainly that it has
interesting algorithmic properties: it can be computed by a fixed-parameter
algorithm, and it yields fixed-parameter algorithms for all the aforementioned
problems where tree-cut width failed to do so.

first stage, by sharing encoder parameters, the NMT model is additionally
supervised by the signal from the CMLM decoder that contains bidirectional
global contexts. Moreover, at the second stage, using the CMLM as teacher, we
further pertinently incorporate bidirectional global context to the NMT model
on its unconfidently-predicted target words via knowledge distillation.
Experimental results show that our proposed CBBGCA training framework

estimation errors, we jointly design the transmit coefficients at the WDs and
the receive strategy at the AP, for minimizing the computation mean squared
error (MSE). First, we consider the single-input single-output (SISO) case with
each WD and AP equipped with one single antenna, in which the globally optimal
solution to the computation MSE minimization problem is obtained in closed
form. Next, we consider the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) case with
multiple receive antennas at the AP, in which a high-quality solution is
obtained based on alternating optimization and convex optimization. For both
cases, the optimized power control solution at the WDs follows a
threshold-based regularized channel inversion structure; while for the SIMO
case, the receive beamforming at the AP follows a sum-minimum MSE (MMSE)
structure. It is shown that with finite receive antennas, a non-zero
computation MSE is inevitable due to the channel estimation errors even when
the WDs' transmit powers become infinity; while with massive receive antennas,
a vanishing MSE is achievable when the channel vectors are independent and
identically distributed. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Design of diverse applications of bacterial cellulose films also relies on

simulations of the films are most accurate when guided by experimental
characterization of the structures and the resultant diffusion inside.
Diffusion through such films is a function of their key microstructural length
scales, determining how molecules, as well as particles and microorganisms,
permeate them. We use microscopy to study the unique bacterial cellulose film
structure and quantify the mobility dynamics of various sizes of tracer
particles and macromolecules. Mobility is hindered within the films, as
confinement and local movement strongly depend on void size relative to
diffusing tracers. The biofilms have a naturally periodic structure of
alternating dense and porous layers of nanofiber mesh, and we tune the

Tracer mobility in the porous layers is isotropic, indicating a largely random

\leq H \leq H_{c_2}$ in nematic superconductors are shown to be structurally
complicated, in contrast to the triangular or square vortex lattices in
conventional superconductors. For low fields the magnetic response of the
system involves a loosely bound collection of parallel Skyrmion chains. As the
external field is increased the chains attract one another, causing a
transition where the unit cell becomes triangular for high applied fields. This
unique Skyrmion lattice and the magnetic twisting are clear indicators that
could be used experimentally to identify materials that exhibit nematic
superconductivity. To obtain these results we develop and present a novel
method to find the unit cell of a vortex lattice that can be applied to other
kinds of superconducting systems.

quantum physics. It has been predominantly investigated in the context of
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), gaining new interest recently in the
domain of nano-optics. Beyond cavity-QED, spontaneous emission may be modified
also in free space due to correlations among the photon emitters, a phenomenon
known as super- and sub-radiance. Correlations may stem either from direct
interactions between the particles, from long-range exchange of photons, or by
measuring single photons in a common mode. Yet, the genuine spatial spontaneous
emission pattern of an atomic ensemble in an entangled quantum state has not
been observed so far, due to the lack of ultra-fast cameras with high spatial
resolution suited for recording single photons from single atoms. Preparing two
trapped ions in free space in entangled Dicke states via photon detection, we
study the resulting collective spontaneous emission patterns. Depending on the
symmetry of the Dicke states, associated with the direction of detection of the
first state-determining photon, we observe fundamentally different emission
patterns for the subsequently scattered photon, including super- and
sub-radiance. Our results demonstrate that the detection of a single photon can
profoundly modify the collective emission of an atomic array, here represented
by its most elementary building block of two atoms in free space.

interactions with the environment until the target object can be extracted.
These interactions involve executing action primitives like grasping or pushing
as well as setting priorities for the objects to manipulate and the actions to

a heuristic algorithm for pushing and rule-based algorithms for high-level
planning. While rule-based policies profit from human intuition in how they
work, they usually perform sub-optimally in many cases. Deep reinforcement
learning (RL) has shown great performance in complex tasks such as taking

the MS problem in a principled formulation as a hierarchical POMDP. Based on

push policy and an action selection policy. When integrated into the
hierarchical POMDP's policy, our proposed sub-policies increase the success

whereby the tweezers apply small forces on individual ions, may appear to
enable further tuning of the spin-spin interactions, any additional flexibility
is negligible. We conclude that optical tweezers are a useful method for
controlling interactions in trapped ion quantum simulators in the presence of

a parsimonious model of subculture emergence where the algorithm of social

takes is a slight modification of Galton-Pearson's biometric model previously
used to approximate cultural inheritance. The new model includes
proportionality between the variance of inputs (cultural 'parents') and the

lead to the formation of distinct cohesive clusters of individuals

estimating the lesion statuses of stroke diseases and developing appropriate
diagnostic systems. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results,
further adoption of the models is hindered by: (1) inter-class indistinction,
the normal brain tissue resembles the lesion in appearance. (2) intra-class
inconsistency, large variability exists between different areas of the lesion.
To solve these challenges in stroke segmentation, we propose a novel method,
namely Attention Guided Multiscale Recovery framework (AGMR-Net) in this paper.
Firstly, a coarse-grained patch attention module in the encoding is adopted to
get a patch-based coarse-grained attention map in a multi-stage explicitly
supervised way, enabling target spatial context saliency representation with a
patch-based weighting technique that eliminates the effect of intra-class
inconsistency. Secondly, to obtain a more detailed boundary partitioning to
solve the challenge of the inter-class indistinction, a newly designed
cross-dimensional feature fusion module is used to capture global contextual
information to further guide the selective aggregation of 2D and 3D features,
which can compensate for the lack of boundary learning capability of 2D
convolution. Lastly, in the decoding stage, an innovative designed multi-scale
deconvolution upsampling instead of linear interpolation enhances the recovery
of target space and boundary information. The AGMR-Net is evaluated on the open
dataset Anatomical Tracings of Lesions-After-Stroke (ATLAS), achieving the
highest dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of 0.594, Hausdorff distance of
27.005 mm, and average symmetry surface distance of 7.137 mm, which demonstrate
that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has
great potential in the diagnosis of stroke.

examine the behavior of such approximation when the required exactness degree
$2n$ is relaxed to $n+k$ with $0<k\leq n$. Aided by the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund
inequality, we affirm that the $L^2$ norm of the exactness-relaxing

this approximation scheme is convergent as $n\rightarrow\infty$ if $k$ is
positively correlated to $n$. Thus, the family of candidate quadrature rules
for constructing hyperinterpolants can be significantly enriched, and the
number of quadrature points can be considerably reduced. As a potential cost,
this relaxation may slow the convergence rate of hyperinterpolation in terms of
the reduced degrees of quadrature exactness. Our theoretical results are

electrical low-voltage grid topology by solving a variation of the minimum cost
flow linear optimization problem with provided data on secondary substations.
In a final step, the generated grid representation is transferred to a

uses open source software and is fully automated and scalable that allows the
generation of ready-to-use distribution grid simulation models for given 20kV

improved results. The performance of the developed method with respect to grid

popular with the increased availability of computational power. Modern
computational plasma codes, relying upon Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
methods, allow for resolving the coronal features using solar surface
magnetograms as inputs. These computations are carried out in a full 3D domain
and thus selection of the right mesh configuration is essential to save
computational resources and enable/speed up convergence. In addition, it has
been observed that for MHD simulations close to the hydrostatic equilibrium,
spurious numerical artefacts might appear in the solution following the mesh
structure, which makes the selection of the grid also a concern for accuracy.
The purpose of this paper is to discuss and trade off two main mesh topologies
when applied to global solar corona simulations using the unstructured ideal
MHD solver from the COOLFluiD platform. The first topology is based on the
geodesic polyhedron and the second on UV mapping. Focus will be placed on
aspects such as mesh adaptability, resolution distribution, resulting spurious
numerical fluxes and convergence performance. For this purpose, firstly a
rotating dipole case is investigated, followed by two simulations using real
magnetograms from the solar minima (1995) and solar maxima (1999). It is
concluded that the most appropriate mesh topology for the simulation depends on
several factors, such as the accuracy requirements, the presence of features
near the polar regions and/or strong features in the flow field in general. If
convergence is of concern and the simulation contains strong dynamics, then
grids which are based on the geodesic polyhedron are recommended compared to
more conventionally used UV-mapped meshes.

Stability results are also presented. Non linear multipliers are introduced and
studied. This notion is connected with the notion of Lipschitz compact

  For a subclass of approximated Schauder frames for Banach spaces,
characterization result is derived using standard Schauder basis for standard
sequence spaces. Duals of a subclass of approximate Schauder frames are
completely described. Similarity of this class is characterized and
interpolation result is derived using orthogonality. A dilation result is
obtained. A new identity is derived for Banach spaces which admit a homogeneous

  A generalization of operator-valued frames for Hilbert spaces are introduced
which unifies all the known generalizations of frames for Hilbert spaces. This

bio-chemical processes and in the origin of life itself. The observation of
dynamics in chiral molecules is crucial for the understanding and control of
the chiral activity of photo-excited states. One of the most promising
techniques for the study of photo-excited chiral systems is time-resolved
photoelectron circular dichroism (TR-PECD), which offers an intense and
sensitive probe for vibronic and geometric molecular structure as well as
electronic structures, and their evolution on a femtosecond timescale. However,
the non-local character of the PECD effect, which is imprinted during the
electron scattering off the molecule, makes the interpretation of TR-PECD
experiments challenging. In this respect, core-photoionization is known to
allow site- and chemical-sensitivity to photelectron spectroscopy. Here we
demonstrate that TR-PECD utilising core-level photoemission enables probing the
chiral electronic structure and its relaxation dynamics with atomic site
sensitivity. Following UV pumped excitation to a 3s Rydberg state, fenchone
enantiomers (C 10 H 16 O) were probed on a femtosecond scale using circularly
polarized soft X-ray light pulses provided by the free-electron laser FERMI. C
1s binding energy shifts caused by the redistribution of valence electron
density in this 3s-valence-Rydberg excitation allowed us to measure transient
PECD chiral responses with an enhanced C-atom site-selectivity compared to that
achievable in the ground state molecule. These results represent the first
chemical-specific and site-specific, enantio-sensitive observations on the
electronic structure of a photo-excited chiral molecule and pave the way
towards chiral femtochemistry probed by core-level photoemission.

method is generally to calibrate the intrinsic of the camera first and then
calibrate the extrinsic of the LiDAR and camera. If the camera's intrinsic is
not calibrated correctly in the first stage, it isn't easy to calibrate the
LiDAR-camera extrinsic accurately. Due to the complex internal structure of the
camera and the lack of an effective quantitative evaluation method for the
camera's intrinsic calibration, in the actual calibration, the accuracy of
extrinsic parameter calibration is often reduced due to the tiny error of the
camera's intrinsic parameters. To this end, we propose a novel target-based
joint calibration method of the camera intrinsic and LiDAR-camera extrinsic
parameters. Firstly, we design a novel calibration board pattern, adding four
circular holes around the checkerboard for locating the LiDAR pose.
Subsequently, a cost function defined under the reprojection constraints of the
checkerboard and circular holes features is designed to solve the camera's
intrinsic parameters, distortion factor, and LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameter.
In the end, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted in actual

agents donate a part of their wealth, which is, in turn, redistributed equally
among all others. This mimics a socio-economic scenario where people have fixed
incomes, suffer individual economic setbacks, and pay taxes to the state. The
system always reaches a stationary state, which shows a trivial exponential
wealth distribution in the absence of tax dynamics. The introduction of the tax
dynamics leads to several interesting features in the stationary wealth
distribution. In particular, we analytically find that an increase in taxation
for a homogeneous system (where all agents are alike) results in a transition
from a society where agents are most likely poor to another where rich agents
are more common. We also study inhomogeneous systems, where the growth rates of
the agents are chosen from a distribution, and the taxation is proportional to
the individual growth rates. We find an optimal taxation, which produces a
complete economic equality (average wealth is independent of the individual

quantum advantage on near-term devices as the required resources are divided
between a quantum simulator and a classical optimizer. As such, designing a VQA
which is resource-efficient and robust against noise is a key factor to achieve
potential advantage with the existing noisy quantum simulators. It turns out
that a fixed VQA circuit design, such as the widely-used hardware efficient
ansatz, is not necessarily robust against imperfections. In this work, we
propose a genome-length-adjustable evolutionary algorithm to design a robust
VQA circuit that is optimized over variations of both circuit ansatz and gate
parameters, without any prior assumptions on circuit structure or depth.
Remarkably, our method not only generates a noise-effect-minimized circuit with
shallow depth, but also accelerates the classical optimization by substantially
reducing the number of parameters. In this regard, the optimized circuit is far
more resource-efficient with respect to both quantum and classical resources.
As applications, based on two typical error models in VQA, we apply our method
to calculate the ground energy of the hydrogen and the water molecules as well
as the Heisenberg model. Simulations suggest that compared with conventional
hardware efficient ansatz, our circuit-structure-tunable method can generate
circuits apparently more robust against both coherent and incoherent noise, and
hence is more likely to be implemented on near-term devices.

the number of vulnerabilities. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is one promising
mitigation that is more and more widely deployed and prevents numerous
exploits. CFI focuses purely on one security domain. That is, transitions
between user space and kernel space are not protected by CFI. Furthermore, if
user space CFI is bypassed, the system and kernel interfaces remain
unprotected, and an attacker can run arbitrary transitions.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of syscall-flow-integrity protection
(SFIP) that complements the concept of CFI with integrity for user-kernel
transitions. Our proof-of-concept implementation relies on static analysis
during compilation to automatically extract possible syscall transitions. An
application can opt-in to SFIP by providing the extracted information to the
kernel for runtime enforcement. The concept is built on three fully-automated
pillars: First, a syscall state machine, representing possible transitions
according to a syscall digraph model. Second, a syscall-origin mapping, which
maps syscalls to the locations at which they can occur. Third, an efficient
enforcement of syscall-flow integrity in a modified Linux kernel. In our
evaluation, we show that SFIP can be applied to large scale applications with
minimal slowdowns. In a micro- and a macrobenchmark, it only introduces an
overhead of 13.1% and 1.8%, respectively. In terms of security, we discuss and
demonstrate its effectiveness in preventing control-flow-hijacking attacks in
real-world applications. Finally, to highlight the reduction in attack surface,
we perform an analysis of the state machines and syscall-origin mappings of
several real-world applications. On average, SFIP decreases the number of
possible transitions by 38.6% compared to seccomp and 90.9% when no protection
is applied.

notice in a controlled fashion. Relatively flexible markets have the ability to
ramp up (or down) power flows across interties without compromising their
ability to reliably meet internal demand. In this paper, a market mechanism to
enable flexibility trading amongst market operators is introduced. In the
proposed market mechanism, market operators exchange information regarding
optimal terms of trade (nodal prices and flows) along interconnection lines at
every trading round. Equipped with this information, each market operator then
independently solves its own internal chance-constrained economic dispatch
problem and broadcasts the updated optimal terms of trade for flows across
markets. We show the proposed decentralized market mechanism for flexibility
trading converges to a Nash equilibrium of the intraday market coupling game,
i.e. a combination of internal market clearing solutions (one for each
participating market) and flows and prices along interconnection lines so that
no individual market operator has an incentive to modify its own internal
solution and/or the terms of trade along interties. For a specific class of
chance constraints, we show that the limiting equilibrium outcome is efficient,
i.e. it corresponds to the solution of the single market clearing problem for
all participating markets. The proposed market mechanism is illustrated with an
application to the three-area IEEE Reliability Test System.

antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic phases of compounds generally requires the
knowledge of (b) the spin configurations and lattice structure (SCLS) of such
phases at a given temperature. Indeed, studying the coupling between (a) and
(b) has been an outstanding challenge in the theory of magnetism. The
traditional approach to electronic phases of matter has generally focused on
solving the problem of EMP regarding the SCLS as a spectator degree of freedom
(DOF). Yet, it has been recognized that EMP of a compound generally respond
self-consistently to changes in SCLS and vice versa. We construct here a
practical, density functional theory (DFT)-based approach that provides the
SCLS as a function of temperature, involving the description of spin, lattice,
and spin-lattice dynamics of different magnetic phases. We distinguish three
Levels of dynamics: (I) dynamics of the spin DOF treated via noncollinear
Heisenberg Monte-Carlo with exchange energies from DFT, (II) dynamics of the
lattice DOF treated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) employing a fixed
spin configuration from Level I at the simulated temperature, and (III)
coupling of spin and lattice dynamics via Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert spin dynamics
combined with AIMD. Such SCLS at each of the three levels are used as inputs to
DFT supercell calculations, providing the EMP at each temperature. The results
of this sequence include electronic band structures, band gaps, density of
states, as well as the statistical distribution of local moments and the
short-range order parameters, each as a function of temperature. Using NiO as a
test case, we address the separability of the DOF in magnetic insulators for a
minimal description of electronic and magnetic properties, demonstrating that
inclusion of spin dynamics and, to some level, lattice dynamics is enough to
explain the EMP.

derive methods to solve global optimization problems on more general functions.
As the regularity of the functions in the sum of squares decomposition is a key

methods, it is important to have theoretical results guaranteeing such a
regularity. In this work, we show second order sufficient conditions in order
for a $p$ times continuously differentiable non-negative function to be a sum

that it allows sets of zeros which are continuous as opposed to discrete, and
also applies to manifolds as opposed to open sets of $\R^d$. This has
applications in problems where manifolds of minimizers or zeros typically

a separable Hilbert space, and show that with early stopping, the choice of
learning rate influences the spectral decomposition of the obtained solution on
the Hessian's eigenvectors. This extends an intuition described by Nakkiran
(2020) on a two-dimensional toy problem to realistic learning scenarios such as

explain why it already occurs in classification tasks without assuming any

  Multiple Imputation Framework",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Missing values in tabular data restrict the use and performance of machine
learning, requiring the imputation of missing values. The most popular
imputation algorithm is arguably multiple imputations using chains of equations
(MICE), which estimates missing values from linear conditioning on observed
values. This paper proposes methods to improve both the imputation accuracy of
MICE and the classification accuracy of imputed data by replacing MICE's linear
conditioning with ensemble learning and deep neural networks (DNN). The
imputation accuracy is further improved by characterizing individual samples
with cluster labels (CISCL) obtained from the training data. Our extensive
analyses involving six tabular data sets, up to 80% missingness, and three
missingness types (missing completely at random, missing at random, missing not
at random) reveal that ensemble or deep learning within MICE is superior to the
baseline MICE (b-MICE), both of which are consistently outperformed by CISCL.
Results show that CISCL plus b-MICE outperforms b-MICE for all percentages and
types of missingness. Our proposed DNN based MICE and gradient boosting MICE
plus CISCL (GB-MICE-CISCL) outperform seven other baseline imputation
algorithms in most experimental cases. The classification accuracy on the data
imputed by GB-MICE is improved by proposed GB-MICE-CISCL imputed data across
all missingness percentages. Results also reveal a shortcoming of the MICE
framework at high missingness (>50%) and when the missing type is not random.
This paper provides a generalized approach to identifying the best imputation
model for a data set with a missingness percentage and type.

diagram is used to divide region into cells and generate initial solutions that
present the positions of the deployed IoT objects. Then, a genetic algorithm is
executed in parallel in several nodes to improve these positions. The developed
VD-GA approach was evaluated on an experimental environment by prototyping on a
real testbed utilizing M5StickC nodes equipped with ESP32 processor. The
experiments show that the distributed approach provided better degree of

the original algorithms in terms of the suggested distributed Genetic-Voronoi

during natural and artificial ageing was investigated experimentally. The aim
of the study was a better understanding of interactions between hydrogen and
crystalline defects and especially vacancies. Experimental data demonstrate
that during natural ageing in hydrogen environment, the hardening response is
delayed. This is attributed to a slower recovery of excess vacancies linked to
a lower mobility. To confirm and quantify the influence of hydrogen on the
vacancy migration energy, artificial ageing was carried out in conditions where
the vacancy concentration is constant. Hence, long-time annealing treatments
were carried out to investigate the influence of hydrogen on the coarsening of
rod-shaped precipitates. Using transmission electron microscopy and atom probe
tomography, it was demonstrated that the precipitate volume fraction and
composition are unchanged under H2 atmosphere but the coarsening kinetic is
significantly reduced. This leads to a delayed softening, in good agreement
with theoretical estimates. Thus, even a low concentration of hydrogen in solid
solution significantly affects the mobility of alloying elements in the
aluminium matrix. This is the result of hydrogen-vacancy interactions that lead
to an increase of the vacancy migration energy. Based on classical coarsening
theories, it was possible to demonstrate that this increase is of about 5% for
a concentration of hydrogen close to the vacancy concentration.

against SCAE, where the attacker can generate adversarial perturbations based
on reducing the contribution of the object capsules in SCAE related to the
original category of the image. The adversarial perturbations are then applied
to the original images, and the perturbed images will be misclassified.
Furthermore, we propose a defense method called Hybrid Adversarial Training

adversarial distillation to achieve better robustness and stability. We
evaluate the defense method and the experimental results show that the refined

non-Markovian and Markovian open quantum dynamics. From the global point of
view, by tuning the base frequency we demonstrate the transition from the
Markovianity to the non-Markovianity as measured by the quantum mutual
information (QMI). In a Markovian open quantum process, the QMI decays
monotonically, while it may rise temporarily in a non-Markovian process.
However, under some circumstances, it is not sufficient to globally investigate
the non-Markovianity of the open quantum dynamics. As an essential supplement,
we further utilize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) flow to locally

optimal controller for linear systems with potentially adversarial disturbances
and known or adversarial initial conditions. The dynamic regret is defined as
the difference between the true incurred cost of the system and the cost which
could have optimally been achieved under any input sequence having full
knowledge of all future disturbances for a given disturbance energy. This
problem formulation can be seen as an alternative to classical $\mathcal{H}_2$-
or $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-control. The proposed controller synthesis is based on
the system level parametrisation, which allows reformulating the dynamic regret
problem as a semi-definite problem. This yields a new framework that allows to
consider structured dynamic regret problems, which have not yet been considered
in the literature. For known pointwise ellipsoidal bounds on the disturbance,
we show that the dynamic regret bound can be improved compared to using only a
bounded energy assumption and that the optimal dynamic regret bound differs by
at most a factor of $\frac{2}{\pi}$ from the computed solution. Furthermore,
the proposed framework allows guaranteeing state and input constraint
satisfaction.

zone (IF-ZCZ) sequence sets is proposed by well designed finite Zak transform
lattice tessellation. Each set is characterized by the period of sequences
$KM$, the set size $K$ and the length of zero correlation zone $M-1$, which is
optimal with respect to the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound. Secondly, the
transformations that keep the properties of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence set
unchanged are given, and the equivalent relation of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence
set is defined based on these transformations. Then, it is proved that the
general construction of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence set proposed by Popovic is
equivalent to the simple construction of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence set, which
indicates that the generation of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence set can be
simplified. Moreover, it is pointed out that the alphabet size for the special
case of the simple construction of the optimal IF-ZCZ sequence set can be a
factor of the period. Finally, both the simple construction of the optimal
IF-ZCZ sequence set and its special case have sparse and highly structured Zak
spectra, which can greatly reduce the computational complexity of implementing
matched filter banks.

argue that any model that can do this must lie outside the particularly well

because in fairness settings, models in this class entail a particularly strong
causal assumption, normally only seen in a randomised controlled trial. We
argue that in general this is unlikely to hold. Furthermore, we show in many

flat bands, which offer opportunity to investigate many intriguing physics
associated with strong electron correlations. In the existing systems,
ultra-flat bands only emerge at very small twist angles less than a few
degrees, which poses challenge for experimental study and practical
applications. Here, we propose a new design principle to achieve low-energy
ultra-flat bands with increased twist angles. The key condition is to have a 2D
semiconducting material with large energy difference of band edges controlled
by stacking. We show that the interlayer interaction leads to defect-like
states under twisting, which forms a flat band in the semiconducting band gap
with dispersion strongly suppressed by the large energy barriers in the moire
superlattice even for large twist angles. We explicitly demonstrate our idea in
bilayer alpha-In2Se3 and bilayer InSe. For bilayer alpha-In2Se3, we show that a
twist angle -13.2 degree is sufficient to achieve the band flatness comparable
to that of twist bilayer graphene at the magic angle -1.1 degree. In addition,
the appearance of ultra-flat bands here is not sensitive to the twist angle as
in bilayer graphene, and it can be further controlled by external gate fields.
Our finding provides a new route to achieve ultra-flat bands other than
reducing the twist angles and paves the way towards engineering such flat bands
in a large family of 2D materials.

parametric computer-aided design (CAD), with the major focus on its advances in
the last 15 years. Geometric constraint solving can date back to the very first
CAD prototype, Sketchpad, in the 1960s, but serious research studies were
carried out only after parametric CAD was introduced in the late 1980s. In the
following 30-year history of GCS research, two development stages may be
identified: (1) the first 15 years (late 1980s - mid 2000s) were primarily
devoted to geometric constraint decomposition for well-constrained systems or
those with only structural constraint dependencies; and (2) the second 15 years
(late 2000s - now) have seen research efforts shifted towards classification
criteria and decomposition algorithms for general constraint systems (with and
without non-structural constraint dependencies). Most existing reviews focused
on the first 15 years. The problem researched in the second 15 years is,
however, equally important, considering that a manually specified constraint
system usually contains under- and over-constrained parts, and that such parts
must be correctly detected and resolved before numerical solving can work. In
this regard, this review paper covers both stages and will discusses what has
already been made possible for handling general constraint systems, what
developments can be expected in the near future, and which areas remain
problematic.

objects (NEOs) collected on the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) as part
of the MIT-Hawaii NEO Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS). These measurements were
combined with previously published data (Binzel et al. 2019) and bias-corrected
to derive the intrinsic compositional distribution of the overall NEO
population, as well as of subpopulations coming from various escape routes
(ERs) in the asteroid belt and beyond. The resulting distributions reflect well
the overall compositional gradient of the asteroid belt, with decreasing
fractions of silicate-rich (S- and Q-type) bodies and increasing fractions of
carbonaceous (B-, C-, D- and P-type) bodies as a function of increasing ER
distance from the Sun. The close compositional match between NEOs and their
predicted source populations validates dynamical models used to identify ERs
and argues against any strong composition change with size in the asteroid belt
between ~5 km down to ~100 m. A notable exception comes from the over-abundance
of D-type NEOs from the 5:2J and, to a lesser extend, the 3:1J and nu6 ERs,
hinting at the presence of a large population of small D-type asteroids in the
main belt. Alternatively, this excess may indicate preferential spectral
evolution from D-type surfaces to C- and P-types as a consequence of space
weathering, or to the fact that D-type objects fragment more often than other
spectral types in the NEO space. No further evidence for the existence of
collisional families in the main belt, below the detection limit of current
main-belt surveys, was found in this work.

identify spectral matches between 500 asteroid spectra and over 1,000 samples
of RELAB meteorite spectra over 0.45-2.5 microns. We reproduce many major and
previously known meteorite-asteroid connections and find possible new, more
rare or less-established connections. Well-established connections include:
ordinary chondrites (OC) with S-complex asteroids; pristine CM carbonaceous
chondrites with Ch-type asteroids and heated CMs with C-type asteroids; HED
meteorites with V-types; enstatite chondrites with Xc-type asteroids; CV
meteorites with K-type asteroids; Brachinites, Pallasites and R chondrites with
olivine-dominated A-type asteroids.
  We find a trend from Q, Sq, S, Sr to Sv correlates with LL to H, with Q-types
matching predominately to L and LL ordinary chondrites, and Sr and Sv matching
predominantly with L and H ordinary chondrites. Ordinary chondrite samples that
match to the X-complex, all measurements of slabs and many labeled as dark or
black (shocked) OCs. We find carbonaceous chondrite samples having spectral
slopes large enough to match D-type asteroid spectra.
  In many cases the asteroid type to meteorite type links are not unique. While
there are well established matches between an asteroid class and meteorite
class, there are less common but still spectrally compatible matches between
many asteroid types and meteorite types. This result emphasizes the diversity
of asteroid and meteorite compositions and highlights the degeneracy of
classification by spectral features alone. Recent and upcoming spacecraft
missions will shed light on the compositions of many of the asteroid classes,
particularly those without diagnostic features, (C-, B-, X-, and D-types), with
measurements of Ceres, Ryugu, Bennu, Psyche, and C-, P-, and D-types as part of

sentence embeddings. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning (SCL) is
regarded as a promising way to address this problem. However, the existing
works mainly rely on hand-crafted data annotation heuristics to generate
positive training samples, which not only call for domain expertise and
laborious tuning, but are also prone to the following unfavorable cases: 1)
trivial positives, 2) coarse-grained positives, and 3) false positives. As a
result, the self-supervision's quality can be severely limited in reality. In
this work, we propose a novel framework InfoCSE to address the above problems.
Instead of relying on annotation heuristics defined by humans, it leverages the
sentence representation model itself and realizes the following iterative
self-supervision process: on one hand, the improvement of sentence
representation may contribute to the quality of data annotation; on the other
hand, more effective data annotation helps to generate high-quality positive
samples, which will further improve the current sentence representation model.
In other words, the representation learning and data annotation become mutually
reinforced, where a strong self-supervision effect can be derived. Extensive
experiments are performed based on three benchmark datasets, where notable
improvements can be achieved against the existing SCL-based methods.

Thick (CT) AGNs. The X-ray emission is complex, requiring both photoionized and
shock-ionized gas. It originates from high ionization regions and is surrounded
by cocoons of low ionization narrow line emission regions (LINERS). Bicone 3-6
keV continuum and 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha emission has been detected, contrary to the
standard AGN model expectation that would confine this hard emission to the
pc-size nuclear absorbing torus. Extended emission in the cross-cone direction,
also requires modifications to the AGN standard model. A porous torus, with a

discuss these results and their implications for both the AGN model and our

feedback mechanisms are at work: radiation affects the inner molecular clouds
of the host on a ~1 kpc scale; shocks of relativistic jets with the host ISM a
few kpc from the central AGN; and photoionization of the ISM via winds on

how to re-stain an unstained (grayscale) image. Two digital stains, Hematoxylin

We proposed a staining loss to maintain the correctness of stain intensity
during the restaining process. Thanks to the self-supervised nature, paired
training samples are no longer necessary, which demonstrates great flexibility
in practical usage. Our RestainNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with regard to color correctness and structure
preservation. We further conducted experiments on the segmentation and

precisely evaluate BH feedback to its environments. Aiming at studying the
unique gas dynamics of super-Eddington flow around supermassive black hole
(SMBH) seeds at high redshift, we carried out axisymmetric two dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic simulations by a nested simulation-box method. Here we
divide the simulation box into the inner zone at $(2 - 3 \times 10^3)
r_{\rm{Sch}}$ (with $r_{\rm Sch}$ being the Schwarzschild radius) and the outer
zone at $(2\times 10^{3} - 3\times 10^6) r_{\rm{Sch}}$, with smooth connection
of the physical quantities, such as gas density, velocity, and radiation
energy. We start the calculation by injecting mass through the outer boundary
of the inner zone at a constant rate of
$\dot{M}_{\rm{inj}}=10^3L_{\rm{Edd}}/c^2$, where $L_{\rm{Edd}}$ is the
Eddington luminosity and $c$ is the speed of light. A powerful outflow is
generated in the innermost region and it propagates from the inner zone to the
outer zone. The outflows are characterized by a velocity of 0.02$c$ (0.7$c$)
and density of $10^{-17}$ ($10^{-19}$) g cm$^{-3}$ for near the edge-on
(face-on) direction. The outflow is gradually accelerated as it travels by
accepting radiation-pressure force. The final mass outflow rate at the
outermost boundary is $\dot{M}_{\rm{out}}\sim 0.3 \times \dot{M}_{\rm{inj}}$.
By extrapolating the outflow structure to a further larger scale, we find that
the momentum and energy fluxes at $r \sim 0.1$ pc are $\sim 10-100
L_{\rm{Edd}}/c $ and $\sim 0.1-10 L_{\rm{Edd}}$, respectively. Moreover, we
find that the impacts are highly anisotropic in the sense that larger impacts
are given towards the face-on direction than in the edge-on direction. These
results indicate that the BH feedback will more efficiently work on the
interstellar medium than that assumed in the cosmological simulations.

consequence, fermions in this lattice manifest a semiconducting behavior below

the superconducting phase can occur. We discuss an interplay between the
semiconductor--superconductor transition and the possibility of realization of
the spin-polarized superconductivity (the so-called Sarma phase). We show that
the critical interaction can be tuned by the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN)
hopping in the absence of the magnetic field. Moreover, a critical value of the
NNN hopping exists, defining a range of parameters for which the semiconducting
phase can emerge. In the weak coupling limit case, this quantum phase
transition occurs for the absolute value of the NNN hopping equal to one third
of the hopping between the nearest neighbors. Similarly, in the presence of the
magnetic field, the Sarma phase can appear, but only in a range of parameters
for which initially the semiconducting state is observed. Both of these aspects
are attributed to the Lifshitz transition, which is induced by the NNN hopping
as well as the external magnetic field.

to isolate from the stellar absorption lines. Here, these challenges are
discussed in the framework of Solar System observations, and transits of
Mercury in particular. Radiation pressure is important for alkali gas dynamics
in close-orbiting exoplanets since the D lines are efficient at resonant
scattering. When the star-planet velocity is >10km/s, eccentric exoplanets
experience more than an order of magnitude higher radiation pressures, aiding
atmospheric escape and producing a larger effective cross-section for absorbing
starlight at the phase of transit. The Doppler shift also aids in isolating the
planetary signature from the stellar photosphere's absorption. Only one
transiting exoplanet, HD 80606b, is presently thought to have both this
requisite Doppler shift and alkali absorption. Radiation pressure on a
planetary exosphere naturally produces blue-shifted absorption, but at levels
insufficient to account for the extreme Doppler shifts that have been inferred
from potassium transit measurements of this system. In the absence of clear
mechanisms to generate such a strong wind, it is described how this
characteristic could arise from an exomoon-magnetosphere interaction, analogous
to Io-Jupiter. At low contrasts presented here, follow-up transit spectra of HD
80606b cannot rule out a potassium jet or atmospheric species with a broad
absorption structure. However, it is evident that line absorption within the
imaging passbands fails to explain the narrow-band photometry that has been
reported in-transit. New observations of energetic alkalis produced by the
Io-Jupiter interaction are also presented, which illustrate that energetic
sodium Doppler structure offers a more valuable marker for the presence of an
exomoon than potassium.

intermediate mass Black Holes (BH) in the halo of the Milky Way, using archival
data from EROS-2 and MACHO photometric surveys towards the Large Magellanic
Cloud. We combined data from these two surveys to create a common database of
light curves for 14.1 million objects in LMC, covering a total duration of 10.6
years, with flux series measured through four wide passbands. We have carried
out a microlensing search on these light curves, complemented by the light
curves of 22.7 million objects, observed by EROS-2 only or MACHO only over
about 7 years, with flux series measured through only two passbands. A
likelihood analysis, taking into account LMC self lensing and Milky Way disk
contributions allows us to conclude that compact objects with masses in the
range $10 - 100 M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than $\sim 15\%$ of a standard
halo total mass (at $95\%$ confidence level). Our analysis sensitivity weakens
for heavier objects, although we still exclude that $\sim 50\%$ of the halo be
made of $\sim 1000 M_{\odot}$ BHs. Combined with previous EROS results, an
upper limit of $\sim 15\%$ of the total halo mass can be obtained for the
contribution of compact halo objects in the mass range $10^{-6} - 10^2
M_{\odot}$.

Navier-Stokes equations. Different from the traditional discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) methods with Riemann solvers, the current method adopts a kinetic
evolution process, which is provided by the integral solution of
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model. In the weak formulation of DG method, a
time-dependent evolution function is provided, and both inviscid and viscous
fluxes can be calculated uniformly. The temporal accuracy is achieved by the
two-stage fourth-order discretization, and the second-order gas-kinetic solver
is adopted for the fluxes over the cell interface and the fluxes inside a cell.
Numerical examples, including accuracy tests and Taylor-Green vortex problem,
are presented to validate the efficiency and accuracy of DG-HGKS. Both optimal
convergence and super-convergence are achieved by the current scheme. The
comparison between DG-HGKS and high-order gas-kinetic scheme with weighted
essential non-oscillatory reconstruction (WENO-HGKS) is also given, and the
numerical performances are comparable with the approximate number of degree of
freedom. To accelerate the computation, the DG-HGKS is implemented with the
graphics processing unit (GPU) using compute unified device architecture
(CUDA). The obtained results are also compared with those calculated by the
central processing units (CPU) code in terms of the computational efficiency.
The speedup of GPU code suggests the potential of high-order gas-kinetic

correlated with the introduction of asymmetry into the system. In general,

suitable platform for studying this phenomenon. Here, we report on the
observation of ratchet effects in HgTe-based dual-grating-gate structures
hosting different band structure properties. Applying polarized terahertz laser
radiation we detected linear and polarization independent ratchets, as well as
an radiation-helicity driven circular ratchet effect. Studying the ratchet
effect in devices made of quantum wells (QWs) of different thickness we
observed that the magnitude of the signal substantially increases with
decreasing QW width with a maximum value for devices made of QWs of critical
thickness hosting Dirac fermions. Furthermore, sweeping the gate voltage
amplitude we observed sign-alternating oscillations for gate voltages
corresponding to p-type conductivity. The amplitude of the oscillations is more
than two orders of magnitude larger than the signal for n-type conducting QWs.
The oscillations and the signal enhancement are shown to be caused by the
complex valence band structure of HgTe-based QWs. These peculiar features of
the ratchet currents make these materials an ideal platform for the development
of THz applications.

features in the neutral hydrogen (HI) power spectrum, which serve as conclusive
evidence of cosmological signals. Observing such features at the expected
scales in HI IM auto-correlations, where contribution from systematics is
uncertain, will provide a more convincing cosmological detection. We
demonstrate how the turnover, i.e. the peak of the power spectrum at
ultra-large scales, can be detected with HI IM. We find that a MeerKAT
4,000$\,{\rm deg}^2$ survey using the UHF-band is capable of a $3.1\sigma$
detection of the turnover, relative to a null model power spectrum with no
turnover. This should exceed what is capable by current galaxy surveys in
optical and near-infrared. The detection significance falls to ${\sim}1\sigma$
in MeerKAT's L-band but can reach ${\sim}13\sigma$ with the SKAO, which should
easily surpass the constraints from future Stage-IV-like spectroscopic galaxy
surveys. We also propose a new model-independent methodology for constraining
the precise turnover scale ($k_0$) and our tests on UHF-band simulated data
achieved a precision of 10%. This improved to 2.4% when using the full SKAO. We
demonstrate how the results are robust to foreground contamination by using
transfer functions, even when an incorrect cosmology has been assumed in their
construction. Given that the turnover is related to the horizon scale at
matter-radiation equality, a sufficiently precise constraint of $k_0$ presents
the possibility for a novel probe of cosmology. We therefore present a
potential methodology for constructing a standard-ruler-based distance
measurement, independent of the sound horizon, using the turnover location in
the HI power spectrum.

the weight pathway analysis (WPA), to make them transparent. We consider
weights in pathways that link neurons longitudinally from input neurons to
output neurons, or simply weight pathways, as the basic units for understanding
a neural network, and decompose a neural network into a series of subnetworks
of such weight pathways. A visualization scheme of the subnetworks is presented
that gives longitudinal perspectives of the network like radiographs, making
the internal structures of the network visible. Impacts of parameter
adjustments or structural changes to the network can be visualized via such
radiographs. Characteristic maps are established for subnetworks to
characterize the enhancement or suppression of the influence of input samples
on each output neuron. Using WPA, we discover that neural network store and
utilize information in a holographic way, that is, subnetworks encode all
training samples in a coherent structure and thus only by investigating the
weight pathways can one explore samples stored in the network. Furthermore,
with WPA, we reveal fundamental learning modes of a neural network: the linear
learning mode and the nonlinear learning mode. The former extracts linearly
separable features while the latter extracts linearly inseparable features. The
hidden-layer neurons self-organize into different classes for establishing
learning modes and for reaching the training goal. The finding of learning
modes provides us the theoretical ground for understanding some of the
fundamental problems of machine learning, such as the dynamics of learning
process, the role of linear and nonlinear neurons, as well as the role of

for not only theoretical interest but also applications to quantum
technologies. In those studies on quantum foundations, the notion of
uncertainty plays a primary role among several stunning features of quantum
theory. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate fundamental aspects of
uncertainty. In particular, we address this problem focusing on convexity,
which has an operational origin. We first try to reveal why in quantum theory
similar bounds are often obtained for two types of uncertainty relations,
namely, preparation and measurement uncertainty relations. To do this, we
consider uncertainty relations in the most general framework of physics called
generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). It is proven that some geometric
structures of states connect those two types of uncertainty relations in GPTs
in terms of several expressions such as entropic one. Our result implies what
is essential for the close relation between those uncertainty relations. Then
we consider a broader expression of uncertainty in quantum theory called
quantum incompatibility. Motivated by an operational intuition, we propose and
investigate new quantifications of incompatibility which are related directly
to the convexity of states. It is also shown that there can be observed a
notable phenomenon for those quantities even in the simplest incompatibility
for a pair of mutually unbiased qubit observables. Finally, we study
thermodynamical entropy of mixing in quantum theory, which also can be seen as
a quantification of uncertainty. We consider its operationally natural
extension to GPTs, and then try to characterize how specific the entropy in
quantum theory is. It is shown that the operationally natural entropy is
allowed to exist only in classical and quantum-like theories among a class of
GPTs called regular polygon theories.

electronic topology may ubiquitously emerge in a class of molecular crystals

inverted with those of molecular orbitals. We provide guidelines hunt for such
interstitial-electron-induced topological molecular crystals, especially in the
topological insulating state. They exhibit a variety of exceptional qualities,
as brought about by the intrinsic interplay of molecular crystals, interstitial
electrons, and topological nature: (1) They may host cleavable surfaces along
multiple orientations, with pronounced topological boundary states free from
dangling bonds. (2) Strong response to moderate mechanical perturbations,
whereby topological phase transition would occur under relatively low pressure.
(3) Inherent high-efficiency thermoelectricity as jointly contributed by the
non-parabolic band structure (therewith high thermopower), highly mobile
interstitial electrons (high electrical conductivity), and soft phonons (small
lattice thermal conductivity). (4) Ultralow work function owing to the active
interstitial electrons. We utilize first-principles calculations to demonstrate
these properties with the representative candidate K$_4$Ba$_2$[SnBi$_4$]. Our
work suggests a pathway of realizing topological phases in bulk molecular
systems, which may advance the interdisciplinary research between topological

25. We also find that except at the maximum of NSGA Cycle 25 where the strength
of activity in northern hemisphere would be dominant, the strength of activity

hole masses is based on the virial relation which is dependent on the
distribution of the line-emitting gas and the viewing angle to the source.
Spectropolarimetry enables us to probe the geometry of this line-emitting gas
and allows us to estimate independently the viewing angle of the source by
comparing the spectrum viewed under natural light and in the polarized light.
We performed spectropolarimetric observations of three NLSy1 - Mrk 1044, SDSS
J080101.41+184840.7, and IRAS 04416+1215 using the European Southern

standard data reduction and extract the natural and polarized spectra. We
estimate the Stokes parameters and the viewing angles of the three sources. We
model the Stokes parameters and infer the properties of the scattering media -
located in the equatorial and polar regions, and simulate the spectra observed
both in natural light and in polarized light using the polarization radiative
transfer code STOKES. We confirm that all three sources are high Eddington
ratio objects. We are successful in recovering the observed H$\alpha$ line
profile both in the natural and polarized light using the STOKES modelling. We
recover the polarization fractions of the order of 0.2-0.5% for the three

small-amplitude forcing without threshold, hence potentially cloaking the
instability onset of parametric waves. Their suppression can be achieved by
resorting to a contact line pinned at the container brim with static contact
angle $\theta_s=90^{\circ}$ (brimful condition). However, tunable meniscus
waves are desired in some applications as those of liquid-based biosensors,
where they can be controlled adjusting the shape of the static meniscus by
slightly under/over-filling the vessel ($\theta_s\ne90^{\circ}$) while keeping
the contact line fixed at the brim. Here, we refer to this wetting condition as
nearly-brimful. Although classic inviscid theories based on Floquet analysis
have been reformulated for the case of a pinned contact line (Kidambi 2013),
accounting for (i) viscous dissipation and (ii) static contact angle effects,
including meniscus waves, makes such analyses practically intractable and a
comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. Aiming at filling this
gap, in this work we formalize a weakly nonlinear analysis via multiple
timescale method capable to predict the impact of (i) and (ii) on the
instability onset of viscous sub-harmonic standing waves in both brimful and
nearly-brimful circular-cylinders. Notwithstanding that the form of the
resulting amplitude equation is in fact analogous to that obtained by symmetry
arguments (Douady 1990), the normal form coefficients are here computed
numerically from first principles, thus allowing us to rationalize and
systematically quantify the modifications on the Faraday tongues and on the
associated bifurcation diagrams induced by the interaction of meniscus and

in contrast with extant approaches, where the randomized algorithms assume the
availability of enough colors to guarantee properness deterministically, and
use additional colors for randomization in dealing with the bichromatic cycles,
our algorithms may initially generate colorings that are not necessarily
proper; they only aim at avoiding cycles where all pairs of edges, or vertices,

homochromatic (of the same color). When this goal is reached, they check for

approach of LiDAR and stereo camera using the geometric and photometric
information of surrounding environments without any calibration targets for
automated driving vehicles. Since LiDAR and stereo camera are widely used for
sensor data fusion on automated driving vehicles, their extrinsic calibration
is highly important. However, most of the LiDAR and stereo camera calibration
approaches are mainly target-based and therefore time consuming. Even the newly
developed targetless approaches in last years are either inaccurate or
unsuitable for driving platforms.
  To address those problems, we introduce TEScalib. By applying a 3D mesh
reconstruction-based point cloud registration, the geometric information is
used to estimate the LiDAR to stereo camera extrinsic parameters accurately and
robustly. To calibrate the stereo camera, a photometric error function is
builded and the LiDAR depth is involved to transform key points from one camera
to another. During driving, these two parts are processed iteratively. Besides
that, we also propose an uncertainty analysis for reflecting the reliability of
the estimated extrinsic parameters. Our TEScalib approach evaluated on the
KITTI dataset achieves very promising results.

unified Hamiltonian construction form and edge topology. Remarkably, our
principle of obtaining CZESs can be readily generalized to arbitrary dimension

smooth turning on of the Rabi frequency as required in any experimental

INDRA detector recorded coincident charged particles with nearly $4\pi$
acceptance.The measured isotopic composition of the PLF identified in VAMOS and
the average light charged particle (LCP) multiplicities are promising
observables to study the isospin diffusion.The detection of the PLF in
coincidence with LCP allows the reconstruction of the mass, charge and
excitation energy of the associated initial quasi-projectile nuclei (QP), as
well as the extraction of apparent temperatures.We investigate the suitability
of the isoscaling method with the PLF and the experimental reconstructed QP.The
extracted $\alpha$ and $\Delta$ isoscaling parameters present a dependence on
the considered system combination that could justify their use as a surrogate
for isospin asymmetry in isospin transport studies.The reconstruction of the QP
allows to observe an evolution of the $\alpha/\Delta$ with the size of the QP,
the latter being consistent with a strong surface contribution to the symmetry

reconstruction of the primary source is mandatory for the study of the symmetry

effects from a postulated model. Nevertheless, we can ask for partial
identification, which usually boils down to finding upper and lower bounds of a
causal quantity of interest derived from all solutions compatible with the
encoded structural assumptions. One appealing way to derive such bounds is by
casting it in terms of a constrained optimization method that searches over all
causal models compatible with evidence, as introduced in the classic work of
Balke and Pearl (1994) for discrete data. Although by construction this
guarantees tight bounds, it poses a formidable computational challenge. To cope
with this issue, alternatives include algorithms that are not guaranteed to be
tight, or by introducing restrictions on the class of models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel alternative: inspired by ideas coming from belief
propagation, we enforce compatibility between marginals of a causal model and
data, without constructing a global causal model. We call this collection of
locally consistent marginals the causal marginal polytope. As global
independence constraints disappear when considering small dimensional tractable
marginals, this also leads to a rethinking of how to elicit and express causal
knowledge. We provide an explicit algorithm and implementation of this idea,
and assess its practicality with numerical experiments.

performance of Euclidean models in graph-related learning is still bounded and
limited by the representation ability of Euclidean geometry, especially for
datasets with highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy. Recently, hyperbolic space
has gained increasing popularity in processing graph data with tree-like
structure and power-law distribution, owing to its exponential growth property.
In this survey, we comprehensively revisit the technical details of the current
hyperbolic graph neural networks, unifying them into a general framework and
summarizing the variants of each component. More importantly, we present
various HGNN-related applications. Last, we also identify several challenges,
which potentially serve as guidelines for further flourishing the achievements
of graph learning in hyperbolic spaces.

nowadays widely used for automated driving vehicles, virtual reality and
automatic data generation. However, most approaches are developed for RGB-D
cameras with colored dense point clouds and not suitable for large-scale
outdoor environments using sparse LiDAR point clouds. Since a 3D surface can be
usually observed from multiple camera images with different view poses, an
optimal image patch selection for the texturing and an optimal semantic class
estimation for the semantic mapping are still challenging.
  To address these problems, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction, texturing
and semantic mapping system using LiDAR and camera sensors. An Adaptive
Truncated Signed Distance Function is introduced to describe surfaces
implicitly, which can deal with different LiDAR point sparsities and improve
model quality. The from this implicit function extracted triangle mesh map is
then textured from a series of registered camera images by applying an optimal
image patch selection strategy. Besides that, a Markov Random Field-based data
fusion approach is proposed to estimate the optimal semantic class for each
triangle mesh. Our approach is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, the KITTI
dataset and a dataset recorded with our experimental vehicle. The results show
that the 3D models generated using our approach are more accurate in comparison
to using other state-of-the-art approaches. The texturing and semantic mapping
achieve also very promising results.

generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator based on the linear and quadratic
moment conditions of a specific transformation. We show the consistency and
asymptotic normality of the GMM estimator, and determine the best set of moment

presents a moir\'e superlattice. This system has shown insulating phases at
integer fillings of the moir\'e lattice, precisely the fillings at which a
sufficiently strong Coulomb interaction (U$_{\rm Mott}$) may produce a
metal-insulator Mott transition. Our calculations show that the electronic
states are strongly affected by a significant spectral weight transfer at
interactions with magnitudes expected to be relevant in experiments. This
effect, which emerges at interactions considerably smaller than U$_{\rm Mott}$
and does not require symmetry breaking, impacts the electronic properties at
temperatures above the magnetic transitions producing anomalous temperature and
doping dependences not present without alignment to hBN. Close to the Mott

ferromagnetism arising from intersite exchange interactions to determine the

We also elaborated the dissimilarities of the oscillatory signals induced by

broad-band THz pump, the oscillation central frequency scales linearly with the
energy detected by THz probe beam, rather than centering at an individual

contrast, the narrow-band THz pump centering at $\omega_{\rm pump}$ turns to
consistently drive JPM like alternating electric field, which leads to an
2$\omega_{\rm pump}$ oscillation once $\omega_{\rm pump}$ approaching the

spacecraft observed small extreme ultraviolet (EUV) bursts, termed campfires,
that have been proposed to be brightenings near the apexes of low-lying loops
in the quiet-Sun atmosphere. The underlying magnetic processes driving these
campfires are not understood. During the cruise phase of SO and at a distance
of 0.523\,AU from the Sun, the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on Solar
Orbiter (SO/PHI) observed a quiet-Sun region jointly with SO/EUI, offering the
possibility to investigate the surface magnetic field dynamics underlying
campfires at a spatial resolution of about 380~km.
  In 71\% of the 38 isolated events, campfires are confined between bipolar
magnetic features, which seem to exhibit signatures of magnetic flux
cancellation. The flux cancellation occurs either between the two main
footpoints, or between one of the footpoints of the loop housing the campfire
and a nearby opposite polarity patch. In one particularly clear-cut case, we
detected the emergence of a small-scale magnetic loop in the internetwork
followed soon afterwards by a campfire brightening adjacent to the location of
the linear polarisation signal in the photosphere, that is to say near where
the apex of the emerging loop lays. The rest of the events were observed over
small scattered magnetic features, which could not be identified as magnetic
footpoints of the campfire hosting loops. The majority of campfires could be
driven by magnetic reconnection triggered at the footpoints, similar to the
physical processes occurring in the burst-like EUV events discussed in the
literature. About a quarter of all analysed campfires, however, are not
associated to such magnetic activity in the photosphere, which implies that
other heating mechanisms are energising these small-scale EUV brightenings.

personalized via routinely collected clinical and imaging data enables to
obtain patient-specific predictions of tumor growth and treatment response over
the anatomy of the patient's affected organ. These patient-specific
computational forecasts have been regarded as a promising approach to
personalize the clinical management of cancer and derive optimal treatment
plans for individual patients, which constitute timely and critical needs in
clinical oncology. However, the computer simulation of the underlying
spatiotemporal models can entail a prohibitive computational cost, which
constitutes a barrier to the successful development of clinically-actionable
computational technologies for personalized tumor forecasting. To address this
issue, here we propose to utilize Dynamic-Mode Decomposition (DMD) to construct
a low-dimensional representation of cancer models and accelerate their
simulation. DMD is an unsupervised machine learning method based on the
singular value decomposition that has proven useful in many applications as
both a predictive and a diagnostic tool. We show that DMD may be applied to
Fisher-Kolmogorov models, which constitute an established formulation to
represent untreated solid tumor growth that can further accommodate other
relevant cancer phenomena. Our results show that a DMD implementation of this
model over a clinically-relevant parameter space can yield impressive
predictions, with short to medium-term errors remaining under 1% and long-term
errors remaining under 20%, despite very short training periods. We posit that
this data-driven approach has the potential to greatly reduce the computational
overhead of personalized simulations of cancer models, thereby facilitating
tumor forecasting, parameter identification, uncertainty quantification, and
treatment optimization.

workflow by providing relevant literature and similar patients for a given

by the lack of diverse patient collections and publicly available large-scale
patient-level annotation datasets. In this paper, we aim to define and
benchmark two ReCDS tasks: Patient-to-Article Retrieval (ReCDS-PAR) and
Patient-to-Patient Retrieval (ReCDS-PPR) using a novel dataset called
PMC-Patients. Methods: We extract patient summaries from PubMed Central
articles using simple heuristics and utilize the PubMed citation graph to
define patient-article relevance and patient-patient similarity. We also
implement and evaluate several ReCDS systems on the PMC-Patients benchmarks,
including sparse retrievers, dense retrievers, and nearest neighbor retrievers.
We conduct several case studies to show the clinical utility of PMC-Patients.
Results: PMC-Patients contains 167k patient summaries with 3.1M patient-article
relevance annotations and 293k patient-patient similarity annotations, which is
the largest-scale resource for ReCDS and also one of the largest patient
collections. Human evaluation and analysis show that PMC-Patients is a diverse
dataset with high-quality annotations. The evaluation of various ReCDS systems
shows that the PMC-Patients benchmark is challenging and calls for further
research. Conclusion: We present PMC-Patients, a large-scale, diverse, and
publicly available patient summary dataset with the largest-scale patient-level
relation annotations. Based on PMC-Patients, we formally define two benchmark
tasks for ReCDS systems and evaluate various existing retrieval methods.
PMC-Patients can largely facilitate methodology research on ReCDS systems and
shows real-world clinical utility.

  Modeling and understanding the topological change of vesicle-like membrane at
the scale of a full cell has proved an elusive aim.
  We propose and discuss here a continuum model able to encompass the
fusion/fission transition of a bilayer membrane at the scale of a Large
Unilamellar Vesicle and evaluate the minimal free energy path across the
transition, inspired by the idea that fusion/fission-inducing proteins have
evolved in Nature towards minimal work expenditure.
  The results predict the correct height for the energetic barrier and provide
the force field that, by acting on the membrane, can induce the transition.
They are found in excellent agreement, in terms of intensity, scale, and
spatial localization with experimental data on typical protein systems at play
during the transition.
  The model may pave the way for the development of more complete models of the
process where the dynamics is coupled to the fluid internal and external
environment and to other applications where the topological changes do either
occur or should be prevented.

systems is performed through allocating blocks of subcarriers to each user.
Even though OFDM is the primary waveform for 5G NR systems, research reports
have noted that single carrier modulation (SCM) offers several advantages over
OFDM in massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, making it a
preferred candidate for some future applications such as massive machine type
communications (mMTC). This paper presents a method for SCM resource allocation
and the relevant information recovery algorithms at the receiver. Our emphasis
is on cyclic prefixed SCM, where highly flexible and efficient frequency domain
detection algorithms enable the operation of many simultaneous users in a
massive MIMO uplink scenario. The proposed resource allocation method allows
the number of users to exceed the number of antennas at the base station (BS).
Each single carrier transmission is partitioned into $L$ interleaved streams,
and each user is allocated a number of such streams. One major benefit of SCM
is that each data symbol is spread over the entire bandwidth. As such, the
receiver performance is dictated by the average channel gain across the
transmission band rather than the channel gain at a given frequency bin or a
small group of frequencies. In the proposed setup, each stream may be thought
of as a resource block in SCM, analogous to resource blocks in OFDM. Hence, in
the context of this paper, the terms resource blocks and streams may be used
interchangeably.

propose a novel preprocessing, data alteration method, called EdgeMixup, to
improve model fairness with a linear combination of an input skin lesion image

outperforms much more complex competing methods such as adversarial approaches,
achieving a 10.99% reduction in accuracy gap between light and dark skin tone

Bayesian inference that exploits underlying geometric information of the
posterior distribution in order to efficiently traverse the parameter space.
However, the form of the Hamiltonian necessitates complicated numerical
integrators, such as the generalized leapfrog method, that preserve the
detailed balance condition. The distinguishing feature of these numerical
integrators is that they involve solutions to implicitly defined equations.
Lagrangian Monte Carlo (LMC) proposes to eliminate the fixed point iterations
by transitioning from the Hamiltonian formalism to Lagrangian dynamics, wherein
a fully explicit integrator is available. This work makes several contributions
regarding the numerical integrator used in LMC. First, it has been claimed in
the literature that the integrator is only first-order accurate for the
Lagrangian equations of motion; to the contrary, we show that the LMC
integrator enjoys second order accuracy. Second, the current conception of LMC
requires four determinant computations in every step in order to maintain
detailed balance; we propose a simple modification to the integration procedure
in LMC in order to reduce the number of determinant computations from four to
two while still retaining a fully explicit numerical integration scheme. Third,
we demonstrate that the LMC integrator enjoys a certain robustness to human
error that is not shared with the generalized leapfrog integrator, which can
invalidate detailed balance in the latter case. We discuss these contributions
within the context of several benchmark Bayesian inference tasks.

implementation of algorithms and data structures in computational geometry
presents tremendous difficulties, such as obtaining robust software despite the

meticulous handling of all degenerate cases, which typically are in abundance.
The code of CGAL extensively uses function and class templates in order to
handle these difficulties, which implies that the programmer has to make many
choices that are resolved during compile time (of the C++ modules). While
bindings take effect at run time (of the Python code), the type of the C++
objects that are bound must be known when the bindings are generated, that is,
when they are compiled. The types of the bound objects are instances
(instantiated types) of C++ function and class templates. The number of object
types that can potentially be bound, in implementation of generic
computational-geometry algorithms, is enormous; thus, the generation of the

combinations. We present a system that rapidly generates bindings for desired
object types according to user prescriptions, which enables the convenient use

using history data without active exploration of the environment. To counter
the insufficient coverage and sample scarcity of many offline datasets, the
principle of pessimism has been recently introduced to mitigate high bias of
the estimated values. While pessimistic variants of model-based algorithms
(e.g., value iteration with lower confidence bounds) have been theoretically
investigated, their model-free counterparts -- which do not require explicit
model estimation -- have not been adequately studied, especially in terms of
sample efficiency. To address this inadequacy, we study a pessimistic variant
of Q-learning in the context of finite-horizon Markov decision processes, and
characterize its sample complexity under the single-policy concentrability
assumption which does not require the full coverage of the state-action space.
In addition, a variance-reduced pessimistic Q-learning algorithm is proposed to
achieve near-optimal sample complexity. Altogether, this work highlights the
efficiency of model-free algorithms in offline RL when used in conjunction with
pessimism and variance reduction.

possibility to reconcile this discrepancy in the framework of a model where the

controlled following a sampling mechanism to avoid excessive overheads.
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), an architecture of Recurrent

over the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of Bayesian networks, from

required. Recently, a novel class of probabilistic models, called Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets), have been introduced as a general framework for
generative modeling of discrete and composite objects, such as graphs. In this
work, we propose to use a GFlowNet as an alternative to MCMC for approximating
the posterior distribution over the structure of Bayesian networks, given a
dataset of observations. Generating a sample DAG from this approximate
distribution is viewed as a sequential decision problem, where the graph is
constructed one edge at a time, based on learned transition probabilities.
Through evaluation on both simulated and real data, we show that our approach,

points to the more general problem of describing marked point processes in
spatial statistics. We propose a non-parametric method that goes beyond
standard tools of point pattern analysis and which is based on a mapping
between the points and a ""dominance tree"", constructed from a recursive
analysis of their Voronoi tessellation. Using toy models, we show that the
height of a node in this tree encodes both its mark and the structure of its
neighborhood, reflecting its importance in the system. We use historical
population data in France (1876-2018) and the US (1880-2010) and show that the
method highlights multiscale urban dynamics experienced by these countries.
These include non-monotonous city trajectories in the US, as revealed by the
evolution of their height in the tree. We show that the height of a city in the
tree is less sensitive to different statistical definitions of cities than its
rank in the urban hierarchy. The method also captures the attraction basins of
cities at successive scales, and while in both countries these basin sizes
become more homogeneous at larger scales, they are also more heterogeneous in
France than in the US. Finally, we introduce a simple graphical representation
- the height clock - that monitors the evolution of the role of each city in
its country.

branching laws of infinite dimensional representations. The stratified model
answers this program by relating branching laws of holomorphic discrete series
representations to the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the stratification
space. This program is developed in three cases. First, we consider the

Nowadays, spatiotemporal graph data is becoming increasingly popular and

(e.g. dynamic functional connectivity), to macro-scale (e.g. human mobility
network). Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among
spatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in
network science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by
human knowledge. This usually fit well towards the graph properties which can
be predefined, but cannot do well for the most cases, especially for many key
domains where the human has yet very limited knowledge such as protein folding
and biological neuronal networks. In this paper, we aim at pushing forward the

factorizes spatiotemporal graphs into spatial, temporal, and graph factors as
well as the factors that explain the interplay among them. A variational
objective function and new mutual information thresholding algorithms driven by
information bottleneck theory have been proposed to maximize the

presented of forced nondispersive motions with forward energy cascade. The
model fits the spectral shape of higher harmonics well within statistical
significance and shows that such interactions imply maximum wave steepness in a
balance between forcing and turbulent mixing. The single fitting parameter is
related to the barotropic tidal flow speed, which thereby sets a nonlinear
limit to baroclinic current scales without generating non-linear higher
harmonics directly.

reconstructions produced by the DIP with total variation regularisation (TV).
Specifically, we endow the DIP with conjugate Gaussian-linear model type
error-bars computed from a local linearisation of the neural network around its
optimised parameters. To preserve conjugacy, we approximate the TV regulariser
with a Gaussian surrogate. This approach provides pixel-wise uncertainty
estimates and a marginal likelihood objective for hyperparameter optimisation.
We demonstrate the method on synthetic data and real-measured high-resolution
2D $\mu$CT data, and show that it provides superior calibration of uncertainty
estimates relative to previous probabilistic formulations of the DIP. Our code

abundance of information acquirable. This study aimed to explore a way of
improving the accuracy of gait event detection in the elderly using a single
sensor on the waist and deep learning models. Data was gathered from elderly
subjects equipped with three IMU sensors while they walked. The input was taken
only from the waist sensor was used to train 16 deep-learning models including
CNN, RNN, and CNN-RNN hybrid with or without the Bidirectional and Attention
mechanism. The groundtruth was extracted from foot IMU sensors. Fairly high
accuracy of 99.73% and 93.89% was achieved by the CNN-BiGRU-Att model at the
tolerance window of $\pm$6TS ($\pm$6ms) and $\pm$1TS ($\pm$1ms) respectively.
Advancing from the previous studies exploring gait event detection, the model
showed a great improvement in terms of its prediction error having an MAE of
6.239ms and 5.24ms for HS and TO events respectively at the tolerance window of
$\pm$1TS. The results showed that the use of CNN-RNN hybrid models with
Attention and Bidirectional mechanisms is promising for accurate gait event
detection using a single waist sensor. The study can contribute to reducing the
burden of gait detection and increase its applicability in future wearable
devices that can be used for remote health monitoring (RHM) or diagnosis based
thereon.

muscle disease that appears between the second and forth decade of a patient's

The effective and punctual diagnosis of this disease based on
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) could have a vital role in reducing premature
cardiovascular mortality. In our analysis, we firstly outline the
digitalization process of paper - based ECG signals enhanced by a spatial
filter aiming to eliminate dark regions in the dataset's images that do not
correspond to ECG waveform, producing undesirable noise. Next, we propose the
utilization of a low - complexity convolutional neural network for the
detection of an arrhythmogenic heart disease, that has not been studied through
the usage of deep learning methodology to date, achieving high classification
accuracy, namely 99.98% training and 98.6% testing accuracy, on a disease the
major identification criterion of which are infinitesimal millivolt variations
in the ECG's morphology, in contrast with other arrhythmogenic abnormalities.
Finally, by performing spectral analysis we investigate significant
differentiations in the field of frequencies between normal ECGs and ECGs
corresponding to patients suffering from ARVC. In 16 out of the 18 frequencies
where we encounter statistically significant differentiations, the normal ECGs
are characterized by greater normalized amplitudes compared to the abnormal
ones. The overall research carried out in this article highlights the
importance of integrating mathematical methods into the examination and
effective diagnosis of various diseases, aiming to a substantial contribution

typically achieved through gridding techniques, or histograms in spatial
Fourier space. For Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) 21 cm power spectrum
measurements, extreme levels of gridding resolution are required to reduce
spectral contamination, as explored in other works. However, the role of the
shape of the Fourier space spreading function, or kernel, also has consequences
in reconstructed power spectra. We decompose the instrumental Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) beam into a series of Gaussians and simulate the effects
of finite kernel extents and differing shapes in gridding/degridding for
optimal map making analyses. For the MWA, we find that the kernel must extend
out to 0.001--0.0001% of the maximum value in order to measure the EoR using
foreground avoidance. This requirement changes depending on beam shape, with
compact kernels requiring far smaller extents for similar contamination levels
at the cost of less-optimal errors. However, simple calibration using pixelated
degridding results, regardless of shape of the kernel, cannot recover the EoR
due to catastrophic errors caused by the pixel resolution. Including an opaque
horizon with widefield beams also causes significant spectral contamination via
a beam--horizon interaction that creates an infinitely extended kernel in
Fourier space, which cannot be represented well. Thus, our results indicate
that simple calibration via degridded models and optimal map making for extreme
widefield instrumentation are not feasible.

symmetry that is based on a flat space-time. The universal coupling of all
quantum fields to quantum Yang-Mills gravity is based on the replacement of
$\p_\mu$ by the translational gauge covariant derivative $(\p_\mu
+g\phi_\mu^\nu \p_\nu)$ in the Lagrangians of non-gravitational fields. Near
the surface of the Earth, Yang-Mills gravity causes the phase gradient $\p_k
\th$ to be altered by a factor of $h_1\approx(1- g\phi)\approx 1- 7\times
10^{-10}$. In addition, the usual gauge-invariant combination of phase
gradients and vector potentials ${\bf A}$ in Josephson junctions is modified
and is no longer gauge invariant. The voltage across a Josephson junction is
thus affected by the presence of the gravitational coupling constant $g$, and
is now given by $V_{g21}\approx Q \int_1^2 [- \mbox{\boldmath$ {\bf \nabla}$}
A_0 - h_1^{-2}{\p {\bf A}}/{\p t}]\cdot d{\bf s}$. We propose an experimental
test of Yang-Mills gravity based on this effect. If one were to compare the
voltage across a Josephson junction in a laboratory at rest on Earth with that
across a junction in free fall (e.g., in the International Space Station or in
a plane maneuvering to simulate zero-gravity such as NASA's now-retired ""Vomit
