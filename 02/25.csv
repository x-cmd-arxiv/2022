the model to carry information in long-form audio via a recurrent form, such
that the inference can be performed in a streaming fashion. Additionally, we
investigate two domain adaptation approaches to allow adapting an existing
language identification model without retraining the model parameters for a new
domain. We perform a comparative study of different model topologies under
different constraints of model size, and find that conformer-based models
significantly outperform LSTM and transformer based models. Our experiments
also show that attentive temporal pooling and domain adaptation improve model
accuracy.

now defeated the convolutional neural network in image classification tasks to
become the most widely used tool. However, the theoretical properties of
attention-based models are seldom considered. In this work, we show that with
suitable adaptations, the single-head self-attention transformer with a fixed
number of transformer encoder blocks and free parameters is able to generate
any desired polynomial of the input with no error. The number of transformer
encoder blocks is the same as the degree of the target polynomial. Even more
exciting, we find that these transformer encoder blocks in this model do not
need to be trained. As a direct consequence, we show that the single-head

universal. These surprising theoretical results clearly explain the outstanding
performances of the transformer model and may shed light on future
modifications in real applications. We also provide some experiments to verify
our theoretical result.

paper arXiv:2101.11197.
  This second paper is devoted to studying a non-archimedean counterpart of
Perelman's $\mu$-entropy. The concept originally appeared as $\mu$-character of
polarized family in the previous research arXiv:2004.06393, where we used it to
introduce an analogue of CM line bundle adapted to $\mu$K-stability.
  We firstly show some differential of the characteristic $\mu$-entropy
$\mathbf{\check{\mu}}^\lambda$ is the minus of $\mu^\lambda$-Futaki invariant,
which connects $\mu^\lambda$K-semistability to the maximization of
characteristic $\mu^\lambda$-entropy. It in particular provides us a criterion
for $\mu^\lambda$K-semistability working without detecting the vector $\xi$
involved in the $\mu^\lambda_\xi$-Futaki invariant.
  In the latter part, we propose a non-archimedean pluripotential approach to
the maximization problem. In order to adjust the characteristic $\mu$-entropy
$\mathbf{\check{\mu}}^\lambda$ to Boucksom--Jonsson's non-archimedean
framework, we introduce a natural modification
$\mathbf{\check{\mu}}^\lambda_{\mathrm{NA}}$ which we call non-archimedean
$\mu$-entropy. We extend the non-archimedean $\mu$-entropy from the set of test
configurations to a space $\mathcal{E}^{\exp} (X, L)$ of non-archimedean psh
metrics on the Berkovich space $X^{\mathrm{NA}}$, which is endowed with a
complete metric structure. We introduce a measure $\int \chi

surprisingly easy-looking regular languages that they struggle with. Hahn shows
that for languages where acceptance depends on a single input symbol, a
transformer's classification decisions become less and less confident (that is,
with cross-entropy approaching 1 bit per string) as input strings get longer
and longer. We examine this limitation using two languages: PARITY, the
language of bit strings with an odd number of 1s, and FIRST, the language of
bit strings starting with a 1. We demonstrate three ways of overcoming the
limitation suggested by Hahn's lemma. First, we settle an open question by
constructing a transformer that recognizes PARITY with perfect accuracy, and
similarly for FIRST. Second, we use layer normalization to bring the
cross-entropy of both models arbitrarily close to zero. Third, when
transformers need to focus on a single position, as for FIRST, we find that
they can fail to generalize to longer strings; we offer a simple remedy to this
problem that also improves length generalization in machine translation.

minimizing their personal cost and approximate one-round walks generated by

different scenarios motivated by their inherent satisfaction rather than by
extrinsic rewards from the environment. This behavior, referred to as intrinsic
motivation, has emerged as one solution to address the exploration challenge
derived from reinforcement learning environments with sparse rewards. Diverse
exploration approaches have been proposed to accelerate the learning process
over single- and multi-agent problems with homogeneous agents. However, scarce
studies have elaborated on collaborative learning frameworks between
heterogeneous agents deployed into the same environment, but interacting with
different instances of the latter without any prior knowledge. Beyond the
heterogeneity, each agent's characteristics grant access only to a subset of
the full state space, which may hide different exploration strategies and
optimal solutions. In this work we combine ideas from intrinsic motivation and
transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on sharing parameters in actor-critic
model architectures and on combining information obtained through intrinsic
motivation with the aim of having a more efficient exploration and faster
learning. We test our strategies through experiments performed over a modified
ViZDooM's My Way Home scenario, which is more challenging than its original
version and allows evaluating the heterogeneity between agents. Our results
reveal different ways in which a collaborative framework with little additional
computational cost can outperform an independent learning process without

the design of efficient algorithms, but applying them to optimize existing
programs is difficult. Therefore, many research efforts have been devoted to
the automatic application of algorithmic paradigms. However, most existing
approaches to this problem are based on deductive methods and thus put
significant restrictions on how the original program is implemented. To
overcome this limitation, we study the automatic application of paradigms as an
oracle-guided inductive synthesis problem, where the synthesizer only invokes
the original program as a black-box oracle or uses a given verifier to verify
the correctness of candidate programs. Such a synthesizer puts no restriction
on the original program and thus overcomes the limitation of deductive
approaches.
  We notice that the application tasks of various paradigms have a similar form
as that of D&C. We denote these paradigms as D&C-like paradigms, unify their
application tasks into a novel type of synthesis problems, named lifting
problems, and propose an efficient inductive synthesizer AutoLifter for lifting
problems. The main challenge of solving lifting problems is from the usually
large scale of efficient algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we divide and
conquer lifting problems. We devise two novel decomposition methods, component
elimination and variable elimination, to soundly divide a lifting problem into
simpler subtasks, each tractable with existing inductive synthesizers.
  We evaluate AutoLifter on 96 programming tasks related to 6 different
algorithmic paradigms. AutoLifter solves 82/96 tasks with an average time cost
of 6.53 seconds, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

over the event structure declaratively characterise a wide range of concurrency

take advantage of this spectral similarity to derive a precise analytic

the cell membrane and other biological interfaces occurs in many cellular
processes. Previous modeling studies have considered the dynamics of a single
rod on fluid planar membranes. We extend these studies to the more
physiologically relevant case of a single filament moving in a spherical
membrane. Specifically, we use a slender-body formulation to compute the
translational and rotational resistance of a single filament of length $L$
moving in a membrane of radius $R$ and 2D viscosity $\eta_m$, and surrounded on
its interior and exterior with Newtonian fluids of viscosities $\eta^{-}$ and
$\eta^{+}$. We first discuss the case where the filament's curvature is at its
minimum $\kappa=1/R$. We show that the boundedness of spherical geometry gives
rise to flow confinement effects that increase in strength with increasing the
ratio of filament's length to membrane radius $L/R$. These confinement flows
only result in a mild increase in filament's resistance along its axis,
$\xi_{\parallel}$, and its rotational resistance, $\xi_{\Omega}$. As a result,
our predictions of $\xi_\parallel$ and $\xi_{\Omega}$ can be quantitatively
mapped to the results on a planar membrane. In contrast, we find that the drag
in perpendicular direction, $\xi_\perp$, increases superlinearly with the
filament's length, when $L/R >1$ and ultimately $\xi_\perp \to \infty$ as $L/R
\to \pi$. Next, we consider the effect of the filament's curvature, $\kappa$,
on its parallel motion, while fixing the membrane's radius. We show that the
flow around the filament becomes increasingly more asymmetric with increasing
its curvature. These flow asymmetries induce a net torque on the filament,
coupling its parallel and rotational dynamics. This coupling becomes stronger

probability of finding a quantum system in a virtual state should be
vanishingly small at all times. In contrast to this notion, we report a
phenomenon occurring in open quantum systems by which virtual states can
acquire a sizable population in the long time limit, even if they are not
directly coupled to any dissipative channel. This means that the situation
where the virtual state remains unpopulated can be metastable. We describe this
effect by introducing a two-step adiabiatic elimination method, that we termed
hierarchical adiabatic elimination, which allows one to obtain analytical
expressions of the timescale of metastability in general open quantum systems.
We show how these results can be relevant for practical questions such as the
generation of stable and metastable entangled states in dissipative systems of
interacting qubits.

generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good
at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language,
it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a
particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of
studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of
whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution
generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and
transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge
representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and
relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to
higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the
neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors
such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit
a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how
reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which
impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not
always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical
approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the
development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better
understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on

implement frequency conversion across the waveguides, mediated by the molecule,

phase transition in their cores, taking into account current constraints from
nuclear experiments and multi-messenger observations. We include magnetic field
effects considering the Landau level quantisation of charged particles and the
anomalous magnetic moment of neutral particles. We construct the magnetised
hybrid equation of state, and we compute the particle population, the matter
magnetisation and the transverse and parallel pressure components. We integrate
the stable stellar models, considering the dynamical stability for \emph{rapid}
or \emph{slow} hadron-quark phase conversion. Finally, we calculate the
frequencies and damping times of the fundamental and $g$ non-radial oscillation
modes. The latter, a key mode to learn about phase transitions in compact
objects, is only obtained for stars with slow conversions. For low magnetic
fields, we find that one of the objects of the GW170817 binary system might be
a hybrid star belonging to the slow extended stability branch. For magnetars,
we find that a stronger magnetic field always softens the hadronic equation of
state. Besides, only for some parameter combinations a stronger magnetic field
implies a higher hybrid star maximum mass. Contrary to previous results, the
incorporation of anomalous magnetic moment does not affect the studied
astrophysical quantities. We discuss possible imprints of the microphysics of
the equation of state that could be tested observationally in the future, and
that might help infer the nature of dense matter and hybrid stars.

constitute excellent model systems to investigate how evolution relates to
structure, folding and function. Here, we propose a scheme to map evolutionary
information at the sequence level to a coarse-grained model for repeat-protein
folding and use it to investigate the folding of thousands of repeat-proteins.
We model the energetics by a combination of an inverse Potts model scheme with
an explicit mechanistic model of duplications and deletions of repeats to
calculate the evolutionary parameters of the system at single residue level.
This is used to inform an Ising-like model that allows for the generation of
folding curves, apparent domain emergence and occupation of intermediate states
that are highly compatible with experimental data in specific case studies. We
analyzed the folding of thousands of natural Ankyrin-repeat proteins and found
that a multiplicity of folding mechanisms are possible. Fully cooperative
all-or-none transition are obtained for arrays with enough sequence-similar
elements and strong interactions between them, while non-cooperative
element-by-element intermittent folding arose if the elements are dissimilar
and the interactions between them are energetically weak. In between, we
characterised nucleation-propagation and multi-domain folding mechanisms.
Finally, we showed that stability and cooperativity of a repeat-array can be
quantitatively predicted from a simple energy score, paving the way for guiding
protein folding design with a co-evolutionary model.

weight system corresponding to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_N$. The
straightforward approach to computing the values of a Lie algebra weight system
on a general chord diagram amounts to elaborating calculations in the
noncommutative universal enveloping algebra, in spite of the fact that the
result belongs to the center of the latter. The first approach is based on a
suggestion due to M. Kazarian to define an invariant of permutations taking
values in the center of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_N$.
The restriction of this invariant to involutions without fixed points (such an
involution determines a chord diagram) coincides with the value of the
$\mathfrak{gl}_N$ -weight system on this chord diagram. We describe the
recursion allowing one to compute the $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ -invariant of
permutations and demonstrate how it works in a number of examples. The second
approach is based on the Harish-Chandra isomorphism for the Lie algebras
$\mathfrak{gl}_N$. This isomorphism identifies the center of the universal
enveloping algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ with the ring $\Lambda^*(N)$ of shifted
symmetric polynomials in $N$ variables. The Harish-Chandra projection can be
applied separately for each monomial in the defining polynomial of the weight
system; as a result, the main body of computations can be done in a commutative
algebra, rather than noncommutative one.

metallicity). We aim to assess and quantify the degree of accuracy underlying
this assumption. We used adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic cosmological
simulations of two $z=1$ dwarf galaxies and generated synthetic quasar
absorption-line spectra of their CGM. For the SiII $\lambda 1260$ transition,
and the CIV $\lambda\lambda1548, 1550$ and OVI $\lambda\lambda1031, 1037$
fine-structure doublets, we objectively determined which gas cells along a
line-of-sight (LOS) contribute to detected absorption. We implemented a fast,
efficient, and objective method to define individual absorption components in
each absorption profile. For each absorption component, we quantified the
spatial distribution of the absorbing gas. We studied a total of 1,302
absorption systems containing a total of 7,755 absorption components. 48% of
SiII, 68% of CIV, and 72% of OVI absorption components arise from two or more
spatially isolated ""cloud"" structures along the LOS. Spatially isolated ""cloud""
structures were most likely to have cloud-cloud LOS separations of
0.03$R_{vir}$, 0.11$R_{vir}$, and 0.13$R_{vir}$ for SiII, CIV, and OVI,

privacy guarantees of a training algorithm. Despite the empirical observation
that DP reduces the vulnerability of models to existing membership inference
(MI) attacks, a theoretical underpinning as to why this is the case is largely
missing in the literature. In practice, this means that models need to be
trained with DP guarantees that greatly decrease their accuracy.
  In this paper, we provide a tighter bound on the positive accuracy (i.e.,
attack precision) of any MI adversary when a training algorithm provides
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. Our bound informs the design of a novel privacy
amplification scheme: an effective training set is sub-sampled from a larger
set prior to the beginning of training. We find this greatly reduces the bound
on MI positive accuracy. As a result, our scheme allows the use of looser DP
guarantees to limit the success of any MI adversary; this ensures that the
model's accuracy is less impacted by the privacy guarantee. While this clearly
benefits entities working with far more data than they need to train on, it can
also improve the accuracy-privacy trade-off on benchmarks studied in the
academic literature. Consequently, we also find that subsampling decreases the
effectiveness of a state-of-the-art MI attack (LiRA) much more effectively than
training with stronger DP guarantees on MNIST and CIFAR10. We conclude by
discussing implications of our MI bound on the field of machine unlearning.

electronic structures of [001]-oriented GAO/STO heterostructures with and
without oxygen vacancies are investigated by first-principle calculations based
on the density functional theory. The calculation results show that the
necessary condition for the formation of 2DEG is that the GAO/STO
heterostructure has the interface composed of Al and TiO$_2$ layers. For the
heterostructure without oxygen vacancy on the GAO side, the 2DEG originates
from the polar discontinuity near the interface, and there is a critical
thickness for the GAO film, below which the 2DEG would not present and the
heterostructure exhibits insulator characteristics. For the case that only the
GAO film contains oxygen vacancies, the polar discontinuity near the interface
disappears, but the 2DEG still exists. In this situation, the critical
thickness of the GAO film for 2DEG formation does not exist either. When the
GAO film and STO substrate both contain oxygen vacancies, it is found that the
2DEG retains as long as the oxygen vacancies on the STO side are not very close
to the interface. The low-temperature mobilities of the 2DEGs in these GAO/STO
heterostructures are considered to be governed by the ionized impurity
scattering, and $\sim$3 to $\sim$11 times as large as that in
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterojunction. The high mobility of the 2DEG is mainly due
to the small electron effective mass in GAO/STO heterostructure.

systems at the vicinity of phase transitions or bifurcations. An example is
found in systems exhibiting a saddle-node bifurcation, which undergo a dramatic
time delay towards equilibrium. Specifically the duration of the transient,
$\tau$, close to this bifurcation in deterministic systems follows scaling laws
of the form $\tau \sim |\epsilon - \epsilon_c|^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the
bifurcation or control parameter, and $\epsilon_c$ its critical value. For
systems undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation, the mechanism involves transients
getting trapped by a so-called ghost. In a recent article we explored how
intrinsic noise affected the deterministic picture. Extensive numerical
simulations showed that, although scaling behaviour persisted in the presence
of noise, the scaling law was more complicated than a simple power law. In
order to gain deeper insight into this scaling behaviour, we resort to the WKB
asymptotic approximation of the Master Equation. According to this
approximation, the behaviour of the system is given as the weighted sum of
\emph{trajectories} within the phase space of the Hamiltonian associated to the
corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. By analysing the flight time of the
Hamilton equations, we show that the statistically significant paths follow a
scaling function that exactly matches the one observed in the stochastic
simulations. We therefore put forward that the properties of the flight times
of the Hamiltonian system underpin the scaling law of the underlying stochastic
system, and that the same properties should extend in a universal way to all
stochastic systems whose associated Hamiltonian exhibits the same behaviour.

algorithms focus on obtaining point estimates of model parameters, rather than
probabilistic estimates capable of capturing model uncertainty, which is
essential in many applications. Variational inference (VI) has become the
method of choice for fitting many modern probabilistic models. In this paper we
introduce partitioned variational inference (PVI), a general framework for
performing VI in the federated setting. We develop new supporting theory for
PVI, demonstrating a number of properties that make it an attractive choice for

number of tests, such that each test indicates whether or not a given subset of
individuals includes one or more infected individuals. The goal of the group
testing procedure is to identify the subset of infected individuals with the
minimum number of tests. Motivated by practical scenarios, such as testing for
viral diseases, this paper focuses on the following group testing settings: (i)
the group testing procedure is noisy, i.e., the outcome of the group testing
procedure can be flipped with a certain probability; (ii) there is a certain
amount of side information on the distribution of the infected individuals

contributions. First, we propose a probabilistic model, referred to as an

superstring and superbrane theories predict the existence of axion-like
particles (ALPs). ALPs are very elusive, extremely light and interact primarily
with photons. In the presence of an external magnetic field two effects show
up: (i) photon-ALP oscillations and (ii) a change of the photon polarization
state. The astrophysical context represents the best opportunity to get
indirect evidence for the ALP existence thanks to various effects that the
photon-ALP interaction produces in the sky. Great attention has been paid so
far to photon-ALP oscillations, since they modify the transparency of the
crossed media at very high energies and so the final spectra of faraway sources
exhibit a flux excess and a characteristic oscillatory behavior. Two hints at
the ALP existence have hitherto been discovered. But less interest has been
attracted by the modification of the photon polarization. In this paper we
address it in the X-ray and in the high energy (HE) bands. Specifically, we
analyze the photon degree of linear polarization and the polarization angle
induced by the photon-ALP interaction for photons generated in the central
region of two galaxy clusters: Perseus and Coma. We find a substantial
departure from conventional physics in both considered bands. We conclude that
the ALP-induced polarization effects are more likely detectable with the
proposed missions like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the
HE range. Still, possible ALP-induced effects on photon polarization could also
be detected by IXPE (already operative) and by the proposed eXTP, XL-Calibur,
NGXP and XPP in the X-ray band.

provide new tools for the computation of the DY cohomology for finite tensor
categories and exact functors between them. The key point is to realize DY
cohomology as relative Ext groups. In particular, we prove that the
infinitesimal deformations of a tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ are classified by
the 3-rd self-extension group of the tensor unit of the Drinfeld center
$\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ relative to $\mathcal{C}$. From classical results on
relative homological algebra we get a long exact sequence for DY cohomology and
a Yoneda product for which we provide an explicit formula. Using the long exact
sequence and duality, we obtain a dimension formula for the cohomology groups
based solely on relatively projective covers which reduces a problem in
homological algebra to a problem in representation theory, e.g. calculating the
space of invariants in a certain object of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. Thanks
to the Yoneda product, we also develop a method for computing DY cocycles
explicitly which are needed for applications in the deformation theory. We
apply these tools to the category of finite-dimensional modules over a
finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. We study in detail the examples of the
bosonization of exterior algebras $\Lambda\mathbb{C}^k \rtimes

dominated medical image segmentation, which is crucial for various clinical
purposes. However, the inherent locality of convolution makes CNNs fail to
fully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some
structures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising
performance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to
their capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the
quadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use
self-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which
limits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions.
Therefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which
leverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an
end-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable
approach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
(NMF) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The
shifted window technique is also utilized in combination with NMF to
effectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with
CNNs and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability,
achieving state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset for brain tumor
segmentation and ISLES'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly
meaningful NMF components give an additional interpretability advantage to
Factorizers over CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a
distinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in
inference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without
sacrificing much accuracy. The code and models are publicly available at

treating them in a unified way as worldline segments shrinking and expanding at
different relative rates. While these polytopes conventionally arise as convex
hulls - via Newton polytopes of Symanzik polynomials - we show that they also
have a remarkably simple dual description as cut out by linear inequalities
defining the facets. It is this dual definition that makes it possible to
transparently understand and efficiently compute leading UV and IR divergences
for any Feynman integral. In the case of the UV, this provides a transparent
geometric understanding of the familiar nested and overlapping divergences. In
the IR, the polytope exposes a new perspective on soft/collinear singularities
and their intricate generalizations. Tropical geometry furnishes a simple
framework for calculating the leading UV/IR divergences of any Feynman
integral, associating them with the volumes of certain dual cones. As concrete
applications, we generalize Weinberg's theorem to include a characterization of
IR divergences, and classify space-time dimensions in which general IR
divergences (logarithmic as well as power-law) can occur. We also compute the
leading IR divergence of rectangular fishnet diagrams at all loop orders, which

systematic patterns of deviation from rational judgement. Specifically, we use
cognitive biases as motivation to (i) generate hypotheses for problems that

are promising sources for low-frequency GW-detectors. They result from a
compact object, such as a stellar-mass black-hole (BH), captured by a
supermassive black hole (SMBH). Several physical processes have been proposed
to form EMRIs. In particular, weak two-body interactions over a long time scale
(i.e., relaxation processes) have been proposed as a likely mechanism to drive
the BH orbit to high eccentricity. Consequently, it is captured by the SMBH and
becomes an EMRI. Here we demonstrate that EMRIs are naturally formed in SMBH
binaries. Gravitational perturbations from an SMBH companion, known as the
eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, combined with relaxation processes,
yield a significantly more enhanced rate than any of these processes operating
alone. Since EKL is sensitive to the orbital configuration, two-body relaxation
can alter the orbital parameters, rendering the system in a more EKL-favorable
regime. As SMBH binaries are expected to be prevalent in the Universe, this
process predicts a substantially high EMRI rate.

$\Delta$Z/$\Delta$R=$-$0.015$\pm$0.005 dex kpc$^{-1}$. Finally we examine the
azimuthal variations in gas-phase metallicity, which show a negative
correlation with the galaxy integrated star-formation rate surface density

quantization (VQ) module is used, together with man-induced constraints, to
produce interpretable content tokens. Last, an innovative link attention module

thermal state of the inter-galactic medium (IGM) evolved in the early universe

consider the heating of the IGM due to cosmic ray protons generated by the
supernovae from both early Pop III and Pop II stars. The low energy cosmic ray
protons from Pop III supernovae can escape from minihalos and heat the IGM via
collision and ionization of hydrogen. Furthermore, high energy protons
generated in Pop II supernovae can escape the hosting halos and heat the IGM
via magnetosonic Alfv\'en waves. We show that the heating due to these cosmic
ray particles can significantly impact the IGM temperature and hence the global
21-cm signal at $z\sim 14-18$. The depth, location, and duration of the 21-cm
absorption profile are highly dependent on the efficiencies of cosmic ray
heating. In particular, the EDGES signal can be well fitted by the cosmic ray
heating along with the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling, and the dark matter-baryon

argue that the properties of cosmic rays and the nature of first generation of

performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework
Parthenon, derived from the well-tested and widely used Athena++ astrophysical

variety of downstream multi-physics codes. Parthenon adopts the Kokkos
programming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from
multi-dimensional variables, to packages defining and separating components, to
launching of parallel compute kernels. Parthenon allocates all data in device
memory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and
mesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided,
asynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node
simulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong
scaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD
x86 CPUs, IBM Power9 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs. At the largest scale
on Frontier (the first TOP500 exascale machine), the miniapp reaches a total of
$1.7\times10^{13}$ zone-cycles/s on 9,216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at ~92%
weak scaling parallel efficiency (starting from a single node). In combination
with being an open, collaborative project, this makes Parthenon an ideal
framework to target exascale simulations in which the downstream developers can
focus on their specific application rather than on the complexity of handling
massively-parallel, device-accelerated AMR.

limit for the trajectories of neutrinos which are constrained in the equatorial

of the gravitational source non-trivially modifies the neutrino phase. We find
that the oscillation probabilities deviate significantly from the corresponding
results in the Schwarzschild spacetime when neutrinos are produced near the
black hole (still in the weak-gravity limit) with non-zero angular momentum and
detected on the same side, i.e., the non-lensed neutrino. Moreover, for a given
gravitational body and geometric parameters, there exists a distance scale for
every energy scale (and vice versa), after which the rotational contribution in
the neutrino phase becomes significant. Using the sun-sized gravitational body
in the numerical analysis of the one-sided neutrino propagation, we show that
even a small rotation of the gravitational object can significantly change the
survival or appearance events of a neutrino flavor registered by the detector,
which is located on the earth. These effects are expected to be prominent for
cosmological/astrophysical scenarios where neutrinos travel past by many
(rotating) gravitational bodies and for large distances. Thus rotational
effects of all such bodies must be incorporated in analyzing oscillations data.

factors one at a time, then measure the resulting drops in a pretrained model's
downstream performance. In contrast to prior work suggesting little effect from
syntax on knowledge transfer, we find significant impacts from syntactic shifts
(3-6% drop), though models quickly adapt with continued pretraining on a small
dataset. However, we find that by far the most impactful factor for
crosslingual transfer is the challenge of aligning the new embeddings with the
existing transformer layers (18% drop), with little additional effect from
switching tokenizers (<2% drop) or word morphologies (<2% drop). Moreover,
continued pretraining with a small dataset is not very effective at closing
this gap - suggesting that new directions are needed for solving this problem.

non-monotonic behavior of thermal conductivity as a function of magnetic field,

development, we study the magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity of
a generalized Kitaev model, which allows the phase transitions between
different flux sectors as a function of the magnetic field. The thermal
conductivity due to Majorana fermions shows dip-bump structures as the magnetic
field increases, which is caused by either the transitions between different
flux sectors of Kitaev spin liquids or the topological transitions that change
the Majorana Chern number within the same flux sector. It is shown that the
change of Chern number is closely related to the four-Majorana-fermion
interaction induced by the magnetic field. The non-monotonic behavior in
thermal conductivity emerges at finite temperature, and it becomes weaker when
temperature decreases towards zero. Our model provides a generic mechanism for
the Kitaev spin liquids to develop non-monotonic magnetic-field dependence of
thermal conductivity while the detailed comparison to realistic materials

domain-agnostic, data-driven models are pervasive, physical knowledge -- often
expressed as differential equations -- is valuable in that it is complementary
to data, and it can potentially help overcome issues such as data sparsity,
noise, and inaccuracy. In this work, we propose a simple, yet powerful and
general framework -- AutoIP, for Automatically Incorporating Physics -- that
can integrate all kinds of differential equations into Gaussian Processes (GPs)
to enhance prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. These equations
can be linear or nonlinear, spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal, complete or
incomplete with unknown source terms, and so on. Based on kernel
differentiation, we construct a GP prior to sample the values of the target
function, equation-related derivatives, and latent source functions, which are
all jointly from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The sampled values are
fed to two likelihoods: one to fit the observations, and the other to conform
to the equation. We use the whitening method to evade the strong dependency
between the sampled function values and kernel parameters, and we develop a
stochastic variational learning algorithm. AutoIP shows improvement upon
vanilla GPs in both simulation and several real-world applications, even using
rough, incomplete equations.

due to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of
phenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present,
examples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve
machine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application

effect of the tidal field, two-body relaxation, stellar evolution and
three/four-bodies interactions. The fraction of surviving binaries, once
accounted for the observational bias and uncertainties, is compared with the
available radial velocity time-series performed in real globular clusters, and
it is used to constrain the initial spatial concentration of the second
generation. The fraction of second generation binaries appears to depend only
on the ratio between the total cluster mass and the initial size of the second
generation which determines the average velocity dispersion across the extent
of this stellar population. In spite of the various uncertainties, we find that
the observed fraction can be obtained only assuming a strong initial
concentration of the second generation (r_h,S~ 0.1 (M/10^6 M_s) pc). The
evolution of the first generation binary fraction is more sensitive to the
tidal field strength (with a non negligible effect of the cluster orbital
eccentricity) since the tidal field has a direct impact on the first generation

linear inequality $\sum \limits_{i=1}^n a_i x_i \leq b$ are the characteristic
vectors of the cliques of $G$. Introduced in [Chv{\'a}tal and Hammer, Annals of
Discrete Mathematics, 1977], the \emph{threshold dimension} of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\dimth(G)$, is the minimum number of threshold graphs whose
intersection yields $G$. Given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, in line with
Chv{\'a}tal and Hammer, $f_G\colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is the
Boolean function that has the property that $f_G(x) = 1$ if and only if $x$ is
the characteristic vector of a clique in $G$. A Boolean function $f$ for which
there exists a graph $G$ such that $f=f_G$ is called a \emph{graphic} Boolean
function. It follows that for a graph $G$, $\dimth(G)$ is precisely the minimum
number of \emph{majority} gates whose AND (or conjunction) realizes the graphic
Boolean function $f_G$. The fact that there exist Boolean functions which can
be realized as the AND of only exponentially many majority gates motivates us
to study threshold dimension of graphs. We give tight or nearly tight upper

maximum degree, degeneracy, number of vertices, size of a minimum vertex cover,

part, the data scarcity problem, especially for kindergarten-aged kids. When
data are scarce, the model might overfit to the training data, and hence good
starting points for training are essential. Recently, meta-learning was
proposed to learn model initialization (MI) for ASR tasks of different
languages. This method leads to good performance when the model is adapted to
an unseen language. However, MI is vulnerable to overfitting on training tasks
(learner overfitting). It is also unknown whether MI generalizes to other
low-resource tasks. In this paper, we validate the effectiveness of MI in
children's ASR and attempt to alleviate the problem of learner overfitting. To
achieve model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), we regard children's speech at
each age as a different task. In terms of learner overfitting, we propose a
task-level augmentation method by simulating new ages using frequency warping
techniques. Detailed experiments are conducted to show the impact of task
augmentation on each age for kindergarten-aged speech. As a result, our
approach achieves a relative word error rate (WER) improvement of 51% over the
baseline system with no augmentation or initialization.

masses at different epochs, using an analytic ""bathtub"" model. The disc of gas
and stars is assumed to be in marginal Toomre instability. Turbulence is
assumed to be sustained via an energy balance between its dissipation and three
simultaneous energy sources. These are stellar feedback, inward transport due
to disc instability and clumpy accretion via streams. The transport rate is
computed with two different formalisms, with similar results. To achieve the
energy balance, the disc self-regulates either the mass fraction in clumps or
the turbulent viscous torque parameter. In this version of the model, the
efficiency by which the stream kinetic energy is converted into turbulence is a
free parameter, $\xi_a$. We find that the contributions of the three energy
sources are in the same ball park, within a factor of $\sim\!2$ in all discs at
all times. In haloes that evolve to a mass $\leq 10^{12}\,\Msun$ by $z=0$
($\leq 10^{11.5}\,\Msun$ at $z\!\sim\!2$), feedback is the main driver
throughout their lifetimes. Above this mass, the main driver is either
transport or accretion for very low or very high values of $\xi_a$,
respectively. For an assumed $\xi_a(t)$ that declines in time, galaxies in
halos with present-day mass $>\!10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ make a transition from
accretion to transport dominance at intermediate redshifts, $z\! \sim\!3$, when

supports to a diverse population. Such allocations pervade social service
delivery, such as provision of homeless services, assignment of refugees to

sociodemographic groups and intersectional identities. Our paper shows that
necessary trade-offs exist for fairness in the context of scarcity; many
reasonable definitions of equitable outcomes cannot hold simultaneously except
under stringent conditions. For example, defining fairness in terms of
improvement over a baseline inherently conflicts with defining fairness in
terms of loss compared with the best possible outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the fairness trade-offs stem from heterogeneity across groups in
intervention responses. Administrative records on homeless service delivery
offer a real-world example. Building on prior work, we measure utilities for
each household as the probability of reentry into homeless services if given
three homeless services. Heterogeneity in utility distributions (conditional on
received services) for several sociodemographic groups (e.g. single women with
children versus without children) generates divergence across fairness metrics.
We argue that such heterogeneity, and thus, fairness trade-offs pervade many
social policy contexts.

is often unavailable, and binary patching may be required to mitigate the
vulnerability. However, manually patching binaries is time-consuming, requires
significant expertise, and does not scale to the rate at which new
vulnerabilities are discovered. To address these problems, we introduce
Partially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD), which extracts and decompiles
suspect binary functions to source where they can be patched or analyzed,
applies transformations to enable recompilation of these functions (partial
recompilation), then employs binary rewriting techniques to create a patched
binary. Although decompilation and recompilation do not universally apply,
PRD's fault localization identifies a function subset that is small enough to
admit decompilation and large enough to address many vulnerabilities. Our
approach succeeds because decompilation is limited to a few functions and
lifting facilitates analysis and repair.
  To demonstrate the scalability of PRD, we evaluate it in the context of a
fully automated end-to-end scenario that relies on source-level Automated
Program Repair (APR) methods to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We also evaluate
PRD in the context of human-generated source-level repairs. In the end-to-end
experiment, PRD produced test-equivalent binaries in 84% of cases; and the
patched binaries incur no significant run-time overhead. When combined with APR
tools and evaluated on the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) benchmarks, PRD
achieved similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, while presenting
repairs as source-level patches which can be reviewed by humans; In some cases,
PRD finds higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. We
also demonstrate that PRD successfully extends to real-world binaries and

channels of change using a longitudinal multi-wave survey of a representative
sample of Americans throughout 2020. This methodology allows us to overcome
some of the limitations of previous studies and uncover novel insights: (1)
individuals with a negative personal experience during a crisis become more
pro-welfare spending, in particular for policies they perceive will benefit
them personally, and they become less trusting of institutions; (2) indirect
shocks or the mere exposure to the crisis doesn't have a similar effect; (3)
policy preferences and institutional trust can change quickly after a negative
experience; and (4) consuming partisan media can mitigate or exacerbate these
effects by distorting perceptions of reality. In an experiment, we find that
exposing individuals to the same information can recalibrate distorted
perceptions with lasting effects. Using a machine learning model to test for
heterogeneous treatment effects, we find a negative personal experience did not
make individuals more responsive to the information treatment, suggesting that
lived and perceived experiences play an equally important role in changing
preferences during a crisis.

(CS) observed by Parker Solar Probe during 10 days around the first perihelion.
The CS thickness $\lambda$ is in the range from a few to 200 km with the
typical value around 30 km, while current densities are in the range from 0.1
to 10\;$\mu {\rm A/m^2}$ with the typical value around 0.7\;$\mu {\rm A/m^2}$.
These CSs are resolved thanks to magnetic field measurements at 73--290
Samples/s resolution. In terms of proton inertial length $\lambda_{p}$, the CS
thickness $\lambda$ is in the range from about $0.1$ to $10\lambda_{p}$ with
the typical value around 2$\lambda_{p}$. The magnetic field magnitude does not
substantially vary across the CSs and, accordingly, the current density is
dominated by the magnetic field-aligned component. The CSs are typically
asymmetric with statistically different magnetic field magnitudes at the CS
boundaries. The current density is larger for smaller-scale CSs, $J_0\approx
0.15 \cdot (\lambda/100\;{\rm km})^{-0.76}$ $\mu {\rm A/m^2}$, but does not
statistically exceed the Alfv\'en current density $J_A$ corresponding to the
ion-electron drift of local Alfv\'{e}n speed. The CSs exhibit remarkable
scale-dependent current density and magnetic shear angles, $J_0/J_{A}\approx
0.17\cdot (\lambda/\lambda_{p})^{-0.67}$ and $\Delta \theta\approx
21^{\circ}\cdot (\lambda/\lambda_{p})^{0.32}$. Based on these observations and
comparison to recent studies at 1 AU, we conclude that proton kinetic-scale CSs
in the near-Sun solar wind are produced by turbulence cascade and they are
automatically in the parameter range, where reconnection is not suppressed by
the diamagnetic mechanism, due to their geometry dictated by turbulence
cascade.

Antineutrino Anomaly' by performing a high-resolution spectrum measurement from
an enriched compact reactor core and a reactor model-independent sterile
neutrino oscillation search based on the unique spectral distortions the
existence of eV$^2$-scale sterile neutrinos would impart. But as the field has
evolved, the current short-baseline (SBL) landscape supports many complex
phenomenological interpretations, establishing a need for complementary
experimental approaches to resolve the situation.
  While the global suite of SBL reactor experiments, including PROSPECT, have
probed much of the sterile neutrino parameter space, there remains a large
region above 1 eV$^2$ that remains unaddressed. Recent results from BEST
confirm the Gallium Anomaly, increasing its significance to $\sim 5\sigma$,
with sterile neutrinos providing a possible explanation of this anomaly.
Separately, the MicroBooNE exclusion of electron-like signatures causing the
MiniBooNE low-energy excess does not eliminate the possibility of sterile
neutrinos as an explanation. Focusing specifically on the future use of
reactors as a neutrino source for beyond-the-standard-model physics and
applications, higher-precision spectral measurements still have a role to play.
  These recent results have created a confusing landscape which requires new
data to disentangle the seemingly contradictory measurements. To directly probe
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ disappearance from high $\Delta m^2$ sterile neutrinos,
the PROSPECT collaboration proposes to build an upgraded and improved detector,
PROSPECT-II. It features an evolutionary detector design which can be
constructed and deployed within one year and have impactful physics with as

In this article, we propose a procedure to evaluate the strength of the
associations between a nominal (categorical) response variable and multiple
features simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a framework of large-scale
multiple testing under arbitrary correlation dependency among test statistics.
First, marginal multinomial regressions are performed for each feature
individually. Second, we use an approach of multiple marginal models for each
baseline-category pair to establish asymptotic joint normality of the stacked
vector of the marginal multinomial regression coefficients. Third, we estimate
the (limiting) covariance matrix between the estimated coefficients from all
marginal models. Finally, our approach approximates the realized false
discovery proportion of a thresholding procedure for the marginal p-values, for
each baseline-category pair. The proposed approach offers a sensible trade-off
between the expected numbers of true and false rejections. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a practical application of the method on hyperspectral imaging
data. This dataset is obtained by a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization

in machine learning that investigates how to automatically learn a mapping from

increasing interest in the adaptive processing of graphs, which led to the
development of different neural network-based methodologies. In this thesis, we
take a different route and develop a Bayesian Deep Learning framework for graph
learning. The dissertation begins with a review of the principles over which
most of the methods in the field are built, followed by a study on graph
classification reproducibility issues. We then proceed to bridge the basic
ideas of deep learning for graphs with the Bayesian world, by building our deep
architectures in an incremental fashion. This framework allows us to consider
graphs with discrete and continuous edge features, producing unsupervised
embeddings rich enough to reach the state of the art on several classification
tasks. Our approach is also amenable to a Bayesian nonparametric extension that
automatizes the choice of almost all model's hyper-parameters. Two real-world
applications demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for graphs. The first
concerns the prediction of information-theoretic quantities for molecular
simulations with supervised neural models. After that, we exploit our Bayesian
models to solve a malware-classification task while being robust to
intra-procedural code obfuscation techniques. We conclude the dissertation with
an attempt to blend the best of the neural and Bayesian worlds together. The
resulting hybrid model is able to predict multimodal distributions conditioned
on input graphs, with the consequent ability to model stochasticity and
uncertainty better than most works. Overall, we aim to provide a Bayesian
perspective into the articulated research field of deep learning for graphs.

their mirror partners on the opposite boundaries of a thin strip of (2+1)D

symmetric mass generation (SMG) mechanism. We show that the interaction-driven
gapping transition is in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality

Quick and prompt response of the rescue teams are crucial in saving human lives
and reducing economic cost. Deep learning based computer vision techniques can
help in scene understanding, and help rescue teams with precise damage
assessment. Semantic segmentation, an active research area in computer vision,
can put labels to each pixel of an image, and therefore can be a valuable
arsenal in the effort of reducing the impacts of hurricanes. Unfortunately,
available datasets for natural disaster damage assessment lack detailed
annotation of the affected areas, and therefore do not support the deep
learning models in total damage assessment. To this end, we introduce the
RescueNet, a high resolution post disaster dataset, for semantic segmentation
to assess damages after natural disasters. The RescueNet consists of post
disaster images collected after Hurricane Michael. The data is collected using
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from several areas impacted by the hurricane.
The uniqueness of the RescueNet comes from the fact that this dataset provides
high resolution post-disaster images and comprehensive annotation of each
image. While most of the existing dataset offer annotation of only part of the
scene, like building, road, or river, RescueNet provides pixel level annotation
of all the classes including building, road, pool, tree, debris, and so on. We
further analyze the usefulness of the dataset by implementing state-of-the-art
segmentation models on the RescueNet. The experiments demonstrate that our

distance an individual can perceive the environment and a minimum conditioning
level to perform the gregarious movement. We investigate the pattern formation

perspective, aiming to analyze and address a fundamental issue of existing
contrastive learning methods that either rely on a large batch size or a large
dictionary of feature vectors. We consider a global objective for contrastive
learning, which contrasts each positive pair with all negative pairs for an
anchor point. From the optimization perspective, we explain why existing
methods such as SimCLR require a large batch size in order to achieve a
satisfactory result. In order to remove such requirement, we propose a
memory-efficient Stochastic Optimization algorithm for solving the Global
objective of Contrastive Learning of Representations, named SogCLR. We show
that its optimization error is negligible under a reasonable condition after a
sufficient number of iterations or is diminishing for a slightly different
global contrastive objective. Empirically, we demonstrate that SogCLR with
small batch size (e.g., 256) can achieve similar performance as SimCLR with
large batch size (e.g., 8192) on self-supervised learning task on ImageNet-1K.
We also attempt to show that the proposed optimization technique is generic and
can be applied to solving other contrastive losses, e.g., two-way contrastive
losses for bimodal contrastive learning. The proposed method is implemented in
our open-sourced library LibAUC (www.libauc.org).

rate through the nonequilibrium phase transition from a plastic disordered
flowing state to a moving anisotropic crystal. A dynamical ordering transition
of this type occurs for vortices in type-II superconductors, colloids, and
other particle-like systems in the presence of random disorder. We find that on
the ordered side of the transition, the density of topological defects $\rho_d$
scales as a power law, $\rho_d \propto 1/t_{q}^\beta$, where $t_{q}$ is the
time duration of the quench across the transition. This type of scaling is
predicted in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for varied quench rates across a
continuous phase transition. We show that scaling with the same exponent holds
for varied strengths of quenched disorder. The value of the exponent can be
connected to the directed percolation universality class. Our results suggest
that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism can be applied to general nonequilibrium phase
transitions.

We confirm that the events identified via our neural network outlier method are

Our approach does not require an analytic expression of the closed-loop

  Here, we present a modified encoding/decoding operator that can be

Since IBM quantum computers perform relatively better with fewer basic gates, a
more efficient decomposition gives more accurate results. Our experiments

leverage news-source credibility labels as weak labels for social media posts
and propose model-guided refinement of labels to construct large-scale, diverse
misinformation labeled datasets in new domains. The weak labels can be
inaccurate at the article or social media post level where the stance of the
user does not align with the news source or article credibility. We propose a
framework to use a detection model self-trained on the initial weak labels with
uncertainty sampling based on entropy in predictions of the model to identify
potentially inaccurate labels and correct for them using self-supervision or
relabeling. The framework will incorporate social context of the post in terms
of the community of its associated user for surfacing inaccurate labels towards
building a large-scale dataset with minimum human effort. To provide labeled
datasets with distinction of misleading narratives where information might be
missing significant context or has inaccurate ancillary details, the proposed
framework will use the few labeled samples as class prototypes to separate high
confidence samples into false, unproven, mixture, mostly false, mostly true,
true, and debunk information. The approach is demonstrated for providing a
large-scale misinformation dataset on COVID-19 vaccines.

around us exhibit some form of nonlinear behavior, nonlinear system
identification techniques are the tools that will help us gain a better
understanding of our surroundings and potentially let us improve their
performance. One model that is often used to represent nonlinear systems is the
polynomial NARX model, an equation error model where the output is a polynomial
function of the past inputs and outputs. That said, a major disadvantage with
the polynomial NARX model is that the number of parameters increases rapidly
with increasing polynomial order. Furthermore, the polynomial NARX model is a
black-box model, and is therefore difficult to interpret. This paper discusses
a decoupling algorithm for the polynomial NARX model that substitutes the
multivariate polynomial with a transformation matrix followed by a bank of
univariate polynomials. This decreases the number of model parameters
significantly and also imposes structure on the black-box NARX model. Since a
non-convex optimization is required for this identification technique,
initialization is an important factor to consider. In this paper the decoupling
algorithm is developed in conjunction with several different initialization
techniques. The resulting algorithms are applied to two nonlinear benchmark
problems: measurement data from the Silver-Box and simulation data from the
Bouc-Wen friction model, and the performance is evaluated for different
validation signals in both simulation and prediction.

an examiner's or observer's capacity for facial morph detection depends on
their subject expertise, experience, and familiarity with the issue and that no
works have reported the specific results of observers who regularly verify
identity (ID) documents for their jobs. As human observers are involved in
checking the ID documents having facial images, a lapse in their competence can
have significant societal challenges. To assess the observers' proficiency,
this work first builds a new benchmark database of realistic morphing attacks
from 48 different subjects, resulting in 400 morphed images. We also capture

business critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently
is challenging primarily because they consist of billions of embedding-based
parameters which are often stored remotely leading to significant overheads
from embedding access. By profiling existing DLRM training, we observe that
only 8.5% of the iteration time is spent in forward/backward pass while the
remaining time is spent on embedding and model synchronization. Our key insight
in this paper is that access to embeddings have a specific structure and
pattern which can be used to accelerate training. We observe that embedding
accesses are heavily skewed, with almost 1% of embeddings represent more than
92% of total accesses. Further, we observe that during training we can
lookahead at future batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be
needed at what iteration in the future. Based on these insight, we propose
Bagpipe, a system for training deep recommendation models that uses caching and
prefetching to overlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We
designed an Oracle Cacher, a new system component which uses our lookahead
algorithm to generate optimal cache update decisions and provide strong
consistency guarantees. Our experiments using three datasets and two models

chaotic, nonlinear, and intermittent phenomena. Koopman operator theory and
Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) model have been widely used to
decompose the chaos of the complex system dynamics into an intermittent forced
linear system. Although the statistics of the intermittent forcing have been
proposed to characterize intermittencies in the HAVOK model, they were not
adequate to attribute for the mode switching of nonlinear dynamics and the
fat-tailed non-Gaussian distribution originated from high-frequency bursts and
rarely-observed intermittent forcing. The paper proposed a new intermittency
dynamics analysis approach to characterize the intermittent phases, chaotic
bursts, and local spectral-temporal properties of various intermittent dynamics
modes using spectral decomposition and wavelet analysis. To validate our
methods, the intermittency behavior of apneic events in obstructive sleep apnea
disorder was selected as the case, in which heart rate variability (HRV)
features were extracted. Next, we constructed the Hankel matrix from the HRV
features and obtained the last eigen time-delay coordinate by singular value
decomposition of the Hankel matrix, which was modeled as an intermittent
forcing input. The statistics of the forcing in OSA demonstrated the fat-tailed
distribution of the intermittent forcing, which correspond to the intermittency
of the underlying OSA pathophysiological process. The pooled means and standard
deviations of the burst duration and the inter-burst duration across OSA
patients were also calculated to be minutes and minutes. Scalogram amplitude
and spectral decomposition of the wavelet transform exhibited various
predominant frequencies and dynamics modes associated with apneic events.

with explanations is crucial in various applications. Many explanations stem
from the model perspective, and may not necessarily effectively communicate why
the model is making its predictions at the right level of abstraction. For
example, providing importance weights to individual pixels in an image can only
express which parts of that particular image are important to the model, but
humans may prefer an explanation which explains the prediction by concept-based
thinking. In this work, we review the emerging area of concept based
explanations. We start by introducing concept explanations including the class
of Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) which characterize concepts using vectors
in appropriate spaces of neural activations, and discuss different properties
of useful concepts, and approaches to measure the usefulness of concept
vectors. We then discuss approaches to automatically extract concepts, and
approaches to address some of their caveats. Finally, we discuss some case
studies that showcase the utility of such concept-based explanations in
synthetic settings and real world applications.

opinions. However, these platforms typically aim to maximize engagement, which
may not align with social good. In this paper, we introduce an opinion dynamics
model where agents are connected in a social network, and update their opinions
based on their neighbors' opinions and on the content shown to them by the
platform. We focus on a stochastic block model with two blocks, where the
initial opinions of the individuals in different blocks are different. We prove
that for large and dense enough networks the trajectory of opinion dynamics in
such networks can be approximated well by a simple two-agent system. The latter
admits tractable analytical analysis, which we leverage to provide interesting
insights into the platform's impact on the social learning outcome in our
original two-block model. Specifically, by using our approximation result, we
show that agents' opinions approximately converge to some limiting opinion,
which is either: consensus, where all agents agree, or persistent disagreement,
where agents' opinions differ. We find that when the platform is weak and there
is a high number of connections between agents with different initial opinions,
a consensus equilibrium is likely. In this case, even if a persistent
disagreement equilibrium arises, the polarization in this equilibrium, i.e.,
the degree of disagreement, is low. When the platform is strong, a persistent
disagreement equilibrium is likely and the equilibrium polarization is high. A
moderate platform typically leads to a persistent disagreement equilibrium with
moderate polarization. Lastly, more balanced and less polarized initial
opinions are more likely to lead to persistent disagreement than to consensus.

is fed to a generic Temporal Convolutional Network that also aggregates global

temporal structure of the prediction residuals to detect both isolated point
anomalies and set-point changes. It is based on a novel application of the
classic CUMSUM algorithm, adapted through the use of a variational
approximation of f-divergences. The model automatically adapts to the time
scales of the observed signals. It approximates a SARIMA model at the get-go,
and auto-tunes to the statistics of the signal and its covariates, without the

fundamental step for different machine learning-based ECG tasks. In order to
extract general ECG representations that can be adapted to various downstream
tasks, the learning process needs to be based on a general ECG-related task
which can be achieved through self-supervised learning (SSL). However, existing
SSL approaches either fail to provide satisfactory ECG representations or
require too much effort to construct the learning data. In this paper, we
propose the T-S reverse detection, a simple yet effective self-supervised
approach to learn ECG representations. Inspired by the temporal and spatial
characteristics of ECG signals, we flip the original signals horizontally
(temporal reverse), vertically (spatial reverse), and both horizontally and
vertically (temporal-spatial reverse). Learning is then done by classifying
four types of signals including the original one. To verify the effectiveness
of the proposed method, we perform a downstream task to detect atrial
fibrillation (AF) which is one of the most common ECG tasks. The results show
that the ECG representations learned with our method achieve remarkable
performance. Furthermore, after exploring the representation feature space and
investigating salient ECG locations, we conclude that the temporal reverse is
more effective for learning ECG representations than the spatial reverse.

for the collapsar model. Although all other characteristics of the burst are
consistent with it being a Type II (i.e., collapse of a massive star) event,
the observed duration of the event is only approximately 1 s, which is at odds
with the predicted allowable timescale range for a collapsar event. To resolve
this dilemma, this {\it Letter} proposes that the original burst could be an
intrinsically long GRB comprising of a precursor and a main emission (ME)
phase. However, the main emission phase is missed due to either precession of
the jet or the obstruction of a companion star, leaving only the precursor
observed as a short-duration GRB 200826A. Interestingly, we found that the
temporal and spectral properties of GRB 200826A broadly resembled those of the
bright precursor observed in GRB 160625B. Furthermore, assuming the prototype
burst of GRB 200826A is similar to that of GRB 160625B, we found that the
observer may indeed miss its main emission because of geometric effects caused
either by jet precession or companion-obstruction models. Our approach provides
a natural explanation for the GRB 200826A-like bursts and agrees with the
rarity of those events.

processes may dominate momentum exchange over direct particle collisions.
Plasma streaming instabilities can couple the momentum of the DM to
counter-streaming baryons or other DM and result in the counter-streaming
fluids coming to rest with each other, just as happens for baryonic
collisionless shocks in astrophysical systems. While electrostatic plasma
instabilities are highly suppressed by Landau damping when DM is millicharged,
in the cosmological situations of interest, electromagnetic instabilities such
as the Weibel can couple momenta, assuming that the linear instability
saturates in the manner typically found for baryonic plasmas. We find that the
streaming of DM in the pre-Recombination universe is affected more strongly by
direct collisions than collective processes, validating previous constraints.
However, when considering magnetized Weibel and Firehose instabilities, the
properties of the Bullet Cluster merger are likely to be substantially altered
if $[q_\chi/m_\chi] \gtrsim 10^{-12}-10^{-11}$, where $[q_\chi/m_\chi]$ is the
charge-to-mass ratio of the DM relative to that of the proton. The Weibel
growth rates are even faster in the case of a dark-$U(1)$ charge, potentially
ruling out $[q_\chi/m_\chi] \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ in the Bullet Cluster system, in
agreement with previous work. The strongest previous limits on millicharged DM
(mDM) arise from considering the spin-down of galactic disks. We show that
plasma instabilities or tangled background magnetic fields could lead to
diffusive propagation of the DM, weakening these spin-down limits. Thus, plasma
instabilities may place some of the most stringent constraints over much of the
millicharged, and our results corroborate previous extremely stringent

packing pipeline, express delivery), with its goal to improve the packing
efficiency and reduce the transportation cost. In this NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem, the position and quantity of each item in the box are
strictly restricted by complex constraints and special customer requirements.
Existing approaches are hard to obtain the optimal solution since rigorous
constraints cannot be handled within a reasonable computation load. In this
paper, for handling this difficulty, the packing knowledge is extracted from
historical data collected from the packing pipeline of Huawei. First, by fully
exploiting the relationship between historical packing records and input
orders(orders to be packed) , the problem is reformulated as a set cover
problem. Then, two novel strategies, the constraint handling and process
acceleration strategies are applied to the classic column generation approach
to solve this set cover problem. The cost of solving pricing problem for
generating new columns is high due to the complex constraints and customer
requirements. The proposed constraints handling strategy exploits the
historical packing records with the most negative value of the reduced cost.
Those constraints have been implicitly satisfied in these historical packing
records so that there is no need to conduct further evaluation on constraints,
thus the computational load is saved. To further eliminate the iteration
process of column generation algorithm and accelerate the optimization process,
a Learning to Price approach called Modified Pointer Network is proposed, by
which we can determine which historical packing records should be selected
directly. Through experiments on realworld datasets, we show our proposed
method can improve the packing success rate and decrease the computation time

when a control parameter (such as constraint density) is tuned, multiple
threshold phenomena emerge, signaling fundamental structural transitions in
their solution space. Finding solutions around these transition points is
exceedingly challenging for algorithm design, where message passing algorithms
suffer from a large message fluctuation far from convergence. Here we introduce
a residual-based updating step into message passing algorithms, in which
messages varying large between consecutive steps are given high priority in the
updating process. For the specific example of model RB, a typical prototype of
random CSPs with growing domains, we show that our algorithm improves the
convergence of message updating and increases the success probability in
finding solutions around the satisfiability threshold with a low computational
cost. Our approach to message passing algorithms should be of value for
exploring their power in developing algorithms to find ground-state solutions
and understand the detailed structure of solution space of hard optimization

topology, is a fundamental process for rapid release of magnetic energy into
plasma particles that occurs pervasively throughout the universe. In most
natural circumstances, the plasma properties on either side of the reconnection
layer are asymmetric, in particular for the collision rates that are associated
with a combination of density and temperature and critically determine the
reconnection mechanism. To date, all laboratory experiments on magnetic
reconnections have been limited to purely collisional or collisionless regimes.
Here, we report a well-designed experimental investigation on asymmetric
magnetic reconnections in a novel hybrid collisional-collisionless regime by
interactions between laser-ablated Cu and CH plasmas. We show that the growth
rate of the tearing instability in such a hybrid regime is still extremely
large, resulting in rapid formation of multiple plasmoids, lower than that in
the purely collisionless regime but much higher than the collisional case. In
addition, we, for the first time, directly observe the topology evolutions of
the whole process of plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnections by using
highly-resolved proton radiography.

such a system, it is challenging to jointly optimize both radar waveforms and
RIS phase shifts in order to improve the multi-target detection performance. To
tackle this challenge, we design a waveform and phase shift optimization (WPSO)

analyze the performance of the proposed MetaRadar scheme theoretically.
Simulation results show that the detection performance of the MetaRadar scheme
is significantly better than that of the traditional radar schemes.

  Specifically, we show that SNAM with subgradient and proximal gradient
descents provably converges to zero training loss as $t\to\infty$, and that the

that SNAM, similar to LASSO, can have exact support recovery, i.e. perfect
feature selection, with appropriate regularization. Moreover, we show that the
SNAM can generalize well and preserve the `identifiability', recovering each

interactions, extending our earlier study of quantum radiation from a
stationary atom's internal degree of freedom, modeled by a harmonic oscillator,
to the emittance of classical radiation. By assuming that the atom interacts
with a quantum scalar field initially in a coherent state, we show how a
stochastic component of the internal dynamics of the atom arises from the
vacuum fluctuations of the field, resulting in the emittance of quantum
radiation, whose reaction induces quantum dissipation in the internal dynamics.
We also show how the deterministic mean field drives the internal classical
mean component to emit classical radiation and receive classical radiation
reaction. Both components are statistically distinct and fully decoupled. It is
clearly seen that the effects of the vacuum fluctuations of the field are
matched with those of quantum radiation reaction, not with classical radiation
reaction, as the folklore goes. In contrast to the quantum component of the
atom's internal dynamics, which always equilibrates, the relaxation dynamics of
the classical component largely depends on the late-time behavior of the mean
field. For the values of the parameters defining the coherent state of the
field much greater than unity, if the mean field remains periodic, then the
internal dynamics of the atom will appear classical and periodic. If the mean
field diminishes with time, then the classical component of the atom's internal
dynamics subsides but the quantum component will abide and dynamically
equilibrate. This also explains why quantum radiation from a stationary atom is
not observed, and a probe located far away only sees classical radiation. Our
analysis therefore paints a continuum landscape starting from vacuum
fluctuations in the quantum field to classical radiation and radiation
reaction.

the proposed neuron has parameters that can change its activation function

turns out that parametrization allows the proposed neuron to fit underlying
patterns that the existing neuron cannot fit. As a result, the proposed neuron
produces optimal solutions for the six classification problems addressed here,
while the existing neuron only solves two of them. Finally, we demonstrate the
feasibility of those quantum neuron solutions on a quantum simulator.

also arises in an approximate way in tetralayer systems, in which the outer

acquire a degree of tunability through either controlling the screening in the

monitoring and prediction of traffic flow at a high spatiotemporal resolution.
However, evacuation traffic prediction is challenging due to the uncertainties
caused by sudden changes in projected hurricane paths and consequently
household evacuation behavior. Moreover, modeling spatiotemporal traffic flow
patterns requires extensive data over a longer time period, whereas evacuations
typically last for 2 to 5 days. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven
approach for predicting evacuation traffic at a network scale. We develop a
dynamic graph convolution LSTM (DGCN-LSTM) model to learn the network dynamics
of hurricane evacuation. We first train the model for non-evacuation period
traffic data showing that the model outperforms existing deep learning models
for predicting non-evacuation period traffic with an RMSE value of 226.84.
However, when we apply the model for evacuation period, the RMSE value
increased to 1440.99. We overcome this issue by adopting a transfer learning
approach with additional features related to evacuation traffic demand such as
distance from the evacuation zone, time to landfall, and other zonal level
features to control the transfer of information (network dynamics) from
non-evacuation periods to evacuation periods. The final transfer learned
DGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE=399.69).
The implemented model can be applied to predict evacuation traffic over a
longer forecasting horizon (6 hour). It will assist transportation agencies to
activate appropriate traffic management strategies to reduce delays for

Dataset owners who spend time and money to collect and curate the data are

mechanisms for demonstrating their ownership of the dataset in question.
Dataset watermarking provides one approach for ownership demonstration which
can, in turn, deter unauthorized use. In this paper, we investigate a recently
proposed data provenance method, radioactive data, to assess if it can be used
to demonstrate ownership of (image) datasets used to train machine learning
(ML) models. The original paper reported that radioactive data is effective in
white-box settings. We show that while this is true for large datasets with
many classes, it is not as effective for datasets where the number of classes
is low $(\leq 30)$ or the number of samples per class is low $(\leq 500)$. We
also show that, counter-intuitively, the black-box verification technique is
effective for all datasets used in this paper, even when white-box verification
is not. Given this observation, we show that the confidence in white-box
verification can be improved by using watermarked samples directly during the
verification process. We also highlight the need to assess the robustness of
radioactive data if it were to be used for ownership demonstration since it is
an adversarial setting unlike provenance identification.
  Compared to dataset watermarking, ML model watermarking has been explored
more extensively in recent literature. However, most of the model watermarking
techniques can be defeated via model extraction. We show that radioactive data
can effectively survive model extraction attacks, which raises the possibility
that it can be used for ML model ownership verification robust against model
extraction.

  Checkpoints during Training","Demo paper, accepted at SIGIR2022",,"10.1145/3477495.3531658",,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The process of model checkpoint validation refers to the evaluation of the
performance of a model checkpoint executed on a held-out portion of the
training data while learning the hyperparameters of the model, and is used to
avoid over-fitting and determine when the model has converged so as to stop
training. A simple and efficient strategy to validate deep learning checkpoints
is the addition of validation loops to execute during training. However, the
validation of dense retrievers (DR) checkpoints is not as trivial -- and the
addition of validation loops is not efficient. This is because, in order to
accurately evaluate the performance of a DR checkpoint, the whole document
corpus needs to be encoded into vectors using the current checkpoint before any
actual retrieval operation for checkpoint validation can be performed. This
corpus encoding process can be very time-consuming if the document corpus
contains millions of documents (e.g., 8.8m for MS MARCO and 21m for Natural
Questions). Thus, a naive use of validation loops during training will
significantly increase training time. To address this issue, in this demo
paper, we propose Asyncval: a Python-based toolkit for efficiently validating
DR checkpoints during training. Instead of pausing the training loop for
validating DR checkpoints, Asyncval decouples the validation loop from the
training loop, uses another GPU to automatically validate new DR checkpoints
and thus permits to perform validation asynchronously from training. Asyncval
also implements a range of different corpus subset sampling strategies for
validating DR checkpoints; these strategies allow to further speed up the
validation process. We provide an investigation of these methods in terms of
their impact on validation time and validation fidelity. Asyncval is made
available as an open-source project at https://github.com/ielab/asyncval.

gain from preferentially assigning a binary treatment to those with high values
of a running variable $x$. The design objective is any continuous function of
the expected information matrix in a two-line regression model, and short-term
gain is expressed as the covariance between the running variable and the
treatment indicator. We investigate how to specify design functions indicating
treatment probabilities as a function of $x$ to optimize these competing
objectives, under external constraints on the number of subjects receiving
treatment. Our results include sharp existence and uniqueness guarantees, while
accommodating the ethically appealing requirement that treatment probabilities
are non-decreasing in $x$. Under such a constraint, there always exists an
optimal design function that is constant below and above a single
discontinuity. When the running variable distribution is not symmetric or the
fraction of subjects receiving the treatment is not $1/2$, our optimal designs
improve upon a $D$-optimality objective without sacrificing short-term gain,
compared to the three level tie-breaker designs of Owen and Varian (2020) that
fix treatment probabilities at $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. We illustrate our optimal

First, benign-malignant discrimination is often assessed by human observers
without pathologic diagnoses at the nodule level. We termed these data as
""unsure data"". Second, a classifier does not necessarily acquire reliable
nodule features for stable learning and robust prediction with patch-level
labels during learning. In this study, we construct a sure dataset with
pathologically-confirmed labels and propose a collaborative learning framework
to facilitate sure nodule classification by integrating unsure data knowledge
through nodule segmentation and malignancy score regression. A loss function is
designed to learn reliable features by introducing interpretability constraints
regulated with nodule segmentation maps. Furthermore, based on model inference
results that reflect the understanding from both machine and experts, we
explore a new nodule analysis method for similar historical nodule retrieval
and interpretable diagnosis. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that our
approach is beneficial for achieving improved performance coupled with faithful
model reasoning for lung cancer prediction. Extensive cross-evaluation results
further illustrate the effect of unsure data for deep-learning-based methods in
lung nodule classification.

as h$\alpha$mp, h$\alpha$mr, l$\alpha$mp, and l$\alpha$mr disks, which
correspond to the features of high-$\alpha$ or low-$\alpha$, and metal-poor or
metal-rich. Combined with the spatial and stellar age information, we confirm
that they are well interpreted in the two-infall formation model. The first
infall of turbulent gas quickly forms the hot and thick h$\alpha$mp disk with
consequent thinner h$\alpha$mr and l$\alpha$mr disks. Then the second gas
accretion forms a thinner and outermost l$\alpha$mp disk. We find that the

sequence of three inner disks. Importantly, we reveal the inverse Age-[M/H]

Stochastic fluctuations in the counts of biological macromolecules have

stationary regime, and as such finding their expression in terms of the model

when the stationary distributions of the original model, whose state space is
potentially infinite, coincide exactly with the stationary distributions of the

The finite subsets of states we identify are called copies and are inspired by
the modular topology of reaction network models. With such a choice we prove a

bifurcating the object to clockwise or counter-clockwise rotations. Two soft
sensors are embedded in parallel over a single soft finger, and the difference
in the resistance measurements is compared when the finger is displaced or bent
in a particular direction, which can identify the bifurcation direction and aid
in the break of symmetry approach without the need of external tracking
devices. The sensors performance is also characterised by extending and bending
the finger without an object interaction. During an experiment that performs a
break of symmetry, manipulated objects turn clockwise and counter-clockwise
depending on the perturbation and actuation frequency, sensors can track the
direction of rotation. The embedded sensors provide a self-sensing capability
for implementing a closed-loop control in future work. The soft ring actuator
performance presents a self-organisation behaviour with soft fingers rotating
an object without a required control for rotating the object. Therefore, the
soft fingers are an underactuated system with complex behaviour when

modes. However, TPhCs with weak topology at optical frequencies have not been
demonstrated so far. Here, we use scattering-type scanning near field optical
microscopy to verify mid-bandgap zero-dimensional light localization close to
100 THz in a TPhC with nontrivial Zak phase and an edge dislocation. We show
that due to the weak topology, differently extended dislocation centers induce
similarly strong light localization. The experimental results are supported by
full-field simulations. Along with the underlying fundamental physics, our
results lay a foundation for the application of TPhCs based on weak topology in
active topological nanophotonics, and nonlinear and quantum optic integrated
devices due to their strong and robust light localization.

Consequently, the discriminative capability of nodes is limited, resulting in
sub-optimal clustering performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel
deep graph clustering algorithm termed Improved Dual Correlation Reduction
Network (IDCRN) through improving the discriminative capability of samples.
Specifically, by approximating the cross-view feature correlation matrix to an
identity matrix, we reduce the redundancy between different dimensions of
features, thus improving the discriminative capability of the latent space
explicitly. Meanwhile, the cross-view sample correlation matrix is forced to
approximate the designed clustering-refined adjacency matrix to guide the
learned latent representation to recover the affinity matrix even across views,
thus enhancing the discriminative capability of features implicitly. Moreover,
we avoid the collapsed representation caused by the over-smoothing issue in
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) through an introduced propagation
regularization term, enabling IDCRN to capture the long-range information with
the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks

introducing two sets of tiles that move in opposite directions, thus zeroing

observations to a reference database, which requires careful preprocessing, or
supervised machine learning, which requires a fairly large number of training
observations from each class. We propose a new machine learning technique for
Raman spectrum matching, based on contrastive representation learning, that
requires no preprocessing and works with as little as a single reference
spectrum from each class. On three datasets we demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves or is on par with the state of the art in prediction
accuracy, and we show how to compute conformal prediction sets with specified
frequentist coverage. Based on our findings, we believe contrastive
representation learning is a promising alternative to existing methods for

beyond a critical size, they split into smaller ones spontaneously. The
critical size for splitting depends on the frequency of electric field and the

the physical properties of bacteria as charged particles are responsible for
the formation of dynamic clusters. Electroconvective flows across the system
play the key role in stabilizing the clusters. However, to form clusters,
collective hydrodynamic cooperation between bacteria is important such that no
aggregation occurs in dilute suspensions. The findings in this study illustrate
that bio-systems can respond collectively to an external field, promising an
effective way to control and modulate the behavior of organisms. Moreover, the
controlled aggregation and condensation of bacteria offer a robust approach to
improve the local concentration of bacteria for early and rapid detection,

significant combustion phenomena called detonation will occur provided the

balance laws with a large shock front as free boundary. In present paper, we
establish the global well-posedness of entropy solutions via wave front
tracking scheme within the framework of $BV\cap L^1$ space. The main
difficulties here stem from the discontinuous source term without uniform

degenerate characteristic field. In dealing with the obstacles caused by
ignition temperature, we develop a modified Glimm-type functional to control
the oscillation growth of combustion waves, even if the exothermic source fails
to uniformly decay. As to the characteristic boundary, the degeneracy of
contact discontinuity is fully employed to get elegant stability estimates near
the piston boundary. Meanwhile, we devise a weighted Lyapunov functional to
balance the nonlinear effects arising from large shock, characteristic boundary

on a graph that relates the global network properties to individual connections
between nodes. In addition, the Kron reduction method is a standard tool for
reducing or eliminating the desired nodes, which preserves the interconnection
structure and the effective resistance of the original graph. Although these
two graph-theoretic concepts stem from the electric network on an undirected
graph, they also have a number of applications throughout a wide variety of

for directed graphs. Furthermore, we prove that this reduction method preserves
the structure of the original graphs, such as the strong connectivity or weight
balance. In addition, we generalize the effective resistance to a directed
graph using Markov chain theory, which is invariant under a Kron reduction.
Although the effective resistance of our proposal is asymmetric, we prove that
it induces two novel graph metrics in general strongly connected directed
graphs. In particular, the effective resistance captures the commute and
covering times for strongly connected weight balanced directed graphs. Finally,
we compare our method with existing approaches and relate the hitting
probability metrics and effective resistance in a stochastic case. In addition,
we show that the effective resistance in a doubly stochastic case is the same

we propose a new approximation method based on the previous lightcut method and
a low-rank matrix factorization model. As many researchers pointed out, the
lighting matrix is low rank, which implies that it can be completed from a
small set of known entries.
  We first generate a conservative global light cut with bounded error and
partition the lighting matrix into slices by the coordinate and normal of the
surface points using the method of lightslice. Then we perform two passes of
randomly sampling on each matrix slice. In the first pass, uniformly
distributed random entries are sampled to coarsen the global light cut, further
clustering the similar light for the spatially localized surface points of the
slices. In the second pass, more entries are sampled according to the
possibility distribution function estimated from the first sampling result.
Then each matrix slice is factorized into a product of two smaller low-rank
matrices constrained by the sampled entries, which delivers a completion of the
lighting matrix. The factorized form provides an additional speedup for adding
up the matrix columns which is more GPU friendly. Compared with the previous
lightcut based methods, we approximate the lighting matrix with some signal
specialized bases via factorization. The experimental results shows that we can
achieve significant acceleration than the state of the art many-light methods.

associated reduced scheme $X=Y_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $Y$ can
be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If $n$ is the
multiplicity of $Y$, there is a canonical filtration $X=X_1\subset
X_2\subset\cdots\subset X_n=Y$, such that $X_i$ is a primitive multiple scheme
of multiplicity $i$. The simplest example is the trivial primitive multiple
scheme of multiplicity $n$ associated to a line bundle $L$ on $X$: it is the
$n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood of $X$, embedded in the line bundle $L^*$ by
the zero section.
  The main subject of this paper is the construction and properties of fine
moduli spaces of vector bundles on primitive multiple schemes. Suppose that
$Y=X_n$ is of multiplicity $n$, and can be extended to $X_{n+1}$ of
multiplicity $n+1$, and let $M_n$ a fine moduli space of vector bundles on
$X_n$. With suitable hypotheses, we construct a fine moduli space $M_{n+1}$ for
the vector bundles on $X_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $X_n$ belongs to $M_n$. It
is an affine bundle over the subvariety $N_n\subset M_n$ of bundles that can be
extended to $X_{n+1}$. In general this affine bundle is not banal. This applies
in particular to Picard groups.
  We give also many new examples of primitive multiple schemes $Y$ such that
the dualizing sheaf $\omega_Y$ is trivial (in the case of surfaces they are
called K3-carpets).

  Prediction and Out-of-Distribution Generalization","Accepted at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-instance learning (MIL) deals with objects represented as bags of
instances and can predict instance labels from bag-level supervision. However,
significant performance gaps exist between instance-level MIL algorithms and
supervised learners since the instance labels are unavailable in MIL. Most
existing MIL algorithms tackle the problem by treating multi-instance bags as
harmful ambiguities and predicting instance labels by reducing the supervision
inexactness. This work studies MIL from a new perspective by considering bags
as auxiliary information, and utilize it to identify instance-level causal
representations from bag-level weak supervision. We propose the CausalMIL
algorithm, which not only excels at instance label prediction but also provides
robustness to distribution change by synergistically integrating MIL with
identifiable variational autoencoder. Our approach is based on a practical and
general assumption: the prior distribution over the instance latent
representations belongs to the non-factorized exponential family conditioning
on the multi-instance bags. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms various baselines on
instance label prediction and out-of-distribution generalization tasks.

identify two key aspects of the problem that render standard solutions
ineffective - i) while good forecasts of future FX rates can be highly
effective in guiding good decisions, forecasting FX rates is difficult, and
erroneous estimates tend to degrade the performance of trading agents instead
of improving it, ii) the inherent non-stationary nature of FX rates renders a
fixed decision-threshold highly ineffective. To address these problems, we
propose a novel supervised learning approach that learns to forecast the top-K
future FX rates instead of forecasting all the future FX rates, and bases the
hold-versus-sell decision on the forecasts (e.g. hold if future FX rate is
higher than current FX rate, sell otherwise). Furthermore, to handle the
non-stationarity in the FX rates data which poses challenges to the i.i.d.

decision-thresholds based on recent historical episodes. Through extensive

such as retinal blood vessel segmentation for early detection of vessel
diseases and pavement crack segmentation for road condition evaluation and
maintenance. Currently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive
performance on these tasks. Yet, most of them mainly focus on finding powerful
deep architectures but ignore capturing the inherent curvilinear structure
feature (e.g., the curvilinear structure is darker than the context) for a more
robust representation. In consequence, the performance usually drops a lot on
cross-datasets, which poses great challenges in practice. In this paper, we aim
to improve the generalizability by introducing a novel local intensity order
transformation (LIOT). Specifically, we transfer a gray-scale image into a
contrast-invariant four-channel image based on the intensity order between each
pixel and its nearby pixels along with the four (horizontal and vertical)
directions. This results in a representation that preserves the inherent
characteristic of the curvilinear structure while being robust to contrast
changes. Cross-dataset evaluation on three retinal blood vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrates that LIOT improves the generalizability of some
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the cross-dataset evaluation between
retinal blood vessel segmentation and pavement crack segmentation shows that
LIOT is able to preserve the inherent characteristic of curvilinear structure
with large appearance gaps. An implementation of the proposed method is

selects the most informative and representative ones for label acquisition. We
achieve the selection mechanism via a graph reasoning network that considers
both the spatial and structural diversities of superpoints. To deploy SSDR-AL
in a more practical scenario, we design a noise-aware iterative labeling
strategy to confront the ""noisy annotation"" problem introduced by the previous
""dominant labeling"" strategy in superpoints. Extensive experiments on two point
cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SSDR-AL in the semantic
segmentation task. Particularly, SSDR-AL significantly outperforms the baseline
method and reduces the annotation cost by up to 63.0% and 24.0% when achieving
90% performance of fully supervised learning, respectively.

observed in compounds that have an in-plane Cu-O distance close to ~1.92
Angstroms. On the other hand, direct measurements of the electron-phonon
coupling lambda as a function of Cu-O distance show a clear linear correlation,
implying that Tc is a strongly non-linear function of lambda. Conventional
superconductivity theories based on the electron-phonon interaction predict a
monotonic dependence of Tc on electron phonon coupling constant, which makes
them incompatible with the observed behaviour. The observed cross-over
behaviour as a function of lambda suggests that Tc occurs at the cross-over
from weak to strong coupling, which is also associated with the onset of
carrier localization. A coexistence, with a dynamical exchange of localized and
itinerant carriers in a two-component superconductivity scenario are in
agreement with the observed anomalous behavior and are suggested to be the key
to understanding the mechanism for achieving high Tc.

deliberation process operates via k-compromise transitions, where agents from k
(current) coalitions come together to form a larger coalition in order to
support a (perhaps new) proposal, possibly leaving behind some of the
dissenting agents from their old coalitions. A deliberation succeeds if it
terminates by identifying a proposal with the largest possible support. For
deliberation in d dimensions, Elkind et al. consider two variants of their
model: in the Euclidean model, proposals and agent locations are points in R^d

k >= d. We complement their analysis by (1) proving that in both models it is

log transformation to model trend and stabilize variance. Additional

minimize the electricity cost consisting of the price of electricity and the
peak electricity tariff both altered by the load from class activities and
battery use as well as the penalty of not scheduling some optional activities.
The schedule of the class activities is obtained through evolutionary

observing expert demonstrations and learning the expert's underlying reward
function. Although learning the reward functions from demonstrations has
achieved great success in various tasks, several other challenges are mostly
ignored. Firstly, existing IRL methods try to learn the reward function from
scratch without relying on any prior knowledge. Secondly, traditional IRL
methods assume the reward functions are homogeneous across all the
demonstrations. Some existing IRL methods managed to extend to the
heterogeneous demonstrations. However, they still assume one hidden variable
that affects the behavior and learn the underlying hidden variable together
with the reward from demonstrations. To solve these issues, we present Context
Hierarchy IRL(CHIRL), a new IRL algorithm that exploits the context to scale up
IRL and learn reward functions of complex behaviors. CHIRL models the context
hierarchically as a directed acyclic graph; it represents the reward function
as a corresponding modular deep neural network that associates each network
module with a node of the context hierarchy. The context hierarchy and the
modular reward representation enable data sharing across multiple contexts and
state abstraction, significantly improving the learning performance. CHIRL has
a natural connection with hierarchical task planning when the context hierarchy
represents subtask decomposition. It enables to incorporate the prior knowledge
of causal dependencies of subtasks and make it capable of solving large complex
tasks by decoupling it into several subtasks and conquering each subtask to
solve the original task. Experiments on benchmark tasks, including a large
scale autonomous driving task in the CARLA simulator, show promising results in
scaling up IRL for tasks with complex reward functions.

various brain-machine interface applications such as epileptic seizure
prediction. However, existing approaches typically train models in a
patient-specific fashion due to the highly personalized characteristics of
epileptic signals. Therefore, only a limited number of labeled recordings from
each subject can be used for training. As a consequence, current DNN based
methods demonstrate poor generalization ability to some extent due to the
insufficiency of training data. On the other hand, patient-independent models
attempt to utilize more patient data to train a universal model for all
patients by pooling patient data together. Despite different techniques
applied, results show that patient-independent models perform worse than
patient-specific models due to high individual variation across patients. A
substantial gap thus exists between patient-specific and patient-independent
models. Approach. In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme based on
knowledge distillation which makes use of a large amount of data from multiple
subjects. It first distills informative features from signals of all available
subjects with a pre-trained general model. A patient-specific model can then be
obtained with the help of distilled knowledge and additional personalized data.
Main results. Four state-of-the-art seizure prediction methods are trained on
the Children's Hospital of Boston-MIT sEEG database with our proposed scheme.
The resulting accuracy, sensitivity, and false prediction rate show that our
proposed training scheme consistently improves the prediction performance of
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Significance. The proposed training
scheme significantly improves the performance of patient-specific seizure
predictors and bridges the gap between patient-specific and patient-independent
predictors.

designed and fabricated a focal plane array with metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
structure metamaterial absorbers for further research. The absorption spectrum
with incident angles from 20 to 60 was measured using THz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS), and the experimental results reveal that the absorption
spectrum changes with incident angle variations. A basic analytical asymmetric
peak model for extracting absorption-frequency characteristics was developed in
this study to quantitatively explore this variation in the absorber behavior
with incident angles. The best result was that the frequency corresponding to
the highest absorption can be easily found using this peak model. The
experimental data was coherent with the validation of the asymmetric peak
model. Moreover, a second model to quantitatively relate parameters to the
incident angle was discovered, allowing for the prediction of absorption
spectrum shifts and changes. The absorption spectrum was predicted to have a

operators for the infinite-dimensional space of initial conditions of domain
wall type, generally intended as initial conditions spatially interpolating
between two different ground states. At large times the unitary time evolution
takes place inside a light cone produced by the spatial inhomogeneity of the
initial condition. In the innermost part of the light cone the form of the
space-time dependence is universal, in the sense that it is specified by data
of the equilibrium universality class. The global limit shape in the variable
$x/t$ changes with the initial condition. In systems with more than two ground
states the tuning of an interaction parameter can induce a transition which is
the nonequilibrium quantum analog of the interfacial wetting transition
occurring in classical systems at equilibrium. We illustrate the general
results through the examples of the Ising, Potts and Ashkin-Teller chains.

compared. The first approach, dubbed the canonical one, uses expressions for
the energy-momentum and spin tensors that have properties that follow a direct
application of Noether's theorem, which yields a totally antisymmetric spin
tensor. The other one is based on a simplified form of the spin tensor and is
commonly used in the current literature under the name of a phenomenological
approach. We show that these two frameworks are equivalent, i.e., they can be
directly connected by a suitably defined pseudogauge transformation, only if
the first framework is initially improved by a suitable modification of the
energy-momentum tensor (addition of a divergence-free term that cannot be
interpreted as a pseudogauge). Our analysis uses arguments related to the
positivity of entropy production. The latter turns out to be equivalent for the
improved canonical and phenomenological frameworks.

First, the complex electron wave function is recovered for a convergent beam

Subsequently a corresponding patch of the phase object is recovered using the
phase object approximation (POA). Repeating this for each scan position in a

ultrashort laser pulses [1] sparked a wave of studies [2,3] as a probe of
charge carrier dynamics in solids under strong fields and a route to extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond photonic devices [4]. High harmonic generation
(HHG) in liquids [5,6] is far less explored, despite their relevance to
biological media, and the mechanism is hotly debated. Using few-cycle pulses
below the breakdown threshold, we demonstrate HHG in alcohol with data showing
carrier-envelope-phase-dependent XUV spectra extending to 50 eV from
isopropanol. We study the mechanism of the harmonic emission through its
dependence on the driving field and find it to be consistent with a
strong-field recombination mechanism. This maps emitted photon energy to the
electron trajectories. We explore the role of the liquid environment in
scattering the trajectories and find evidence that information on electron
scattering from neighbouring molecules is encoded in the harmonic spectra.
Using simulations we exploit this to estimate the scattering cross section and
we confirm that the cross-section in liquid isopropanol is significantly
reduced compared to vapour. Our findings suggest an \textit{in situ}
measurement strategy for retrieving accurate values of scattering cross
sections in liquids, and also a pathway to liquid-based attosecond XUV devices.

Over the years, a variety of methods tackling VCR have advanced the performance

treat the two processes in a separate manner and hence decompose the VCR into
two irrelevant VQA instances. As a result, the pivotal connection between
question answering and rationale inference is interrupted, rendering existing

exceed the initial one. It is shown that, the ability of DM interaction to
generate entanglement is larger than that displayed for the dipole interaction.
The possibility of maximizing the quantum correlations between the three qubits
increases as one increase the strength of interaction and starting with large
initial quantum correlations. The long-lived quantum correlations could be
achieved by controlling the strength of the dipole interaction.

the pursuit of solving this problem, the research field of time-resolved
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4D MRI) has evolved. However, current
techniques are unsuitable for most interventional settings because they lack
sufficient temporal and/or spatial resolution or have long acquisition times.
In this work, we propose a novel approach for real-time, high-resolution 4D MRI
with large fields of view for MR-guided interventions. To this end, we trained
a convolutional neural network (CNN) end-to-end to predict a 3D liver MRI that
correctly predicts the liver's respiratory state from a live 2D navigator MRI
of a subject. Our method can be used in two ways: First, it can reconstruct
near real-time 4D MRI with high quality and high resolution (209x128x128 matrix
size with isotropic 1.8mm voxel size and 0.6s/volume) given a dynamic
interventional 2D navigator slice for guidance during an intervention. Second,
it can be used for retrospective 4D reconstruction with a temporal resolution
of below 0.2s/volume for motion analysis and use in radiation therapy. We
report a mean target registration error (TRE) of 1.19 $\pm$0.74mm, which is
below voxel size. We compare our results with a state-of-the-art retrospective
4D MRI reconstruction. Visual evaluation shows comparable quality. We show that
small training sizes with short acquisition times down to 2min can already
achieve promising results and 24min are sufficient for high quality results.
Because our method can be readily combined with earlier methods, acquisition
time can be further decreased while also limiting quality loss. We show that an
end-to-end, deep learning formulation is highly promising for 4D MRI
reconstruction.

The potential is gradually softened such that rigorous four-body equations for

observed, and the accuracy of the procedure is improved by extrapolating in one

at least some of earlier determinations and shed light on the existing
disagreements. An additional case of the Phillips correlation line is
established for the dimer-dimer scattering length. The trimer production rate

finite-range effects despite the weak binding of the dimer.

crystals stay in suspension in the host liquid before being deposited at its
bottom (or top, for light particles). We perform a systematic 3D numerical
study of particle-laden Rayleigh-Benard convection, and derive a robust model
for the particle residence time. For Rayleigh numbers higher than 10^7,
inertial particles' trajectories exhibit a monotonic transition from fluid
tracer-like to free-fall dynamics, the control parameter being the ratio
between particle Stokes velocity and the fluid velocity. The average settling
rate is proportional to the particle Stokes velocity in both the end-member
regimes, but the distribution of the residence times differs markedly from one
to the other. For lower Rayleigh numbers (<10^7), an interaction between
large-scale circulation and particle motion emerges, increasing the settling
rates on average. Nevertheless, the mean residence time does not exceed the
terminal time, i.e. the settling time from a quiescent fluid, by a factor
larger than four. An exception are simulations with only a slightly
super-critical Rayleigh number (~ 10^4), for which stationary convection
develops and some particles become trapped indefinitely. 2D simulations of the
same problem overestimate the flow-particle interaction - and hence the
residence time - for both high and low Rayleigh numbers, which stresses the
importance of using 3D geometries for simulating particle-laden flows. We
outline how our model can be used to explain depth changes of crystal size
distribution in sedimentary layers of magmatic intrusions that are thought to
have formed via settling of a crystal cargo, and discuss how the
micro-structural observations of solidified intrusions can be used to infer the

strategy to leverage the inductive bias brought by prior domain mappings for

neural network, is that a bottleneck is required to prevent learning the
identity function. Learning the identity function renders the AEs useless for
anomaly detection. In this work, we challenge this limiting belief and
investigate the value of non-bottlenecked AEs.
  The bottleneck can be removed in two ways: (1) overparameterising the latent
layer, and (2) introducing skip connections. However, limited works have
reported on the use of one of the ways. For the first time, we carry out
extensive experiments covering various combinations of bottleneck removal
schemes, types of AEs and datasets. In addition, we propose the infinitely-wide
AEs as an extreme example of non-bottlenecked AEs.
  Their improvement over the baseline implies learning the identity function is
not trivial as previously assumed. Moreover, we find that non-bottlenecked

graphene, we study the ground state property of an effective Anderson model,
consisting of three dangling $sp^2$ orbitals of the surrounding carbon atoms
around the vacancy and the $\pi$ orbitals of carbon atoms that form the
honeycomb lattice with a single vacancy. Employing the block-Lanczos
density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that there are two phases
in the relevant parameter space, i.e., a nonmagnetic phase in the weak coupling
region and a free magnetic moment phase in the realistic parameter region. The
systematic analysis finds that, in the free magnetic moment phase, local
multiplets of the doubly degenerate irreducible representation of the
$\mathcal{C}_3$ point group with spin 1 become dominant in the ground state,
and approximately half of this local spin 1 is screened by electrons in the
surrounding $\pi$ orbitals, indicating the emergence of the residual spin-1/2
free magnetic moment. Furthermore, we find that the emergence of the free
magnetic moment is robust against carrier doping, which is in sharp contrast to
the case of graphene with an adatom, thus explaining the qualitative difference
observed experimentally in these two classes of systems. We also find the
enhancement of the spin correlation function between $\pi$ electrons around the
vacancy and those in the conduction band away from the vacancy in the undoped
case, as compared to that in the doped case, while the spin correlation
function between the $\sigma$ electrons in the $sp^2$ dangling orbitals around
the vacancy and the $\pi$ electrons in the conduction band remains large in
both undoped and doped cases. Our calculations thus support qualitatively the
previous experiment that suggests the emergence of free magnetic moment with
two distinct origins.

Under appropriate conditions each sub-structure has four stable equilibrium
states. This gives the system under investigation the ability to remain stable
in a large number of complex states, which is a vital ability for myriad of
applications, including reconfigurable structures and soft robots. The
theoretical model explains the dynamics of a single straw-like element in a
discrete manner, considering inertial, damping, and gravitational effects,
while taking into account the nonlinear elasticity of the elastic frusta, and
assuming hydrostatic behavior of the entrapped fluid. After identifying the
geometric and elastic parameters of the theoretical model based on relatively
simple experiments, the model is validated compared to numerical simulations
and experiments. The numerical simulations validate the theoretical elasticity
of the elastic frusta, whereas the overall dynamic behavior of the system and
the influence of unmodeled fluidic effects are examined experimentally. It is
demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that straw-like elements cannot
be adequately modeled using simple uniaxial deformations. In addition, the
experimental validation indicates that the suggested model can accurately
capture their overall dynamics.

convolution with a scaled Gaussian kernel. We start by establishing convergence
rates to functions from periodic Sobolev spaces and we show that the saturation
rate is $O(h^{2}),$ where $h$ is the scale of the Gaussian kernel. Taken from a
discrete point of view, this result can be interpreted as the accuracy that can
be achieved on the uniform grid with spacing $h.$ In the discrete setting, the
curse of dimensionality would place severe restrictions on the computation of
the approximation. For instance, a spacing of $2^{-n}$ would provide an
approximation converging at a rate of $O(2^{-2n})$ but would require
$(2^{n}+1)^{d}$ grid points. To overcome this we introduce a sparse grid
version of Gaussian convolution approximation, where substantially fewer grid
points are required, and
  show that the sparse grid version delivers a saturation rate of
$O(n^{d-1}2^{-2n}).$ This rate is in line with what one would expect in the
sparse grid setting (where the full grid error only deteriorates by a factor of
order $n^{d-1}$) however the analysis that leads to the result is novel in that
it draws on results from the theory of special functions and key observations

Accounting for uncertainties in the particle balance equation is important for

affected by plasma composition. JET deuterium and mixed hydrogen-deuterium
plasma discharges heated by neutral beams only are analysed with the TRANSP

the prescribed ion temperature, plasma rotation and impurity content might
result in a noticeable over- or underestimate of the computed neutron rate. A
significant difference in the time evolution of the measured and computed
neutron rate is observed in the interpretive simulations if same diffusivity
for electrons and thermal ions is assumed. Increased thermal deuterium ion
transport is required to reach agreement with the plasma composition measured
at the plasma edge and the measured neutron rate. Thermal ion density computed

called validators for that system if their validity constraints validate that

that for systems of validators, the effect that Byzantine components can have
on honest nodes is precisely identical to the effect that equivocating

of electron tunneling as given by the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect.
This characteristic is mainly assessed considering three transport mechanisms:
direct tunneling, thermionic emission, and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Here, by
analyzing the effect of temperature on TER, we show that taking into account
only these mechanisms may not be enough in order to fully characterize the
performance of FTJ devices. We approach the electron tunneling in FTJ with the
non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is able to overcome the

that the performance of FTJs is also affected by temperature, in a non-trivial
way, via resonance (Gamow-Siegert) states, which are present in the electron
transmission probability and are usually situated above the barrier. Although
the NEGF technique does not provide direct access to the wavefunctions, we show
that, for single-band transport, one can find the wavefunction at any given

implementation: PLSSVM uses different interchangeable backends--OpenMP, CUDA,
OpenCL, SYCL--supporting modern hardware from various vendors like NVIDIA, AMD,

failure, and more precisely aims to determine which inputs are more likely to
lead to the failure of the system. The Shapley effects are quantitative global
sensitivity indices which are able to deal with correlated input variables.

the failure probability is small. Moreover, an extension to the case where only
an i.i.d. input/output N-sample distributed according to the importance

the Shapley effects only with a data set distributed according to the
importance sampling auxiliary distribution stemming from a reliability analysis

importance sampling. We also provide numerical guidelines and finally,

electrostatics of the FeFET exhibit an oscillatory conduction band profile. To
capture such oscillations, we solve coupled 2-D Poisson's equation with the net
ferroelectric energy density (gradient energy + free energy + depolarization
energy) equation. Multi-domain dynamics are captured by minimizing the net
ferroelectric energy leading to a thermodynamically stable state. Furthermore,
we show that the motion of domain walls originates local bound charge density
in the ferroelectric region, which induces the negative capacitance (NC)
effect. The strength of domain wall-induced NC is determined by the gradient
energy of the ferroelectric material. FeFET exhibits variability in the drain
current with domain period due to the inherent NC effect. Additionally, the
impact of domain wall transition (soft$\rightleftharpoons$hard) on the device's
electrostatic/transport is also analyzed. The model also accurately captures
both nucleations of a new domain and the motion of the domain wall.
Furthermore, the model is thoroughly validated against experimental results and

empirically justify the performance degradation of the existing methods on
these OoD datasets, which serves as evidence to justify the modality bias
learning. In addition, to overcome this problem, we propose a plug-and-play
loss function method, whereby the feature space for each label is adaptively
learned according to the training set statistics. Thereafter, we apply this
method on eight baselines in total to test its effectiveness. From the results
on four datasets regarding the above three tasks, our method yields remarkable
performance improvements compared with the baselines, demonstrating its
superiority on reducing the modality bias problem.

these instance features act as a conditioning for IC-GAN image generation,

regression models to predict instance features, noise vectors, and dense

reconstruct novel test images based on these fMRI-predicted variables. The
generated images presented state-of-the-art results in terms of capturing the
semantic attributes of the original test images while remaining relatively
faithful to low-level image details. Finally, we use the learned regression

measurement, conventional entropy measures are susceptible to length and
amplitude changes in time series. A new entropy metric, neural network entropy
(NNetEn), has been developed to overcome these limitations. NNetEn entropy is
computed using a modified LogNNet neural network classification model. The
algorithm contains a reservoir matrix of N=19625 elements that must be filled
with the given data. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, this
work investigates different methods of filling the reservoir with time series
(signal) elements. The reservoir filling method determines the accuracy of the
entropy estimation by convolution of the study time series and LogNNet test
data. The present study proposes 6 methods for filling the reservoir for time
series. Two of them (Method 3 and Method 6) employ the novel approach of
stretching the time series to create intermediate elements that complement it,
but do not change its dynamics. The most reliable methods for short time series
are Method 3 and Method 5. The second part of the study examines the influence
of noise and constant bias on entropy values. Our study examines three
different time series data types (chaotic, periodic, and binary) with different
dynamic properties, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and offsets. The NNetEn
entropy calculation errors are less than 10% when SNR is greater than 30 dB,
and entropy decreases with an increase in the bias component. The third part of
the article analyzes real-time biosignal EEG data collected from emotion
recognition experiments. The NNetEn measures show robustness under
low-amplitude noise using various filters. Thus, NNetEn measures entropy
effectively when applied to real-world environments with ambient noise, white
noise, and 1/f noise.

process simulation with finite elements had the drawback of remeshing required
by the changing surface geometries. This disadvantage was overcome by a novel
model formulation for the anodic dissolution that utilizes effective material
parameters as well as the dissolution level as an internal variable and,
thereby, does not require remeshing. Now, we extend this concept to model
arbitrarily shaped and moving cathodes. Two methodologies are investigated to
describe the time varying position of the cathode. In the first approach, we
change the electric conductivity of elements within the cathode and, in a
second approach, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodes of
corresponding elements. For both methods, elements on the cathode's surface are
treated with effective material parameters. This procedure allows for the
efficient simulation of industrially relevant, complex geometries without mesh
adaptation. The model's performance is validated by means of analytical,
numerical and experimental results from the literature. The short computation
times make the approach interesting for industrial applications.

photons detected from the radio wavelengths up to high and very high energies,

converts the stellar rotational kinetic energy into radio, X-ray and gamma-ray
photons. Force-free magnetospheres, being dissipationless, cannot operate this
conversion. Some non ideal plasma effects must set in within the magnetosphere.
In this paper, we compute numerical solutions of pulsar radiative
magnetospheres in the radiation reaction limit, where radiation fully balances
single particle acceleration. Using an appropriate Ohm's law, the dissipation
is only controlled by the pair multiplicity factor~$\kappa$. Moreover we allow
for either a minimal radiative region where dissipation is added only where
required or for a force-free inside radiative outside model. This approach
naturally and self-consistently connects the particle dynamics to its radiation
field in the ultra-relativistic regime. Our solutions tend to the force-free
limit for moderately large multiplicities, $\kappa \gg 1$, decreasing the
spin-down energy conversion into radiation. Nevertheless, for sufficiently low
multiplicity $\kappa \lesssim1$, a significant fraction of the spin-down energy
flows into radiation via particle acceleration. The work done by the
electromagnetic field on the plasma mainly occurs in the current sheet of the
striped wind, right outside the light-cylinder. Nevertheless the impact on the
magnetic topology is negligible whatever the model. Therefore the associated
sky maps and light-curves are only weakly impacted as shown.

of the velocity fluctuations, and then define an order parameter as the time
average of the secondary-flow strength. The order parameter displays a
subcritical transition from the laminar to a bistable flow that switches
between weakly chaotic flow and elastic turbulence. The transition to the
bistable flow occurs at the critical Weissenberg number $\mathrm{Wi_c}=12$.
Above $\mathrm{Wi_c}$, in the elastic turbulent state, we observe a strong
increase in velocity fluctuations and flow resistance, which we define as the
total work performed on the fluid. Upon starting simulations in the turbulent
state and subsequently lowering $\mathrm{Wi}$ below its critical value, we
observe hysteretic behavior in the order parameter and the flow resistance,
which is a common feature of a subcritical transition. Hysteresis has also been
found in experiments. Additionally, we find power-law scaling in the spatial
and temporal power spectra of the velocity fluctuations, characteristic for
elastic turbulence. The maximum values of the power-law exponents in our
simulations are $\alpha_t= 3.41$ for the temporal exponent and $\alpha_s= 3.17$

this work, we address this limitation. We propose ask2mask (ATM), a novel
approach to focus on specific samples during MSM pre-training. ATM employs an

two different ways: 1) A fine-grained data selection is performed by masking
over the highly confident input frames as chosen by the scorer. This allows the
model to learn meaningful representations. 2) ATM is further extended to focus
at utterance-level by weighting the final MSM loss with the utterance-level
confidence score. We conduct fine-tuning experiments on two well-benchmarked

  While such tools improved in many ways, including performance and accuracy

enriched in heavy elements compared to solar abundances. The prevailing view is
that giant planets accreted multiple Earth masses of heavy elements after the
end of core formation. Such late solid enrichment is commonly explained by the
accretion of planetesimals. Planetesimals are expected to form at the edges of
planetary gaps, and here we address the question of whether these planetesimals
can be accreted in large enough amounts to explain the inferred high heavy
element contents of giant planets. We perform a series of N-body simulations of
the dynamics of planetesimals and planets during the planetary growth phase,
taking into account gas drag as well as the enhanced collision cross-section
caused by the extended envelopes. We consider the growth of Jupiter and Saturn
via gas accretion after reaching the pebble isolation mass and we include their
migration in an evolving disk. We find that the accretion efficiency of
planetesimals formed at planetary gap edges is very low: less than 10% of the
formed planetesimals are accreted even in the most favorable cases, which in
our model corresponds to a few Earth-masses. When planetesimals are assumed to
form beyond the feeding zone of the planets, extending to a few Hill radii from
a planet, accretion becomes negligible. Furthermore, we find that the accretion
efficiency increases when the planetary migration distance is increased and
that the efficiency does not increase when the planetesimal radii are
decreased. Based on these results we conclude that it is difficult to explain
the large heavy element content of giant planets with planetesimal accretion
during the gas accretion phase. Alternative processes most likely are required,
e.g. accretion of vapor deposited by drifting pebbles.

of two multivariate normal samples that share a population covariance matrix.
Hotelling's test is not ideal for high-dimensional samples because the
eigenvalues of the estimated sample covariance matrix are inconsistent
estimators for their population counterparts. We replace the sample covariance
matrix with the nonlinear shrinkage estimator of Ledoit and Wolf 2020. We
observe empirically for sub-Gaussian data that the resulting algorithm
dominates past methods (Bai and Saranadasa 1996, Chen and Qin 2010, and Li et
al. 2020) for a family of population covariance matrices that includes matrices
with high or low condition number and many or few nontrivial -- i.e., spiked --
eigenvalues.

order but lacking the periodicity of a crystal. In colloidal systems,
quasicrystals are typically predicted for particles with complex or highly
specific interactions, which makes experimental realization difficult. Here, we
propose an ideal colloidal model system for quasicrystal formation: binary
mixtures of hard spheres sedimented onto a flat substrate. Using computer
simulations, we explore both the close-packing and spontaneous self-assembly of
these systems over a wide range of size ratios and compositions. Surprisingly,
we find that this simple, effectively two-dimensional model systems forms not
only a variety of crystal phases, but also two quasicrystal phases: one
dodecagonal and one octagonal. Intriguingly, the octagonal quasicrystal
consists of three different tiles, whose relative concentrations can be
continuously tuned via the composition of the binary mixture. Both phases form
reliably and rapidly over a significant part of parameter space, making hard
spheres on a plane an ideal model system for exploring quasicrystal
self-assembly on the colloidal scale.

regularization of third-order Taylor polynomial of the smooth part.
Specifically, approximate solutions of the auxiliary problems are obtained by
using a Bregman gradient method as inner solver. Different from existing
adaptive approaches for high-order methods, in our new schemes the
regularization parameters are adjusted taking into account the progress of the
inner solver. With this technique, we show that the basic method finds an

have a large impact on the forecast user. Although weighted scoring rules have
become a well-established tool to achieve this, such scores have been studied
almost exclusively in the univariate case, with interest typically placed on
extreme events. However, a large impact may also result from events not
considered to be extreme from a statistical perspective: the interaction of
several moderate events could also generate a high impact. Compound weather
events provide a good example of this. To assess forecasts made for high-impact
events, this work extends existing results on weighted scoring rules by
introducing weighted multivariate scores. To do so, we utilise kernel scores.
We demonstrate that the threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score
(twCRPS), arguably the most well-known weighted scoring rule, is a kernel
score. This result leads to a convenient representation of the twCRPS when the
forecast is an ensemble, and also permits a generalisation that can be employed
with alternative kernels, allowing us to introduce, for example, a
threshold-weighted energy score and threshold-weighted variogram score. To
illustrate the additional information that these weighted multivariate scoring
rules provide, results are presented for a case study in which the weighted
scores are used to evaluate daily precipitation accumulation forecasts, with
particular interest on events that could lead to flooding.

moments of the top quark-$Z$ boson interactions in the context of the Bestest
Little Higgs Model (BLHM). For this purpose, we derive the corresponding
Feynman rules. Among the new contributions, there are those arising from the
vertices of scalar bosons, vector bosons and heavy quarks contribution:
$tq_iS_i$, ($S_i=h_0, H_0, A_0, \phi^{0}, \eta^{0}, \sigma, H^{\pm},
\phi^{\pm}, \eta^{\pm}$); $tq_iV_i$, ($V_i= \gamma, Z, W, Z', W'$); and
$Zq_i\bar q_i$ ($q_i=b, t, B, T, T_5, T_6, T^{2/3}, T^{5/3}$). With these new
vertices, we calculate the one-loop contributions to the weak dipole moments
$a^W_t$ and $d^W_t$ of the top-quark in several scenarios. We found that with
the parameters of the BLHM of $m_{A_0}= 1000$ GeV, $m_{\eta^0}= 100$ GeV,
$F=4000$ GeV, $f=[1000, 3000]$ GeV and $\tan\beta=3$, the $a^W_t$ reaches
values with a sensitivity of $a^{W}_{t}= 2.49 \times 10^{-4}-1.26 \times
10^{-5}i$, $1.26 \times 10^{-4}-5.41\times 10^{-6}i$, where the main
contribution comes from the scalars $h_0$ and $H_0$, which couples to the
top-quark of the Standard Model and the top-quarks of the BLHM. These values
seem to be out of the reach of the expected experimental sensitivity of present
experiments. However, experiments on future colliders are expected to be
sensitive enough to measure the AWMDM of the top-quark. Our study complements
other studies at the level of one-loop with an extended scalar sector.

further integration with other high-performance components like low-loss delay

formulation with time-discounted quadratic objective for nonlinear systems
admitting an exponential $\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov function. We show that with a
suitable parameterization of the MHE objective, the $\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov
function serves as an $M$-step Lyapunov function for MHE. Provided that the
estimation horizon is chosen large enough, this directly implies exponential
stability of MHE. The stability analysis is also applicable to full information
estimation, where the restriction to exponential $\delta$-IOSS can be relaxed.
Moreover, we provide simple LMI conditions to systematically derive
$\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov functions, which allows us to easily verify
$\delta$-IOSS for a large class of nonlinear detectable systems. This is useful
in the context of MHE in general, since most of the existing nonlinear (robust)
stability results for MHE depend on the system being $\delta$-IOSS
(detectable). In combination, we thus provide a framework for designing MHE
schemes with guaranteed robust exponential stability. The applicability of the
proposed methods is demonstrated with a nonlinear chemical reactor process and
a 12-state quadrotor model.

arising from utility maximization. The main idea is to directly start from the
dynamical programming equation and compute the conditional expectation using a
novel representation of the conditional density function through the Dirac
Delta function and the corresponding series representation. We obtain an
explicit series representation of the value function, whose coefficients are
expressed through integration of the value function at a later time point
against a chosen basis function. Thus we are able to set up a recursive
integration time-stepping scheme to compute the optimal value function given
the known terminal condition, e.g. utility function. Due to tensor
decomposition property of the Dirac Delta function in high dimensions, it is
straightforward to extend our approach to solving high-dimensional stochastic
control problems. The backward recursive nature of the method also allows for
solving stochastic control and stopping problems, i.e. mixed control problems.
We illustrate the method through solving some two-dimensional stochastic
control (and stopping) problems, including the case under the classical and
rough Heston stochastic volatility models, and stochastic local volatility
models such as the stochastic alpha beta rho (SABR) model.

acts on produced charged particles. The impact of these interactions on charged
pion transverse-mass and rapidity spectra, as well as on pion-pion momentum
correlations is investigated in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.4 GeV.
We show that the low-mt part of the data ($m_t < 0.2$ GeV/c$^2$) can be well
described with a Coulomb-modified Boltzmann distribution that also takes
changes of the Coulomb field during the expansion of the fireball into account.
The observed centrality dependence of the fitted mean Coulomb potential
deviates strongly from a $A_{part}^{2/3}$ scaling, indicating that, next to the
fireball, the non-interacting charged spectators have to be taken into account.
For the most central collisions, the Coulomb modifications of the HBT source
radii are found to be consistent with the potential extracted from the
single-pion transverse-mass distributions. This finding suggests that the
region of homogeneity obtained from two-pion correlations coincides with the
region in which the pions freeze-out. Using the inferred mean-square radius of
the charge distribution at freeze-out, we have deduced a baryon density, in
fair agreement with values obtained from statistical hadronization model fits
to the particle yields.

intermetallic compounds play a key role, thanks to mild temperatures and

hydrogen-based devices, and in this work, the intermetallic compound
TiFe$_{0.85}$Mn$_{0.05}$ is evaluated and selected as H$_2$-carrier for a
storage system of 50 kg of H$_2$. A batch of 5 kg of alloy was synthesized at
industrial level and characterized through scanning electron microscopy and
powder X-ray diffraction, to determine the structure and phase abundance.
Moreover, the hydrogen sorption properties were investigated through
thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, followed by a long-term cycling study and
resistance to O$_2$ and H$_2$O poisoning. Comparing results for alloys with
same nominal composition, but prepared either under industrial or laboratory
conditions, it was found that the alloy synthesis promotes discrepancies in
phase abundance and microstructure and promotes the formation of a passive
layer that deeply affect the hydrogen sorption properties. A scheme based on
Monte Carlo simulation and structural results was developed to explain the key
role of the passive layer (Ti$_3$Fe$_3$O) and of the secondary phases
(Ti$_4$Fe$_2$O$_{0.4}$ and $\beta$-Ti$_{80}$(Fe,Mn)$_2$0) in promoting the
hydrogenation of the TiFe$_{0.85}$Mn$_{0.05}$. A storage system based on this
alloy can be integrated with an electrolyser upstream (25 bar) and a fuel cell
downstream (1 bar) at 55 $^\circ$C, storing 1.0 H$_2$ wt.%, displaying fast
kinetic, resistance to oxygen, water and nitrogen gas impurities, and stability

interviews with 15 CISOs and six senior organisational leaders, between October
2019 and July 2020, as part of a wider exploration into the purpose of CISOs
and cyber-security functions. In this paper, we employ broader security
scholarship related to ontological security and sociological notions of
identity work to provide an interpretative analysis of the CISO role in
organisations. Research findings reveal that cyber security is an expert system
that positions the CISO as an interpreter of something that is mystical,
unknown and fearful to the uninitiated. They show how the fearful nature of
cyber security contributes to it being considered an ontological threat by the
organisation, while responding to that threat contributes to the organisation's
overall identity. We further show how cyber security is analogous to a belief
system and how one of the roles of the CISO is akin to that of a modern-day
soothsayer for senior management; that this role is precarious and, at the same
time, superior, leading to alienation within the organisation. Our study also
highlights that the CISO identity of protector-from-threat, linked to the
precarious position, motivates self-serving actions that we term `cyber
sophistry'. We conclude by outlining a series of implications for both
organisations and CISOs.

this work, we first assess the robustness of these pre-trained methods to fully

methods such as CutPaste. We then propose SROC, a Simple Refinement strategy

show that our simple heuristic competes with, and even outperforms much more
complex strategies from the existing literature.

calibrating both ALMA and MSDP data and then demonstrating a reasonable
correlation between both. In particular we can see quite similar fine-structure

temperatures. However, having current observations only in one band, we use an
independent diagnostic constraint which is the H$\alpha$ line integrated
intensity. We develop an inversion code and show that it can provide realistic
temperatures for brighter parts of the prominence where one gets a unique
solution, while within faint structures such inversion is ill conditioned. In
brighter parts ALMA serves as a prominence thermometer, provided that the
optical thickness in Band 3 is large enough. In order to find a relation
between brightness and kinetic temperatures for a given observed H$\alpha$

  data","11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables",,,,"astro-ph.IM gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The sensitivity of gravitational-waves detectors is characterized by their
noise curves which determine the detector's reach and the ability to accurately
measure the parameters of astrophysical sources. The detector noise is
typically modelled as stationary and Gaussian for many practical purposes.
However, physical changes in the state of detectors due to environmental and
instrumental factors, including extreme cases where a detector discontinues
observing for some time, introduce non-stationarity into the noise. Even slow
evolution of the detector sensitivity will affect long duration signals such as
binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Mis-estimation of the noise behavior
directly impacts the posterior width of the signal parameters. This becomes an
issue for studies which depend on accurate localization volumes such as i)
probing cosmological parameters (such as Hubble constant, clustering bias)
using cross-correlation methods with galaxies, ii) doing electromagnetic
follow-up using localization information from parameter estimation done from
pre-merger data. We study the effects of dynamical noise on the parameter
estimation of the GW events. We develop a new method to correct dynamical noise
by estimating a locally-valid pseudo PSD which is normalized along the
time-frequency track of a potential signal. We do simulations by injecting the
BNS signal in various scenarios where the detector goes through a period of
non-stationarity with reference noise curve of third generation detectors
(Cosmic explorer, Einstein telescope). As an example, for a source where

jet particles and electromagnetic flux. Here we consider a simple analytical
model for relativistic jets at larger distances from their launching sites,
assuming a cylindrical axisymmetric geometry with a radial velocity shear, and
purely toroidal magnetic field. We argue that, as long as the jet plasma is in
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, such outflows tend to be particle dominated,
i.e. the ratio of the electromagnetic to particle energy flux, integrated over
the jet cross-sectional area, is typically below unity, $\sigma < 1$. At the
same time, for particular magnetic and radial velocity profiles, magnetic
pressure may still dominate over particle pressure for certain ranges of the
jet radius, i.e. the local jet plasma parameter $\beta_{pl} < 1$, and this may
be relevant in the context of particle acceleration and production of
high-energy emission in such systems. The jet magnetization parameter can be
elevated up to the modest values $\sigma \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$ only in the
case of extreme gradients or discontinuities in the gaseous pressure, and a
significantly suppressed velocity shear. Such configurations, which consist of
a narrow, unmagnetized jet spine surrounded by an extended, force-free layer,
may require an additional poloidal field component to stabilize them against
current-driven oscillations, but even this will not elevate substantially their
$\sigma$ parameter.

PSPACE-complete for synchronizing once and infinitely often, and PTIME-complete

remarkably in line with the special case of MDPs, while the algorithmic

the spectroscopic training set has a very different distribution in

line confusion causes a fraction of the training spectroscopic sample to not

focus on the investigation of confidence calibration for object detection and
segmentation models in this chapter. We introduce the concept of multivariate
confidence calibration that is an extension of well-known calibration methods
to the task of object detection and segmentation. This allows for an extended
confidence calibration that is also aware of additional features such as
bounding box/pixel position, shape information, etc. Furthermore, we extend the
expected calibration error (ECE) to measure miscalibration of object detection
and segmentation models. We examine several network architectures on MS COCO as
well as on Cityscapes and show that especially object detection as well as
instance segmentation models are intrinsically miscalibrated given the
introduced definition of calibration. Using our proposed calibration methods,
we have been able to improve calibration so that it also has a positive impact
on the quality of segmentation masks as well.

here, ranging from a compilation of variations on the Standard Model through
the more distant quasi-steady-state cosmology, plasma cosmology, or universe
models as a hypersphere, to the most exotic cases including static models.
  The present-day standard model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM, gives us a
representation of a cosmos whose dynamics is dominated by gravity with a finite
lifetime, large scale homogeneity, expansion and a hot initial state, together
with other dark elements necessary to avoid certain inconsistencies with
observations. There are however some models with characteristics that are close
to those of the standard model but differing in some minor aspects: different
considerations on CP violation, inflation, number of neutrino species,
quark-hadron phase transition, baryonic or non-baryonic dark-matter, dark
energy, nucleosynthesis scenarios, large-scale structure formation scenarios;
or major variations like a inhomogeneous universe, Cold Big Bang, varying
physical constants or gravity law, zero-active mass (also called `R_h=ct'),
Milne, and cyclical models.
  At the most extreme distance from the standard model, the static models, a
non-cosmological redshift includes `tired-light' hypotheses, which assume that
the photon loses energy owing to an intrinsic property or an interaction with
matter or light as it travels some distance, or other non-standard ideas.
  Our impression is that none of the alternative models has acquired the same
level of development as Lambda-CDM in offering explanations of available
cosmological observations. One should not, however, judge any theory in terms
of the number of observations that it can successfully explain (ad hoc in many
cases) given the much lower level of development of the alternative ones.

of research interest. Computational modeling and simulation allows for studying
musculoskeletal systems. Specifically, predictive simulation approaches offer
researchers the opportunity to predict and study new biological motions without

permutations and g) effort goal weight. Identified on related research studies,
we evaluated the following risk factors: vertical Ground Reaction Force, knee

remains valid in the absence of mirror symmetry and for non-commensurate
chains. The defined bulk quantity takes integer values, is gauge invariant, and
can be interpreted as the difference of the number of edge states between a

invokes a chiral-like symmetry present in this model.

versatile capability in manipulating electromagnetic wave. Advanced designs to
satisfy multiple objectives with non-linear constraints have motivated
researchers in using machine learning (ML) techniques like deep learning (DL)
for accelerated design of metasurfaces. For metasurfaces, it is difficult to
make quantitative comparisons between different ML models without having a
common and yet complex dataset used in many disciplines like image
classification. Many studies were directed to a relatively constrained datasets
that are limited to specified patterns or shapes in metasurfaces. In this
paper, we present our SUTD polarized reflection of complex metasurfaces
(SUTD-PRCM) dataset, which contains approximately 260,000 samples of complex
metasurfaces created from electromagnetic simulation, and it has been used to
benchmark our DL models. The metasurface patterns are divided into different
classes to facilitate different degree of complexity, which involves
identifying and exploiting the relationship between the patterns and the
electromagnetic responses that can be compared in using different DL models.
With the release of this SUTD-PRCM dataset, we hope that it will be useful for
benchmarking existing or future DL models developed in the ML community. We
also propose a classification problem that is less encountered and apply neural
architecture search to have a preliminary understanding of potential
modification to the neural architecture that will improve the prediction by DL
models. Our finding shows that convolution stacking is not the dominant element
of the neural architecture anymore, which implies that low-level features are
preferred over the traditional deep hierarchical high-level features thus
explains why deep convolutional neural network based models are not performing
well in our dataset.

accurate spectral analysis. In this work, we developed a deep learning model to
overcome the effects of such variations and classify graphene Raman spectra
according to different charge densities and dielectric environments. We
consider two approaches: deep learning models and machine learning algorithms
to classify spectra with slightly different charge density or dielectric
environment. These two approaches show similar success rates for high
Signal-to-Noise data. However, deep learning models are less sensitive to
noise. To improve the accuracy and generalization of all models, we use data
augmentation through additive noise and peak shifting. We demonstrated the
spectra classification with 99% accuracy using a convolutional neural net (CNN)
model. The CNN model is able to classify Raman spectra of graphene with
different charge doping levels and even subtle variation in the spectra between
graphene on SiO$_2$ and graphene on silanized SiO$_2$. Our approach has the
potential for fast and reliable estimation of graphene doping levels and
dielectric environments. The proposed model paves the way for achieving
efficient analytical tools to evaluate the properties of graphene.

  Cancer",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The accurate diagnosis and molecular profiling of colorectal cancers are
critical for planning the best treatment options for patients. Microsatellite
instability (MSI) or mismatch repair (MMR) status plays a vital role in
appropriate treatment selection, has prognostic implications and is used to
investigate the possibility of patients having underlying genetic disorders
(Lynch syndrome). NICE recommends that all CRC patients should be offered
MMR/MSI testing. Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to assess MMR status
with subsequent molecular testing performed as required. This incurs
significant extra costs and requires additional resources. The introduction of
automated methods that can predict MSI or MMR status from a target image could
substantially reduce the cost associated with MMR testing. Unlike previous
studies on MSI prediction involving training a CNN using coarse labels (MSI vs
Microsatellite Stable (MSS)), we have utilised fine-grain MMR labels for
training purposes. In this paper, we present our work on predicting MSI status
in a two-stage process using a single target slide either stained with CK8/18
or H&E. First, we trained a multi-headed convolutional neural network model
where each head was responsible for predicting one of the MMR protein
expressions. To this end, we performed the registration of MMR stained slides
to the target slide as a pre-processing step. In the second stage, statistical
features computed from the MMR prediction maps were used for the final MSI
prediction. Our results demonstrated that MSI classification can be improved by
incorporating fine-grained MMR labels in comparison to the previous approaches
in which only coarse labels were utilised.

optimization is data-free and depends solely on the predictions of the neural

ortho-loss, motivates the network to discover pair-wise orthogonal
eigenfunctions. The second loss term, called norm-loss, requests the discovery
of normalized eigenfunctions and is used to avoid trivial solutions. We find
that embedding even or odd symmetries to the neural network architecture
further improves the convergence for relevant problems. Lastly, a patience

proposed unsupervised learning method is used to solve the finite well,
multiple finite wells, and hydrogen atom eigenvalue quantum problems.

Production Vehicle Routing Problem (MoP-VRP). In this problem, vehicles are
equipped with 3D printers, and production takes place on the way to the
customer. The objective is to minimize the weighted cost incurred by travel and
delay of service. We formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and
develop an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for this
problem. To show the advantage of mobile production, we compare the problem
with the Central Production Vehicle Routing Problem (CP-VRP), where production
takes place in a central depot. We also propose an efficient ALNS for the
CP-VRP. We generate benchmark instances based on Vehicle Routing Problem with
Time Windows (VRPTW) benchmark instances, and realistic instances based on
real-life data provided by the Danish Company 3D Printhuset. Overall, the
proposed ALNS for both problems are efficient, and we solve instances up to 200
customers within a short computational time. We test different scenarios with
varying numbers of machines in each vehicle, as well as different production
time. The results show that these are the key factors that influence travel and
delay costs. The key advantage of mobile production is flexibility: it can
shorten the time span from the start of production to the delivery of products,
and at the same time lower delivery costs. Moreover, long-term cost estimations
show that this technology has low operation costs and thus is feasible in real
life practice.

Let $P=uvz$ be a 2-path of a 2-connected, $k$-regular graph $G$ on at most $2k$

and universal theories that describe our universe. Many theories assume the
presence of an absolute space and time in which the physical objects are
located and physical processes take place. However, it is more fundamental to
understand time as relative to the motion of another object, e.g. the number of
swings of a pendulum, and the position of an object primarily as relative to
other objects. The goals of this paper is to explain, how using the principle
of relationalism (to be introduced below), classical mechanics can be
formulated on a most elementary space, which is freed from absolute entities:
shape space. On shape space only the relative orientation and length of
subsystems are taken into account. In order to find out how the shape of a
classical system evolves in time, the method of ""symplectic reduction of
Hamiltonian systems"" is extended to include scale transformations, and in this
way the reduction of a classical system with respect to the full similarity
group is achieved. A necessary requirement for the validity of the principle of
relationalism is that changing the length scale of a system, all parameters of
the theory that depend on the length, get changed accordingly. In particular,
the principle of relationalism requires a proper transformation of the coupling
constants of the interaction potentials in Classical Physics. This leads
consequently to a transformation in Planck's measuring units, which enables us
to derive a metric on shape space in a unique way. Later in this paper, we will
explain the derivation of the reduced Hamiltonian and symplectic form on shape
space.

printability can be tuned by accessories such as heating and UV modules.
Software associated with Printer.HM were designed to accept geometry inputs
including computer-aided design models, coordinates, equations, and pictures,
to create prints of distinct characteristics. Printer.HM could further perform
versatile operations, such as liquid dispensing, non-planar printing, and
pick-and-place of meso-objects. By mix-and-match software and hardware
settings, Printer.HM demonstrated printing of pH-responsive soft actuators,
plant-based functional hydrogels, and organ macro-anatomical models.
Integrating affordability and open design, we envisage the Printer.HM concept
to widen open innovations for soft, biological, and sustainable material

The model requires the action of a special type of detector that detects and
records individual particles. According to our model, microscopic particles are
classical entities that follow classical trajectories without nonlocal
interactions between them. As long as they remain undetected, particles carry
the information of a phase equal to an action integral along their trajectory.
At the point of their detection, our special type of detector collects the
phases from all particles reaching it, adds them up over time as complex
numbers, and divides them by the square root of their number. The detector
records a detection each time the square of the magnitude of the ensuing vector
crosses an integer value. We test our model with numerical simulations of a
double-slit experiment, and obtain an interference pattern analogous to the one
observed in an actual physical experiment.

All these methods estimate the perceptual magnitudes of the stimuli on a scale.
However, procedures such as Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS) have
shown that considering perceptual distances can bring benefits in terms of
discriminatory power, observers' cognitive load, and the number of trials
required. One of the disadvantages of the MLDS method is that the perceptual
scales obtained for stimuli created from different source content are generally
not comparable. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MLDS method that
ensures inter-content comparability of the results and shows its usefulness
especially in the presence of observer errors.
