Extended abstract appeared at IWOCA 2022",,,,"cs.DM cs.CC cs.DS math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The NP-complete graph problem Cluster Editing seeks to transform a static
graph into a disjoint union of cliques by making the fewest possible edits to
the edges. We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal
graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when
restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain
two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it
is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it
contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general
characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the
temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden
configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an
FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of
modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.

physiology. A fenestration is a shunt between the systemic and pulmonary veins
that is added either at the time of Fontan conversion or at a later time for
the treatment of complications. This shunt increases cardiac output and
decreases systemic venous pressure. However, these hemodynamic benefits are
achieved at the expense of a decrease in the arterial oxygen saturation. The
model developed this paper incorporates fenestration size as a parameter and
describes both blood flow and oxygen transport. It is calibrated to clinical
data from Fontan patients, and we use it to study the impact of a fenestration
on several hemodynamic variables. In certain scenarios corresponding to
high-risk Fontan physiology, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal
fenestration size that maximizes oxygen delivery to the systemic tissues.

given query keyword occurs. We investigate to what extent keyword localisation
is possible using a visually grounded speech (VGS) model. VGS models are
trained on unlabelled images paired with spoken captions. These models are
therefore self-supervised -- trained without any explicit textual label or
location information. To obtain training targets, we first tag training images
with soft text labels using a pretrained visual classifier with a fixed
vocabulary. This enables a VGS model to predict the presence of a written
keyword in an utterance, but not its location. We consider four ways to equip
VGS models with localisations capabilities. Two of these -- a saliency approach
and input masking -- can be applied to an arbitrary prediction model after
training, while the other two -- attention and a score aggregation approach --
are incorporated directly into the structure of the model. Masked-based
localisation gives some of the best reported localisation scores from a VGS
model, with an accuracy of 57% when the system knows that a keyword occurs in
an utterance and need to predict its location. In a setting where localisation
is performed after detection, an $F_1$ of 25% is achieved, and in a setting
where a keyword spotting ranking pass is first performed, we get a localisation
P@10 of 32%. While these scores are modest compared to the idealised setting
with unordered bag-of-word-supervision (from transcriptions), these models do
not receive any textual or location supervision. Further analyses show that
these models are limited by the first detection or ranking pass. Moreover,
individual keyword localisation performance is correlated with the tagging
performance from the visual classifier. We also show qualitatively how and
where semantic mistakes occur, e.g. that the model locates surfer when queried
with ocean.

in AI, but it becomes extremely challenging when actions can trigger cascades

{\em Cascade} where an agent is shown a video of a physically simulated dynamic
scene, and is asked to intervene and trigger a cascade of events, such that the
system reaches a ""counterfactual"" goal. For instance, the agent may be asked to
""Make the blue ball hit the red one, by pushing the green ball"". The agent
intervention is drawn from a continuous space, and cascades of events makes the
dynamics highly non-linear.
  We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward model and devise
an algorithm that learns to search in semantic trees in continuous spaces. We
demonstrate that our approach learns to effectively follow instructions to
intervene in previously unseen complex scenes. It can also reason about
alternative outcomes, when provided an observed cascade of events.

widespread applications in large-scale machine learning and multi-agent
systems. The same mechanism that enables its success, i.e., information sharing
among participating agents, however, also leads to the disclosure of individual
agents' private information, which is unacceptable when sensitive data are
involved. As differential privacy is becoming a de facto standard for privacy
preservation, recently results have emerged integrating differential privacy
with distributed optimization. However, directly incorporating differential
privacy design in existing distributed optimization approaches significantly
compromises optimization accuracy. In this paper, we propose to redesign and
tailor gradient methods for differentially-private distributed optimization,
and propose two differential-privacy oriented gradient methods that can ensure
both rigorous epsilon-differential privacy and optimality. The first algorithm
is based on static-consensus based gradient methods, and the second algorithm
is based on dynamic-consensus (gradient-tracking) based distributed
optimization methods and, hence, is applicable to general directed interaction
graph topologies. Both algorithms can simultaneously ensure almost sure
convergence to an optimal solution and a finite privacy budget, even when the
number of iterations goes to infinity. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that both goals are achieved simultaneously. Numerical simulations using a
distributed estimation problem and experimental results on a benchmark dataset
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

features of neuronal structures in a region, across age-timepoints, for large

structures by implementing a density multiplier and a new loss function, called
the hallucination loss.Moreover, to alleviate artifacts that occur due to
tiling of large input volumes, we introduce a spatial-consistency module in the
training pipeline of neuReGANerator. We show that neuReGANerator has a
reconstruction accuracy of 94% in predicting neuronal structures. Finally, to
visualize the predicted change in projections, NeuRegenerate offers two modes:
(1) neuroCompare to simultaneously visualize the difference in the structures
of the neuronal projections, across the age timepoints, and (2) neuroMorph, a
vesselness-based morphing technique to interactively visualize the
transformation of the structures from one age-timepoint to the other. Our
framework is designed specifically for volumes acquired using wide-field

the tasks are usually approached by unpaired techniques based on Generative

the learned map is biased, i.e., it does not actually transform the
distribution of low-resolution images to high-resolution ones. Inspired by
these findings, we propose an algorithm for unpaired SR which learns an
unbiased OT map for the perceptual transport cost. Unlike the existing
GAN-based alternatives, our algorithm has a simple optimization objective
reducing the need for complex hyperparameter selection and an application of
additional regularizations. At the same time, it provides a nearly

separability of the data-generating distribution under linear compression.
While it has been long known that linear separability may be maintained by
linear transformations that approximately preserve the inner products between
the domain points, the limit to which the inner products are preserved in order
to maintain linear separability was unknown. In this paper, we show that linear
separability is maintained as long as the distortion of the inner products is
smaller than the squared margin of the original data-generating distribution.
The proof is mainly based on the geometry of hard support vector machines (SVM)
extended from the finite set of training examples to the (possibly) infinite
domain of the data-generating distribution. As applications, we derive bounds
on the (i) compression length of random sub-Gaussian matrices; and (ii)

diffusion in $\R^d\backslash \calU$, where $\calU$ is a bounded obstacle with a
partially absorbing surface $\partial \calU$. We begin by considering a Robin
boundary condition with a constant reactivity $\kappa_0$, and show how previous
results are recovered in the limits $\kappa_0\rightarrow 0,\infty$. We then
generalize the Robin boundary condition to a more general probabilistic model
of diffusion-mediated surface reactions using an encounter-based approach. The
latter considers the joint probability density or propagator
$P(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$ for the pair $(\X_t,\ell_t)$ in the case of a perfectly
reflecting surface, where $\X_t$ and $\ell_t$ denote the particle position and
local time, respectively. The local time determines the amount of time that a
Brownian particle spends in a neighborhood of the boundary. The effects of
surface reactions are then incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition
for the boundary local time. We construct the boundary value problem (BVP)
satisfied by the propagator in the presence of resetting, and use this to
derive implicit equations for the marginal density of particle position and the
survival probability. We highlight the fact that these equations are difficult
to solve in the case of non-constant reactivities, since resetting is not
governed by a renewal process. We then consider a simpler problem in which both
the position and local time are reset. In this case, the survival probability
with resetting can be expressed in terms of the survival probability without
resetting, which allows us to explore the dependence of the MFPT on the
resetting rate $r$ and the type of surface reactions. The theory is illustrated
using the example of a spherically symmetric surface.

parameter to predict the global probability density distribution (pdf) of the
ocean spray. The bursting and collapse of small bubbles on the sea surface from
about 10 to 100 microns produces an extreme energy focusing and the ejection of
a rapid liquid spout whose size reaches the free molecular regime of the
gaseous environment. In these rarefied conditions, simulations show that this
spout yields a jet of sub-micrometer and nanometric scale droplets whose number
and speed can be far beyond any previous estimation, overcoming by orders of
magnitude alternative mechanisms recently proposed. The one-parameter model
fits remarkably well published experimental measurements along five orders of
magnitude of spray size, from about 5 nm to about 0.5 mm. According to this
proposal, the majority of aerosols determining the life on our planet would
have their extremely elusive birth in the uterus-like nano-shape of small
bursting bubbles on the ocean surface at the very latest instants of collapse.

designed to suppress the otherwise overwhelming laser noise by several orders
of magnitude. It is widely believed that TDI can only be applied once all phase

commonly-used Michelson combination X, that TDI can be computed using the raw,
unsynchronized data, thereby avoiding the need for an initial synchronization
processing step and significantly simplifying the initial noise reduction
pipeline. Furthermore, the raw data is free of any potential artifacts
introduced by clock synchronization and reference frame transformation
algorithms, which allows to operate directly on the MHz beatnotes. As a
consequence, in-band clock noise is directly suppressed as part of TDI, in
contrast to the approach previously proposed in the literature (in which large
trends in the beatnotes are removed before the main laser-noise reduction step,
and clock noise is suppressed in an extra processing step). We validate our
algorithm with full-scale numerical simulations that use LISA Instrument and

the optimal value for a decision variable based only on comparisons between

asked to express a preference between two samples, highlighting which one, if
any, is better than the other. The optimization procedure must use the observed
preferences to find the value of the decision variable that is most preferred
by the human decision-maker, while also minimizing the number of comparisons.
In this work, we propose GLISp-r, an extension of a recent preference-based
optimization procedure called GLISp. The latter uses a Radial Basis Function
surrogate to describe the tastes of the individual. Iteratively, GLISp proposes
new samples to compare with the current best candidate by trading off
exploitation of the surrogate model and exploration of the decision space. In
GLISp-r, we propose a different criterion to use when looking for a new
candidate sample that is inspired by MSRS, a popular procedure in the black-box
optimization framework (which is closely related to the preference-based one).
Compared to GLISp, GLISp-r is less likely to get stuck on local optimizers of
the preference-based optimization problem. We motivate this claim
theoretically, with a proof of convergence, and empirically, by comparing the

robustness issues that hinder its applicability in safety-critical domains.
These issues are often addressed by training against worst-case perturbations
of data, a technique known as adversarial training. Although empirically
effective, adversarial training can be overly conservative, leading to
unfavorable trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. To this end,
in this paper we propose a framework called probabilistic robustness that
bridges the gap between the accurate, yet brittle average case and the robust,
yet conservative worst case by enforcing robustness to most rather than to all
perturbations. From a theoretical point of view, this framework overcomes the
trade-offs between the performance and the sample-complexity of worst-case and
average-case learning. From a practical point of view, we propose a novel
algorithm based on risk-aware optimization that effectively balances average-

We present both a model-based and a data-driven strategy to generate surrogate

principles and applies a bottom-up model order reduction (MOR) that preserves
stability and convergence while providing a priori error bounds, although the
resulting reduced-order model may lose its interpretability. The latter
generates interpretable surrogate models by fitting artificial constitutive
relations to a presupposed topological structure using experimental or
simulation data. For the latter, we use Tonti diagrams to systematically
produce differential equations from the assumed topological structure using
algebraic topological semantics that are common to various lumped-parameter
models (LPM). The parameter for the constitutive relations are estimated using
standard system identification algorithms. Our framework is compatible with
various spatial discretization schemes for distributed parameter models (DPM),
and can supports solving engineering problems in different domains of physics.

sensor array system. We consider an array model within which a small number of
sensors are distorted by unknown sensor gain and phase errors. With such an
array model, the problem of joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and
distorted sensor detection is investigated and the problem is formulated under
the framework of low-rank and row-sparse decomposition. We derive an
iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to solve the resulting
problem in both noiseless and noisy cases. The convergence property of the IRLS
algorithm is analyzed by means of the monotonicity and boundedness of the
objective function. Extensive simulations are conducted regarding parameter
selection, convergence speed, computational complexity, and performances of DOA
estimation as well as distorted sensor detection. Even though the IRLS
algorithm is slightly worse than the alternating direction method of
multipliers in detecting the distorted sensors, the results show that our
approach outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of
convergence speed, computational cost, and DOA estimation performance.

robotics by allowing automatic controller design. The automatic controller
design is a crucial approach for designing swarm robotic systems, which require
more complex controllers than a single robot system to lead a desired
collective behaviour. Although the DRL-based controller design method showed
its effectiveness, the reliance on the central training server is a critical
problem in real-world environments where robot-server communication is unstable
or limited. We propose a novel Federated Learning (FL) based DRL training
strategy (FLDDPG) for use in swarm robotic applications. Through the comparison
with baseline strategies under a limited communication bandwidth scenario, it
is shown that the FLDDPG method resulted in higher robustness and
generalisation ability into a different environment and real robots, while the
baseline strategies suffer from the limitation of communication bandwidth. This
result suggests that the proposed method can benefit swarm robotic systems
operating in environments with limited communication bandwidth, e.g., in
high-radiation, underwater, or subterranean environments.

disjoint subsets of a set $R$ of indivisible resources, such that the minimum
utility among all players is maximized. We study the restricted variant, also
known as the Santa Claus problem, where each resource has an intrinsic positive
value, and each player covets a subset of the resources. Bez\'akov\'a and Dani
showed that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor less than
$2$, consequently a great deal of work has focused on approximate solutions.
The principal approach for obtaining approximation algorithms has been via the
Configuration LP (CLP) of Bansal and Sviridenko. Accordingly, there has been
much interest in bounding the integrality gap of this CLP. The existing
algorithms and integrality gap estimations are all based one way or another on
the combinatorial augmenting tree argument of Haxell for finding perfect
matchings in certain hypergraphs. Our main innovation in this paper is to
introduce the use of topological methods for the restricted max-min allocation
problem, to replace the combinatorial argument. This approach yields
substantial improvements in the integrality gap of the CLP. In particular we
improve the previously best known bound of $3.808$ to $3.534$. We also study
the $(1,\varepsilon)$-restricted version, in which resources can take only two
values, and improve the integrality gap in most cases.

the size of the basis set is a bottleneck which limits applications of coupled
cluster (CC) algorithms. This is particularly so for calculations based on 2-
or 4-component relativistic Hamiltonians, which often employ uncontracted basis
sets and lead to large virtual molecular orbital (VMO) spaces. This problem may
be alleviated by employing a more compact set of virtual spinors than those
provided by the canonical Hartree-Fock (HF) set, such as those based on natural
orbitals (NOs). In this paper we describe the implementation of a module for
generating NOs for correlated wavefunctions, and in particular MP2 frozen
natural orbitals (MP2FNOs), as a component of our novel implementation of
relativistic coupled cluster theory for massively parallel architectures [J.
Pototschnig et. al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17, 5509, 2021]. Our
implementation is capable of manipulating both complex and quaternion density
matrices, thus allowing for the generation of both Kramers-restricted and
Kramers-unrestricted MP2FNOs. Furthermore, NOs are re-expressed in the parent
atomic orbital (AO) basis, so that the code also makes it possible to generate
CCSD natural orbitals in AO basis for further analysis. By investigating the
truncation errors of MP2FNOs for both the correlation energy and molecular
properties at CCSD level such as the electric field gradients at the nuclei
(EFGs), electric dipole and quadrupole moments for hydrogen halides HX
(X=F-Ts), and parity-violating energy differences (PV) for H$_2$Y$_2$ (Y=O-Se),
we find that MP2FNOs accelerate the convergence of the correlation energy in a
roughly uniform manner across the periodic table and that, with VMO spaces
truncated to around half the size of the full spaces ones, it is possible to
obtain reliable estimates for both energies and all molecular properties
considered.

theoretical guarantees -- we show that, in general, even for a perfectly
calibrated classifier, there always exist specific pools of candidates for
which its shortlist is suboptimal. Then, we develop a distribution-free
screening algorithm -- called Calibrated Subset Selection (CSS) -- that, given
any classifier and some amount of calibration data, finds near-optimal
shortlists of candidates that contain a desired number of qualified candidates
in expectation. Moreover, we show that a variant of CSS that calibrates a given
classifier multiple times across specific groups can create shortlists with
provable diversity guarantees. Experiments on US Census survey data validate
our theoretical results and show that the shortlists provided by our algorithm
are superior to those provided by several competitive baselines.

to counterbalance anomalous GVD, which in contrast reduces the wave-vector

demonstrated to date in the anomalous dispersion regime. We synthesize here
structured femtosecond pulsed beams known as `space-time' wave packets designed
to realize dispersion-cancellation symmetrically in either the normal- or

density on the mean free path and localization length is characterized. We
observe that in the Mie scattering regime, the independent scattering
approximation is valid up to volume fractions exceeding 10% and often higher
depending on scattering parameter, indicating the mean free path can usually be
calculated much less expensively using the number density and the scattering
cross-section of a single scatterer. We also study localization lengths and
their dependence on particle loading. In the case of heavy particles in a
lighter matrix, we have been able to observe localization only at volume
fractions >30% using the Landauer approach and only for high frequency modes,
exceeding the vibration frequencies of the embedded nanoparticles. Using modal
analysis we show that localization in nanoparticle laden materials is primarily
due to energetic confinement rather than Anderson localization. Subsequently,
we show that by using light particles in a heavy matrix the fraction of
confined modes can be substantially increased.

acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$), and methane (CH$_4$)) become
detectable when observing the atmospheres of various planets using JWST. We
focused on atmospheric models based on the parameters of a small sample of
planets: HD 189733b, HD 209458b, HD 97658b, and Kepler-30c. We computed model
transmission spectra using the Bayesian retrieval package ARCiS. We simulated
observed spectra using the PandExo package. We subsequently ran retrievals on
these spectra to determine whether the molecular abundances can be accurately
retrieved from these simulated spectra. We find that generally we can detect
and retrieve abundances of the hydrocarbon species as long as they have a VMR
above approximately 1x10$^{-7}$-1x10$^{-6}$, at least for the brighter targets.
There are variations based on planet type and instrument(s) used, and these
limits will likely change depending on the abundance of other strong absorbers.
We also find scenarios where the presence of one hydrocarbon is confused with
another; this is often improved when two instruments are combined. C$_2$H$_2$,
CH$_4$, and C$_2$H$_4$ will all be detectable with JWST, provided they are
present in high enough abundances, and that the optimal instruments are chosen.
A combination of two instruments, either NIRSpec G395M and MIRI LRS, or NIRCam
F322W2 and MIRI LRS, is best for observing these species in bright exoplanet
systems, with NIRSpec G395M and MIRI LRS the best option for the HD
189733b-like atmosphere with clouds included. The use of NIRSpec Prism is
tentatively found to be best for fainter targets, potentially in combination
with the MIRI LRS slit mode, although the target we test is too faint to draw
any strong conclusions. Instrument sensitivity, noise, and wavelength range are
all thought to play a role in being able to distinguish spectral features.

designed with privacy in mind (e.g., using TLS for confidentiality). Foreseeing
all privacy issues at the time of protocol design is, however, challenging and
may become near impossible when interaction out of protocol bounds occurs. One
demonstrably not well understood interaction occurs when DHCP exchanges are
accompanied by automated changes to the global DNS (e.g., to dynamically add
hostnames for allocated IP addresses). As we will substantiate, this is a
privacy risk: one may be able to infer device presence and network dynamics
from virtually anywhere on the Internet -- and even identify and track
individuals -- even if other mechanisms to limit tracking by outsiders (e.g.,
blocking pings) are in place.
  We present a first of its kind study into this risk. We identify networks
that expose client identifiers in reverse DNS records and study the relation
between the presence of clients and said records. Our results show a strong
link: in 9 out of 10 cases, records linger for at most an hour, for a selection
of academic, enterprise and ISP networks alike. We also demonstrate how client
patterns and network dynamics can be learned, by tracking devices owned by
persons named Brian over time, revealing shifts in work patterns caused by
COVID-19 related work-from-home measures, and by determining a good time to

entropy production must be nonnegative. In continuum physics such a requirement
is fulfilled by postulating the constitutive equations which represent the
material properties of the bodies in such a way that second law of
thermodynamics is satisfied in arbitrary processes. Such an approach, first
assumed in some pioneering papers by Coleman and Noll \cite{ColNol} and Coleman
and Mizel \cite{ColMiz}, in practice regards second law of thermodynamics as a
restriction on the constitutive equations, which must guarantee that any
solution of the balance laws satisfies also the entropy inequality. As observed
by Muschik and Ehrentraut \cite{MusEhr}, this is a useful operative assumption,
but not a consequence of general physical laws. Indeed, a different point of
view, which regards second law of thermodynamics as a restriction on the
thermodynamic processes, i.e., on the solutions of the system of balance laws,
is possible. This is tantamount to assume that there are solutions of the
balance laws which satisfy the entropy inequality, and solutions which do not
satisfy it. In order to decide what is the correct approach, Muschik and
Erhentraut postulated an amendment to the second law, which makes explicit the
evident but rather hidden assumption that in any point of the body the entropy
production is zero if, and only if, this point is thermodynamic equilibrium.
Then they proved that, given the amendment, second law of thermodynamics is
necessarily a restriction on the constitutive equations and not on the
thermodynamic processes. In the present paper we revisit their proof, lighting
up some geometric aspects which were hidden in Ref. \cite{MusEhr}. Moreover, we
propose an alternative formulation of second law of thermodynamics which
incorporates the amendment.

secondary fragmentation in its aftermath, the fragments should have arrived at
their first perihelion nearly simultaneously, reminiscent of the anticipated
outcome for the two-superfragment model's perihelion return of AD 356 (Sekanina

to appraise possible scientific ramifications of the brief remark by Ammianus
Marcellinus, a Roman historian, that ""in broad daylight comets were seen"" in
late AD 363, only seven years later. The tested scenario, which does not
contradict Ammianus' narrative and is consistent with the contact-binary model,
involves a set of ten sungrazers visible in the daytime, all reaching
perihelion over a period of 4.6 days. As part of this work, I comment on the

porous medium in which the horizontal permeability is larger than the vertical
permeability. It is well known that the classical axisymmetric gravity current
supplied by a constant point source of fluid has an unphysical singularity near
the origin. We address this by considering a pressure-dominated region near the
origin which allows for vertical flow from the source, such that the current
remains of finite depth, whilst beyond this region the flow is
gravity-dominated. At early times the inner pressure-driven region controls the
spreading of the current, but at late times the inner region occupies a
progressively smaller fraction of the current such that the radius increases as
$\sim t^{3/7}$, while the depth near the origin increases approximately as
$\sim t^{1/7}$. The presence of anisotropy highlights this phenomenon, since
the vertical permeability maintains an effect on the flow at late times through
the pressure-driven flow near the origin. Using these results we provide some
quantitative insights into the dominant dynamics which control CO$_2$ migration
through permeable aquifers, as occurs in the context of carbon capture and
storage.

drag term. This approach incorporates many flow rheologies into a single
setting and enables us to investigate the features that set different systems
apart. We derive simple formulae for the onset of linear instability, the
corresponding linear growth rates and related properties including the
existence of monoclinal waves, development of shocks and whether instability is
initially triggered up- or downstream of the wave front. Also included within
our framework is the presence of shear in the flow velocity profile, which is
often neglected in depth-averaged studies. We find that it can significantly
modify the threshold for instability. Constant corrections to the governing
equations to account for sheared profiles via a 'momentum shape factor' act to
stabilize traveling waves. More general correction terms are found to have a
nontrivial and potentially important quantitative effect on the properties
explored. Finally, we have investigated the spatial properties of the dominant
(fastest growing) linear modes. We derive equations for their amplitude and
frequency and find that both features can become severely amplified near the
front of the traveling wave. For flood waves that propagate into a dry
downstream region, this amplification is unbounded in the limit of high
disturbance frequency. We show that the rate of divergence is a function of the
spatial dependence of the wave depth profile at the front, which may be
determined straightforwardly from the drag law.

to describing a broad range of correlated quantum many-body physics from

Quantum computing with rapid developments in recent years has a huge potential
to impact the computation of quantum thermodynamics. To fulfill the potential
impacts, it is crucial to design quantum algorithms that utilize the
computation power of the quantum computing devices. Here we present a quantum
kernel function expansion (QKFE) algorithm for solving thermodynamic properties
of quantum many-body systems. In this quantum algorithm, the many-body density
of states is approximated by a kernel-Fourier expansion, whose expansion
moments are obtained by random state sampling and quantum interferometric
measurements. As compared to its classical counterpart, namely the kernel
polynomial method (KPM), QKFE has an exponential advantage in the cost of both
time and memory. In computing low temperature properties, QKFE becomes
inefficient, as similar to classical KPM. To resolve this difficulty, we
further construct a thermal ensemble and approaches the low temperature regime
step-by-step. For quantum Hamiltonians, whose ground states are preparable with
polynomial quantum circuits, THEI has an overall polynomial complexity. We
demonstrate its efficiency with applications to one and two-dimensional quantum
spin models, and a fermionic lattice. With our analysis on the realization with
digital and analogue quantum devices, we expect the quantum algorithm is
accessible to current quantum technology.

in reinforcement learning via regret bounds for a multi-agent setting.
Considering a number of $\aleph$ agents operating in the same Markov decision
process, however possibly with different reward functions, we consider the
regret each agent suffers with respect to an optimal policy maximizing her
average reward. We show that when the agents share their observations the total
regret of all agents is smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{\aleph}$ compared to the

a continuous space, are used in a broad range of Graph ML applications. The
quality of such embeddings crucially depends on whether the geometry of the

many types of real-world graphs, where hierarchical structure and a power-law
degree distribution are linked to negative curvature. In this regard, it has
recently been shown that hyperbolic spaces and more general manifolds, such as
products of constant-curvature spaces and matrix manifolds, are advantageous to
approximately match nodes pairwise distances. However, all these classes of
manifolds are homogeneous, implying that the curvature distribution is the same
at each point, making them unsuited to match the local curvature (and related
structural properties) of the graph. In this paper, we study graph embeddings
in a broader class of heterogeneous rotationally-symmetric manifolds. By adding
a single extra radial dimension to any given existing homogeneous model, we can
both account for heterogeneous curvature distributions on graphs and pairwise

exhibit strong Lyman-alpha emission despite being situated at redshifts where
the IGM is thought to be substantially neutral. It has been argued that this
enhanced Ly$\alpha$ transmission reflects the presence of massive galaxies in
overdense regions which power large ionized bubbles. An alternative explanation
is that massive galaxies shift more of their Ly$\alpha$ profile to large
velocities (relative to the systemic redshift) where the IGM damping wing
absorption is reduced. Such a mass-dependent trend is seen at lower redshifts,
but whether one exists at $z\sim7$ remains unclear owing to the small number of
existing systemic redshift measurements in the reionization era. This is now
changing with the emergence of [CII]-based redshifts from ALMA. Here we report
MMT/Binospec Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy of eight UV-bright
($\mathrm{M_{UV}}^{}\sim-22$) galaxies at $z\simeq7$ selected from the ALMA
REBELS survey. We detect Ly$\alpha$ in 4 of 8 galaxies and use the [CII]
systemic redshifts to investigate the Ly$\alpha$ velocity profiles. The
Ly$\alpha$ lines are significantly redshifted from systemic (average velocity
offset=223 km/s) and broad (FWHM$\approx$300$-$650 km/s), with two sources
showing emission extending to $\approx$750 km/s. We find that the broadest
Ly$\alpha$ profiles are associated with the largest [CII] line widths,
suggesting a potential link between the Ly$\alpha$ FWHM and the dynamical mass.
Since Ly$\alpha$ photons at high velocities transmit efficiently through the
$z=7$ IGM, our data suggest that velocity profiles play a significant role in
boosting the Ly$\alpha$ visibility of the most UV-luminous reionization-era
galaxies.

cosmological $\Lambda$CDM simulations known as Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and
EAGLE, we calculate the intrinsic and sky-projected aspect ratio distribution
of the stars in subhalos with stellar mass $M_* > 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at redshift
$z=0$. There is a significant deficit of intrinsically thin disk galaxies,
which however comprise most of the locally observed galaxy population.
Consequently, the sky-projected aspect ratio distribution produced by these
$\Lambda$CDM simulations disagrees with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA)
survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $\geq 12.52\sigma$ (TNG50-1) and $\geq
14.82\sigma$ (EAGLE50) confidence. The deficit of intrinsically thin galaxies
could be due to a much less hierarchical merger-driven build-up of observed
galaxies than is given by the $\Lambda$CDM framework. It might also arise from
the implemented sub-grid models, or from the limited resolution of the
above-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. We estimate that an $8^5$ times
better mass resolution realization than TNG50-1 would reduce the tension with
GAMA to the $5.58\sigma$ level. Finally, we show that galaxies with fewer major
mergers have a somewhat thinner aspect ratio distribution. Given also the high
expected frequency of minor mergers in $\Lambda$CDM, the problem may be due to
minor mergers. In this case, the angular momentum problem could be alleviated
in Milgromian dynamics (MOND) because of a reduced merger frequency arising
from the absence of dynamical friction between extended dark matter halos.

there is a single Lorentz-invariant vacuum in which all fields have zero
expectation value and in many cosmologically relevant models this is not the
case. We explore ways to overcome this limitation by investigating a simple
example model, the covariant Galileon, which possesses a one-parameter family
of Lorentz-invariant vacua as well as multiple boost-breaking vacua. Each of
these vacua has a corresponding set of positivity bounds, and we show how a
particular (beyond-the-forward-limit) bound can be used to map out the
parameter space according to which vacua may persist in the UV theory, finding
that in general there are regions in which none, one or many of the effective
field theory vacua can be consistent with unitarity, causality and locality in
the UV. Finally, we discuss the interplay between this map and cosmological
observations. We find that the observationally favoured region of parameter
space is incompatible with a large class of vacua, and conversely that
particular boost-breaking vacua would imply positivity bounds that rule out
otherwise observationally favoured cosmologies. We also identify a specific
boost-breaking vacuum which is `closest' to the cosmological background, and
show that the particular positivity bound we consider reduces the otherwise
cosmologically favoured region of Galileon parameter space by up to $70 \%$,
ruling out the vast majority of cosmologies with a positive coefficient for the
cubic Galileon in the process.

of galaxies in the Universe. However, the dust temperature $T_d$ remains mostly
unconstrained due to the few available FIR continuum data at redshift $z>5$.
This introduces large uncertainties in several properties of high-$z$ galaxies,
namely their dust masses, infrared luminosities, and obscured fraction of star
formation. Using a new method based on simultaneous [CII] 158$\mu$m line and
underlying dust continuum measurements, we derive $T_ d$ in the continuum and
[CII] detected $z\approx 7$ galaxies in the ALMA Large Project REBELS sample.
We find $39\ \mathrm{K} < T_d < 58\ \mathrm{K}$, and dust masses in the narrow
range $M_d = (0.9-3.6)\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$. These results allow us to extend
for the first time the reported $T_d(z)$ relation into the Epoch of
Reionization. We produce a new physical model that explains the increasing $T_
d(z)$ trend with the decrease of gas depletion time,
$t_{dep}=M_g/\mathrm{SFR}$, induced by the higher cosmological accretion rate
at early times; this hypothesis yields $T_d \propto (1+z)^{0.4}$. The model
also explains the observed $T_d$ scatter at a fixed redshift. We find that dust
is warmer in obscured sources, as a larger obscuration results in more
efficient dust heating. For UV-transparent (obscured) galaxies, $T_d$ only
depends on the gas column density (metallicity), $T_d \propto N_H^{1/6}$ ($T_d
\propto Z^{-1/6}$). REBELS galaxies are on average relatively transparent, with
effective gas column densities around $N_H \simeq (0.03-1)\times 10^{21}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. We predict that other high-$z$ galaxies (e.g. MACS0416-Y1,
A2744-YD4), with estimated $T_d \gg 60$ K, are significantly obscured,
low-metallicity systems. In fact $T_d$ is higher in metal-poor systems due to
their smaller dust content, which for fixed $L_{ IR}$ results in warmer
temperatures.

not clear if the atmospheric heating mechanisms of the Sun and active sun-like

systematic survey of the responses of solar and stellar atmospheres to surface
magnetic flux over a wide range of temperatures. By analyzing 10 years of
multi-wavelength synoptic observations of the Sun, we reveal that the
irradiance and magnetic flux show power-law relations with an exponent
decreasing from above- to sub-unity as the temperature decreases from the
corona to the chromosphere. Moreover, this trend indicating the efficiency of
atmospheric heating can be extended to sun-like stars. We also discover that
the power-law exponent has a solar cycle dependence, where it becomes smallest
at activity maximum, probably due to the saturation of atmospheric heating. Our
study provides observational evidence that the mechanism of atmospheric heating
is universal among the Sun and sun-like stars, regardless of age or activity.

provide interfaces to X-ray data products or information (such as radial

theories can be derived from supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD with perturbation of
anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB). Nevertheless, despite the fact that AMSB
needs to be a small (but still exact) perturbation, there are two other major
problems remaining unsolved: first, in order to derive the chiral symmetry
breaking pattern, one needs to minimize the potential along a certain specific
direction, identifying this direction fully as an outcome is nontrivial given
the moduli space of degenerate vacua in the SUSY limit; second, when SUSY is
broken, non-holomorphic states might emerge and be relevant for determining the
vacuum structure. In this work, we focus on SUSY QCD with $N_f\leq N_c+1$ and
perturb the theories using AMSB. Without minimizing the potential along a
certain specific direction in the moduli space, we successfully derive the
expected chiral symmetry breaking pattern when $N_f<N_c$. However, when
$N_f=N_c$ and $N_f=N_c+1$, we show that tree-level AMSB would induce runaway
directions, along which baryon number is spontaneously broken, and the vacua
with broken baryon number can be deeper while the field values are not far from
the origin. This implies that phase transitions and/or non-holomorphic physics
are necessary. Moreover, we perform explicit consistency checks on ultraviolet
insensitivity for different $N_f$ by adding the holomorphic mass term for the
last flavor, we find that the jump of AMSB potential indeed matches the
contribution from the holomorphic mass term. We also show in general that, when
tree-level AMSB is not vanishing, the origin of the moduli space in s-confining
theories does not persist as a minimum.

the planet candidate. Ground-based photometric observations, combined with

an actual period of $18.85019 \pm 0.00014$ d. A joint analysis of all available

without planetary gaps, varying the initial conditions of the key parameters.
We calculate the disk continuum emission and the effective radius for all
models as a function of time. By selecting those simulations that continuously
follow the SLR, we can derive constraints on the input parameters of the
models. We confirm previous results that models of smooth disks in the radial
drift regime are compatible with the observed SLR ($L_{mm}\propto r_{eff}^{2}$)
but only smooth disks cannot be the reality. We show that the SLR is more
widely populated if planets are present. However they tend to follow a
different relation than smooth disks, potentially implying that a mixture of
smooth and sub-structured disks are present in the observed sample. We derive a
SLR ($L_{mm}\propto r_{eff}^{5/4}$) for disks with strong sub-structure. To be
compatible with the SLR, models need to have an initially high disk mass ($\geq
2.5 \cdot 10^{-2}M_{\star}$) and low turbulence-parameter $\alpha$ values
($\leq 10^{-3}$). Furthermore, we find that the grain composition and porosity
drastically affects the evolution of disks on the size-luminosity diagram where
relatively compact grains that include amorphous carbon are favoured. Moreover,
a uniformly optically thick disk with high albedo ($0.9$) that follows the SLR
cannot be formed from an evolutionary procedure.

between redshift 0.78 and 1.43 made with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Radio observations acquired over 102 nights are
used to construct maps which are foreground filtered and stacked on the angular
and spectral locations of luminous red galaxies (LRG), emission line galaxies
(ELG), and quasars (QSO) from the eBOSS clustering catalogs. We find decisive
evidence for a detection when stacking on all three tracers of LSS, with the
logarithm of the Bayes Factor equal to 18.9 (LRG), 10.8 (ELG), and 56.3 (QSO).
An alternative frequentist interpretation, based on the likelihood-ratio test,
yields a detection significance of $7.1\sigma$ (LRG), $5.7\sigma$ (ELG), and
$11.1\sigma$ (QSO). These are the first 21-cm intensity mapping measurements
made with an interferometer. We constrain the effective clustering amplitude of
neutral hydrogen (HI), defined as $\mathcal{A}_{\rm HI}\equiv
10^{3}\,\Omega_\mathrm{HI}\left(b_\mathrm{HI}+\langle\,f\mu^{2}\rangle\right)$,
where $\Omega_\mathrm{HI}$ is the cosmic abundance of HI, $b_\mathrm{HI}$ is
the linear bias of HI, and $\langle\,f\mu^{2}\rangle=0.552$ encodes the effect
of redshift-space distortions at linear order. We find
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=1.51^{+3.60}_{-0.97}$ for LRGs $(z=0.84)$,
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=6.76^{+9.04}_{-3.79}$ for ELGs $(z=0.96)$, and
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=1.68^{+1.10}_{-0.67}$ for QSOs $(z=1.20)$, with
constraints limited by modeling uncertainties at nonlinear scales. We are also
sensitive to bias in the spectroscopic redshifts of each tracer, and find a
non-zero bias $\Delta\,v= -66 \pm 20 \mathrm{km/s}$ for the QSOs. We split the
QSO catalog into three redshift bins and have a decisive detection in each,
with the upper bin at $z=1.30$ producing the highest redshift 21-cm intensity

models (c.f., deep learning). In this paper, we study an underexplored hidden
cost of overparameterization: the fact that overparameterized models may be
more vulnerable to privacy attacks, in particular the membership inference
attack that predicts the (potentially sensitive) examples used to train a
model. We significantly extend the relatively few empirical results on this
problem by theoretically proving for an overparameterized linear regression
model in the Gaussian data setting that membership inference vulnerability
increases with the number of parameters. Moreover, a range of empirical studies
indicates that more complex, nonlinear models exhibit the same behavior.
Finally, we extend our analysis towards ridge-regularized linear regression and
show in the Gaussian data setting that increased regularization also increases
membership inference vulnerability in the overparameterized regime.

They increase significantly the outflow mass loading factor in all our galaxies

coefficient, exploring values from $\kappa = 10^{27}$ to $\rm 3\times 10^{29}\,

higher diffusion coefficient reduces the effect on star formation and increases
the generation of cold outflows. Finally, we compare CR feedback to a
calibrated 'strong' supernova feedback model known to sufficiently regulate
star formation in high-redshift cosmological simulations. We find that CR

sub-collection $A\subseteq \mathcal{S}$ of maximum total weight. For $k\leq 2$,
the weighted $k$-Set Packing problem can be solved in polynomial time, but for

asymptotically best possible in that no algorithm considering local

of the weight function can yield an approximation guarantee better than
$\frac{k}{2}$.
  In this paper, we finally show how to beat the threshold of $\frac{k}{2}$ for

combining local search with the application of a black box algorithm for the

two-photon absorption (TPA) of broadband, spectrally multi-mode squeezed
vacuum, including low-gain (isolated entangled photon pairs or EPP) and
high-gain (bright squeezed vacuum or BSV) regimes. The results are relevant to
the potential use of entangled-light TPA as a spectroscopic and imaging method.
We treat the scenario that the exciting light is spatially single-mode and is
non-resonant with all intermediate molecular states. In the case of high gain,
we find that in the case that the linewidth of the final molecular state is
much narrower than the bandwidth of the exciting light, bright squeezed vacuum
is found to be equally (but no more) effective in driving TPA as is a
quasi-monochromatic coherent-state (classical) pulse of the same temporal
shape, duration and mean photon number. Therefore, in this case the sought-for
advantage of observing TPA at extremely low optical flux is not provided by
broadband bright squeezed vacuum. In the opposite case that the final-state
linewidth is much broader than the bandwidth of the BSV exciting light, we show
that the TPA rate is proportional to the second-order intensity autocorrelation
function at zero time delay g^(2)(0), as expected. We derive and evaluate
formulas describing the transition between these two limiting cases, that is,
including the regime where the molecular linewidth and optical bandwidth are
comparable, as is often the case in experimental studies. We also show that for
g^(2)(0) to reach the idealized form g^(2)(0) = 3 + 1/n, with n being the mean
number of photons per temporal mode, it is required to compensate the

confidence sequence for the population mean, under the minimal assumption that
only an upper bound $\sigma^2$ on the variance is known. While previous works
rely on light-tail assumptions like boundedness or subGaussianity (under which
all moments of a distribution exist), the confidence sequences in our work are
able to handle data from a wide range of heavy-tailed distributions. The best
among our three methods -- the Catoni-style confidence sequence -- performs
remarkably well in practice, essentially matching the state-of-the-art methods
for $\sigma^2$-subGaussian data, and provably attains the $\sqrt{\log \log

important implications for sequential experimentation with unbounded
observations, since the $\sigma^2$-bounded-variance assumption is more
realistic and easier to verify than $\sigma^2$-subGaussianity (which implies
the former). We also extend our methods to data with infinite variance, but

with time, influenced by the change in solar activity on different time scales,
ranging up to $\sim 11$ years for a solar cycle. The solar wind contribution
depends strongly on the angle between the pulsar line of sight and the solar

to mitigate these effects do exist, they do not account for all the effects of
the solar wind and its temporal changes. Since low-frequency pulsar

applications where solution evaluations are computationally costly. A common
approach to speed up QD algorithms is to evaluate solutions in parallel, for

limited to several dozen of parallel evaluations as most physics simulators can
only be parallelized more with a greater number of CPUs. With recent advances
in simulators that run on accelerators, thousands of evaluations can now be

interactive timescales without any significant effect on the performance.
Results across standard optimization functions and four neuroevolution
benchmark environments shows that experiment runtimes are reduced by two
factors of magnitudes, turning days of computation into minutes. More
surprising, we observe that reducing the number of generations by two orders of
magnitude, and thus having significantly shorter lineage does not impact the
performance of QD algorithms. These results show that QD can now benefit from
hardware acceleration, which contributed significantly to the bloom of deep
learning.

TOI-1759 b, using photometric time-series from TESS and near infrared
spectropolarimetric data from SPIRou on the CFHT. TOI-1759 b orbits a
moderately active M0V star with an orbital period of $18.849975\pm0.000006$ d,
and we measure a planetary radius and mass of $3.06\pm0.22$ R$_\oplus$ and
$6.8\pm2.0$ M$_\oplus$. Radial velocities were extracted from the SPIRou
spectra using both the CCF and the LBL methods, optimizing the velocity
measurements in the near infrared domain. We analyzed the broadband SED of the
star and the high-resolution SPIRou spectra to constrain the stellar parameters
and thus improve the accuracy of the derived planet parameters. A LSD analysis
of the SPIRou Stokes $V$ polarized spectra detects Zeeman signatures in
TOI-1759. We model the rotational modulation of the magnetic stellar activity
using a GP regression with a quasi-periodic covariance function, and find a
rotation period of $35.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ d. We reconstruct the large-scale
surface magnetic field of the star using ZDI, which gives a predominantly
poloidal field with a mean strength of $18\pm4$ G. Finally, we perform a joint
Bayesian MCMC analysis of the TESS photometry and SPIRou RVs to optimally
constrain the system parameters. At $0.1176\pm0.0013$ au from the star, the
planet receives $6.4$ times the bolometric flux incident on Earth, and its
equilibrium temperature is estimated at $433\pm14$ K. TOI-1759 b is a likely
gas-dominated sub-Neptune with an expected high rate of photoevaporation.
Therefore, it is an interesting target to search for neutral hydrogen escape,
which may provide important constraints on the planetary formation mechanisms
responsible for the observed sub-Neptune radius desert.

this approach, panoptic segmentation is leveraged to produce instance segmented
semantic masks from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images. This effort
represents the first deep learning based automated process for segmenting
unique yarn instances in a woven composite textile. Furthermore, it improves on
existing methods by providing instance-level segmentation on low contrast CT
datasets. Frame-to-frame instance tracking is accomplished via an
intersection-over-union (IoU) approach adopted from video panoptic segmentation
for assembling a 3D geometric model. A corrective recognition algorithm is
developed to improve the recognition quality (RQ). The panoptic quality (PQ)

capturing yarn flow directions, contact regions between individual yarns, and
the spatially varying cross-sectional areas of the yarns.

relatively easier to obtain high-quality representations. We observe that tasks
with lower-quality features fail to meet the anchor-point or clusterability

algorithm for solving expanded Linear Programming relaxations of mixed integer

column generated during pricing to a small directed acyclic graph for which any
path from source to sink describes a feasible column. This structure is easily
satisfied for vehicle routing, crew scheduling and various logistics problems
where pricing is a constrained shortest path problem. The construction of such
graphs trades off the size/diversity of a subset of columns modeled by the
graphs versus the additional computational time required to solve the problems
induced by larger graphs.
  Graph Generation (GG) has two computational bottlenecks. The first is
pricing. Pricing in GG and Column Generation (CG) is identical because of the
structure of the problems solved. The second bottleneck is the restricted
master problem (RMP), which is more computationally intensive in GG than in CG
given the same number of columns generated. By design GG converges in fewer
iterations than CG, and hence requires fewer calls to pricing. Therefore, when
the computation time of GG is dominated by pricing, as opposed to solving the
RMP, GG converges much faster than CG in terms of time. However GG need not
converge faster than CG when the GG RMP, rather than pricing, dominates
computation.
  In this paper we introduce Principled Graph Management (PGM), which is an
algorithm to solve the GG RMP rapidly by exploiting its special structure. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PGM inside a GG solution to the classical
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. We demonstrate that PGM solves the GG RMP

speed increases with problem size.

work on this problem due to Luyo et al. (2021) achieves a regret rate that has
a dependence of $O(K^{3/5})$ on the number of episodes $K$. We provide a
private algorithm with an improved regret rate with an optimal dependence of
$O(\sqrt{K})$ on the number of episodes. The key recipe for our stronger regret
guarantee is the adaptivity in the policy update schedule, in which an update
only occurs when sufficient changes in the data are detected. As a result, our
algorithm benefits from low switching cost and only performs $O(\log(K))$
updates, which greatly reduces the amount of privacy noise. Finally, in the
most prevalent privacy regimes where the privacy parameter $\epsilon$ is a
constant, our algorithm incurs negligible privacy cost -- in comparison with
the existing non-private regret bounds, the additional regret due to privacy
appears in lower-order terms.

users to reduce the network's peak-time communication load. Coded caching
achieves significant performance gains compared to uncoded caching schemes and
is thus a promising technique to boost performance in future networks. In the
original model introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), a server stores
multiple files and is connected to multiple cache-aided users through an
error-free shared link; once the local caches have been filled and all users
have sent their demand to the server, the server can start sending coded
multicast messages to satisfy all users' demands. A practical limitation of the
original MAN model is that it halts if the server does not receive all users'
demands, which is the limiting case of asynchronous coded caching when the
requests of some users arrive with infinite delay. In this paper we formally
define a coded caching system where some users are offline. We propose
achievable and converse bounds for this novel setting and show under which
conditions they meet, thus providing an optimal solution, and when they are to
within a constant multiplicative gap of two. Interestingly, when optimality can
be be shown, the optimal load-memory tradeoff only depends on the number active
users, and not on the total (active plus offline) number of users.

oscillate. Next, a nonlinear phase occurs. In this phase, the amplitude of the
electric field experiences strong damping because the field dramatically
changes the momenta of newly created pairs. This strong damping ceases, and the
system enters a final linear phase, when the electric field can no longer
dramatically change pair momenta. Applied to pulsars, this theory may explain
several aspects of radio emission, including the observed luminosity,

decade, leaving only those who have massive datacenter-based resources with the
ability to develop and train such models. One of the main challenges for the
long tail of researchers who might have only limited resources (e.g., a single

problem is so acute that the memory requirement of training massive DNN models
can often exceed the aggregate capacity of all available GPUs on a single

sizes. Current solutions that rely on virtualizing GPU memory (by swapping
to/from CPU memory) incur excessive swapping overhead. In this paper, we
present a new training framework, Harmony, and advocate rethinking how DNN
frameworks schedule computation and move data to push the boundaries of
training massive models efficiently on a single commodity server. Across
various massive DNN models, Harmony is able to reduce swap load by up to two
orders of magnitude and obtain a training throughput speedup of up to 7.6x over
highly optimized baselines with virtualized memory.

function (DF) of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. This DF exhibits
non-trivial features, in particular a superthermal distribution of

we must first understand how the binary DF is affected by dynamical
perturbations, which typically fall into two classes: (i) stochastic kicks from

Galactic tide. Here we isolate effect (ii) and calculate the time-asymptotic,
phase-mixed DF for an ensemble of wide binaries under quadrupole-order tides.
For binaries wide enough that the phase-mixing assumption is valid, none of our
results depend explicitly on semimajor axes, masses, etc. We show that unless
the initial DF is both isotropic in binary orientation and thermal in
eccentricity, then the final phase-mixed DF is always both anisotropic and
non-thermal. However, the only way to produce a superthermal DF under phase
mixing is for the initial DF to itself be superthermal.

established may have more elaborate formal policy systems. Alternatively, they
may require less formalization precisely because of their maturity. Indeed,
scholars often downplay the role that formal rules relative to unwritten rules,
norms, and values. But in a community with formal rules, decisions are more
consistent, transparent, and legitimate. To understand the relationship of
formal institutions to community maturity and governance style, we conduct a
large-scale quantitative analysis applying institutional analysis frameworks of
self-governance scholar Elinor Ostrom to 80,000 communities across 3 platforms:
the sandbox game Minecraft, the MMO game World of Warcraft, and Reddit. We
classify communities' written rules to test predictors of institutional
formalization. From this analysis we extract two major findings. First,
institutional formalization, the size and complexity of an online community's
governance system, is generally positively associated with maturity, as
measured by age, population size, or degree of user engagement. Second, we find
that online communities employ similar governance styles across platforms,
strongly favoring ""weak"" norms to ""strong"" requirements. These findings suggest
that designers and founders of online communities converge on styles of
governance practice that are correlated with successful self-governance. With
deeper insights into the patterns of successful self-governance, we can help

The equations retain finite orbit width effects by employing the second
adiabatic invariant $J$ as a velocity space coordinate and they have been
implemented in the orbit-averaged neoclassical code KNOSOS. The equations are
used to study the $1/\nu$ regime and the lower collisionality regimes. For
generic large aspect ratio stellarators with mirror ratios close to unity, as
the collision frequency decreases, the $1/\nu$ regime transitions directly into
the $\nu$ regime, without passing through a $\sqrt{\nu}$ regime. An explicit
formula for the neoclassical fluxes in the $\nu$ regime is obtained. The
formula includes the effect of particles that transition between different
types of wells. While these transitions produce stochastic scattering
independent of the value of the collision frequency in velocity space, the
diffusion in real space remains proportional to the collision frequency. The
$\sqrt{\nu}$ regime is only recovered in large aspect ratio stellarators close
to omnigeneity: large aspect ratio stellarators with large mirror ratios and
optimized large aspect ratio stellarators with mirror ratios close to unity.
Neoclassical transport in large aspect ratio stellarators with large mirror
ratios can be calculated with the orbit-averaged equations derived by
\cite{calvo17}. In these stellarators, the $\sqrt{\nu}$ regime exists in the
collisionality interval $\epsilon |\ln \epsilon| \ll \nu_{ii} R a/\rho_i v_{ti}

emission. With our novel Transverse Oscillating Bubble Enhanced Betatron
Radiation (TOBER) scheme, we show a significant increase in the number of
generated photons by specifically manipulating the amplitude of the betatron
oscillations. We realize this through an orchestrated evolution of the temporal
laser pulse shape and the accelerating plasma structure. This leads to
controlled off-axis injection of electrons that perform large-amplitude
collective transverse betatron oscillations, resulting in increased radiation
emission. Our concept holds the promise for a method to optimize the X-ray
parameters for specific applications, such as time-resolved investigations with
spatial and temporal atomic resolution or advanced high-resolution imaging
modalities, and the generation of X-ray beams with even higher peak and average
brightness.

  code smell detection)","Accepted to MSR 2022",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To reduce technical debt and make code more maintainable, it is important to
be able to warn programmers about code smells. State-of-the-art code small
detectors use deep learners, without much exploration of alternatives within
that technology.
  One promising alternative for software analytics and deep learning is GHOST
(from TSE'21) that relies on a combination of hyper-parameter optimization of
feedforward neural networks and a novel oversampling technique to deal with
class imbalance.
  The prior study from TSE'21 proposing this novel ""fuzzy sampling"" was
somewhat limited in that the method was tested on defect prediction, but
nothing else. Like defect prediction, code smell detection datasets have a
class imbalance (which motivated ""fuzzy sampling""). Hence, in this work we test
if fuzzy sampling is useful for code smell detection.
  The results of this paper show that we can achieve better than
state-of-the-art results on code smell detection with fuzzy oversampling. For
example, for ""feature envy"", we were able to achieve 99+\% AUC across all our
datasets, and on 8/10 datasets for ""misplaced class"". While our specific
results refer to code smell detection, they do suggest other lessons for other
kinds of analytics. For example: (a) try better preprocessing before trying
complex learners (b) include simpler learners as a baseline in software
analytics (c) try ""fuzzy sampling"" as one such baseline.

effectively. By utilizing the explicit stereo-based geometric constraints in
the stereo matching stage, PanoDepth can generate dense high-quality depth. We
conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate PanoDepth with

sets of detectors, at a given frequency of a CMB polarization experiment, is
presented. The uncertainties in the polarization angle of each detector set are
related to a given bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ parameter. The
approach is grounded in using a linear combination of the detector sets to
obtain the CMB polarization signal. In addition, assuming that the
uncertainties on the polarization angle are in the small angle limit (lower
than a few degrees), it is possible to derive analytic expressions to establish
the requirements. The methodology also accounts for possible correlations among
detectors, that may originate from the optics, wafers, etc. The approach is
applied to the LiteBIRD space mission. We show that, for the most restrictive
case (i.e., full correlation of the polarization angle systematics among
detector sets), the requirements on the polarization angle uncertainties are of
around 1 arcmin at the most sensitive frequency bands (i.e., $\approx 150$ GHz)
and of few tens of arcmin at the lowest (i.e., $\approx 40$ GHz) and highest
(i.e., $\approx 400$ GHz) observational bands. Conversely, for the least
restrictive case (i.e., no correlation of the polarization angle systematics
among detector sets), the requirements are $\approx 5$ times less restrictive
than for the previous scenario. At the global and the telescope levels,
polarization angle knowledge of a few arcmins is sufficient for correlated
global systematic errors and can be relaxed by a factor of two for fully
uncorrelated errors in detector polarization angle. The reported uncertainty
levels are needed in order to have the bias on $r$ due to systematics below the
limit established by the LiteBIRD collaboration.

to explore the patterns of uncertain food demand behavior and its significant
importance in inventory management and redistribution of surplus food thereby
developing a two-stage hybrid food demand estimation model. Data obtained from
a food bank network in Cleveland, Ohio, is used, and the clusters developed are
studied and visualized. The results reveal that this proposed framework can
make an in-depth identification of food accessibility and assistance patterns

adapts to user context opens a side-channel that leaks private information

malicious eavesdropper can monitor the actions taken by an IoT system and
extract users' private information. In particular, we show two concrete
instantiations (in the context of mobile phones and smart homes) of a new
category of spyware which we refer to as Context-Aware Adaptation Based Spyware
(SpyCon). Experimental evaluations show that the developed SpyCon can predict
users' daily behavior with an accuracy of 90.3%. The rest of this paper is
devoted to introducing VindiCo, a software mechanism designed to detect and
mitigate possible SpyCon. Being new spyware with no known prior signature or
behavior, traditional spyware detection that is based on code signature or app
behavior is not adequate to detect SpyCon. Therefore, VindiCo proposes a novel
information-based detection engine along with several mitigation techniques to
restrain the ability of the detected SpyCon to extract private information. By
having general detection and mitigation engines, VindiCo is agnostic to the
inference algorithm used by SpyCon. Our results show that VindiCo reduces the
ability of SpyCon to infer user context from 90.3% to the baseline accuracy
(accuracy based on random guesses) with negligible execution overhead.

the oxygen. The rate of the brain's oxygen utilization can be determined from
the knowledge of cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF).
Therefore, OEF is a key physiological parameter of the brain's function and
metabolism. OEF has been suggested to be a useful biomarker in a number of
brain diseases. With recent advances in MRI techniques, several MRI-based
methods have been developed to measure OEF in the human brain. These MRI OEF
techniques are based on T2 of blood, phase of blood signal, susceptibility of
blood-containing voxel, effect of deoxyhemoglobin on signal behavior in
extravascular tissue, and calibration of BOLD signal using gas-inhalation.
Compared to 15O positron emission tomography, which is considered the ""gold
standard"" for OEF measurement, MRI-based techniques are non-invasive,
radiation-free, and have broader availabilities. This article provides a review
of these emerging MRI-based OEF techniques. We first briefly introduce the role
of OEF in brain oxygen homeostasis. We then review the methodological aspects
of different categories of MRI OEF techniques, including their signal
mechanisms, acquisition methods, and data analyses. Advantages and limitations

emergence of life on Earth through their creation of favorable niches for life,
changes to the atmosphere and delivery of water. Consequently, we suggest two
potential requirements for life in an exoplanetary system: first, that the
system has an asteroid belt, and second, that there is a mechanism to drive
asteroids to impact the terrestrial habitable planet. Since in the solar
system, the $\nu_6$ secular resonance has been shown to have been important in
driving these impacts, we explore how the masses and locations of two giant
planets determine the location and strength of this secular resonance.
Examining observed exoplanetary systems with two giant planets, we find that a
secular resonance within the asteroid belt region may not be uncommon. Hence
the solar system is somewhat special, but the degree of fine-tuning that may be
necessary for the emergence of life is not excessive. Finally, with $n$-body
simulations, we show that when the two giant planets are close to the 2:1 mean
motion resonance, the asteroid belt is unstable but this does not lead to
increased asteroid delivery.

into consideration nucleation and condensation, which have not been considered

generate simulated thermal emission and geometric albedo spectra and find
large, wavelength-dependent differences between the CARMA and Virga models,
with different gas absorption bands reacting differently to the different cloud

that directly predicts the coordinates of atoms: (1) the loss function is
invariant to roto-translation of coordinates and permutation of symmetric
atoms; (2) the newly proposed model adaptively aggregates the bond and atom
information and iteratively refines the coordinates of the generated
conformation. Our method achieves the best results on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs

pursue different perspectives of service quality. On the other hand, with the
explosive growth of information in the era of big data, a lot of private

the breadth first strategy (BFS) is used to map the virtual links. In the

Researchers found that agents' lack of environmental knowledge, the difficulty

address these challenges, researchers have suggested assisting agents with
computer vision technologies, especially 3D reconstruction. This paper presents
a high-fidelity prototype of such an RSA, where agents use interactive 3D maps

EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has recently been theoretically recognized as a long awaited

study on transport properties arising from the topological states in this
material is scarce. In this paper, we perform the detailed magnetoresistance
(MR) and Hall measurements to study the magnetotransport properties of this
material. We find that the transport is strongly influenced by the spin
configuration of the Eu moments from the concomitant change in the field
dependence of the MR and that of the magnetization below the N\'eel
temperature. Most importantly, an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and a large
topological Hall effect (THE) are observed. We suggest that the AHE is
originated from a nonvanishing net Berry curvature due to the helical spin
structure and that the THE is attributed to the formation of a noncoplanar spin
texture with a finite scalar spin chirality induced by the external magnetic
field in EuIn$_2$As$_2$. Our studies provide a platform to understand the
influence of the interplay between the topology of electronic bands and the
field-induced magnetic structure on magnetoelectric transport properties. In

puzzle by identifying a class of ""sub-threshold"" observables that we claim do
not show effects of ensemble averaging. These are amplitudes that do not
involve black hole states. To support our claim, we explore the example of
$D=3$, and show that connected solutions of Einstein's equations with

demonstrate this requires some novel results about the renormalized volume of a

security problems. The integration of ICPSs and network virtualization (NV) can
provide more efficient network resource support and security guarantees for IoT
users. Based on the above two problems faced by ICPSs, we propose a virtual
network embedded (VNE) algorithm with computing, storage resources and security
constraints to ensure the rationality and security of resource allocation in
ICPSs. In particular, we use reinforcement learning (RL) method as a means to
improve algorithm performance. We extract the important attribute
characteristics of underlying network as the training environment of RL agent.
Agent can derive the optimal node embedding strategy through training, so as to
meet the requirements of ICPSs for resource management and security. The
embedding of virtual links is based on the breadth first search (BFS) strategy.
Therefore, this is a comprehensive two-stage RL-VNE algorithm considering the
constraints of computing, storage and security three-dimensional resources.
Finally, we design a large number of simulation experiments from the
perspective of typical indicators of VNE algorithms. The experimental results
effectively illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in the application of
ICPSs.

learning approaches that rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown
success in learning mechanics, the performance of GNNs has yet to be
investigated on a myriad of solid mechanics problems. In this work, we examine
the ability of GNNs to predict a fundamental aspect of mechanically driven
emergent behavior: the connection between a column's geometric structure and
the direction that it buckles. To accomplish this, we introduce the Asymmetric
Buckling Columns (ABC) dataset, a dataset comprised of three sub-datasets of
asymmetric and heterogeneous column geometries where the goal is to classify
the direction of symmetry breaking (left or right) under compression after the
onset of instability. Because of complex local geometry, the ""image-like"" data
representations required for implementing standard convolutional neural network
based metamodels are not ideal, thus motivating the use of GNNs. In addition to
investigating GNN model architecture, we study the effect of different input
data representation approaches, data augmentation, and combining multiple
models as an ensemble. While we were able to obtain good results, we also
showed that predicting solid mechanics based emergent behavior is non-trivial.
Because both our model implementation and dataset are distributed under
open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can build on our work to
create enhanced mechanics-specific machine learning pipelines for capturing the
behavior of complex geometric structures.

We find that all of the simulations are in the quasi-geostrophic regime in

$\widetilde{Rm} \lesssim O(1)$. The magnitude of the large scale magnetic field
is observed to saturate and become approximately constant with increasing
Rayleigh number. Energy spectra show that all length scales present in the flow
field and the small-scale magnetic field are consistent with a scaling of
$E^{1/3}$, even in the turbulent regime. For a fixed value of $E$, we find that
the viscous dissipation length scale is approximately constant over a broad
range of $Ra$; the ohmic dissipation length scale is approximately constant
within the large scale dynamo regime, but transitions to a
$\widetilde{Rm}^{-1/2}$ scaling in the small scale dynamo regime.

allow a deliberative planner to reason purely in terms of those contracts and
synthesize a plan by choosing a sequence of reactive behaviors and their target

reduces both the search depth at which plans will be found, and the number of

to a ""self-consistency problem"". Traditional iterative methods heavily rely on
high-quality initial guesses of $V$ generated via domain-specific heuristics

during its outburst. After the discovery on 2021 May 1, the soft X-ray flux
below 10 keV rapidly increased for $\sim 10$ days and then have been gradually
decreasing over 5 months. At the brightest phase, the source exhibited the
state transition from the low/hard state to the high/soft state via the
intermediate state. The broad-band X-ray spectrum during the outburst was well
described with a disk blackbody plus its thermal or non-thermal Comptonization.
Before the transition the source spectrum was described by a thermal
Comptonization component with a photon index of $\sim 1.7$ and an electron
temperature of $\sim 30$ keV, whereas a strong disk blackbody component was
observed after the transition. The spectral properties in these periods are
consistent with the low/hard state and the high/soft state, respectively. A
sudden flux drop with a few days duration, unassociated with a significant
change in the hardness ratio, was found in the intermediate state. A possible
cause of this variation is that the mass accretion rate rapidly increased at
the disk transition, which induced a strong Compton-thick outflow and scattered
out the X-ray flux. Assuming a non-spinning black hole, we estimated a black
hole mass of MAXI J1803$-$298 as $5.8 \pm 0.4~(\cos i/\cos 70^\circ)^{-1/2}
(D/8~\mathrm{kpc})~M_\odot$ (where $i$ and $D$ are the inclination angle and
the distance) from the inner disk radius obtained in the high/soft state.

models while interactively selecting only small subsets of unlabelled data for
labelling and training. In ""open world"" settings, the classes of interest can
make up a small fraction of the overall dataset -- most of the data may be
viewed as an out-of-distribution or irrelevant class. This leads to extreme
class-imbalance, and our theory and methods focus on this core issue. We
propose a new strategy for active learning called GALAXY (Graph-based Active
Learning At the eXtrEme), which blends ideas from graph-based active learning
and deep learning. GALAXY automatically and adaptively selects more
class-balanced examples for labeling than most other methods for active
learning. Our theory shows that GALAXY performs a refined form of uncertainty
sampling that gathers a much more class-balanced dataset than vanilla
uncertainty sampling. Experimentally, we demonstrate GALAXY's superiority over
existing state-of-art deep active learning algorithms in unbalanced vision

general relativity. We find that ignoring background metric perturbations due
to the oscillating fluid, as in the Cowling approximation, underestimates the
g-mode frequency by up to 10% for higher mass stars, depending on the
parameters of the nuclear equation of state and how the mixed phase is
constructed. The g-mode frequencies are well-described by a linear scaling with
the central lepton (or combined lepton and quark) fraction for nucleonic
(hybrid) stars. Our findings suggest that neutron stars with and without quarks
are manifestly different with regards to their quasi-normal g-mode spectrum,

prototypes presents significant scalability challenges due to the massive costs
of generating/routing the analog control signals that need to be sent from a
classical controller at room temperature to the quantum chip inside the
dilution refrigerator. Thus, researchers in industry and academia have focused
on designing in-fridge classical controllers in order to mitigate these
challenges. Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) is a classical logic
family proposed for large-scale in-fridge controllers. SFQ logic has the
potential to maximize scalability thanks to its ultra-high speed and very low
power consumption. However, architecture design for SFQ logic poses challenges
due to its unconventional pulse-driven nature and lack of dense memory and
logic. Thus, research at the architecture level is essential to guide
architects to design SFQ-based classical controllers for large-scale quantum
machines.
  In this paper, we present DigiQ, the first system-level design of a Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)-friendly SFQ-based classical controller. We
perform a design space exploration of SFQ-based controllers and co-design the
quantum gate decompositions and SFQ-based implementation of those
decompositions to find an optimal SFQ-friendly design point that trades area
and power for latency and control while ensuring good quantum algorithmic
performance. Our co-design results in a single instruction, multiple data
(SIMD) controller architecture, which has high scalability (>42,000-qubit
scales), but imposes new challenges on the calibration of control pulses. We
present software-level solutions to address these challenges, which if
unaddressed would degrade quantum circuit fidelity given the imperfections of
qubit hardware.

  In this paper, we present the first thorough analysis of SFQ-based two-qubit

leakage to qubit non-computational subspace, which presents severe design
challenges. We show that despite these challenges, we can realize gates with
high fidelity by carefully designing optimal control methods and qubit
architectures. We develop optimal control methods that suppress leakage, and
also investigate various qubit architectures that reduce the leakage. After
carefully engineering our SFQ-friendly quantum system, we show that it can
achieve similar gate fidelity and gate time to microwave-based quantum systems.
The promising results of this paper show that (1) SFQ-based universal quantum

field application, especially those that in confined spaces. While important,
reorientation remains a relatively unstudied problem for robots, including
limbless mechanisms, often called snake robots. Instead of looking at snakes,
we take inspiration from observations of the turning behavior of tiny nematode
worms C. elegans. Our previous work presented an in-place and in-plane turning
gait for limbless robots, called an omega turn, and prescribed it using a novel
two-wave template. In this work, we advance omega turn-inspired controllers in
three aspects: 1) we use geometric methods to vary joint angle amplitudes and
forward wave spatial frequency in our turning equation to establish a wide and
precise amplitude modulation and frequency modulation on omega turn; 2) we use
this new relationship to enable robots with fewer internal degrees of freedom
(i.e., fewer joints in the body) to achieve desirable performance, and 3) we
apply compliant control methods to this relationship to handle unmodelled
effects in the environment. We experimentally validate our approach on a

that the diffuse gamma rays can be divided into two components from the

density and reveals a soft spectrum, while the other is associated with the HII
gas and presents a hard spectrum. Assuming the diffuse gamma-ray emissions are
mainly produced through the interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and the
ambient gas, these two components are produced by the CR populations with
spectral indices of 2.8 (""soft"") and 2.3 (""hard""), respectively. We argue that
the hard CR population may come from the vicinity of the CR accelerators. The
soft CR population has a similar spectral shape and density as measured in the

correlated diffusion of surfactants is described by a Poisson-Nernst-Planck
(PNP) system, in which the drift term is given by the gradient of a potential
which includes both the effect of the bubble and the Coulomb interaction
between the carriers. The latter term is obtained from the solution of a
self-consistent Poisson equation. For very short Debye lengths one can adopt
the so called Quasi-Neutral limit which drastically simplifies the system, thus
allowing for much faster numerical simulations. The paper has four main
objectives. The first one is to present a PNP model that describes ion charges
in presence of a trap. The second one is to provide benchmark tests for the
validation of simplified multiscale models under current development [1]. The
third one is to explore the relevance of the term describing the interaction
among the apolar tails of the anions. The last one is to quantitatively explore
the validity of the Quasi-Neutral limit by comparison with detailed numerical
simulation for smaller and smaller Debye lengths. In order to reach these
goals, we propose a simple and efficient Alternate Direction Implicit method
for the numerical solution of the non-linear PNP system, which guarantees
second order accuracy both in space and time, without requiring solution of
nonlinear equation at each time step. New semi-implicit scheme for a simplified
PNP system near quasi neutrality is also proposed.

can work with highly nonlinear and chaotic systems. The chosen system for this
study is a passively-actuated tilted Furuta pendulum, which is known to have a
highly non linear and coupled model. The pendulum is tilted to ensure the
existence of a stable equilibrium configuration for all its degrees of freedom,
and the link weights are the only external forces applied to the system. A
nonlinear analytical model of the pendulum is derived, and a continuous
friction model considering static friction, dynamic friction, viscous friction,
and the stribeck effect is selected from the literature. A high-gain Universal
Adaptive Stabilizer (UAS) observer is designed to identify friction model
parameters using joint angle measurements. The methodology is tested in
simulation and validated on an experimental setup. Despite the high
nonlinearity of the system, the methodology is proven to converge to the exact
parameter values, in simulation, and to yield qualitative parameter magnitudes
in experiments where the goodness of fit was around 85\% on average. The
discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is attributed
to the limitations of the friction model. The main advantage of the proposed
method is the significant reduction in computational needs and the time
required relative to conventional optimization-based identification routines.
The proposed approach yielded more than 99\% reduction in the estimation time
while being considerably more accurate than the optimization approach in every
test performed. One more advantage is that the approach can be easily adapted
to fit other models to experimental data.

has to deal with inherent data deficiencies of EHRs, namely missing values,

embedding. First, we use low-rank constrained sparse coding to identify and
calculate weight for similar patients, while denoising against missing values.
Then, graph embedding on sparse representations is adopted to measure the
similarity between patient pairs via preserving local relationships defined by
distances. Finally, a global cost function is constructed to optimize related

requirements for the quality of functional curves are proposed: a high order of

technical aesthetics. The authors do not set themselves the task of giving a
simple and precise mathematical definition of such curves. On the contrary,
this category can include various curves that meet certain quality criteria,
the refinement and addition of which is possible in the near future.

energy regime. A thin Keplerian and a slim accretion disk provide the best-fit
continuum for XMM-NEWTON spectra. All observations show a broad hump-like
feature around $\sim 0.9$ keV, which can be associated with a collection of
blended emission lines, and suggests the presence of a wind/outflow in this ULX
through comparison with other ULXs that show a similar feature. The flaring
spectra correspond to higher slim disk temperatures due to higher mass
accretion rate under an advection-dominated accretion scenario. The
luminosity-temperature (L-T) values in different flux states show a positive
trend. When characterized with a powerlaw relation, the L-T profile is broadly
consistent with both $L\propto T^2$ and $L\propto T^4$ relations for the
analysed data. The empirical predictions for a slim accretion disk in the case
of super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-mass compact object is $L \propto

ensembles of quantum emitters, producing light-matter hybrid states known as
polaritons. Under such conditions, the discrete multilevel spectrum of
molecular systems offers an appealing playground for exploring multiphoton
processes. This work contrasts predictions from the Tavis-Cummings (TC) model,
in which the material is a collection of two-level systems, with the
implications of considering additional energy levels with harmonic and
anharmonic structures. We discuss the exact eigenspectrum, up to the second
excitation manifold, of an arbitrary number $N$ of oscillators collectively
coupled to a single cavity mode in the rotating-wave approximation. Elaborating
on our group-theoretic approach [New J. Phys. 23, 063081 (2021)], we simplify
the brute-force diagonalization of a gigantic $N^2\times N^2$ Hamiltonian
(where $N=10^6-10^{10}$, as experiments suggest) to the diagonalization of, at
most, $4\times4$ matrices. We thoroughly discuss the eigenstates and the
consequences of weak and strong anharmonicities. Furthermore, we find resonant
conditions between bipolaritons and anharmonic transitions where two-photon
absorption can be enhanced. Finally, we conclude that energy shifts in the
polaritonic states induced by anharmonicities become negligible for large $N$.
Thus, calculations with a single or few emitters qualitatively fail to
represent the nonlinear optical response of the collective strong coupling
regime. Our work highlights the rich physics of multilevel anharmonic systems
coupled to cavities absent in standard models of quantum optics. We also
provide concise tabulated expressions for eigenfrequencies and transition
amplitudes, which should serve as a reference for future spectroscopic studies
of molecular polaritons.

to be true for $n=2,3,4$. Motivated by a recent preprint of Y. Martinez-Maure,
we give a short proof of his result: for dimension $n\geq 3$, under mild
conditions, almost every normal through a boundary point to a smooth convex
body $K\in \mathbb{R}^n$ contains an intersection point of at least $6$ normals
from different points on the boundary of $K$.

distinctive properties of low power consumption, biological plausibility, and
adversarial robustness. The most effective way to train deep SNNs is through
ANN-to-SNN conversion, which have yielded the best performance in deep network
structure and large-scale datasets. However, there is a trade-off between
accuracy and latency. In order to achieve high precision as original ANNs, a
long simulation time is needed to match the firing rate of a spiking neuron
with the activation value of an analog neuron, which impedes the practical
application of SNN. In this paper, we aim to achieve high-performance converted
SNNs with extremely low latency (fewer than 32 time-steps). We start by
theoretically analyzing ANN-to-SNN conversion and show that scaling the
thresholds does play a similar role as weight normalization. Instead of
introducing constraints that facilitate ANN-to-SNN conversion at the cost of
model capacity, we applied a more direct way by optimizing the initial membrane
potential to reduce the conversion loss in each layer. Besides, we demonstrate
that optimal initialization of membrane potentials can implement expected
error-free ANN-to-SNN conversion. We evaluate our algorithm on the CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, using
fewer time-steps. For example, we reach top-1 accuracy of 93.38\% on CIFAR-10
with 16 time-steps. Moreover, our method can be applied to other ANN-SNN
conversion methodologies and remarkably promote performance when the time-steps
is small.

of several kBT compared to equilibrium and near-equilibrium, slowly growing
chains. Interestingly, the extra free energy is a non-monotonic function of the
degree of polymerization and thus also of time. Our decomposition of the
thermodynamic contributions shows that the initial dominant extra free energy
is stored in the nonequilibrium inhomogeneous density profiles of the free
monomer gas (showing density depletion and wakes) in the vicinity of the active

exemplifies non-abelian topological charges. Here, we construct ideal acoustic
metamaterials to realize non-abelian braiding with the fewest band nodes. We

optimization procedures that aim to find the global solutions of an
optimization problem using, respectively, the least amount of function
evaluations or sample comparisons as possible. In the black-box case, the
analytical expression of the objective function is unknown and it can only be
evaluated through a (costly) computer simulation or an experiment. In the
preference-based case, the objective function is still unknown but it
corresponds to the subjective criterion of an individual. So, it is not
possible to quantify such criterion in a reliable and consistent way.
Therefore, preference-based optimization algorithms seek global solutions using
only comparisons between couples of different samples, for which a human
decision-maker indicates which of the two is preferred. Quite often, the
black-box and preference-based frameworks are covered separately and are
handled using different techniques. In this paper, we show that black-box and
preference-based optimization problems are closely related and can be solved

  Encoding","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trajectory forecasting is critical for autonomous platforms to make safe
planning and actions. Currently, most trajectory forecasting methods assume
that object trajectories have been extracted and directly develop trajectory
predictors based on the ground truth trajectories. However, this assumption
does not hold in practical situations. Trajectories obtained from object
detection and tracking are inevitably noisy, which could cause serious
forecasting errors to predictors built on ground truth trajectories. In this
paper, we propose a trajectory predictor directly based on detection results
without relying on explicitly formed trajectories. Different from the
traditional methods which encode the motion cue of an agent based on its
clearly defined trajectory, we extract the motion information only based on the
affinity cues among detection results, in which an affinity-aware state update
mechanism is designed to take the uncertainty of association into account. In
addition, considering that there could be multiple plausible matching
candidates, we aggregate the states of them. This design relaxes the
undesirable effect of noisy trajectory obtained from data association.
Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and its
generalization ability on different detectors. Cross-comparison to other
forecasting schemes further proves the superiority of our method. Code will be
released upon acceptance.

Carlo (MCMC) method. In addition to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for
the image, which can be obtained with conventional methods, the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimate and uncertainty maps can also be computed. The
data-driven Markov chains are constructed from the generative model learned
from a given image database and are independent of the forward operator that is
used to model the k-space measurement. This provides flexibility because the
method can be applied to k-space acquired with different sampling schemes or
receive coils using the same pre-trained models. Furthermore, we use a
framework based on a reverse diffusion process to be able to utilize advanced
generative models. The performance of the method is evaluated on an open

there are two kinds of mechanisms driving quantum phase transition (QPT) in
this model. One is the infrared (IR) geometry to be renormalization group (RG)
unstable, and the other is the strength of lattice deformation leading to some
kind of bifurcating solution. We also find a novel QPT in the metal phases. The
study on the behavior of the butterfly velocity crossing QPT indicates that the
butterfly velocity or its first derivative exhibiting local extreme depends on
the QPT mechanism. Further, the scaling behaviors of the butterfly velocity in
the zero-temperature limit confirm that different phases are controlled by
different IR geometries. Therefore, the butterfly velocity is a good probe to
QPT and it also provides a possible way to study QPT beyond holography.

Almost every step of users' is tracked, analyzed, and later used in different

circumvent standard tracking preventing techniques (i.e., the first party
performs the tracking in the name of the third party). We visit the top 15,000

planetary embryos for the sake simplicity. While this approach gives valuable
insights on the evolution of the initial embryos, the initial distribution
itself is a bold assumption. Limiting oneself to an initial distribution may
neglect essential physics that precedes, or follows said initial distribution.
We wish to investigate the effect of dynamic planetary embryo formation on the
formation of planetary systems. The presented framework begins with an initial
disk of gas, dust and pebbles. The disk evolution, the formation of
planetesimals and the formation of planetary embryos is modeled consistently.
Embryos then grow by pebble, planetesimal and eventually gas accretion. Planet
disk interactions and N-body dynamics with other simultaneously growing embryos
is included in the framework. We show that the formation of planets can occur
in multiple consecutive phases. Earlier generations grow massive by pebble
accretion but are subject to fast type I migration and thus accretion to the
star. The later generations of embryos that form grow to much smaller masses by
planetesimal accretion, as the amount of pebbles in the disk has vanished. The
formation history of planetary systems may be far more complex than an initial
distribution of embryos could reflect. The dynamic formation of planetary
embryos needs to be considered in global models of planet formation to allow
for a complete picture of the systems evolution.

best possible order of approximation by a finite point set in terms of the

However, if $\mu$ contains a discrete component no non-trivial lower bound
holds in general because it is straightforward to construct examples without
any approximation error in this case. This might explain, why the approximation
of discrete measures on $[0,1]$ by finite point sets has so far not been
completely covered in the existing literature. In this note, we close this gap
by giving a complete description of the discrete case. Most importantly, we
prove that for any discrete measure the best possible order of approximation is
for infinitely many $N$ bounded from below by $\frac{1}{cN}$ for some constant
$c \geq 2$ which depends on the measure. This implies, that for a finitely
supported discrete measure on $[0,1]^d$ the known possible order of

diseases, and hence also include a large number of parameters. One of the
attractive features of physics-based models is that in those models (most)
parameters have a clear physical meaning. Nevertheless, the determination of
these parameters is often very elaborate and costly and shows a large scatter
within the population. Hence, it is essential to identify the most important
parameter for a particular problem at hand. In order to distinguish parameters
which have a significant influence on a specific model output from
non-influential parameters, we use sensitivity analysis, in particular the
Sobol method as a global variance-based method. However, the Sobol method
requires a large number of model evaluations, which is prohibitive for
computationally expensive models. We therefore employ Gaussian processes as a
metamodel for the underlying full model. Metamodelling introduces further
uncertainty, which we also quantify. We demonstrate the approach by applying it
to two different problems: nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in a multiphase
tumour-growth model, and arterial growth and remodelling. Even relatively small
numbers of evaluations of the full model suffice to identify the influential
parameters in both cases and to separate them from non-influential parameters.
The approach also allows the quantification of higher-order interaction
effects. We thus show that a variance-based global sensitivity analysis is
feasible for computationally expensive biomechanical models. Different aspects
of sensitivity analysis are covered including a transparent declaration of the
uncertainties involved in the estimation process. Such a global sensitivity
analysis not only helps to massively reduce costs for experimental

of a scalar reward function. More recently, convex RL has been introduced to
extend the RL formulation to all the objectives that are convex functions of
the state distribution induced by a policy. Notably, convex RL covers several
relevant applications that do not fall into the scalar formulation, including
imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration. In classic RL, it is
common to optimize an infinite trials objective, which accounts for the state
distribution instead of the empirical state visitation frequencies, even though
the actual number of trajectories is always finite in practice. This is
theoretically sound since the infinite trials and finite trials objectives can
be proved to coincide and thus lead to the same optimal policy. In this paper,
we show that this hidden assumption does not hold in the convex RL setting. In
particular, we show that erroneously optimizing the infinite trials objective
in place of the actual finite trials one, as it is usually done, can lead to a
significant approximation error. Since the finite trials setting is the default
in both simulated and real-world RL, we believe shedding light on this issue
will lead to better approaches and methodologies for convex RL, impacting
relevant research areas such as imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure

To protect the confidentiality of industrial data, federated learning (FL) was
introduced to collaboratively train shared machine learning models. However,
the local data collected by different devices skew in class distribution and
degrade industrial FL performance. This challenge has been widely studied at
the mobile edge, but they ignored the rapidly changing streaming data and
clustering nature of factory devices, and more seriously, they may threaten
data security. In this paper, we propose FedGS, which is a hierarchical
cloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered industries, to improve industrial
FL performance on non-i.i.d. data. Taking advantage of naturally clustered
factory devices, FedGS uses a gradient-based binary permutation algorithm
(GBP-CS) to select a subset of devices within each factory and build
homogeneous super nodes participating in FL training. Then, we propose a
compound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process
within and among these super nodes, which shows great robustness against data
heterogeneity. The proposed methods are time-efficient and can adapt to dynamic
environments, without exposing confidential industrial data in risky
manipulation. We prove that FedGS has better convergence performance than
FedAvg and give a relaxed condition under which FedGS is more
communication-efficient. Extensive experiments show that FedGS improves
accuracy by 3.5% and reduces training rounds by 59% on average, confirming its
superior effectiveness and efficiency on non-i.i.d. data.

measuring their physical properties. In particular, observing the final
deceleration phase, often poorly sampled, is fundamental to obtain a reliable
estimate of the jet's energy. During its 2019/2020 outburst, the BH LMXB MAXI
J1348$-$630 launched a single-sided radio-emitting jet that was detected at
large scales after a strong deceleration due to the interaction with the
interstellar medium (ISM). We successfully modelled the jet motion with a
dynamical external shock model, which allowed us to constrain the jet initial
Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 = 1.85^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$, inclination angle $\theta =
29.3_{-3.2}^{+2.7}$ deg and ejection date $t_{\rm ej} = 21.5_{-3.0}^{+1.8}$

external ISM density, we find that the jet has a large initial kinetic energy
$E_0 = 4.6^{+20.0}_{-3.4} \times 10^{46}$ erg, far greater than what commonly
measured for LMXBs from the jet's synchrotron emission. This implies that
discrete ejecta radiate away only a small fraction of their total energy, which
is instead transferred to the environment. The jet power estimate is larger
than the simultaneous available accretion power, and we present several options

Degeneration accumulates during brain aging and other cerebral activities,
causing structural atrophy and dysfunction. At the same time, adaptation allows
brain network reorganize to compensate for structural loss to maintain
cognition function. Although hidden resilience mechanism is critical and
fundamental to uncover the brain aging law, due to the lack of datasets and
appropriate methodology, it remains essentially unknown how these two processes
interact dynamically across brain networks. To quantitatively investigate this
complex process, we analyze aging brains based on 6-year follow-up multimodal
neuroimaging database from 63 persons. We reveal the critical mechanism of
network resilience that various perturbation may cause fast brain structural
atrophy, and then brain can reorganize its functional layout to lower its
operational efficiency, which helps to slow down the structural atrophy and
finally recover its functional efficiency equilibrium. This empirical finding
could be explained by our theoretical model, suggesting one universal
resilience dynamical function. This resilience is achieved in the brain

thickness reflects how the coupling between different conducting channels
(Topological surface channels and bulk channels) changes. Additionally, the
electron-electron interaction (EEI) effect was observed in the
temperature-dependent conductivity at low temperatures. From the EEI effect, we
get an alternate estimate of the number of transport channels and obtain a

where training happens with data federated across devices and not leaving them
to sustain user privacy. This is ensured by making the untrained or partially
trained models to reach directly the individual devices and getting locally
trained ""on-device"" using the device owned data, and the server aggregating all
the partially trained model learnings to update a global model. Although almost
all the model learning schemes in the federated learning setup use gradient
descent, there are certain characteristic differences brought about by the
non-IID nature of the data availability, that affects the training in
comparison to the centralized schemes. In this paper, we discuss the various
factors that affect the federated learning training, because of the non-IID
distributed nature of the data, as well as the inherent differences in the
federating learning approach as against the typical centralized gradient
descent techniques. We empirically demonstrate the effect of number of samples
per device and the distribution of output labels on federated learning. In
addition to the privacy advantage we seek through federated learning, we also
study if there is a cost advantage while using federated learning frameworks.
We show that federated learning does have an advantage in cost when the model
sizes to be trained are not reasonably large. All in all, we present the need
for careful design of model for both performance and cost.

and contains improvements in the consideration of heat capacities and
lithospheric pressure, and in the calculation of the amount of interfacial

are significant differences in the e.g. the serpentinization time -- the time
necessary to consume most of the reactants at specific initial conditions -- or
the amount of heat produced by this process. In a simple application we show
that in icy bodies, under some realistic conditions, below the melting point of
water ice, serpentinization reaction using interfacial water may be able to
proceed and eventually push the local temperature above the melting point to
start a 'runaway' serpentinization. According to our calculations in objects
with radii R $\gtrsim$ 200 km serpentinization might have quickly reformed
nearly the whole interior of these bodies in the early Solar system.

wrong number of electrons, improving the accuracy further. We also show how
low-lying excited states can be calculated efficiently using a Gram-Schmidt

Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have been exposed to the Internet for ease of
access and adaptation to advanced technologies. However, it creates security
vulnerabilities. Attackers often exploit these vulnerabilities to launch an
attack on ICSs. Towards this, threat hunting is performed to proactively
monitor the security of ICS networks and protect them against threats that
could make the systems malfunction. A threat hunter manually identifies threats
and provides a hypothesis based on the available threat intelligence. In this
paper, we motivate the gap in lacking research in the automation of threat
hunting in ICS networks. We propose an automated extraction of threat
intelligence and the generation and validation of a hypothesis. We present an
automated threat hunting framework based on threat intelligence provided by the
ICS MITRE ATT&CK framework to automate the tasks. Unlike the existing hunting
solutions which are cloud-based, costly and prone to human errors, our solution
is a central and open-source implemented using different open-source

that the proposed threat hunting solution can identify the network's attacks

time. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the
anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$ varying from $0.2$
to $0.7$. The jets are measured in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta_{\rm jet}|<
0.9-R$ and in the transverse momentum range $5<p_\mathrm{T,jet}^{\rm ch}<140\
\mathrm{GeV}/c$. The multiplicity intervals are categorised by the ALICE
forward detector V0. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ differential cross section of
charged-particle jets are compared to leading order (LO) and next-to-leading
order (NLO) perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. It is
found that the data are better described by the NLO calculation, although the
NLO prediction overestimates the jet cross section below $20\ \mathrm{GeV}/c$.
The cross section ratios for different $R$ are also measured and compared to
model calculations. These measurements provide insights into the angular
dependence of jet fragmentation. The jet yield increases with increasing
self-normalised charged-particle multiplicity. This increase shows only a weak
dependence on jet transverse momentum and resolution parameter at the highest
multiplicity. While such behaviour is qualitatively described by the present
version of PYTHIA, quantitative description may require implementing new
mechanisms for multi-particle production in hadronic collisions.

expected to be an important structural element in the design of beyond 5G (B5G)
and 6G wireless access networks. A key operational aspect in HetNets is how to
optimally implement the wireless backhaul links to efficiently support the
traffic demand. In this work, we utilize the recently proposed Robotic Aerial
Small Cells (RASCs) that are able to grasp at different tall urban landforms as
wireless relay nodes for backhauling. This can be considered as an alternative
to fixed small cells (FSCs) which lack flexibility since once installed their
position cannot be altered. More specifically, on-demand deployment of RASCs is
considered for constructing a millimeter-wave (mmWave) backhaul network to
optimize available network capacity using a network flow-based mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) formulation. Numerical investigations reveal that for
the same required achievable throughput, the number of RASCs required are 25\%
to 65\% less than the number of required FSCs. This result can have significant
implications in reducing required wireless network equipment (capex) to provide
a given network capacity and allows for an efficient and flexible network
densification.

decisions to present a ranked list of relevant items is critical. Off-policy
evaluation (OPE) for ranking policies is thus gaining a growing interest
because it enables performance estimation of new ranking policies using only
logged data. Although OPE in contextual bandits has been studied extensively,
its naive application to the ranking setting faces a critical variance issue
due to the huge item space. To tackle this problem, previous studies introduce
some assumptions on user behavior to make the combinatorial item space
tractable. However, an unrealistic assumption may, in turn, cause serious bias.
Therefore, appropriately controlling the bias-variance tradeoff by imposing a
reasonable assumption is the key for success in OPE of ranking policies. To
achieve a well-balanced bias-variance tradeoff, we propose the Cascade Doubly
Robust estimator building on the cascade assumption, which assumes that a user
interacts with items sequentially from the top position in a ranking. We show
that the proposed estimator is unbiased in more cases compared to existing
estimators that make stronger assumptions. Furthermore, compared to a previous
estimator based on the same cascade assumption, the proposed estimator reduces
the variance by leveraging a control variate. Comprehensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our estimator leads to more
accurate OPE than existing estimators in a variety of settings.

  We consider two variants of BGT. In discrete BGT the robot trims only one

  For discrete BGT, we show a simple $4$-approximation algorithm and, by

tighter approximation when the growth rates are balanced. A by-product of this

at large dopings, giving rise to direct LH and indirect HH gaps. In p-doped

providing low-powered transmissions in nextG (i.e., beyond 5G) wireless

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently attracted significant
attention due to its high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. This
paper proposes a new optimization framework to minimize total transmit power of
BC-NOMA cooperative vehicle-to-everything networks (V2XneT) while ensuring the
quality of services. More specifically, the base station (BS) transmits a
superimposed signal to its associated roadside units (RSUs) in the first time
slot. Then the RSUs transmit the superimposed signal to their serving vehicles
in the second time slot exploiting decode and forward protocol. A backscatter
device (BD) in the coverage area of RSU also receives the superimposed signal
and reflect it towards vehicles by modulating own information. Thus, the
objective is to simultaneously optimize the transmit power of BS and RSUs along
with reflection coefficient of BDs under perfect and imperfect channel state
information. The problem of energy efficiency is formulated as non-convex and
coupled on multiple optimization variables which makes it very complex and hard
to solve. Therefore, we first transform and decouple the original problem into
two sub-problems and then employ iterative sub-gradient method to obtain an
efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BC-NOMA
V2XneT provides high energy efficiency than the conventional NOMA V2XneT

potential is bounded from below irrespective of the sign of $\beta$. Earlier
computations mostly considered the quartic part. Our chief motivation behind
this study is to assess the vacuum expectation values of $V(\phi)$ and $\phi$,
both of which can be negative, and hence may lead to some screening of the
inflationary cosmological constant value. First using the in-in formalism, the
renormalised quantum correction to the cubic potential appearing in the
energy-momentum tensor is computed at two loop, which is the leading order in
this case. The quantum correction to the kinetic term at two loop are
subleading compared to the above result at late cosmological times. Next, using
some of these results we compute the renormalised vacuum expectation value of $
\phi$, by computing the tadpoles at ${\cal O}(\beta)$ and ${\cal O}(\lambda
\beta)$. Due to the appearance of the de Sitter isometry breaking logarithms,
the tadpoles cannot be completely renormalised away in this case, unlike the
flat spacetime. All these results, as expected, show secularly growing
logarithms at late cosmological times. We next use a recently proposed
renormalisation group inspired formalism to resum perturbative secular effects,
to compute a non-perturbative $\langle \phi \rangle$ at late cosmological
times. $\langle \phi \rangle$ turns out to be approximately one order of
magnitude less compared to the position of the classical minima
$\phi=-3\beta/\lambda$ of $V(\phi)$. Estimation on the possible screening of
the inflationary cosmological constant due to this $\langle \phi \rangle$ is
also presented.

twofold: i) an increase in the force constant of the cyanide out-of-plane
movement due to the binding of the gas onto the Pt(CN)4 plane, and ii) the
hampered rotation of the pyrazine due to steric hindrance. The high energy
region of the neutron scattering data whose spectral weight is dominated by the
internal vibrations of the pyrazine is negligibly affected by the presence of
the gas as expected from a physisorption type of binding.

Bayesian evidence and realistic mock data sets constructed with AGAMA to select

strongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild
preference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few
per cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind
our results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching
the phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of
the DCM. The internal kinematics are thus consistent with a population of
hundreds of massive white dwarfs in NGC 6397, and roughly 100 segregated
stellar-mass black holes in NGC 3201, as previously found with CMC. Such
analyses confirm the accuracy of both mass-orbit modelling and Monte Carlo

devices, which overcomes their limitations and achieves better user experience.
Moreover, the proof-of-concept (PoC) hardware prototype of the platform, and
two typical use cases providing AR services of navigation and face recognition

  Practitioner's Perspective",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As various post hoc explanation methods are increasingly being leveraged to
explain complex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to develop
a deeper understanding of if and when the explanations output by these methods
disagree with each other, and how such disagreements are resolved in practice.
However, there is little to no research that provides answers to these critical
questions. In this work, we introduce and study the disagreement problem in
explainable machine learning. More specifically, we formalize the notion of
disagreement between explanations, analyze how often such disagreements occur
in practice, and how do practitioners resolve these disagreements. To this end,
we first conduct interviews with data scientists to understand what constitutes
disagreement between explanations generated by different methods for the same
model prediction, and introduce a novel quantitative framework to formalize
this understanding. We then leverage this framework to carry out a rigorous
empirical analysis with four real-world datasets, six state-of-the-art post hoc
explanation methods, and eight different predictive models, to measure the
extent of disagreement between the explanations generated by various popular
explanation methods. In addition, we carry out an online user study with data
scientists to understand how they resolve the aforementioned disagreements. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art explanation methods often disagree in
terms of the explanations they output. Our findings also underscore the
importance of developing principled evaluation metrics that enable

good characterisation of the scattering phase function. The Henyey-Greenstein
phase function has become the standard for describing anisotropic scattering by
dust grains, but it is a poor representation of the real scattering phase
function outside the optical range. Aims: We investigate alternatives for the
Henyey-Greenstein phase function that would allow the scattering properties of
dust grains to be described. Our goal is to find a balance between realism and
complexity: the scattering phase function should be flexible enough to provide
an accurate fit to the scattering properties of dust grains over a wide
wavelength range, and it should be simple enough to be easy to handle,
especially in the context of radiative transfer calculations. Methods: We fit
various analytical phase functions to the scattering phase function
corresponding to the BARE-GR-S model, one of the most popular and commonly
adopted models for interstellar dust. We weigh the accuracy of the fit against
the number of free parameters in the analytical phase functions. Results: We
confirm that the Henyey-Greenstein phase functions poorly describe scattering
by dust grains, particularly at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with relative
differences of up to 50%. The Draine phase function alleviates this problem at
near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, but not in the UV. The two-term
Reynolds-McCormick phase function, recently advocated in the context of light
scattering in nanoscale materials and aquatic media, describes the BARE-GR-S
data very well, but its five free parameters are degenerate. We propose a
simpler phase function, the two-term ultraspherical-2 (TTU2) phase function,
that also provides an excellent fit to the BARE-GR-S phase function over the
entire UV-NIR wavelength range. (Abridged)

low-frequency surveys reach an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. However,
this resolution is not yet sufficient to study the more compact and distant
sources in detail. Sub-arcsecond resolution is therefore the next milestone in
advancing these fields. The biggest challenge at low radio frequencies is the
ionosphere. If not adequately corrected for, ionospheric seeing blurs the
images to arcsecond or even arcminute scales. Additionally, the required image
size to map the degree-scale field of view of low-frequency radio telescopes at
this resolution is far greater than what typical soft- and hardware is
currently capable of handling. Here we present for the first time (to the best
of our knowledge) widefield sub-arcsecond imaging at low radio frequencies. We
derive ionospheric corrections in a few dozen individual directions and apply
those during imaging efficiently using a recently developed imaging algorithm
(arXiv:1407.1943, arXiv:1909.07226). We demonstrate our method by applying it
to an eight hour observation of the International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR)

BN transparent in the visible spectral region with a highly anisotropic optical
response. This difference can be primarily attributed to a considerably reduced
dielectric screening in BN, leading to enhancement of the effective Coulomb
interaction. Despite relatively strong Coulomb interaction, exciton formation
is largely suppressed in both materials. Our analysis of the elastic properties

the assumption of manifold hypothesis. In this paper, we show that the dataset
lies on an embedded hypersurface submanifold which is locally
$(d-1)$-dimensional. Hence, we show that the manifold hypothesis holds at least
for the embedding dimensionality $d-1$. Using an induction in a pyramid
structure, we also extend the embedding dimensionality to lower embedding
dimensionalities to show the validity of manifold hypothesis for embedding
dimensionalities $\{1, 2, \dots, d-1\}$. For embedding the hypersurface, we
first construct the $d$ nearest neighbors graph for data. For every point, we
fit an osculating hypersphere $S^{d-1}$ using its neighbors where this
hypersphere is osculating to a hypothetical hypersurface. Then, using surgery
theory, we apply surgery on the osculating hyperspheres to obtain $n$
hyper-caps. We connect the hyper-caps to one another using partial
hyper-cylinders. By connecting all parts, the embedded hypersurface is obtained
as the disjoint union of these elements. We discuss the geometrical
characteristics of the embedded hypersurface, such as having boundary, its
topology, smoothness, boundedness, orientability, compactness, and injectivity.
Some discussion are also provided for the linearity and structure of data. This

  Specifically, we first show that the low $\rank$ solution of the Hankel
penalized least square estimator satisfies an estimation error in $S_p$-norms
for $p \in [1,2]$ that captures the effect of the system order better than the
existing operator norm upper bound for the simple least square. We then provide
a stability analysis for an estimation procedure based on a variant of the
Ho-Kalman algorithm that improves both the dependence on the dimension and the
least singular value of the Hankel matrix of the Markov parameters. Finally, we
propose an estimation algorithm for the minimal realization that uses both the
Hankel penalized least square estimator and the Ho-Kalman based estimation
procedure and guarantees with high probability that we recover the correct
order of the system and satisfies a new fast rate in the $S_2$-norm with a

establishing and breaking contact. The interaction wrenches that arise from
contact are used to steer the robot Center of Mass (CoM) and reject
perturbations that make the system deviate from the desired trajectory and
often make them fall. The feasibility of a given control target (desired CoM
wrench or acceleration) is conditioned by the contact point distribution,
ground friction, and actuation limits. In this work, we develop a method to
compute the set of feasible wrenches that a legged robot can exert on its CoM
through contact. The presented method can be used with any amount of
non-co-planar contacts and takes into account actuation limits and limitations
based on an inelastic contact model with Coulomb friction. This is exemplified
with a planar biped model standing with the feet at different heights.
Exploiting assumptions from the contact model, we explain how to compute the
set of wrenches that are feasible on the CoM when the contacts remain in
position as well as the ones that are feasible when some of the contacts are
broken. Therefore, this method can be used to assess whether a switch in
contact configuration is feasible while achieving a given control task.
Furthermore, the method can be used to identify the directions in which the
system is not actuated (i.e. a wrench cannot be exerted in those directions).
We show how having a joint be actuated or passive can change the non-actuated
wrench directions of a robot at a given pose using a spatial model of a
lower-extremity exoskeleton. Therefore, this method is also a useful tool for
the design phase of the system. This work presents a useful tool for the
control and design of legged systems that extends on the current state of the
art.

primary operators -- which transform under a single copy of the Virasoro
algebra -- to have parametrically large conformal dimension for fixed central
charge. In particular, we find a \textit{single} universal expression that
interpolates between distinct heavy regimes, exactly as in the case of bulk OPE
asymptotics\cite{Collier:2019weq}. The expression depends universally on the
boundary entropy and the central charge, and not on any other details of the

a second at $-7500$ km/s, with a third, near-zero velocity component appearing
after a delay. The blue and central components can be described by Gaussian
profiles of intermediate width, but the red component is significantly broader
and Lorentzian. The blue component evolves towards lower velocity before fading
at $100$ d post-peak, concurrently with a light curve break. Multi-component
profiles are observed in other hydrogen lines including Pa$\beta$, and in lines
of Ca II and He I. Spectropolarimetry obtained before (10.2 d) and after (38.4
d) the appearance of the H lines show a large shift on the Stokes $Q$ -- $U$
plane consistent with SN 2018bsz undergoing radical changes in its geometry.
Assuming the SN is almost unpolarised at 10.2 d, the continuum polarisation at
38.4 d reaches $P \sim1.8\%$ implying a highly asymmetric configuration. We
propose that the observed evolution of SN 2018bsz can be explained by highly
aspherical CSM. After the SN explosion, the CSM is quickly overtaken by the
ejecta, but as the photosphere starts to recede, the different CSM regions
re-emerge producing the peculiar line profiles. Based on the first appearance
of H$\alpha$, we can constrain the distance of the CSM to be less than $430$
AU, or even lower ($<87$ AU) if the pre-peak plateau is related to an eruption
that created the CSM. The presence of CSM has been inferred for other SLSNe-I.
However, it is not clear whether the rare properties of SN 2018bsz can be
generalised for SLSNe-I or whether they are the result of an uncommon
evolutionary path, possibly involving a binary companion.

  graph optimization problems",,,,,"quant-ph cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum Annealing (QA) is a computational framework where a quantum system's
continuous evolution is used to find the global minimum of an objective
function over an unstructured search space. It can be seen as a general
metaheuristic for optimization problems, including NP-hard ones if we allow an
exponentially large running time. While QA is widely studied from a heuristic
point of view, little is known about theoretical guarantees on the quality of
the solutions obtained in polynomial time.
  In this paper we use a technique borrowed from theoretical physics, the
Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound, and develop new tools proving that short, constant
time quantum annealing guarantees constant factor approximations ratios for
some optimization problems when restricted to bounded degree graphs.
Informally, on bounded degree graphs the LR bound allows us to retrieve a
(relaxed) locality argument, through which the approximation ratio can be
deduced by studying subgraphs of bounded radius.
  We illustrate our tools on problems MaxCut and Maximum Independent Set for
cubic graphs, providing explicit approximation ratios and the runtimes needed
to obtain them. Our results are of similar flavor to the well-known ones
obtained in the different but related QAOA (quantum optimization algorithms)
framework.
  Eventually, we discuss theoretical and experimental arguments for further
improvements.

affected by the mixing of opposite-parity ionic levels, which is induced both
by an external electric field and the weak interaction between electrons and
the nucleus. In order to reinvestigate this ""Stark-plus-weak-interaction""
mixing, well-known in neutral atomic systems, we employ relativistic Dirac
theory. Based on the developed approach, detailed calculations are performed

\to {\rm 1s}^2 \; {\rm 3s}_{1/2}$ (M1 + parity-violating-E1) transitions in
hydrogen- and lithium-like ions, respectively. In particular, we focus on the
difference between the excitation rates obtained for the right- and
left-circularly polarized incident light. This difference arises due to the
parity violating mixing of ionic levels and is usually characterized in terms
of the circular-dichroism parameter. We argue that future measurements of
circular dichroism, performed with highly charged ions in the SPS or LHC rings,
may provide valuable information on the electron-nucleus weak-interaction

specifically aimed at such mathematical content. This approach draws on the
navigational mechanisms often used to explore the virtual worlds of text
adventure games with audio-visual sensory substitution for graphical content.
The relative spatial placement of the elements of an equation are represented
as a virtual world, so that the reader can navigate from element to element.
Text elements are announced conventionally using synthesised speech while
graphical elements, such as roots and fraction lines, are rendered using a
modification of the vOICe algorithm. The virtual world allows the reader to
interactively discover the spatial structure of the equation, while the
rendition of graphical elements as sound allows the shape and identity of
elements that cannot be synthesised as speech to be discovered and recognised.
The browsing approach was evaluated by eleven blind and fourteen sighted
participants in a user trial that included the identification of twelve
equations extracted from PDF documents. Overall, equations were identified
completely correctly in 78% of cases (74% and 83% respectively for blind and
sighted subjects). If partial correctness is considered, the performance is
substantially higher. We conclude that the integration of a spatial model
represented as a virtual world in conjunction with audio-visual sensory
substitution for non-textual elements can be an effective way for blind and

has also been investigated in a neutral pressure transmitting medium, PTM.
While the in situ heating of Yb facilitates the formation of YbH$_2$ plus x

phase transitions from the unit cells of P-31m symmetry to the I4/m and I4/mmm

the same time, the molecular volume of the systems compressed in H$_2$ PTM is

hydrogen uptake. Nevertheless, hydrogenation towards YbH$_3$ is incomplete, and
polyhydrides do not form up to the highest pressure studied here of ca. 75 GPa.

a spherically symmetric wind of the progenitor star. We investigate whether a
past interaction of Cas A with an asymmetric circumstellar shell can account
for the observed asymmetries. We performed 3D MHD simulations that describe the
remnant evolution from the SN to its interaction with a circumstellar shell.
The initial conditions are provided by a 3D neutrino-driven SN model whose
morphology resembles Cas A. We explored the parameter space of the shell,
searching for a set of parameters able to produce reverse shock asymmetries at
the age of 350 years analogous to those observed in Cas A. The interaction of
the remnant with the shell can produce asymmetries resembling those observed in
the reverse shock if the shell was asymmetric with the densest portion in the
nearside to the northwest (NW). The reverse shock shows the following
asymmetries at the age of Cas A: i) it moves inward in the observer frame in
the NW region, while it moves outward in other regions; ii) the geometric
center of the reverse shock is offset to the NW from the geometric center of
the forward shock; iii) the reverse shock in the NW region has enhanced
nonthermal emission because, there, the ejecta enter the reverse shock with a
higher velocity (between 4000 and 7000 km/s) than in other regions (below 2000
km/s). The asymmetries observed in the reverse shock of Cas A can be
interpreted as signatures of the interaction of the remnant with an asymmetric
circumstellar shell that occurred between 180 and 240 years after the SN event.
We suggest that the shell was, most likely, the result of a massive eruption
from the progenitor star that occurred between $10^4$ and $10^5$ years prior to
core-collapse. We estimate a total mass of the shell of the order 2 Msun.

also comment on cybercrime forums. The cybercrime forums on which they discuss
are analyzed and crossover users' strength of participation is reported. Also,
to assess if they represent a sub-group of the forum population, their posting

blend of analyses shows that (i) a minimum of 7.2% of the public forum
population are crossover users that have ties with cybercrime forums; (ii)
their participation in cybercrime forums is limited; and (iii) their posting

different metals by reducing the energy barrier of the rate limiting step and
even to reach the cusp of the volcano plot. The largest changes in catalytic
activity with strain for the HER were found in Pt, Au, and Ir while Co and Ni
were very insensitive to this strategy. In the case of the ORR, the catalytic
activity of Au could be enhanced by the application of tensile strains while
that of Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, Co, Ru, and Os was improved by the application of
compressive strains. However, the catalytic activity of Ir was rather
insensitive to mechanical deformations. Elastic strains were able to modify the

magnetic linear dichroism under different experimental conditions (temperature,

dynamical interplay of charge excitations with the zigzag ordered state on
ultrashort time scales. We observe a rather slow initial demagnetization (few
to 10s of ps) followed by a long-lived non-thermal antiferromagnetic
spin-disordered state (100$-$1000s of ps), which can be understood in terms of
holons and doublons disordering the antiferromagnetic background after
photoexcitation. Varying temperature and fluence in the presence of an external
magnetic field reveals two distinct photoinduced dynamics associated with the
zigzag and quantum paramagnetic disordered phases. The photo-induced

recovery dynamics related to the growth and propagation of zigzag domains on

epitaxial layers, their electronic and magnetic properties can be modulated by
structural distortions induced at the atomic scale. The modification and
control can be affected at coherent heterointerfaces by epitaxial strain
imposed by the substrate or by structural modifications to accommodate the
film-substrate symmetry mismatch. Often these act in conjunction with a strong
dependence on the layer thickness, especially for ultrathin layers. Moreover,
as a result of these effects, the temperature dependence of the structure may
deviate largely from that of the bulk. The temperature-dependent structure of 3
to 44 unit cell thick ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ films grown on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$
substrates are investigated using a combination of high-resolution synchrotron
X-ray diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy. This aims to shed
light on the intriguing magnetic and magnetotransport properties of epitaxial
SRO layers, subjected to extensive investigations lately. The oxygen octahedral
tilts and rotations are found to be strongly dependent on the temperature, the
film thickness, and the distance away from the film-substrate interface. As a
striking manifestation of the coupling between magnetic order and lattice
structure, the Invar effect is observed below the ferromagnetic transition
temperature in epitaxial layers as thin as 8 unit cells, similar to bulk
ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$.

the use of intelligent learning algorithm to solve the problem of VNE has
become a trend, this method is gradually outdated. At the same time, there are
some security problems in VNE. However, there is no intelligent algorithm to
solve the security problem of VNE. For this reason, this paper proposes a
security-aware VNE algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL). In the
training phase, we use a policy network as a learning agent and take the

The learning agent is trained in this environment to get the mapping

Virtual nodes can only be embedded on substrate nodes that are not lower than

based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) (TS-DRL-VNE) for the problem that
the mapping result of existing heuristic algorithm is easy to converge to the
local optimal solution. For the problem that the existing VNE algorithm based
on ML often ignores the importance of substrate network representation and
training mode, a DRL VNE algorithm based on full attribute matrix (FAM-DRL-VNE)
is proposed. In view of the problem that the existing VNE algorithm often
ignores the underlying resource changes between virtual network requests, a DRL
VNE algorithm based on matrix perturbation theory (MPT-DRL-VNE) is proposed.
Experimental results show that the above algorithm is superior to other
algorithms.

high-fidelity numerical simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs)

This makes part-scale predictions computationally demanding, especially when
they require many small-scale simulations. We consider drop-on-demand liquid
metal jetting (LMJ) as an illustrative example of such computational
complexity. A model describing droplet coalescence for LMJ may include coupled
incompressible fluid flow, heat transfer, and phase change equations.
Numerically solving these equations becomes prohibitively expensive when
simulating the build process for a full part consisting of thousands to
millions of droplets. Reduced-order models (ROMs) based on neural networks (NN)
or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms have been built to replace the original
physics-based solver and are computationally tractable for part-level
simulations. However, their quick inference capabilities often come at the
expense of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We apply an operator
learning (OL) approach to learn a mapping between initial and final states of
the droplet coalescence process for enabling rapid and accurate part-scale
build simulation. Preliminary results suggest that OL requires
order-of-magnitude fewer data points than a kNN approach and is generalizable
beyond the training set while achieving similar prediction error.

poses different challenges. For example, providing a detailed matching
explanation for the targeted stakeholders is needed to ensure a transparent
recommendation. There are several knowledge bases that represent skills and
competencies (e.g, ESCO, O*NET) that are used to identify the candidate and the
