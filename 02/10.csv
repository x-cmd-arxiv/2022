$\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$, where $\varepsilon$ is the scaling parameter,

task-specific data: A unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts
guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a
bidirectional PLM. With quality training data selected based on the generation
probability and regularization techniques (label smoothing and temporal
ensembling) applied to the fine-tuning stage for better generalization and

strategy based on hybrid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear NCS has been proposed
in Hertneck and Allg\""ower (2021b), however with the limitation to NCS without
transmission delays. In this paper, we extend this strategy for nonlinear NCS
with transmission delays. The capability to handle systems with delays makes it
possible to use the resulting dynamic STC mechanism in many practical scenarios
where instant transmissions without delays cannot be guaranteed. The proposed
dynamic STC mechanism guarantees stability despite bounded transmission delays.
The effectiveness of the mechanism is illustrated with a numerical example and
compared to state-of-the art literature.

gravity, in string theory, local and nonlocal higher derivative theories, as
well as general asymptotically-free or finite theories, gravitationally
interacting bound states can form when the energy is larger than the Planck
energy. On the other hand, in higher derivative or nonlocal theories with
interaction governed by a dimensionless or a dimensionful coupling constant,
the bound states form when the energy is smaller than the Planck energy. Such
bound states are allowed because of the softness of the scattering amplitudes
in the ultraviolet region. Indeed, in such theories, the potential is finite
while the force is zero or constant in $r=0$. Finally, since the bound states
that form in the early Universe may have an energy that ranges from the Planck
mass to any arbitrarily large or small value, we argue that they can serve as
dark matter candidates and/or as the seeds for the structure's formation at
large scale in the Cosmos.

extraction of electroencephalography (EEG) data, such as in motor imagery
brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. It is a data-driven method estimating a
set of spatial filters so that the power of the filtered EEG signal is
maximized for one motor imagery class and minimized for the other. This method,
however, is prone to overfitting and is known to suffer from poor
generalization especially with limited calibration data. Additionally, due to
the high heterogeneity in brain data and the non-stationarity of brain
activity, CSP is usually trained for each user separately resulting in long
calibration sessions or frequent re-calibrations that are tiring for the user.
In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called Spectrally Adaptive Common
Spatial Patterns (SACSP) that improves CSP by learning a temporal/spectral
filter for each spatial filter so that the spatial filters are concentrated on
the most relevant temporal frequencies for each user. We show the efficacy of
SACSP in providing better generalizability and higher classification accuracy
from calibration to online control compared to existing methods. Furthermore,
we show that SACSP provides neurophysiologically relevant information about the
temporal frequencies of the filtered signals. Our results highlight the
differences in the motor imagery signal among BCI users as well as spectral
differences in the signals generated for each class, and show the importance of
learning robust user-specific features in a data-driven manner.

redshift of z = 6.312 and its luminous X-ray and optical afterglow. We obtained
a photometric and spectroscopic follow-up in the optical and near-infrared
(NIR), covering both the prompt and afterglow emission from a few minutes up to
20 Ms after burst. With an isotropic gamma-ray energy release of Eiso = 1.27E54
erg, GRB 210905A lies in the top ~7% of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in terms of
energy released. Its afterglow is among the most luminous ever observed. It
starts with a shallow evolution that can be explained by energy injection, and
it is followed by a steeper decay, while the spectral energy distribution is in
agreement with slow cooling in a constant-density environment within the
standard fireball theory. A jet break at ~ 46.2+-16.3 d (~6.3 d rest-frame) has
been observed in the X-ray light curve; however, it is hidden in the H band due
to the contribution from the likely host galaxy, the fourth GRB host at z > 6
known to date. We derived a half-opening angle of 8.4+-1.0 degrees, which is
the highest ever measured for a z>6 burst, but within the range covered by
closer events. The resulting collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy release of
1E52 erg is also among the highest ever measured. The moderately large
half-opening angle argues against recent claims of an inverse dependence of the
half-opening angle on the redshift. The total jet energy is likely too large to
be sustained by a standard magnetar, and it suggests that the central engine of
this burst was a newly formed black hole. Despite the outstanding energetics
and luminosity of both GRB 210905A and its afterglow, we demonstrate that they
are consistent with those of less distant bursts, indicating that the powering
mechanisms and progenitors do not evolve significantly with redshift.

the functional residual, where $k$ is the iteration counter and $p$ is the

computation of the Cubically regularized Newton step by the first-order

achieved by the Fast Gradient Method. Thus, our result proves the latter rate
to be optimal. We also discover lower complexity bounds for non-Euclidean

proposed in the literature. These include the classical Hopfield networks
(HNs), sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern
continuous Hopfield networks (MCHNs), which possesses close links with
self-attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a general
framework for understanding the operation of such memory networks as a sequence
of three operations: similarity, separation, and projection. We derive all
these memory models as instances of our general framework with differing
similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework of
Krotov et al (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural
network dynamics with only second-order interactions between neurons, and
derive a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics.
Finally, using our framework, we empirically investigate the capacity of using
different similarity functions for these associative memory models, beyond the
dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically that Euclidean or
Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better in practice
on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity than
existing models.

beams in circular accelerators opens new possibilities for controlling some of
the beam properties. Beam splitting by crossing a stable 1D non-linear
resonance is part of the routine operation of the CERN Proton Synchrotron. The
beam undergoes trapping and transport inside stable islands created in the
horizontal plane to allow multi-turn extraction towards the Super Proton
Synchrotron, where the beam is used for fixed-target experiments. This process
acts only on the horizontal beam emittance, inducing a reduction of its initial
value. In this paper, we present a generalisation of this approach, in which
both transverse planes are affected by the proposed technique. We will discuss
in detail how to manipulate the transverse emittances by means of a controlled
crossing of a 2D non-linear resonance. The novel technique will be presented by
discussing the theoretical analysis of a Hamiltonian model, as well as
simulating the performance of the proposed manipulation using a more realistic
non-linear symplectic map.

biorelevant solvents (water, ammonia and methane) to be present in liquid form
inside the uppermost few meters of several modelled surfaces (rocky and icy
crusts of various compositions) of hypothetical bodies orbiting active galactic
nuclei (AGN), and investigate under which constraints this might occur.
Methods. We adjust and average together X-ray spectra from a sample of 20 Type
1 Seyfert galaxies to calculate a mean snowline of the sample used. Based on
this, we introduce variation of a hypothetical body's orbit across distances
between 10% and 100% of the snowline radius, and calculate a sub-surface
attenuation within four different model surface compositions for each. Surface
compositions are based on lunar soil and solvent ices found in the milky way's
circumnuclear region. We then use this as a continuous source term for a
thermal model. Example bodies are systematically investigated with sizes
between 1/30 and 20 earth radii. Further outlier variations are also considered
(such as the case of bound rotation of the body) to end up with a perspective
of solvent phases under a wide slew of many different conditions. Results. We
find that liquid solvents are possible under a multitude of parameters, with
temperature being the main constraint to liquid water and body size as well as
pressure being the main constraint to liquid methane and ammonia. We further
find that these results, when adjusted for snowline distance, depend less on
the energy output of the central source within the Seyfert Type 1 AGN than on
other parameters, such as body sizes and solvent properties.

source of sea spay aerosol. The mechanisms underlying the drops production from
a single bubble bursting event have been intensively studied and the influence
of the bubble size and liquid parameters (density, viscosity and surface
tension) has been unified. However, despite the diversity of the surfactant
molecules present in the oceans, their influence has been overlooked. In this
paper we experimentally explore the influence of the surfactant concentration
(Sodium Dodecyl Surfate - SDS) in a water solution on a single bubble collapse
and subsequent drop production. We show that these surfactant molecules have an
astonishing effect. In particular, we quantitatively show that they modify the
bubble collapse, they induce less, smaller and faster drops and they can even
completely prevent the drop production for a particular concentration. These
results are presented in the existing dimensionless framework and they allow us
to affirme that these effects are mainly a consequence of the surface tension
gradients (Marangoni stresses) more than just the surface tension lowering.
Finally, this study shows that the role of water contamination by
surface-active agents is important and needs to be understood to improve the
prediction of the sea spray aerosol.

compliance of soft robots provides a form of ""mechanical intelligence"" -- the
ability to passively exhibit behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to
program. Exploiting this capacity requires careful consideration of the

promising means to generate sophisticated soft robots by reasoning over this
coupling. However, the complex nature of soft robot dynamics makes it difficult
to provide a simulation environment that is both sufficiently accurate to allow
for sim-to-real transfer, while also being fast enough for contemporary
co-optimization algorithms. In this work, we show that finite element

(seeds) on the SIR epidemic model on random networks. This is relevant when,
for example, the number of arriving infected individuals is large, but also to
the modeling of a large number of infected individuals, but also to more
general situations such as the spread of ideas in the presence of publicity
campaigns. This model is frequently studied by mapping to a bond percolation
problem, in which edges in the network are occupied with the probability, $p$,
of eventual infection along an edge connecting an infected individual to a
susceptible neighbor. This approach allows one to calculate the total final
size of the infection and epidemic threshold in the limit of a vanishingly
small seed fraction. We show, however, that when the initial infection occupies
a nonvanishing fraction $f$ of the network, this method yields ambiguous
results, as the correspondence between edge occupation and contagion
transmission no longer holds. We propose instead to measure the giant component
of recovered individuals within the original contact network. This has an
unambiguous interpretation and correctly captures the dependence of the
epidemic size on $f$. We give exact equations for the size of the epidemic and
the epidemic threshold in the infinite size limit. We observe a second order
phase transition as in the original formulation, however with an epidemic
threshold which decreases with increasing $f$. When the seed fraction $f$ tends
to zero we recover the standard results.

implicitly assume a graph with a trivial underlying sheaf. This choice is
reflected in the structure of the graph Laplacian operator, the properties of
the associated diffusion equation, and the characteristics of the convolutional
models that discretise this equation. In this paper, we use cellular sheaf
theory to show that the underlying geometry of the graph is deeply linked with
the performance of GNNs in heterophilic settings and their oversmoothing
behaviour. By considering a hierarchy of increasingly general sheaves, we study
how the ability of the sheaf diffusion process to achieve linear separation of
the classes in the infinite time limit expands. At the same time, we prove that
when the sheaf is non-trivial, discretised parametric diffusion processes have
greater control than GNNs over their asymptotic behaviour. On the practical
side, we study how sheaves can be learned from data. The resulting sheaf
diffusion models have many desirable properties that address the limitations of
classical graph diffusion equations (and corresponding GNN models) and obtain
competitive results in heterophilic settings. Overall, our work provides new
connections between GNNs and algebraic topology and would be of interest to
both fields.

considerable amount of cryogens, as it is the case for high spatial resolution
far infrared (FIR) astronomy, currently still face technological limits for
their execution from space. Angular resolution and available observational
capabilities are particularly affected. Balloon-based platforms promise to
complement the existing observational capabilities by offering means to deploy
comparatively large telescopes with comparatively little effort, including
other advantages such as the possibility to regularly refill cryogens and to
change and/or update instruments. The planned European Stratospheric Balloon
Observatory (ESBO) aims at providing these additional large aperture FIR
capabilities, exceeding the spatial resolution of Herschel, in the long term.
The plans focus on reusable platforms performing regular flights and an
operations concept that provides researchers with proposal-based access to
observations. It thereby aims at offering a complement to other airborne,
ground-based and space-based observatories in terms of access to wavelength
regions, spatial resolution capability, and photometric stability. While the
FIR capabilities are a main long-term objective, ESBO will offer benefits in
other wavelength regimes along the way. Within the ESBO Design Study (ESBO DS),
a prototype platform carrying a 0.5 m telescope for ultraviolet and visible
light observations is being built and a platform concept for a next-generation
FIR telescope is being studied. A flight of the UV/VIS prototype platform is
estimated for 2021. In this paper we will outline the scientific and technical
motivation for a large aperture balloon-based FIR observatory and the ESBO DS
approach towards such an infrastructure. Secondly, we will present the
technical motivation, science case, and instrumentation of the 0.5 m UV/VIS

the lack of both accurate and efficient inference methods for approximating the
intractable posterior. Recently, pretrained language models (PLMs) have brought
astonishing performance improvements to a wide variety of tasks due to their
superior representations of text. Interestingly, there have not been standard
approaches to deploy PLMs for topic discovery as better alternatives to topic

representations for topic discovery, and then propose a joint latent space
learning and clustering framework built upon PLM embeddings. In the latent
space, topic-word and document-topic distributions are jointly modeled so that
the discovered topics can be interpreted by coherent and distinctive terms and
meanwhile serve as meaningful summaries of the documents. Our model effectively
leverages the strong representation power and superb linguistic features
brought by PLMs for topic discovery, and is conceptually simpler than topic
models. On two benchmark datasets in different domains, our model generates
significantly more coherent and diverse topics than strong topic models, and
offers better topic-wise document representations, based on both automatic and

the linear polarization plane of photons during propagation. This effect, known
as cosmic birefringence, impacts on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations producing a mixing of $E$ and $B$ polarization modes which is
otherwise null in the standard scenario. Such an effect is naturally
parametrized by a rotation angle which can be written as the sum of an
isotropic component $\alpha_0$ and an anisotropic one
$\delta\alpha(\hat{\mathbf{n}})$. In this paper we compute angular power
spectra and bispectra involving $\delta\alpha$ and the CMB temperature and
polarization maps. In particular, contrarily to what happens for the
cross-spectra, we show that even in absence of primordial cross-correlations
between the anisotropic birefringence angle and the CMB maps, there exist
non-vanishing three-point correlation functions carrying signatures of
parity-breaking physics. Furthermore, we find that such angular bispectra still
survive in a regime of purely anisotropic cosmic birefringence, which
corresponds to the conservative case of having $\alpha_0=0$. These bispectra
represent an additional observable aimed at studying cosmic birefringence and
its parity-violating nature beyond power spectrum analyses. They provide also a
way to perform consistency checks for specific models of cosmic birefringence.
Moreover, we estimate that among all the possible birefringent bispectra,
$\langle\delta\alpha\, TB\rangle$ and $\langle\delta\alpha\,EB\rangle$ are the
ones which contain the largest signal-to-noise ratio. Once the cosmic
birefringence signal is taken to be at the level of current constraints, we
show that these bispectra are within reach of future CMB experiments, as
LiteBIRD.

shapes individuals' beliefs about whether the income distribution is fair

income inequality (which often leads to large misperceptions), nor do they
consider all inequities to be unfair. In this paper, we empirically assess the
link between objective measures of income inequality and fairness views in a
context of high but decreasing income inequality. We combine opinion poll data
with harmonized data from household surveys of 18 Latin American countries from
1997--2015. We report three main findings. First, we find a strong and
statistically significant relationship between income inequality and unfairness
views across countries and over time. Unfairness views evolved in the same
direction as income inequality for 17 out of the 18 countries in our sample.
Second, individuals who are older, unemployed, and left-wing are, on average,
more likely to perceive the income distribution as very unfair. Third, fairness
views and income inequality have predictive power for individuals'
self-reported propensity to mobilize and protest independent of each other,
suggesting that these two variables capture different channels through which
changes in the income distribution can affect social unrest.

networks (RNNs) by means of the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework.
The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is typically employed as the activation
function of the RNN, and the ReLU has specific nonnegativity properties
regarding its input and output signals. Therefore, it is effective if we can
derive IQC-based stability conditions with multipliers taking care of such
nonnegativity properties. However, such nonnegativity (linear) properties are
hardly captured by the existing multipliers defined on the positive
semidefinite cone. To get around this difficulty, we loosen the standard
positive semidefinite cone to the copositive cone, and employ copositive
multipliers to capture the nonnegativity properties. We show that, within the
framework of the IQC, we can employ copositive multipliers (or their inner
approximation) together with existing multipliers such as Zames-Falb
multipliers and polytopic bounding multipliers, and this directly enables us to
ensure that the introduction of the copositive multipliers leads to better (no
more conservative) results. We finally illustrate the effectiveness of the
IQC-based stability conditions with the copositive multipliers by numerical
examples.

linear stochastic transitivity model with contextualized utilities (CoLST), and
the learner's task is to include the best arm (with highest latent
context-dependent utility) in the duel. We propose a computationally efficient
algorithm, $\texttt{CoLSTIM}$, which makes its choice based on imitating the
feedback process using perturbed context-dependent utility estimates of the
underlying CoLST model. If each arm is associated with a $d$-dimensional
feature vector, we show that $\texttt{CoLSTIM}$ achieves a regret of order
$\tilde O( \sqrt{dT})$ after $T$ learning rounds. Additionally, we also
establish the optimality of $\texttt{CoLSTIM}$ by showing a lower bound for the
weak regret that refines the existing average regret analysis. Our experiments
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-art algorithms for special cases of
CoLST models.

account for genuine many-body quantum interference between different solutions
of the mean-field equations of a bosonic many-body (MB) system. This renders
the TWA essentially classical, where a large number of particles formally takes
the role of the inverse of Planck's constant $\hbar$. The failure to describe
genuine interference phenomena, such as localization and scarring in Fock
space, can be seen as a virtue of this quasiclassical method, which thereby
allows one to identify genuine quantum effects when being compared with ""exact""
quantum calculations that do not involve any a priori approximation. A rather
prominent cause for such quantum effects that are not accounted for by the TWA
is the constructive interference between the contributions of symmetry-related
trajectories, which would occur in the presence of discrete symmetries provided
the phase-space distribution of the initial state and the observable to be
evaluated feature a strong localization about the corresponding symmetry
subspaces. Here we show how one can conceive an augmented version of the TWA
which can account for this particular effect. This augmented TWA effectively
amounts to complementing conventional TWA calculations by separate Truncated
Wigner simulations that are restricted to symmetric subspaces and involve
weight factors that account for the dynamical stability of sampling
trajectories with respect to perpendicular deviations from those subspaces. We
illustrate the validity of this method at pre- as well as post-Ehrenfest time
scales in prototypical Bose-Hubbard systems displaying chaotic classical
dynamics, where it also reveals the existence of additional MB interference
effects.

conversion of nuclear singlet order into observable magnetization. In this
study polarisation transfer to a heteronucleus is achieved through a selective
rotation of the proton singlet-triplet states driven by a combination of a
rotating magnetic field and a weak bias field. Surprisingly we find that
efficient polarisation transfer driven by a STORM (Singlet-Triplet Oscillations
through Rotating Magnetic fields) pulse in the presence of $\mu$T bias fields
requires rotation frequencies on the order of several kHz. The rotation
frequencies therefore greatly exceed any of the internal frequencies of typical
zero- to ultralow field experiments. We further show that the rotational
direction of the rotating field is not arbitrary and greatly influences the
final transfer efficiency. Some of these aspects are demonstrated
experimentally by considering hyperpolarised (1-$^{13}$C)fumarate. In addition,
we provide numerical simulations highlighting the resilience of the STORM pulse
against disruptive quadrupolar coupling partners. In contrast to most of the

framework is that of ferromagnetic systems, in which the alignment interactions
are a surrogate of the effective imitation among the individuals. In this
context, the experimental discovery of scale-free correlations of speed
fluctuations in starling flocks poses a challenge to the common statistical
physics wisdom, as in the ordered phase of standard ferromagnetic models with
$\mathrm{O}(n)$ symmetry, the modulus of the order parameter has finite
correlation length. To make sense of this anomaly a novel ferromagnetic theory
has been proposed, where the bare confining potential has zero second
derivative (i.e.\ it is marginal) along the modulus of the order parameter. The
marginal model exhibits a zero-temperature critical point, where the modulus
correlation length diverges, hence allowing to boost both correlation and
collective order by simply reducing the temperature. Here, we derive an
effective field theory describing the marginal model close to the $T=0$
critical point and calculate the renormalization group equations at one loop
within a momentum shell approach. We discover a non-trivial scenario, as the
cubic and quartic vertices do not vanish in the infrared limit, while the
coupling constants effectively regulating the exponents $\nu$ and $\eta$ have
upper critical dimension $d_c=2$, so that in three dimensions the critical
exponents acquire their free values, $\nu=1/2$ and $\eta=0$. This theoretical
scenario is verified by a Monte Carlo study of the modulus susceptibility in
three dimensions, where the standard finite-size scaling relations have to be
adapted to the case of $d>d_c$. The numerical data fully confirm our
theoretical results.

AUDIT therefore relieves biologists and ecologists from a significant workload.
We evaluate AUDIT on a zoo scenario dataset unseen during training where we

the solution (in the gap case) is payoff-equivalent to a classic environment

delivers a sharp characterization of the equilibrium price path. Furthermore,
we provide a (simple to check and frequently satisfied) sufficient condition
which guarantees that no arbitrary (even dynamically-inconsistent) information
arrival process can lower the seller's profit against this equilibrium price
path. We call a price path with this property a reinforcing solution, and

spontaneous transition of a smooth, laminar flow to rapidly changing, chaotic
dynamics. In 1883, Reynolds experimentally demonstrated that, in an initially
laminar flow of water, turbulent motions emerge without any measurable external
disturbance. To this day, turbulence remains a major unresolved phenomenon in
fluid mechanics; in particular, there is a lack of a mathematical model where
turbulent dynamics emerge naturally from a laminar flow. Recently, we proposed
a new theory of turbulence in gases, according to which turbulent motions are
created in an inertial gas flow by the mean field effect of the intermolecular
potential. In the current work, we investigate the effect of viscosity in our
turbulence model, by numerically simulating the air flow at normal conditions
in a straight pipe for different values of the Reynolds number. We find that
the transition between the laminar and turbulent flows in our model occurs
without any deliberate perturbations as the Reynolds number increases from 2000
to 4000. As the simulated flow becomes turbulent, the decay rate of the time
averaged Fourier spectrum of the kinetic energy in our model approaches
Kolmogorov's inverse five-thirds law. Both results are consistent with

  Demonstration",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge in real-world reinforcement learning (RL) is the sparsity
of reward feedback. Often, what is available is an intuitive but sparse reward
function that only indicates whether the task is completed partially or fully.
However, the lack of carefully designed, fine grain feedback implies that most
existing RL algorithms fail to learn an acceptable policy in a reasonable time
frame. This is because of the large number of exploration actions that the
policy has to perform before it gets any useful feedback that it can learn
from. In this work, we address this challenging problem by developing an
algorithm that exploits the offline demonstration data generated by a
sub-optimal behavior policy for faster and efficient online RL in such sparse
reward settings. The proposed algorithm, which we call the Learning Online with
Guidance Offline (LOGO) algorithm, merges a policy improvement step with an
additional policy guidance step by using the offline demonstration data. The
key idea is that by obtaining guidance from - not imitating - the offline data,
LOGO orients its policy in the manner of the sub-optimal policy, while yet
being able to learn beyond and approach optimality. We provide a theoretical
analysis of our algorithm, and provide a lower bound on the performance
improvement in each learning episode. We also extend our algorithm to the even
more challenging incomplete observation setting, where the demonstration data
contains only a censored version of the true state observation. We demonstrate
the superior performance of our algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches on a
number of benchmark environments with sparse rewards and censored state.
Further, we demonstrate the value of our approach via implementing LOGO on a
mobile robot for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, where it shows
excellent performance.

investigate the properties of a system that displays long-range
valley-polarized nematic order. Besides breaking the threefold rotational
symmetry of the triangular moir\'e superlattice, this type of order also breaks
twofold rotational and time-reversal symmetries, which leads to interesting
properties. First, we develop a phenomenological model to describe the onset of
this ordered state in twisted moir\'e systems and to explore its signatures in
their thermodynamic and electronic properties. Its main manifestation is that
it triggers the emergence of in-plane orbital magnetic moments oriented along
high-symmetry lattice directions. We also investigate the properties of the
valley-polarized nematic state at zero temperature. Due to the existence of a
dangerously irrelevant coupling $\lambda$ in the six-state clock model that
describes the putative valley-polarized nematic quantum critical point, the
ordered state displays a pseudo-Goldstone mode. Using a two-patch model, we
compute the fermionic self-energy to show that down to very low energies, the
Yukawa-like coupling between the pseudo-Goldstone mode and the electronic
degrees of freedom promotes the emergence of non-Fermi liquid behavior. Below a
crossover energy scale $\Omega^{*}\sim\lambda^{3/2}$, however, Fermi liquid
behavior is recovered. Finally, we discuss the applicability of these results

method offers a promising approach to compute $E_\textrm{Ov}$ accurately,
giving access to all electronic structure methods. Central to this approach is
the construction of quantum(-mechanically treated) clusters placed within
suitable embedding environments. Unfortunately, current approaches to
constructing the quantum clusters either require large system sizes, preventing
application of high-level methods, or require significant manual input,
preventing investigations of multiple systems simultaneously. In this work, we
present a systematic and general quantum cluster design protocol that can
determine small converged quantum clusters for studying the Ov in metal-oxides
with accurate methods such as local coupled cluster with single, double and

rely on strong assumptions on both the function classes (e.g.,

Despite the recent efforts on relaxing these assumptions, existing works are
only able to relax one of the two factors, leaving the strong assumption on the

sample-efficient offline RL with weak assumptions on both factors?
  In this paper we answer the question in the positive. We analyze a simple

seek to avoid the use of calibration based on stellar models thus providing a
truly independent estimate of these properties. These include both the helium
abundance and other physical quantities that can have a significant impact on
the oscillation frequencies such as the electronic degeneracy parameter or the
extent of the ionisation region.
  Taking as a starting point our first paper, we applied structural
perturbations of the ionisation zone to the wave equation for radial
oscillations in an isentropic region. The resulting glitch model is thus able
to exploit the information contained in the fast frequency oscillation caused
by the helium ionisation but also in the slow trend accompanying that of
hydrogen. This information can directly be expressed in terms of parameters
related respectively to the helium abundance, electronic degeneracy and extent
of the ionisation region.
  Using a Bayesian inference, we show that a substantial recovery of the
properties at the origin of the glitch is possible. A degeneracy between the
helium abundance and the electronic degeneracy is found to exist, which
particularly affects the helium estimate. Extending the method to cases where
the glitch is subject to contamination (e.g. surface effects), we noted the
importance of the slow glitch trend associated with hydrogen ionisation. We
propose using a Gaussian process to disentangle the frequency glitch from
surface effects.

While accurate localization favors models that operate at the pixel- or

our approach performs contrastive learning by directly sampling individual
point pairs from different regions. Compared to an aggregated representation

online knowledge distillation during training. Both advantages are important
when dealing with imperfect regions encountered in the unsupervised setting.

classes of optimization problems. Our algorithms all build upon techniques
related to the analysis of primal-dual extragradient methods via relative
Lipschitzness proposed recently by [CST21].
  (1) Separable minimax optimization. We study separable minimax optimization
problems $\min_x \max_y f(x) - g(y) + h(x, y)$, where $f$ and $g$ have
smoothness and strong convexity parameters $(L^x, \mu^x)$, $(L^y, \mu^y)$, and
$h$ is convex-concave with a $(\Lambda^{xx}, \Lambda^{xy},
\Lambda^{yy})$-blockwise operator norm bounded Hessian. We provide an algorithm
with gradient query complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{L^{x}}{\mu^{x}}} +
\sqrt{\frac{L^{y}}{\mu^{y}}} + \frac{\Lambda^{xx}}{\mu^{x}} +
\frac{\Lambda^{xy}}{\sqrt{\mu^{x}\mu^{y}}} +
\frac{\Lambda^{yy}}{\mu^{y}}\right)$. Notably, for convex-concave minimax
problems with bilinear coupling (e.g.\ quadratics), where $\Lambda^{xx} =
\Lambda^{yy} = 0$, our rate matches a lower bound of [ZHZ19].
  (2) Finite sum optimization. We study finite sum optimization problems
$\min_x \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in[n]} f_i(x)$, where each $f_i$ is $L_i$-smooth and
the overall problem is $\mu$-strongly convex. We provide an algorithm with
gradient query complexity $\tilde{O}\left(n + \sum_{i\in[n]}
\sqrt{\frac{L_i}{n\mu}} \right)$. Notably, when the smoothness bounds
$\{L_i\}_{i\in[n]}$ are non-uniform, our rate improves upon accelerated SVRG
[LMH15, FGKS15] and Katyusha [All17] by up to a $\sqrt{n}$ factor.
  (3) Minimax finite sums. We generalize our algorithms for minimax and finite
sum optimization to solve a natural family of minimax finite sum optimization
problems at an accelerated rate, encapsulating both above results up to a
logarithmic factor.

while retaining its structural information and meaningful properties. In this
work, we review and investigate thirteen dimension reduction methods including
linear and nonlinear, spectral, blind source separation, convex and non-convex
methods and utilize the resulting embeddings to construct a mapping to
quantities of interest via polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). We refer to the
general proposed approach as manifold PCE (m-PCE), where manifold corresponds
to the latent space resulting from any of the studied dimension reduction
methods. To investigate the capabilities and limitations of these methods we
conduct numerical tests for three physics-based systems (treated as
black-boxes) having high-dimensional stochastic inputs of varying complexity
modeled as both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields to investigate the
effect of the intrinsic dimensionality of input data. We demonstrate both the
advantages and limitations of the unsupervised learning methods and we conclude
that a suitable m-PCE model provides a cost-effective approach compared to
alternative algorithms proposed in the literature, including recently proposed
expensive deep neural network-based surrogates and can be readily applied for
high-dimensional UQ in stochastic PDEs.

extracted in one layer and then passed to the next layer to choose relevant

Noncommuting charges have recently emerged as a subfield at the intersection of
quantum thermodynamics and quantum information. Until now, this subfield has

displays a volume-law behavior of the entropy and exponentially decaying

In this paper, we argue that these higher-group symmetries and this phenomenon
of Weak Gravity Conjecture mixing are related to one another. We show that this
relationship extends to supergravities in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 dimensions, so
higher-dimensional supergravity is endowed with precisely the structure needed
to ensure consistency with emergent higher-group symmetries and with the Weak
Gravity Conjecture. We further argue that a similar mixing of Weak Gravity
Conjectures can occur in two-term Chern-Simons theories or in theories with
kinetic mixing, though the connection with higher-group symmetries here is more
tenuous, and accordingly the constraints on effective field theory are not as
sharp.

role of neutrinos in this anomaly has been mostly overlooked, despite their key
role in CMB lensing, because in the standard scenario they tend to increase the

open up a window to link anomalous CMB lensing with present and future

equations of motion for such relativistic trajectories is not as simple as in
Newtonian mechanics. The principle of general (or Lorentz) covariance and the
mass-shell constraint make it difficult to parametrize physically adequate
4-forces. Here, we propose a solution to this old problem. We apply our
framework to several conservative and dissipative forces. In particular, we
propose covariant formulations for Hooke's law and the constant force, and
compute the drag due to gravitational and hard-sphere collisions in dust, gas
and radiation media. We recover and covariantly extend known forces such as
Epstein drag, Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction and Poynting-Robertson drag.
Variable-mass effects are also considered, namely Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and
the variable-mass rocket. We conclude with two applications: 1. The
free-falling spring. We find that Hooke's law corrects the deviation equation
by an effective Anti-de Sitter tidal force; 2. Black hole infall with drag. We
numerically compute some trajectories on a Schwarzschild background supporting
a dust-like accretion disk.

stars and helium burning stars (~80 Myr), intermediate mass asymptotic branch
stars (~1 Gyr), and low mass red giant branch stars (~4 Gyr). We compare the
stellar disk dynamics to that of the gas using existing HI, CO, and Halpha
kinematics. We find that the disk of M33 has relatively low velocity dispersion
(~16 km/s), and unlike in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, there is no
strong trend in velocity dispersion as a function of stellar age. The youngest
disk stars are as dynamically hot as the oldest disk stars and are dynamically
hotter than predicted by most M33 like low mass simulated analogs in Illustris.
The velocity dispersion of the young stars is highly structured, with the large

studies focus almost exclusively on the central Einstein-radius region.
Covering over 14 arcmin$^2$, the new MUSE mosaic extends significantly beyond
the A370 Einstein radius, providing, for the first time, a detailed look at the
cluster outskirts. Combining these data with wide-field, multi-band Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the BUFFALO project, we analyse the
distribution of objects within the cluster and along the line of sight.
Identifying 416 cluster galaxies, we use kinematics to trace the radial mass
profile of the halo, providing a mass estimate independent from the lens model.
We also measure radially-averaged properties of the cluster members, tracking
their evolution as a function of infall. Thanks to the high spatial resolution
of our data, we identify six cluster members acting as galaxy-galaxy lenses,
which constrain localized mass distributions beyond the Einstein radius.
Finally, taking advantage of MUSE's 3D capabilities, we detect and analyse
multiple spatially extended overdensities outside of the cluster that influence
lensing-derived halo mass estimates. We stress that much of this work is only
possible thanks to the robust, extended IFU coverage, highlighting its
importance even in less optically dense cluster regions. Overall, this work
showcases the power of combining HST+MUSE, and serves as the initial step
towards a larger and wider program targeting several clusters.

incorporating N enrichment into our previously developed and empirically tuned
multi-zone galactic chemical evolution model. We adopt a
metallicity-independent (""primary"") N yield from massive stars and a
metallicity-dependent (""secondary"") N yield from AGB stars. In our model,
galactic radial zones do not evolve along the observed [N/O]-[O/H] relation,
but first increase in [O/H] at roughly constant [N/O], then move upward in
[N/O] via secondary N production. By $t\approx5$ Gyr, the model approaches an
equilibrium [N/O]-[O/H] relation, which traces the radial oxygen gradient. We
find good agreement with the [N/O]-[O/H] trend observed in extra-galactic
systems if we adopt an IMF-averaged massive star yield
$y_\text{N}^\text{CC}=3.6\times10^{-4}$, consistent with predictions for
rapidly rotating progenitors, and a fractional AGB yield that is linear in mass
and metallicity
$y_\text{N}^\text{AGB}=(9\times10^{-4})(M_*/M_\odot)(Z_*/Z_\odot)$. This model
reproduces the [N/O]-[O/H] relation found for Milky Way stars in the APOGEE
survey, and it reproduces (though imperfectly) the trends of stellar [N/O] with
age and [O/Fe]. The metallicity-dependent yield plays the dominant role in
shaping the gas-phase [N/O]-[O/H] relation, but the AGB time-delay is required
to match the APOGEE stellar age and [O/Fe] trends. If we add $\sim$40\%
oscillations to the star formation rate, the model reproduces the scatter in
gas-phase [N/O] vs. [O/H] observed in external galaxies by MaNGA. We also
construct models using published AGB yields and examine their empirical
successes and shortcomings. For all AGB yields we consider, simple stellar
populations release half their N after only $\sim$250 Myr.

we can dissect the ingredients driving the wind and predict the resulting
mass-loss for hydrogen-depleted massive stars. Our modelling efforts reveal a
complex picture with strong, non-linear dependencies on the luminosity-to-mass
ratio and Z with a steep, but not totally abrupt onset for WR-type winds in
helium stars. With our findings, we provide a theoretical motivation for a
population of helium stars at low Z, which cannot be detected via WR-type
spectral features. Our study of massive He-star atmosphere models yields the
very first mass-loss recipe derived from first principles in this regime.
Implementing our first findings in stellar evolution models, we demonstrate how
traditional approaches tend to overpredict WR-type mass loss in the young
Universe.

Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). We develop a new method incorporating a multi-step

subsequently decompose the emission line into multiple components. We detect
outflows ranging in velocity, $v_{\rm out}$, from $100-600$ km s$^{-1}$ across
a range of star formation rate surface densities, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, from
$\sim$0.01-10 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ in resolution elements of a few
hundred parsec. Outflows are detected in $\sim100\%$ of all spaxels within the
half-light radius, and $\sim70\%$ within $r_{90}$, suggestive of a high
covering fraction for this starbursting disk galaxy. Around $2/3$ of the total
outflowing mass originates from the star forming ring, which corresponds to
$<10\%$ of the total area of the galaxy. We find that the relationship between
$v_{\rm out}$ and the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, as well as between the mass loading
factor, $\eta$, and the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, are consistent with trends expected
from energy-driven feedback models. We study the resolution effects on this
relationship and find stronger correlations above a re-binned size-scale of
$\sim500$ pc. Conversely, we do not find statistically significant consistency
with the prediction from momentum-driven winds.

outflows varying greatly scale and energetics are consistent with being
launched by the same physical processes. High-angular resolution CO J = 3-2
observations were used of ten high-mass protostars in the Cygnus-X molecular
cloud, obtained at the SMA as part of the PILS-Cygnus survey. From these data,
the outflow force was measured. In addition, an extended sample of protostellar
and extragalactic outflow-force measurements was assembled from existing
literature to allow for a direct comparison of the scaling relations of the two
types of outflows. Molecular outflows were detected originating from all ten
sources of the PILS-Cygnus survey, and their outflow forces are found in close
agreement with measurements from the literature. The comparison of the
protostellar and extragalactic sources reveals, with 95\% confidence, that
Class 0 protostars and extragalactic sources follow the same outflow
force--bolometric luminosity correlation. The close agreement between the
Cygnus-X sources and sources of similar envelope mass and bolometric luminosity
suggests that clustered star formation has no significant effect on
protostellar outflows. We find a strong indication that protostellar and
extragalactic outflows are consistent with having a similar launch mechanism.
The existence of such a mechanism would enable the development of a single
universal outflow launch model, although more observations are required in

We isolate the luminosity distance parameter $d_L(z)$ from the Baryon Acoustic

magnitude and the Hubble constant $H_0$, is replaced by a degeneracy between
$M_B$ and the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$. When imposing the $r_d$ value,
this yields the $M_B(z) = M_B + \delta M_B(z)$ value from NRT. We perform the

serves to separate valuable mineral particles from worthless gangue particles

attach to bubbles of air injected into the pulp. This creates bubble-particle
aggregates that rise to the top of the flotation column where they accumulate
to a froth or foam layer that is removed through a launder for further
processing. At the same time, the hydrophilic gangue particles settle and are
removed continuously. The drainage of liquid due to capillarity is essential
for the formation of a stable froth layer. This effect is included into a
previously formulated hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that
models the volume fractions of floating aggregates and settling hydrophilic
solids [R. B\""{u}rger, S. Diehl and M.C. Mart\'i, {\it IMA J. Appl. Math.} {\bf

by multichannel filtering, or simply by using plain natural RGB, or medical
images, which already consist of several channels. Subsequently we minimize the

the necessary assumptions such that it can be solved efficiently by
optimization techniques like the Chambolle-Pock method. We prove that the
proposed energy functional has global minimizers, and show its stability and
convergence with respect to noisy inputs. Experimental results show that the

this line be produced by plasma quasi-thermal noise on the Voyager short
antenna? Second, why does this line emerge at some distance from the
heliopause? We provide a simple answer to these questions, which elucidates the
origin of this line. First, a minute quantity of supra-thermal electrons, as
generally present in plasmas, whence the qualifier quasi-thermal, can produce a
small plasma frequency peak on a short antenna, of amplitude independent of the
concentration of these electrons; furthermore, the detection required long
spectral averages, alleviating the smallness of the peak compared to the
background. We therefore attribute the observed line to a minute proportion of
fast electrons that contribute negligibly to the pressure. Second, we suggest
that, up to some distance from the heliopause, the large compressive
fluctuations ubiquitous in this region prevent the line to emerge from the
statistical fluctuations of the receiver noise because it is blurred out by the
averaging required for detection,especially in the presence of short-wavelength
density fluctuations. These results open up novel perspectives for interstellar
missions, by showing that a minute proportion of fast electrons may be
sufficient to measure the density even with a relatively short antenna, because
the quietness of the medium enables a large number of spectra to be averaged.

separated by a ten-meter-long rigid mast that undergoes small amounts of
thermal flexing which need to be compensated for in order to produce a

parameters in order to discover whether the mast motion in future observations
can be predicted. We find that, by using the solar aspect angle (SAA),
observation date, and orbital phase, we can simulate the motion of one laser by
translating the track produced by the other and applying modifications to the
resulting mast aspect solution, allowing the reconstruction of a minimally

alternative image analysis pipeline -- The Thresher -- for these kinds of data,
based on online multi-frame blind deconvolution. It makes use of all available
data to obtain a best estimate of the astronomical scene in the context of
reasonable computational limits; it does not require prior estimates of the
point-spread functions in the images, or knowledge of point sources in the
scene that could provide such estimates. Most importantly, the scene it aims to
return is the optimum of a justified scalar objective based on the likelihood
function. Because it uses the full set of images in the stack, The Thresher
outperforms TLI in signal-to-noise; as it accounts for the individual-frame

effectiveness of our algorithm on both simulated data and real

Research (SOAR) Telescope in Chile, using the High-Resolution Camera mounted on
the adaptive optics module (HRCam+SAM). The sample of nearby M dwarfs is drawn
from three sources: multiples from the RECONS long-term astrometric monitoring
program at the SMARTS 0.9m, known multiples for which these new observations
will enable or improve orbit fits, and candidate multiples flagged by their
astrometric fits in Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). We surveyed 333 of our 338 M
dwarfs via 830 speckle observations, detecting companions for 63% of the stars.
Most notably, this includes new companions for 76% in the subset selected from
Gaia DR2. In all, we report the first direct detections of 97 new stellar
companions to the observed M dwarfs. Here we present the properties of those
detections, the limits of each non-detection, and five orbits with periods 0.67
- 29 yr already observed as part of this program. Companions detected have
projected separations of 0.024 - 2.0 arcsec (0.25 - 66 AU) from their primaries
and have $\Delta I \lesssim 5.0$ mag. This multi-year campaign will ultimately
map complete orbits for nearby M dwarfs with periods up to 3 yr, and provide
key epochs to stretch orbital determinations for binaries to 30 yr.

classical offline setting, where data arrive independently, and the online
setting, where data arrive adversarially. While the former model is often both
computationally and statistically tractable, the latter requires no
distributional assumptions. In an attempt to achieve the best of both worlds,
previous work proposed the smooth online setting where each sample is drawn
from an adversarially chosen distribution, which is smooth, i.e., it has a
bounded density with respect to a fixed dominating measure. We provide tight
bounds on the minimax regret of learning a nonparametric function class, with
nearly optimal dependence on both the horizon and smoothness parameters.
Furthermore, we provide the first oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithms in
this setting. In particular, we propose an oracle-efficient improper algorithm
whose regret achieves optimal dependence on the horizon and a proper algorithm
requiring only a single oracle call per round whose regret has the optimal
horizon dependence in the classification setting and is sublinear in general.
Both algorithms have exponentially worse dependence on the smoothness parameter
of the adversary than the minimax rate. We then prove a lower bound on the
oracle complexity of any proper learning algorithm, which matches the
oracle-efficient upper bounds up to a polynomial factor, thus demonstrating the
existence of a statistical-computational gap in smooth online learning.
Finally, we apply our results to the contextual bandit setting to show that if
a function class is learnable in the classical setting, then there is an
oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithm for contextual bandits in the case that
contexts arrive in a smooth manner.

effective equations of motion are derived under the constraint that the quantum
state of the electron system at any instant of time $t$ lies in the
$n$-dimensional low-energy subspace for the corresponding spin configuration at

the form of a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge freedom given by the
arbitrariness of the basis spanning the instantaneous low-energy sector. The
holonomic constraint generates a gauge covariant spin-Berry curvature tensor in
the equations of motion for the classical spins. In the non-abelian theory for

curvature is generically nonzero, even for time-reversal symmetric systems. Its
expectation value with the representation of the electron state is gauge
invariant and gives rise to an additional {\em geometrical} spin torque.
Besides anomalous precession, the $n\ge 2$ theory also captures the spin
nutational motion, which is usually considered as a retardation effect. This is
demonstrated by proof-of-principle numerical calculations for a minimal model

$\mathbf{v^*}=(v_1^*, ..., v_N^*)$ of dimension $N$ and is eligible to retrieve

difficult to achieve $p$-type conductivity. However, with excess of Zn, forming

material from crystalline to amorphous. This is especially true in silicon
photonics, where the high thermal conductivity of the waveguide material makes
heating the PCM energy inefficient. Here, we improve the energy efficiency of
the laser-induced phase transitions by inserting a layer of two-dimensional
(2D) material, either MoS2 or WS2, between the silica or silicon and the PCM.
The 2D material reduces the required laser power by at least 40% during the
amorphization (RESET) process, depending on the substrate. Thermal simulations
confirm that both MoS2 and WS2 2D layers act as a thermal barrier, which
efficiently confines energy within the PCM layer. Remarkably, the thermal
insulation effect of the 2D layer is equivalent to a ~100 nm layer of SiO2. The
high thermal boundary resistance induced by the van der Waals (vdW)-bonded
layers limits the thermal diffusion through the layer interfaces. Hence, 2D
materials with stable vdW interfaces can be used to improve the thermal
efficiency of PCM-tuned Si photonic devices. Furthermore, our waveguide
simulations show that the 2D layer does not affect the propagating mode in the
Si waveguide, thus this simple additional thin film produces a substantial
energy efficiency improvement without degrading the optical performance of the
waveguide. Our findings pave the way for energy-efficient laser-induced

the existence of heavy $SU(2)_L$ scalar doublet $(X= (X^0, X^-)^T)$ in the

asymmetry through a dimension eight operator, which conserves $B-L$ symmetry

converted to a net B-asymmetry through EW-sphalerons which are active at a
temperature above 100 GeV. To alleviate the small-scale anomalies of

fundamental question in astrophysics. The Orion Nebula is the nearest site of
ongoing and recent massive star formation. It is a unique laboratory for the
study of stellar feedback. Recent SOFIA [CII] 158 $\mu$m observations revealed
an expanding bubble, the Veil shell, being powered by stellar winds and
ionization feedback. We have identified a protrusion-like substructure in the
Northwest portion of the Orion Veil Shell that may indicate additional feedback
mechanisms that are highly directional. Our goal is to investigate the origin
of the protrusion by quantifying its possible driving mechanisms. We use the
[CII] 158 $\mu$m map of the Orion Nebula obtained with the upGREAT instrument
onboard SOFIA. The spectral and spatial resolution of the observations are 0.3
km/s and 16 arcsec, respectively.
  We consider three possible origins for this protrusion: Fossil outflow
cavities created by jets/outflows during the protostellar accretion phase,
pre-existing clumpiness in the OMC-1 core, and the stellar wind during the main
sequence phase. Based on the energetics and the morphology, we conclude that
the northwestern part of the pre-existing cloud was locally perturbed by
outflows ejected from massive protostars in the Trapezium cluster. This
suggests that the protrusion of the Veil is the result of mechanical rather
than radiative feedback. Furthermore, we argue that the location of the
protrusion is a suitable place to break the Orion Veil owing to the
photo-ablation from the walls of the protrusion. We conclude that the outflows
of massive protostars can influence the morphology of the future \hii\,region
and even cause breakages in the ionization front. Specifically, the interaction
of stellar winds of main-sequence stars with the molecular core pre-processed
by the protostellar jet is important.

craters that show high levels of degradation. Following previous studies on
impact cratering rates on the Saturnian satellites, we modeled the cratering
process on Titan to constrain its surface chronology and to assess the role of
centaur objects as its main impactors. A theoretical model previously developed
was used to calculate the crater production on Titan, considering the centaur
objects as the main impactors and including two different slopes for the
size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the smaller members of their source
population. A simple model for the atmospheric shielding effects is considered
within the cratering process and our results are then compared with other
synthetic crater distributions and updated observational crater counts. This
comparison is then used to compute Titan's crater retention age for each crater
diameter. The cumulative crater distribution produced by the SFD with a
differential index of $s_2 = 3.5$ is found to consistently predict large
craters (D > 50 km) on the surface of Titan, while it overestimates the number
of smaller craters. As both the modeled and observed distributions flatten for
craters with $D \lesssim 25 $ km due to atmospheric shielding, the difference
between them can be considered as a proxy for the scale to which erosion
processes have acted on the surface of Titan throughout the Solar System age.
Our results for the surface chronology of Titan indicate that craters with D >
50 km can prevail over the Solar System age, whereas smaller craters may be
completely obliterated due to erosion processes acting globally.

We derive computationally efficient algorithms for computing our proposed

SS-TPCA achieves the same estimation accuracy as classical matrix PCA, with
error proportional to the square root of the number of vertices in the network

isolating meaningful changepoints or outlying observations, and for
characterizing the ""variability network"" of the most varying edges. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on simulated data and on an

processing and can often be viewed as a perturbed equally spaced grid. In this
paper, we analyze how the uneven distribution of the samples impacts the
quality of interpolation and quadrature. Starting with equally spaced nodes on
$[-\pi,\pi)$ with grid spacing $h$, suppose the unevenly spaced nodes are
obtained by perturbing each uniform node by an arbitrary amount $\leq \alpha
h$, where $0 \leq \alpha < 1/2$ is a fixed constant. We prove a discrete
version of the Kadec-1/4 theorem, which states that the nonuniform discrete
Fourier transform associated with perturbed nodes has a bounded condition
number independent of $h$, for any $\alpha < 1/4$. We go on to show that
unevenly spaced quadrature rules converge for all continuous functions and
interpolants converge uniformly for all differentiable functions whose
derivative has bounded variation when $0 \leq \alpha < 1/4$. Though, quadrature
rules at perturbed nodes can have negative weights for any $\alpha > 0$, we
provide a bound on the absolute sum of the quadrature weights. Therefore, we
show that perturbed equally spaced grids with small $\alpha$ can be used
without numerical woes. While our proof techniques work primarily when $0 \leq
\alpha < 1/4$, we show that a small amount of oversampling extends our results
to the case when $1/4 \leq \alpha < 1/2$.

emission. In this work, variations in methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission are studied
to test if absence of CH$_3$OH emission can be linked to source properties.
Combining both new and archival observations with ALMA and sources from the
literature, a sample of 184 low-mass and high-mass protostars is investigated.
The warm (T > 100 K) gaseous CH$_3$OH mass, $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$, is determined for
each source using primarily optically thin isotopologues. On average, Class I
protostellar systems seem to have less warm $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$ ($<10^{-10}$
M$_\odot$) than younger Class 0 sources ($\sim10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$). High-mass
sources in our sample show higher warm $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$ up to $10^{-7}-10^{-3}$
M$_\odot$. To take into account the effect of the source's overall mass on
$M_{\rm CH_3OH}$, a normalized CH$_3$OH mass is defined as $M_{\rm
CH_3OH}/M_{\rm dust,0}$, where $M_{\rm dust,0}$ is the cold + warm dust mass
within a fixed radius. Excluding upper limits, a simple power-law fit to the
normalized warm CH$_3$OH masses results in $M_{\rm CH_3OH}/M_{\rm
dust,0}\propto L_{\rm bol}^{0.70\pm0.05}$. This is in good agreement with a
simple hot core toy model which predicts that the normalized $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$
increases with $L_{\rm bol}^{0.75}$ due to the snowline moving outward. Sources
for which the size of the disk is equivalent or smaller than the estimated 100
K radius agree well with the best-fit power-law model, whereas sources with
significantly larger disks show up to two orders of magnitude lower normalized
warm CH$_3$OH masses. Based on the latter results, we suggest that source
structure such as a disk can result in colder gas and thus fewer COMs in the
gas phase. Additionally, optically thick dust can hide the emission of COMs.

  C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.105.044310",,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With an extreme neutron-to-proton ratio of N/Z=3, 8He provides an ideal
laboratory for the study of a variety of exotic phenomena, such as the
emergence of a soft dipole mode that is dominated by transitions into the
continuum. In this contribution, a covariant density functional theory (DFT)
framework is used to compute ground-state properties and the dipole response of
8He. Although 8He is admittedly too light for DFT to be applicable, the great
merit of the approach is that the spurious contamination associated with the
center-of-mass motion is guaranteed to decouple from the physical response.
Given that a strong mixing between the isoscalar and isovector dipole modes is
expected for a system with such a large neutron-proton asymmetry as 8He, the
narrow structures that emerged at low energies in the isovector dipole response
are attributed to the shift of the spurious strength to zero (or near zero)
excitation energy. Thus, the theoretical framework implemented here disfavors
the emergence of a soft dipole mode in 8He.

which present challenges to path planning and motion control for both manned

vehicle to adapt its control and motion planning algorithms. Terrain
properties, however, can change on time scales of days or even hours,
necessitating their online estimation. The kinematics and, in particular the
oscillations experienced by an offroad vehicle carry a signature of the terrain
properties. These terrain properties can thus be estimated from proprioceptive
sensing of the vehicle dynamics with an appropriate model and estimation
algorithm. In this paper, we show that knowledge of the vertical dynamics of a
vehicle due to its suspension can enable faster and more accurate estimation of
terrain parameters. The paper considers a five degree of freedom model that
combines the well known half-car and bicycle models. We show through simulation
that the sinkage exponent, a parameter that can significantly influence the
wheel forces from the terrain and thus greatly impact the vehicle trajectory,
can be estimated from measurements of the vehicle's linear acceleration and
rotational velocity, which can be readily obtained from an onboard IMU. We show
that modelling the vertical vehicle dynamics can lead to significant
improvement in both the estimation of terrain parameters and the prediction of
the vehicle trajectory.

quadratically in the number of stimuli. One way to tackle this problem is to
construct approximation procedures that rely on more accessible proxies for

online recruitment, proposing an efficient domain-general procedure for
predicting human similarity judgments based on text descriptions. Intuitively,
similar stimuli are likely to evoke similar descriptions, allowing us to use
description similarity to predict pairwise similarity judgments. Crucially, the
number of descriptions required grows only linearly with the number of stimuli,
drastically reducing the amount of data required. We test this procedure on six
datasets of naturalistic images and show that our models outperform previous
approaches based on visual information.

provide strong evidence that passing all tests implies that our experiments are

highly sparse subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that can be trained in
isolation to match full accuracy. Despite many exciting efforts being made,
there is one ""commonsense"" rarely challenged: a winning ticket is found by
iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) and hence the resultant pruned subnetworks
have only unstructured sparsity. That gap limits the appeal of winning tickets
in practice, since the highly irregular sparse patterns are challenging to
accelerate on hardware. Meanwhile, directly substituting structured pruning for
unstructured pruning in IMP damages performance more severely and is usually
unable to locate winning tickets. In this paper, we demonstrate the first
positive result that a structurally sparse winning ticket can be effectively
found in general. The core idea is to append ""post-processing techniques"" after
each round of (unstructured) IMP, to enforce the formation of structural
sparsity. Specifically, we first ""re-fill"" pruned elements back in some
channels deemed to be important, and then ""re-group"" non-zero elements to
create flexible group-wise structural patterns. Both our identified channel-
and group-wise structural subnetworks win the lottery, with substantial
inference speedups readily supported by existing hardware. Extensive
experiments, conducted on diverse datasets across multiple network backbones,
consistently validate our proposal, showing that the hardware acceleration
roadblock of LTH is now removed. Specifically, the structural winning tickets
obtain up to {64.93%, 64.84%, 60.23%} running time savings at {36%~80%, 74%,

rods initially increases with distance from the value for a single rod before
plateauing to twice the value. However, the drag acting on the two rods is
remarkably different, with the leading rod experiencing roughly similar drag
compared to a solitary rod, while the following rod experiences far less drag.
The anomalous relationship of drag and the distance between the leading and
following body is observed in both dry granular beds and while immersed in
viscous Newtonian fluids across the quasi-static and the rate-dependent
regimes. Through refractive index matching, we visualize the sediment flow past
the two rods and show that a stagnant region develops in their reference frame
between the rods for small separations. Thus, the following rod is increasingly
shielded from the granular flow with decreasing separation distance, leading to
a lower net drag. Care should be exercised in applying resistive force theory
to multi-component objects moving in granular sediments based on our result

interest in novel electron devices for military and civilian use has led to a

extended in-service longevity). Sc-containing ""scandate"" cathodes have been
widely reported to exhibit superior emission properties compared to
previous-generation thermionic cathodes, including oxide, B-, and M-type

which the addition of Sc enhances cathode emission remains ambiguous, and
certain limitations -- non-uniform emission, low reproducibility, inconsistent
longevity -- continue to prevent widespread commercial integration of scandate
cathodes into electron devices. This review attempts to survey the literature
to-date addressing the fabrication, structure, and properties of scandate
cathodes, with particular attention to studies addressing the role of Sc in

endpoints of the edges of $M$ satisfies property $\mathscr{P}$. As examples,
for appropriate choices of $\mathscr{P}$, the problems Induced Matching,
Uniquely Restricted Matching, Connected Matching and Disconnected Matching
arise. For many of these problems, finding a maximum $\mathscr{P}$-matching is
a knowingly NP-Hard problem, with few exceptions, such as connected matchings,
which has the same time complexity as usual Maximum Matching problem. The
weighted variant of Maximum Matching has been studied for decades, with many
applications, including the well-known Assignment problem. Motivated by this
fact, in addition to some recent researches in weighted versions of acyclic and
induced matchings, we study the Maximum Weight Connected Matching. In this
problem, we want to find a matching $M$ such that the endpoint vertices of its
edges induce a connected subgraph and the sum of the edge weights of $M$ is
maximum. Unlike the unweighted Connected Matching problem, which is in P for
general graphs, we show that Maximum Weight Connected Matching is NP-Hard even
for bounded diameter bipartite graphs, starlike graphs, planar bipartite, and
bounded degree planar graphs, while solvable in linear time for trees and
subcubic graphs. When we restrict edge weights to be non negative only, we show
that the problem turns to be polynomially solvable for chordal graphs, while it
remains NP-Hard for most of the cases when weights can be negative. Our final
contributions are on parameterized complexity. On the positive side, we present
a single exponential time algorithm when parameterized by treewidth. In terms
of kernelization, we show that, even when restricted to binary weights,
Weighted Connected Matching does not admit a polynomial kernel when
parameterized by vertex cover under standard complexity-theoretical hypotheses.

atmosphere that may be confined to the permanent dayside of the planet. The
launch of JWST will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage
to characterise these worlds. In this paper, we assess the observability of
characterisable spectral features by self-consistently modelling silicate
atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having sufficient
substellar temperatures (> 1500 K). To achieve this we use outgassed
equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer methods to compute
temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical compositions and emission
spectra. We explore varying melt compositions, free of highly-volatile
elements, accounting for possible atmospheric evolution. Our models include a
large number of neutral and ionic species, as well as all up-to-date opacities.
The results indicate that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are the best, unique
identifiers of silicate atmospheres, detectable using MIRI instrument of JWST.
Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong constraints
on atmospheric thermal structure and possibly the composition of the melt. We
also propose that certain species, e.g., TiO, may be directly tied to different
classes of melts, possibly revealing surface and interior dynamics. Currently,
there are nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation of

of a modified force-free current sheet, with periodic boundary conditions in
all directions. In all cases, the linear and non-linear evolution led to a
primary current sheet between two large flux ropes. The global reconnection
rate during this later stage was analyzed in all simulations. It was found that
in 2.5D the primary current sheet fragmented due to plasmoids, and as expected,
the global reconnection rate, calculated using multiple methods, increases with
the strength of the reconnecting field due to a stronger Alfv\'{e}n speed. In
3D, the presence of interacting oblique modes of the tearing instability
complicates the simple 2.5D picture, entangling the magnetic field of the
inflow and introducing a negative effect on the reconnection rate. The two
competing effects of stronger Alfv\'{e}n speed and entangling, which both
increase with the strength of the reconnecting field, resulted in a decrease in
the reconnection rate with increasing reconnecting field. For all simulations,
the 3D rates were less than in 2.5D, but suggest that as one goes to weak

of limited use in this ""in-development"" use case, since they require a
test-suite to be available as a patching oracle. Thus, developers typically
tend to manually resolve their in-development REs, often by referring to
technical forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). To automate this manual process
we extend our previous work, MAESTRO, to provide real-time assistance to
developers for repairing Java REs by recommending a relevant patch-suggesting
SO post and synthesizing a repair patch from this post to fix the RE in the
developer's code. MAESTRO exploits a library of Runtime Exception Patterns
(REPs) semi-automatically mined from SO posts, through a relatively
inexpensive, one-time, incremental process. An REP is an abstracted sequence of
statements that triggers a given RE. REPs are used to index SO posts, retrieve
a post most relevant to the RE instance exhibited by a developer's code and
then mediate the process of extracting a concrete repair from the SO post,
abstracting out post-specific details, and concretizing the repair to the
developer's buggy code. We evaluate MAESTRO on a published RE benchmark
comprised of 78 instances. MAESTRO is able to generate a correct repair patch
at the top position in 27% of the cases, within the top-3 in 40% of the cases
and overall return a useful artifact in 81% of the cases. Further, the use of
REPs proves instrumental to all aspects of MAESTRO's performance, from ranking

particular, 45% of correct patches generated by MAESTRO could not be produced

relation between the depletions of different elements do not strongly vary
between the three galaxies, implying that abundance ratios should trace
depletions accurately down to 20% solar metallicity. From the depletions, we
derive D/G and D/M. The D/G increases with density, consistent with the more
efficient accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains in the denser ISM. For
log N(H) > 21 cm^-2, the depletion of metallicity tracers (S, Zn) exceeds -0.5
dex, even at 20% solar metallicity. The gas fraction of metals increases from

exploding aspherical stars as ""ellipsars"" in reference to the elliptical shape
of the iso-density contours of their progenitors in the two-dimensional

reduce translation quality at inference time. To bridge the gap between the

Supervised Hybrid Audio Segmentation (SHAS), a method that can effectively
learn the optimal segmentation from any manually segmented speech corpus.
First, we train a classifier to identify the included frames in a segmentation,
using speech representations from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0. The optimal
splitting points are then found by a probabilistic Divide-and-Conquer algorithm
that progressively splits at the frame of lowest probability until all segments
are below a pre-specified length. Experiments on MuST-C and mTEDx show that the
translation of the segments produced by our method approaches the quality of
the manual segmentation on 5 language pairs. Namely, SHAS retains 95-98% of the
manual segmentation's BLEU score, compared to the 87-93% of the best existing
methods. Our method is additionally generalizable to different domains and
achieves high zero-shot performance in unseen languages.

We have utilized both highly-controlled, broadband vibroseis shaker trucks and
more-variable, narrow-band sledgehammer sources to excite the near surface, and
compare the DAS-derived dispersion data obtained from both source types
directly with concurrently acquired traditional geophone-derived dispersion
data. We find that the differences between the two sensing approaches are
minimal and well within the dispersion uncertainty bounds associated with each
individual measurement type when the following conditions are met for DAS: (a)
a tight-buffered or strain-sensing fiber-optic cable is used, (b) the cable is
buried in a shallow trench to enhance coupling, and (c) short gauge lengths and
small channel separations are used. We also show that frequency-dependent
normalization of the dispersion image following MASW processing removes the
effects of scaling, integration, and differentiation on the measured waveforms,
thereby allowing nearly identical dispersion data to be extracted from geophone
waveforms and DAS waveforms without requiring them to first be converted into
equivalent units. We demonstrate that the short wavelength DAS dispersion
measurements are limited by both the gauge length and the more commonly
considered channel separation. We further show that it is possible to extract
essentially equivalent surface wave dispersion data from seismic measurements
made using a traditional geophone array or two different DAS cables. Finally,
we show that shear wave velocity profiles recovered from the DAS data using an
uncertainty-consistent, multi-mode inversion agree favorably with cone
penetration tests performed at the site.

end of the hard to soft transition of this outburst, Insight-HXMT found that
the source rapidly alternated between low flux and high flux states on a
timescale of hours. Two high flux states lasted only for a period comparable to
the orbital period of the observatory. Time-resolved spectral analysis shows
that the sudden changes of flux are confined in the hard X-ray band (>4 keV).
The variable non-thermal emission, including the power-law continuum from the
corona and the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk, is responsible
for the observed variability. The strength of disk thermal emission and the
inner radius of the accretion disk are consistent between the two flux states.
Assuming the lamppost geometry, our best-fit disk reflection models suggest a
very low corona height (within 3 $R_{\rm g}$) and there is no evidence of
significant variation in the corona geometry either. The observed rapidly
alternating flux states suggest that the intrinsic power of the corona must
change during the state transition. We discuss possible mechanisms for the
observed sudden changes in the coronal power of GX 339-4.

a serious objectness-related adversarial vulnerability in YOLO detectors and
present an effective attack strategy targeting the objectness aspect of visual
detection in autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, to address such vulnerability,
we propose a new objectness-aware adversarial training approach for visual

aspect is 45.17% and 43.50% more effective than those generated from
classification and/or localization losses on the KITTI and COCO traffic

improve the detectors' robustness against objectness-oriented attacks by up to
21% and 12% mAP on KITTI and COCO traffic, respectively.

heterogeneous individuals, each either cooperates or defects, and earns payoffs

cooperators in the population. Over a discrete sequence of time, the
individuals revise their choices asynchronously based on the best-response or

revealing that the photoinduced CDW is similar to phenomena shown under

standard Stackelberg game, called a discrete-time dynamic Stackelberg game,
that has an underlying state space that affects the leader's rewards and
available strategies and evolves in a Markovian manner depending on both the
leader and follower's selected strategies. Although standard Stackelberg games
have been utilized to improve scheduling in security domains, their deployment
is often limited by requiring complete information of the follower's utility
function. In contrast, we consider scenarios where the follower's utility
function is unknown to the leader; however, it can be linearly parameterized.
Our objective then is to provide an algorithm that prescribes a randomized
strategy to the leader at each step of the game based on observations of how
the follower responded in previous steps. We design a no-regret learning
algorithm that, with high probability, achieves a regret bound (when compared
to the best policy in hindsight) which is sublinear in the number of time

on the inference accuracy of HDC. Our modeling is based on 14nm FinFET
technology fully calibrated with Intel measurement data. We accurately model,
for the first time, the voltage-dependent error probability in SRAM-based and
FeFET-based in-memory computing. Thanks to HDC's resiliency against errors, the
complexity of the underlying hardware can be reduced, providing large energy
savings of up to 6x. Experimental results for SRAM reveal that
variability-induced errors have a probability of up to 39 percent. Despite such
a high error probability, the inference accuracy is only marginally impacted.
This opens doors to explore new tradeoffs. We also demonstrate that the
resiliency against errors is application-dependent. In addition, we investigate
the robustness of HDC against errors when the underlying in-memory hardware is
realized using emerging non-volatile FeFET devices instead of mature CMOS-based
SRAMs. We demonstrate that inference accuracy does remain high despite the
larger error probability, while large area and power savings can be obtained.
All in all, HW/SW co-design is the key for efficient yet reliable in-memory
hyperdimensional computing for both conventional CMOS technology and upcoming
emerging technologies.

(DRSs) with low ambiguity function for delay over the entire signal duration

task. However, in practice, the Doppler frequency range is normally much
smaller than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, and it is relatively easy
to attain quasi-synchronization for delays far less than the entire signal
duration. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new concept called low
ambiguity zone (LAZ) which is a small area of the corresponding ambiguity
function of interest defined by the certain Doppler frequency and delay. Such
an LAZ will reduce to a zero ambiguity zone (ZAZ) if the maximum ambiguity
values of interest are zero. In this paper, we derive a set of theoretical
bounds on periodic LAZ/ZAZ of unimodular DRSs with and without spectral
constraints, which include the existing bounds on periodic global ambiguity
function as special cases. These bounds may be used as theoretical design
guidelines to measure the optimality of sequences against Doppler effect. We
then introduce four optimal constructions of DRSs with respect to the derived

Gennes equations of a model Hamiltonian built on the honeycomb lattice with the
Ising spin-orbital coupling pertinent to the transition metal dichalcogenides,
we numerically investigate the local breaking of the spin and sublattice
degeneracies in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. It is revealed
that the ferromagnetic orders are induced inside the vortex core region by the
Ising spin-orbital coupling. The induced magnetic orders are antiphase in terms
of their opposite polarizations inside the two nearest-neighbor vortices with
one of the two polarizations coming dominantly from one sublattice sites,
implying the local breaking of the spin and sublattice degeneracies. The
finite-energy peaks of the local-density-of-states for spin-up and spin-down

coupling, and the relative shifts of them on sublattices $A$ and $B$ are also

multiple secondary sources and microphones. A method based on the kernel
interpolation of a sound field makes it possible to attenuate noise over the
target region with flexible array geometry. Furthermore, by using the kernel
function with directional weighting, prior information on primary noise source
directions can be taken into consideration. However, whereas the sound field to
be interpolated is a superposition of primary and secondary sound fields, the
directional weight for the primary noise source was applied to the total sound
field in previous work; therefore, the performance improvement was limited. We
propose a method of individually interpolating the primary and secondary sound
fields and formulate a normalized least-mean-square algorithm based on this
interpolation method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method
outperforms the method based on total kernel interpolation.

chirality and life on earth is a break of symmetry to be compared with the
breaks of symmetry in the evolution of the universe. Based on a perspective of
asymmetry transfer, the chirality at molecular level might stem from electron
spin at subatomic level. Accordingly, in this paper a spin-induced chiral
selectivity (SICS) mechanism and its outreach are introduced and discussed. The
stress force or spin torque derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED) might be
the driving force for the transfer of asymmetry and the formation of molecular
chirality. Some recent experimental results seem to support the SICS
conjecture. If spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) did cause life to become
chirally selective, a magnetic half-metal material such as greigite (Fe3S4), a
mineral present in a primordial site where life could have emerged, might act
as a spin filter to produce SPEs, which then induced the asymmetric synthesis
of chiral molecules via the SICS mechanism. All these tentative thoughts may
help explain how homochirality and life could have arisen on the early Earth.

transfer related issues remains limited. This article explores how NGOs and

using an exploratory research strategy. It asks What are institutional
constraints and opportunities faced by humanitarian emergency responders in
ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer and how humanitarian actors
address such institutional conditions. We introduced a new conceptual
framework, namely humanitarian and disaster management ecosystem for cash
transfer. This framework allows non-governmental actors to restore complex
relations between the state, disaster survivors or citizen, local market
economy and civil society. Mixed methods and multistage research strategy were

that implementing cash transfers in the context of post tsunamigenic
earthquakes and liquefaction hazards, NGOs must co-create an ecosystem of
response that not only aimed at restoring peoples access to cash and basic

labels generally train a classification network to generate the Class
Activation Maps (CAMs) as the initial coarse segmentation labels. However,
current WSSS methods still perform far from satisfactorily because their
adopted CAMs 1) typically focus on partial discriminative object regions and 2)
usually contain useless background regions. These two problems are attributed
to the sole image-level supervision and aggregation of global information when
training the classification networks. In this work, we propose the visual words
learning module and hybrid pooling approach, and incorporate them in the
classification network to mitigate the above problems. In the visual words
learning module, we counter the first problem by enforcing the classification
network to learn fine-grained visual word labels so that more object extents
could be discovered. Specifically, the visual words are learned with a
codebook, which could be updated via two proposed strategies, i.e.
learning-based strategy and memory-bank strategy. The second drawback of CAMs
is alleviated with the proposed hybrid pooling, which incorporates the global
average and local discriminative information to simultaneously ensure object
completeness and reduce background regions. We evaluated our methods on PASCAL
VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. Without any extra saliency prior, our
method achieved 70.6% and 70.7% mIoU on the $val$ and $test$ set of PASCAL VOC

high spatial frequency detector pixel-to-pixel quantum efficiency variations,
2) medium spatial frequency ""measles"" caused by particle deposition on the

expected due to atmospheric loss from sputtering and photochemical processes is
greater than measurements. A massive, multi-bar early CO2-dominated atmosphere
and recent volcanic outgassing have been proposed to explain this discrepancy,
and many previous models have assumed atmospheric nitrogen rapidly reached a
steady state where loss to space balanced volcanic outgassing. Here we show
using time-dependent models that the abundance and isotopic composition of
nitrogen in the Martian atmosphere can be explained by a family of evolutionary
scenarios in which the initial partial pressure of nitrogen is sufficiently
high that a steady state is not reached and nitrogen levels gradually decline
to present-day values over 4 billion years. Our solutions do not require a
multi-bar early CO2 atmosphere and are consistent with volcanic outgassing
indicated by both geologic mapping and the atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar ratio. Monte
Carlo simulations that include these scenarios estimate that the partial
pressure of N2 was 60 - 740 mbar (90% confidence, with a median value of 310
mbar) at 3.8 billion years ago when the valley networks formed. We suggest that
such a high nitrogen partial pressure could have contributed substantially to
warming on early Mars.

Building on the recent advantages of flow-based molecular generation models, we
propose SiamFlow, which forces the flow to fit the distribution of target

and a uniform loss to bring target sequence embeddings and drug graph
embeddings into agreements while avoiding collapse. Furthermore, we formulate
the alignment into a one-to-many problem by learning spaces of target sequence

the beginnings of trajectories; dominance of Earth's gravity forbids the

not only obtain steady-state orbits, but also use the additional parameters
such as speed to tune the orbits towards relativistic dynamics. Our mapping
demonstrates how activity mixes space and time in a metric, shows how active
particles do not necessarily follow geodesics in the real space but instead
follow geodesics in a fiducial spacetime. The mapping further reveals how

calibration techniques are applied to each partition to improve AUC. While the
theoretical optimality of this framework holds for any model, we focus on deep

geographically correlated, with adopters largely residing within the boundaries
of relatively few well-studied, socially significant areas. These cultural
regions are often hypothesized to be the result of either (i) identity
performance driving the adoption of cultural innovation, or (ii) homophily in
the networks underlying diffusion. In this study, we show that demographic
identity and network topology are both required to model the diffusion of
innovation, as they play complementary roles in producing its spatial
properties. We develop an agent-based model of cultural adoption, and validate
geographic patterns of transmission in our model against a novel dataset of
innovative words that we identify from a 10% sample of Twitter. Using our
model, we are able to directly compare a combined network + identity model of
diffusion to simulated network-only and identity-only counterfactuals --
allowing us to test the separate and combined roles of network and identity.
While social scientists often treat either network or identity as the core
social structure in modeling culture change, we show that key geographic
properties of diffusion actually depend on both factors as each one influences
different mechanisms of diffusion. Specifically, the network principally drives
spread among urban counties via weak-tie diffusion, while identity plays a
disproportionate role in transmission among rural counties via strong-tie
diffusion. Diffusion between urban and rural areas, a key component in
innovation diffusing nationally, requires both network and identity. Our work
suggests that models must integrate both factors in order to understand and
reproduce the adoption of innovation.

simultaneously be tagged by both ""recommended"" (i.e., reviewer is happy and

based mean-field theory taking into account ion size as well as pH-dependence
of charged polyelectrolyte layer grafted on a rigid surface in an electrolyte.
The influence of ion size on properties in a soft nanochannel is evaluated by
numerically calculating ion number densities and electrostatic potential. We
demonstrate that unlike in point-like ions, for finite sizes of ions, a uniform
distribution of chargeable sites within the polyelectrolyte layer causes
unphysical discontinuities in ion number densities not only for hydrogen ion
but also for other kinds of ions. It is shown that the same cubic spatial
distribution of chargeable sites as for point-like ions is necessary to ensure
continuity of ion number density and zero ion transport at the polyelectrolyte
layer - rigid solid interface. We find that considering finite ion size causes
an increase in electrostatic potential and electroosmotic velocity and a
decrease in ion number densities. More importantly, we demonstrate that in
polyelectrolyte layer, pH-dependence of polyelectrolyte charge density makes

external fields strongly depends on the equilibrium electric double layer that
surrounds the colloidal particles in the suspension. The theoretical models for
salt-free suspensions can be improved by incorporating non-uniform size effects
and orientational ordering of water dipoles neglected in previous mean-field
approaches, which are based on the Poisson-Boltzmann approach. Our model
including non-uniform size effects and orientational ordering of water dipoles
seems to have quite a promising effect because the model can predict the
phenomena like a heavy decrease in relative permittivity of the suspension and
counterion stratification near highly charged colloidal particle. In this work
we numerically obtain the electric potential, the counterions concentration and
the relative permittivity around a charged particle in a concentrated salt-free
suspension corrected by non-uniform size effects and orientational ordering of
water dipoles. The results show the worth of such corrections for medium to
high particle charges at every particle volume fraction. We conclude that
non-uniform size effects and orientational ordering of water dipoles are
necessary for the development of new theoretical models to study
non-equilibrium properties in concentrated colloidal suspensions.

decentralized users, each with a local dataset. Compared to traditional
centralized learning, FL does not require direct access to local datasets and
thus aims to mitigate data privacy concerns. However, data privacy leakage in
FL still exists due to inference attacks, including membership inference,
property inference, and data inversion. In this work, we propose a new type of
privacy inference attack, coined Preference Profiling Attack (PPA), that
accurately profiles the private preferences of a local user, e.g., most liked
(disliked) items from the client's online shopping and most common expressions
from the user's selfies. In general, PPA can profile top-k (i.e., k = 1, 2, 3
and k = 1 in particular) preferences contingent on the local client (user)'s
characteristics. Our key insight is that the gradient variation of a local
user's model has a distinguishable sensitivity to the sample proportion of a
given class, especially the majority (minority) class. By observing a user
model's gradient sensitivity to a class, PPA can profile the sample proportion
of the class in the user's local dataset, and thus the user's preference of the
class is exposed. The inherent statistical heterogeneity of FL further
facilitates PPA. We have extensively evaluated the PPA's effectiveness using
four datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, RAF-DB and Products-10K). Our results show that
PPA achieves 90% and 98% top-1 attack accuracy to the MNIST and CIFAR10,
respectively. More importantly, in real-world commercial scenarios of shopping
(i.e., Products-10K) and social network (i.e., RAF-DB), PPA gains a top-1
attack accuracy of 78% in the former case to infer the most ordered items

general expressions for the spatial distribution functions of solvents and

of the two solvents from the charged surface and a behavior of decreased

key factor for the depletion is the ratio of the solvent dipole moment to the

optimization, it is important to produce a set of uniformly distributed

black-box biobjective optimization, one can evaluate distances between
solutions with the ordering property of the Pareto front. These distances allow
to be able to evaluate distribution of all solution points, so it is not
difficult to maintain uniformity of solutions distribution. However, problems
with more than two objectives do not have ordering property, so it is noted
that these problems require other techniques to measure the coverage and
maintain uniformity of solutions distribution. In this paper, we propose an

explore area around this point. This ensures uniformity of solutions

human motion segmentation and other related tasks. However, existing
segmentation methods often cluster data without guidance from prior knowledge,
resulting in unsatisfactory segmentation results. To this end, we propose a
novel Consistency and Diversity induced human Motion Segmentation (CDMS)
algorithm. Specifically, our model factorizes the source and target data into
distinct multi-layer feature spaces, in which transfer subspace learning is
conducted on different layers to capture multi-level information. A
multi-mutual consistency learning strategy is carried out to reduce the domain
gap between the source and target data. In this way, the domain-specific
knowledge and domain-invariant properties can be explored simultaneously.
Besides, a novel constraint based on the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) is introduced to ensure the diversity of multi-level subspace
representations, which enables the complementarity of multi-level
representations to be explored to boost the transfer learning performance.
Moreover, to preserve the temporal correlations, an enhanced graph regularizer
is imposed on the learned representation coefficients and the multi-level
representations of the source data. The proposed model can be efficiently
solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.
Extensive experimental results on public human motion datasets demonstrate the

ratios involving slow (s) neutron-capture and $\alpha$ elements (called
chemical-clocks) has been used to provide estimates of stellar ages, usually in
a limited volume close to the Sun. We aim to analyse the relations of chemical
clocks in the Galactic disc extending the range to R$_{\rm GC}\sim$6-20~kpc.
Using the sixth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, we calibrated
several relations between stellar ages and abundance ratios [s/$\alpha$] using
a sample of open clusters, the largest one so far used with this aim. Thanks to
their wide galactocentric coverage, we investigated the radial variations of
the shape of these relations, confirming their non-universality. We estimated
our accuracy and precision in recovering the global ages of open clusters, and
the ages of their individual members. We applied the multi-variate relations
with the highest correlation coefficients to the field star population. We
confirm that there is no single age-chemical clock relationship valid for the
whole disc, but that there is a dependence on the galactocentric position,
which is related to the radial variation of the star formation history combined
with the non-monotonic dependence on metallicity of the yields of the s-process
elements from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Finally, the abundance ratios
[Ba/$\alpha$] are more sensitive to age than those with [Y/$\alpha$] for young
disc stars, and their slopes vary less with galactocentric distance.

the joint observations of GW170817/GRB 170817A, which gives an upper limit to
the $\text{AdS}_{6}^{~}$ radius as $\ell^{2}_{~} \lesssim
3.84\,\text{Mpc}^{2}_{~}$. For a high-redshift source, the time delay is
converted into the discrepancy between the source redshift derived from the GW

reasonable observation time, it requires a stronger constraint on the

neglect the small spin-orbit coupling show a Dirac point, i.e. a band crossing

  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","37 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Value function decomposition is becoming a popular rule of thumb for scaling
up multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative games. For such a
decomposition rule to hold, the assumption of the individual-global max (IGM)
principle must be made; that is, the local maxima on the decomposed value
function per every agent must amount to the global maximum on the joint value
function. This principle, however, does not have to hold in general. As a
result, the applicability of value decomposition algorithms is concealed and
their corresponding convergence properties remain unknown. In this paper, we
make the first effort to answer these questions. Specifically, we introduce the
set of cooperative games in which the value decomposition methods find their
validity, which is referred as decomposable games. In decomposable games, we
theoretically prove that applying the multi-agent fitted Q-Iteration algorithm
(MA-FQI) will lead to an optimal Q-function. In non-decomposable games, the
estimated Q-function by MA-FQI can still converge to the optimum under the
circumstance that the Q-function needs projecting into the decomposable
function space at each iteration. In both settings, we consider value function
representations by practical deep neural networks and derive their
corresponding convergence rates. To summarize, our results, for the first time,
offer theoretical insights for MARL practitioners in terms of when value
decomposition algorithms converge and why they perform well.

non-minimal coupling results in the growth of the spectator field which, in
turn, drives the second stage of inflation in a significant region of parameter

source adiabatic ones, and hence the spectator non-minimal coupling can modify
the inflationary predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar

the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). We obtain
analytically the correlation kernel, density, particle current, and energy

re-identification attack and tested it against their 2010 data release. The
specific attack executed by the Bureau allows an attacker to infer the race and
ethnicity of respondents with average 75% precision for 85% of the respondents,
assuming that the attacker knows the correct age, sex, and address of the
respondents. They interpreted the attack as exceeding the Bureau's privacy
standards, and so introduced stronger privacy protections for the 2020 Census
in the form of the TopDown Algorithm (TDA). This paper demonstrates that race
and ethnicity can be inferred from the TDA-protected census data with
substantially better precision and recall, using less prior knowledge: only the
respondents' address. Race and ethnicity can be inferred with average 75%
precision for 98% of the respondents, and can be inferred with 100% precision
for 11% of the respondents. The inference is done by simply assuming that the
race/ethnicity of the respondent is that of the majority race/ethnicity for the
respondent's census block. The conclusion to draw from this simple
demonstration is NOT that the Bureau's data releases lack adequate privacy
protections. Indeed it is the purpose of the data releases to allow this kind
of inference. The problem, rather, is that the Bureau's criteria for measuring

enhance STAP performance under the limited training samples, this paper
develops a STAP theory with random matrix theory (RMT). By minimizing the
output clutter-plus-noise power, the estimate of the inversion of clutter plus

its eigenvalues, and thus producing the optimal STAP weight vector. Two STAP

of the energy dependence of the QPO and the broad noise continuum. The
fractional r.m.s increases with energy, and its shape is similar for both the
QPO and the continuum noise, suggesting a common radiative origin. However,
while the QPO exhibits hard time lags, with the high energy photons lagging the
low ones by a few milliseconds, the continuum noise shows the opposite
behavior. The photon spectrum from SXT and LAXPC in $0.7-30$ keV band comprises
the soft component from a disc and a hard Comptonized component from a hot

predominant approaches for the enhancement of the noise corrupted speech. The
performance of these estimators are usually significantly improved when any
perceptually relevant cost function is considered. On the other hand, the
recent progress in the phase-based speech signal processing have shown that the
phase-only enhancement based on spectral phase estimation methods can also
provide joint improvement in the perceived speech quality and intelligibility,
even in low SNR conditions. In this paper, to take advantage of both the
perceptually motivated cost function involving STSAs of estimated and true
clean speech and utilizing the prior spectral phase information, we have
derived a phase-aware Bayesian STSA estimator. The parameters of the cost
function are chosen based on the characteristics of the human auditory system,
namely, the dynamic compressive nonlinearity of the cochlea, the perceived
loudness theory and the simultaneous masking properties of the ear. This type
of parameter selection scheme results in more noise reduction while limiting
the speech distortion. The derived STSA estimator is optimal in the MMSE sense
if the prior phase information is available. In practice, however, typically
only an estimate of the clean speech phase can be obtained via employing
different types of spectral phase estimation techniques which have been
developed throughout the last few years. In a blind setup, we have evaluated
the proposed Bayesian STSA estimator with different types of standard phase
estimation methods available in the literature. Experimental results have shown
that the proposed estimator can achieve substantial improvement in performance

analytical units and extracts historical roads by inferring their existence in
historical map series based on image processing and clustering techniques. We

distributed quantum information. For photons, this typically involves Bell
state measurements based on two-photon interference effects. In this context,
hybrid systems that combine high rate, ultra-stable and pure quantum sources
with long-lived quantum memories are particularly interesting. Here, we develop
a theoretical description of pulsed two-photon interference of photons from
dissimilar sources to predict the outcomes of second-order cross-correlation
measurements. These are directly related to, and hence used to quantify, photon
indistinguishability. We study their dependence on critical system parameters
such as quantum state lifetime and frequency detuning, and quantify the impact
of emission time jitter, pure dephasing and spectral wandering. Our results
show that for fixed lifetime of emitter one, for each frequency detuning there
is an optimal lifetime of emitter two that leads to highest photon
indistinguishability. Expectations for different hybrid combinations involving
III-V quantum dots, color centers in diamond, 2D materials and atoms are
quantitatively compared for real-world system parameters. Our work both
provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of dissimilar emitters and
enables assessment of which imperfections can be tolerated in hybrid photonic
quantum networks.

framework, which effectively leverages both semantic features and structural
information in the existing taxonomy and offers a better representation of
candidate position to boost the performance of taxonomy completion.
Specifically, TaxoEnrich consists of four components: (1)
taxonomy-contextualized embedding which incorporates both semantic meanings of
concept and taxonomic relations based on powerful pretrained language models;
(2) a taxonomy-aware sequential encoder which learns candidate position
representations by encoding the structural information of taxonomy; (3) a
query-aware sibling encoder which adaptively aggregates candidate siblings to
augment candidate position representations based on their importance to the
query-position matching; (4) a query-position matching model which extends

CDR models can improve the recommendation performance of a target domain by
leveraging the data of other source domains. However, most existing CDR models
assume information can directly 'transfer across the bridge', ignoring the
privacy issues. To solve the privacy concern in CDR, in this paper, we propose
a novel two stage based privacy-preserving CDR framework (PriCDR). In the first
stage, we propose two methods, i.e., Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (JLT)
based and Sparse-awareJLT (SJLT) based, to publish the rating matrix of the
source domain using differential privacy. We theoretically analyze the privacy
and utility of our proposed differential privacy based rating publishing
methods. In the second stage, we propose a novel heterogeneous CDR model
(HeteroCDR), which uses deep auto-encoder and deep neural network to model the
published source rating matrix and target rating matrix respectively. To this
end, PriCDR can not only protect the data privacy of the source domain, but
also alleviate the data sparsity of the source domain. We conduct experiments
on two benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed PriCDR and HeteroCDR.

nonnormalizable, coherent superpositions of kinks at all spatial positions and
are simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and the momentum operator. The
latter are localized about a single, moving classical solution. To understand
the wave packets, we calculate several simple matrix elements.

the presence of resetting. In the limit $p\to 0$, we compute the exact

improving existing Fr\'echet regression methods. Based on the theory of

requires no stress data but only full-field displacement and global force data;
it delivers interpretable models, i.e., models that are embodied by
parsimonious mathematical expressions discovered through sparse regression of a
potentially large catalogue of candidate functions; it is one-shot, i.e.,
discovery only needs one experiment. The material model library is constructed
by expanding the yield function with a Fourier series, whereas isotropic and
kinematic hardening are introduced by assuming a yield function dependency on
internal history variables that evolve with the plastic deformation. For
selecting the most relevant Fourier modes and identifying the hardening
behavior, EUCLID employs physics knowledge, i.e., the optimization problem that
governs the discovery enforces the equilibrium constraints in the bulk and at
the loaded boundary of the domain. Sparsity promoting regularization is
deployed to generate a set of solutions out of which a solution with low cost
and high parsimony is automatically selected. Through virtual experiments, we
demonstrate the ability of EUCLID to accurately discover several plastic yield
surfaces and hardening mechanisms of different complexity.

for the three categories of populations, say, susceptible, infected and

statement of the conjecture presupposes a precise definition of the class of
quiescent solutions as well as a proof of existence and uniqueness of
developments corresponding to initial data on a big bang singularity. We
provide one definition of quiescence here. We also appeal to existing results
in order to illustrate that, in certain cases, there are unique developments
corresponding to initial data on the singularity. However, our perspective
leads to a large class of open problems corresponding to the general
conjecture. An additional benefit of the notion of initial data developed here
is that it can be used to give a unified perspective on the existing results
concerning quiescent singularities. In fact, we provide several examples of how
existing results can be considered to be special cases of the framework
developed here. A second, potential, application is to oscillatory and
spatially inhomogeneous big bang singularities. Considering the existing
arguments in the spatially homogeneous setting, a crucial first step in the
study of oscillatory behaviour is to understand how solutions approach the
Kasner circle along a stable manifold, and then depart via an unstable
manifold. In order to carry out a similar analysis in the spatially

manifold. Building on the work of Fournodavlos and Luk, we here propose such an

due to two main aspects, i.e, there are only positive user-item ratings on the
target domain and there is no overlapped user across different domains. Most
previous CDR approaches cannot solve the RNCDR problem well, since (1) they
cannot effectively combine review with other information (e.g., ID or ratings)
to obtain expressive user or item embedding, (2) they cannot reduce the domain
discrepancy on users and items. To fill this gap, we propose Collaborative
Filtering with Attribution Alignment model (CFAA), a cross-domain
recommendation framework for the RNCDR problem. CFAA includes two main modules,
i.e., rating prediction module and embedding attribution alignment module. The
former aims to jointly mine review, one-hot ID, and multi-hot historical
ratings to generate expressive user and item embeddings. The later includes
vertical attribution alignment and horizontal attribution alignment, tending to
reduce the discrepancy based on multiple perspectives. Our empirical study on
Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrates that CFAA significantly outperforms the

neural networks continues to be a challenge, in particular for networks with
trained and thus non-random weights. To address this issue, we study the
mapping between probability distributions implemented by a deep feed-forward
network. We characterize this mapping as an iterated transformation of
distributions, where the non-linearity in each layer transfers information
between different orders of correlation functions. This allows us to identify
essential statistics in the data, as well as different information
representations that can be used by neural networks. Applied to an XOR task and
to MNIST, we show that correlations up to second order predominantly capture
the information processing in the internal layers, while the input layer also
extracts higher-order correlations from the data. This analysis provides a
quantitative and explainable perspective on classification.

Junction (FTJ) paves a futuristic possibility of utilizing the FTJ as a
bistable resistive device with an enormously high ON/OFF ratio. In the last 20
years, numerous studies have reported that the formation of multidomain in
ferroelectric material is an inevitable process to minimize the total system
energy. Recent studies based on phase-field simulations have demonstrated that
domain nucleation/motion substantially alters the electrostatics of a
ferroelectric material. However, the impact of domain dynamics on quantum
transport in FTJ remains elusive. This paper presents a comprehensive study of
multidomain dynamics in a ferroelectric tunnel junction. Analysis of this
article is twofold; firstly, we study the impact of domain dynamics on
electrostatics in an FTJ. Subsequently, the obtained electrostatics is used to
study the variations in tunneling current, and TER originated from multidomain
dynamics. We show that ON/OFF current density and TER vary locally in the
ferroelectric region. Furthermore, the device's electrostatics and quantum
transport exhibit an oscillatory nature due to periodic domain texture. ON/OFF
current density shows a sine/cosine distribution in ferroelectric, and
approximately one-decade local variation in current density is observed. These
local fluctuations in current density cause oscillations in the device's ON/OFF
ratio. Optimization techniques to achieve a uniform and maximum TER are also
discussed. A 2D analytical and explicit model is derived by solving coupled 2D
Poisson's equation and Landau-Ginzburg equation. The model incorporates the
switching and nucleation of domains by minimizing net ferroelectric energy
(depolarization+free+gradient energy density). Furthermore, the impact of the
bottom insulator layer on ferroelectric's gradient energy is also studied.

faster in some situations than in others. Real-time knowledge about the error
growth could enable strategies to adjust the modelling and forecasting
infrastructure on-the-fly to increase accuracy or reduce computation time. One
could, e.g., change the ensemble size, or the distribution and type of target
observations. Local Lyapunov exponents are known indicators of the rate at
which very small prediction errors grow over a finite time interval. However,
their computation is very expensive: it requires maintaining and evolving a
tangent linear model, orthogonalisation algorithms and storing large matrices.
  In this feasibility study, we investigate the accuracy of supervised machine
learning in estimating the current local Lyapunov exponents, from input of
current and recent time steps of the system trajectory, as an alternative to
the classical method. Thus machine learning is not used here to emulate a
physical model or some of its components, but non intrusively as a
complementary tool. We test four popular supervised learning algorithms:
regression trees, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks and
long short-term memory networks. Experiments are conducted on two
low-dimensional chaotic systems of ordinary differential equations, the
R\""ossler and the Lorenz 63 models. We find that on average the machine
learning algorithms predict the stable local Lyapunov exponent accurately, the
unstable exponent reasonably accurately, and the neutral exponent only somewhat
accurately. We show that greater prediction accuracy is associated with local
homogeneity of the local Lyapunov exponents on the system attractor.
Importantly, the situations in which (forecast) errors grow fastest are not

properties. A striking illustration of this idea is given by spheres and closed
manifolds: if a set $X$ is homeomorphic to a sphere or a closed manifold, then
any algorithm that semicomputes $X$ in some sense can be converted into an
algorithm that fully computes $X$. In other words, the topological properties
of $X$ enable one to derive full information about $X$ from partial information
about $X$. In that case, we say that $X$ has computable type. Those results
have been obtained by Miller, Iljazovi\'c, Su\v{s}i\'c and others in the recent
years. A similar notion of computable type was also defined for pairs $(X,A)$
in order to cover more spaces, such as compact manifolds with boundary and
finite graphs with endpoints.
  We investigate the higher dimensional analog of graphs, namely the pairs
$(X,A)$ where $X$ is a finite simplicial complex and $A$ is a subcomplex of
$X$. We give two topological characterizations of the pairs having computable
type. The first one uses a global property of the pair, that we call the
$\epsilon$-surjection property. The second one uses a local property of
neighborhoods of vertices, called the surjection property. We give a further
characterization for $2$-dimensional simplicial complexes, by identifying which
local neighborhoods have the surjection property.
  Using these characterizations, we give non-trivial applications to two famous
sets: we prove that the dunce hat does not have computable type whereas Bing's
house does. Important concepts from topology, such as absolute neighborhood
retracts and topological cones, play a key role in our proofs.

functionals on the quality of removal/addition energies obtained using the
Extended Koopmans' Theorem (EKT). Within reduced density matrix functional
theory (RDMFT) the EKT approach reduces to a matrix diagonalization, whose
ingredients are the one- and two-body reduced density matrices. A striking
feature of the EKT within RDMFT is that it opens a band gap, although too
large, in strongly correlated materials, which are a challenge for
state-of-the-art methods such as GW . Using the one-dimensional Hubbard model
and the homogeneous electron gas as test cases, we find that: i) with exact or
very accurate density matrices the EKT systematically overestimates the band
gap in the Hubbard model and the bandwidth in the homogeneous electron gas; ii)
with approximate density matrices, instead, the EKT can benefit from error
cancellation. In particular we test a new approximation which combines RPA
screening with the Power functional (PF) approximation to the two-body reduced
density matrix introduced by Sharma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 78, 201103(R) (2008)].
An important feature of this approximation is that it reduces the EKT band gap
in the studied models; it can hence be a promising approximation for correcting
the EKT band-gap overestimation in strongly correlated materials.

opportunities for individuals, software teams and software companies. As the

[Objective] The goal of this study is to gain insights on how their WFH
environment impacts software projects and software companies. We are also
interested in understanding if the impact differs between software startups and
established companies. [Method] We conducted a global-scale, cross-sectional
survey during spring and summer 2021. Our results are based on quantitative and
qualitative analysis of 297 valid responses. [Results] We observed a mixed
perception of the impact of WFH on software project management, resilience, and
innovation. Certain patterns on WFH, control and coordination mechanisms and
collaborative tools are observed globally. We find that team, agility and
leadership are the three most important factors for achieving resilience during
the pandemic. Although startups do not perceive the impact of WFH differently,
there is a difference between engineers who work in a small team context and
those who work in a large team context. [Conclusion] The result suggests a

damage and damage saturation to tumour control obtained with SBRT/SRS
treatments for early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases. Methods and Materials:
We have constructed a dataset of early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases
dose-response. These data were fitted to models based on the linear-quadratic
(LQ), the linear-quadratic-linear (LQL), and phenomenological modifications of
the LQ-model to account for indirect cell damage. We use the
Akaike-Information-Criterion formalism to compare performance, and studied the
stability of the results with changes in fitting parameters and perturbations
on dose/TCP values.
  Results: In NSCLC, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term increasing with dose
yields the best-fits for $\alpha$/$\beta$=10 Gy. Only the inclusion of very
fast accelerated proliferation or low $\alpha$/$\beta$ values can eliminate
such superiority. In brain, the LQL model yields the best-fits, and the ranking
is not affected by variations of fitting parameters or dose/TCP perturbations.
  Conclusions: For $\alpha$/$\beta$=10 Gy, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term
increasing with dose provides better fits to NSCLC dose-response curves. For
brain metastases, the LQL provides the best fit. This might be interpreted as a
hint of indirect damage in NSCLC, and damage saturation in brain metastases.
The results for NSCLC are strongly dependent on the value of $\alpha$/$\beta$
and may require further investigation, while those for brain seem to be clearly
significant. Our results can assist in the design of improved radiotherapy for
NSCLC and brain metastases, aiming at avoiding over/under-treatment.

number of predictors variables is very high. It is well-known that model
selection procedures like the Lasso or Boosting tend to overfit on real data.
The celebrated Stability Selection overcomes these weaknesses by aggregating
models, based on subsamples of the training data, followed by choosing a stable
predictor set which is usually much sparser than the predictor sets from the
raw models. The standard Stability Selection is based on a global criterion,
namely the per-family error rate, while additionally requiring expert knowledge
to suitably configure the hyperparameters. Since model selection depends on the
loss function, i.e., predictor sets selected w.r.t. some particular loss
function differ from those selected w.r.t. some other loss function, we propose
a Stability Selection variant which respects the chosen loss function via an
additional validation step based on out-of-sample validation data, optionally
enhanced with an exhaustive search strategy. Our Stability Selection variants
are widely applicable and user-friendly. Moreover, our Stability Selection
variants can avoid the issue of severe underfitting which affects the original
Stability Selection for noisy high-dimensional data, so our priority is not to
avoid false positives at all costs but to result in a sparse stable model with
which one can make predictions. Experiments where we consider both regression
and binary classification and where we use Boosting as model selection
algorithm reveal a significant precision improvement compared to raw Boosting
models while not suffering from any of the mentioned issues of the original
Stability Selection.

circulation regimes is a popular way of investigating teleconnections, the
predictability of severe weather events, and climate change. Here, we
investigate a supervised machine learning approach based on deformable
convolutional neural networks (deCNNs) and transfer learning to forecast the
North Atlantic-European weather regimes during extended boreal winter for 1 to
15 days into the future. We apply state-of-the-art interpretation techniques
from the machine learning literature to attribute particular regions of
interest or potential teleconnections relevant for any given weather cluster
prediction or regime transition. We demonstrate superior forecasting
performance relative to several classical meteorological benchmarks, as well as
logistic regression and random forests. Due to its wider field of view, we also
observe deCNN achieving considerably better performance than regular
convolutional neural networks at lead times beyond 5-6 days. Finally, we find
transfer learning to be of paramount importance, similar to previous
data-driven atmospheric forecasting studies.

While statistical analysis has proved FQE to be minimax-optimal with tabular,
linear and several nonparametric function families, its practical performance
with more general function approximator is less theoretically understood. We
focus on FQE with general differentiable function approximators, making our
theory applicable to neural function approximations. We approach this problem
using the Z-estimation theory and establish the following results: The FQE
estimation error is asymptotically normal with explicit variance determined
jointly by the tangent space of the function class at the ground truth, the
reward structure, and the distribution shift due to off-policy learning; The
finite-sample FQE error bound is dominated by the same variance term, and it
can also be bounded by function class-dependent divergence, which measures how
the off-policy distribution shift intertwines with the function approximator.
In addition, we study bootstrapping FQE estimators for error distribution
inference and estimating confidence intervals, accompanied by a Cramer-Rao
lower bound that matches our upper bounds. The Z-estimation analysis provides a
generalizable theoretical framework for studying off-policy estimation in RL
and provides sharp statistical theory for FQE with differentiable function
approximators.

retrieving relevant products, but also consider user personalized preference.
Recent work on PPS mainly adopts the representation learning paradigm, e.g.,
learning representations for each entity (including user, product and query)
from historical user behaviors (aka. user-product-query interactions). However,
we argue that existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the crucial
collaborative signal, which is latent in historical interactions to reveal the
affinity between the entities. Collaborative signal is quite helpful for
generating high-quality representation, exploiting which would benefit the
representation learning of one node from its connected nodes.
  To tackle this limitation, in this work, we propose a new model IHGNN for
personalized product search. IHGNN resorts to a hypergraph constructed from the
historical user-product-query interactions, which could completely preserve
ternary relations and express collaborative signal based on the topological
structure. On this basis, we develop a specific interactive hypergraph neural
network to explicitly encode the structure information (i.e., collaborative
signal) into the embedding process. It collects the information from the
hypergraph neighbors and explicitly models neighbor feature interaction to
enhance the representation of the target entity. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets validate the superiority of our proposal over the
state-of-the-arts.

Existing recommender system poisoning methods mainly focus on promoting the
recommendation chances of target items due to financial incentives. In fact, in
real-world scenarios, the attacker may also attempt to degrade the overall
performance of recommender systems. However, existing general FL poisoning
methods for degrading model performance are either ineffective or not concealed
in poisoning federated recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective and covert poisoning attack method on federated recommendation,
named FedAttack. Its core idea is using globally hardest samples to subvert
model training. More specifically, the malicious clients first infer user
embeddings based on local user profiles. Next, they choose the candidate items
that are most relevant to the user embeddings as hardest negative samples, and
find the candidates farthest from the user embeddings as hardest positive
samples. The model gradients inferred from these poisoned samples are then
uploaded to the server for aggregation and model update. Since the behaviors of
malicious clients are somewhat similar to users with diverse interests, they
cannot be effectively distinguished from normal clients by the server.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FedAttack can
effectively degrade the performance of various federated recommender systems,
meanwhile cannot be effectively detected nor defended by many existing methods.

magnetic susceptibility, thermoremanent magnetization and field dependent
magnetization measurements. This van der Waals system, with a centrosymmetric
honeycomb lattice, combines frustration and disorder, due to intercalation, and
may be hosting topologically non-trivial magnetic phases. Our study identifies
two magnetic phase transitions at $T_{f1} \approx $ 4.2 K and at $T_{f2}
\approx $ 2.7 K. We find that the paramagnetic state, for $T > T_{f1}$, is
dominated by short-range ferromagnetic correlations. These build up well above
$T_{f1}$ and lead to a significant change in magnetic entropy, which reaches
$\Delta S_M^{Pk} = $ -5.52 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 7 T. Between $T_{f1}$ and
$T_{f2}$ we observe slow spin dynamics characteristic of a cluster glass-like

(2017), it has been well known that the generalization error of supervised
learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of the mutual information between
their input and the output, given that the loss of any fixed hypothesis has a
subgaussian tail. In this work, we generalize this result beyond the standard
choice of Shannon's mutual information to measure the dependence between the
input and the output. Our main result shows that it is indeed possible to
replace the mutual information by any strongly convex function of the joint
input-output distribution, with the subgaussianity condition on the losses
replaced by a bound on an appropriately chosen norm capturing the geometry of
the dependence measure. This allows us to derive a range of generalization
bounds that are either entirely new or strengthen previously known ones.
Examples include bounds stated in terms of $p$-norm divergences and the
Wasserstein-2 distance, which are respectively applicable for heavy-tailed loss
distributions and highly smooth loss functions. Our analysis is entirely based
on elementary tools from convex analysis by tracking the growth of a potential
function associated with the dependence measure and the loss function.

from the perspective of 1-bit Sigma-Delta quantization. We introduce a method
to generate Sigma-Delta schemes for two-dimensional signals as a weighted
combination of its one-dimensional counterparts and show that various error
diffusion schemes proposed in the literature can be represented in this
framework via Sigma-Delta schemes of first order. Under the model of
two-dimensional bandlimited signals, which is motivated by a mathematical model
of human visual perception, we derive quantitative error bounds for such
weighted Sigma-Delta schemes. We see these bounds as a step towards a
mathematical understanding of the good empirical performance of error
diffusion, even though they are formulated in the supremum norm, which is known
to not fully capture the visual similarity of images.
  Motivated by the correspondence between existing error diffusion algorithms
and first-order Sigma-Delta schemes, we study the performance of the analogous
weighted combinations of second-order Sigma-Delta schemes and show that they
exhibit a superior performance in terms of guaranteed error decay for
two-dimensional bandlimited signals. In extensive numerical simulations for
real world images, we demonstrate that with some modifications to enhance
stability this superior performance also translates to the problem of digital
halftoning.
  More concretely, we find that certain second-order weighted Sigma-Delta
schemes exhibit competitive performance for digital halftoning of real world
images in terms of the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM), a state-of-the-art
measure for image quality assessment.

  mixture in high-speed wedge flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, oblique detonation of n-heptane/air mixture in high-speed wedge
flows is simulated by solving the reactive Euler equations with a
two-dimensional (2D) configuration. This is a first attempt to model
complicated hydrocarbon fuel ODWs with a detailed chemistry (44 species and 112
reactions). Effects of freestream equivalence ratios and velocities are
considered, and the abrupt and smooth transition from oblique shock to
detonation are predicted. Ignition limit, ODW characteristics, and
predictability of the transition mode are discussed. Firstly, homogeneous
constant-volume ignition calculations are performed for both fuel-lean and
stoichiometric mixtures. The results show that the ignition delay generally
increases with the wedge angle. However, a negative wedge angle dependence is
observed, due to the negative temperature coefficient effects. The wedge angle
range for successful ignition of n-heptane/air mixtures decreases when the
wedge length is reduced. From 2D simulations of stationary ODWs, the initiation
length generally decreases with the freestream equivalence ratio, but the
transition length exhibits weakly non-monotonic dependence. Smooth ODW
typically occurs for lean conditions (equivalence ratio < 0.4). The
interactions between shock / compression waves and chemical reaction inside the
induction zone are also studied with the chemical explosive mode analysis.
Moreover, the predictability of the shock-to-detonation transition mode is
explored through quantifying the relation between ignition delay and chemical
excitation time. It is demonstrated that the ignition delay (excitation time)
increases (decreases) with the freestream equivalence ratio for the three
studied oncoming flow velocities. Smaller excitation time corresponds to
stronger pressure waves from the ignition location behind OSW.

combinatorics in which one is to identify a subset of contaminated items from a
given ground set. There has been renewed interest in group testing recently due
to its applications in diagnostic virology, including pool testing for the
novel coronavirus. The majority of existing works on group testing focus on the
\emph{uniform} setting in which any subset of size $d$ from a ground set $V$ of
size $n$ is potentially contaminated. In this work, we consider a {\em
generalized} version of group testing with an arbitrary set-system of
potentially contaminated sets. The generalized problem is characterized by a
hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, where $V$ represents the ground set and edges $e\in E$
represent potentially contaminated sets. The problem of generalized group
testing is motivated by practical settings in which not all subsets of a given
size $d$ may be potentially contaminated, rather, due to social dynamics,
geographical limitations, or other considerations, there exist subsets that can
be readily ruled out. For example, in the context of pool testing, the edge set
$E$ may consist of families, work teams, or students in a classroom, i.e.,
subsets likely to be mutually contaminated. The goal in studying the
generalized setting is to leverage the additional knowledge characterized by
$H=(V,E)$ to significantly reduce the number of required tests. The paper
considers both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing and makes the following
contributions. First, for the non-adaptive setting, we show that finding an
optimal solution for the generalized version of group testing is NP-hard. For
this setting, we present a solution that requires $O(d\log{|E|})$ tests, where
$d$ is the maximum size of a set $e \in E$. Our solutions generalize those
given for the traditional setting and are shown to be of order-optimal size
$O(\log{|E|})$ for hypergraphs with edges that have ``large'' symmetric
differences. For the adaptive setting, when edges in $E$ are of size exactly
$d$, we present a solution of size $O(\log{|E|}+d\log^2{d})$ that comes close
to the lower bound of $\Omega(\log{|E|} + d)$.

whether the output of each ReLu activated neuron will be a zero or a positive
number in order to skip the computation of those neurons that will likely
output a zero. Our predictor, named Mixture-of-Rookies, combines two
inexpensive components. The first one exploits the high linear correlation
between binarized (1-bit) and full-precision (8-bit) dot products, whereas the
second component clusters together neurons that tend to output zero at the same
time. We propose a novel clustering scheme based on the analysis of angles, as
the sign of the dot product of two vectors depends on the cosine of the angle
between them. We implement our hybrid zero output predictor on top of a
state-of-the-art DNN accelerator. Experimental results show that our scheme
introduces a small area overhead of 5.3% while achieving a speedup of 1.2x and
reducing energy consumption by 16.5% on average for a set of diverse DNNs.

the desired cohesive power over all $\Delta_2$ cohesive sets. Furthermore, our
result is optimal in the sense that $\Delta_2$ cannot be replaced by $\Pi_2$.

denotes the shuffle operation. An unexpected corollary of our work is the
existence of an infinite $\Pi_1$ set that has no $\Delta_2$ cohesive subset.
This result generalizes D. Martin's well-known result that there is a
co-infinite c.e. set with no maximal superset, and it is also optimal in that

insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoplate. The nanoplate is grown via van der Waals
epitaxy on a mica substrate and a top-gated Hall-bar device is fabricated from
the nanoplate directly on the growth substrate. Top-gate voltage dependent
measurements of the sheet resistance of the device reveal that the transport
carriers in the nanoplate are of n-type and that, with decreasing top gate
voltage, the carrier density in the nanoplate is decreased. However, the
mobility is increased with decreasing top-gate voltage. This mobility increase
with decreasing carrier density in the nanoplate is demonstrated to arise from
a decrease in bulk-to-surface electron scattering rate. Low-field
magnetotransport measurements are performed at low temperatures. The measured
magnetoconductivity of the nanoplate shows typical weak anti-localization (WAL)
characteristics. We analyze the measurements by taking surface-bulk
inter-channel electron scattering into account and extract dephasing times
${\tau}_{\phi}$, diffusion coefficients $D$ of electrons at the top surface and
in the bulk, and the surface-bulk scattering times ${\tau}_{SB}$ as a function
of top-gate voltage and temperature. It is found that the dephasing in the
nanoplate arises dominantly from electron-electron scattering with small energy
transfers. It is also found that the ratio of ${\tau}_{\phi}$/${\tau}_{SB}$ (a
measure of the surface-bulk electron coherent coupling) is decreased with
decreasing gate voltage or increasing temperature. We demonstrate that taking
the surface-bulk coherent electron scattering in our Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoplate
into account is essential to understand quantum transport measurements at low

coupled with Bayesian inference confirms that the gas traced by SiO has
different densities - and possibly temperatures - than that traced by HNCO. We
find that SiO traces gas affected by fast shocks while the gas traced by HNCO

for any constant $c \geq 1$, if we can solve linear equations in combinatorial
Laplacians of 2-complexes up to high accuracy in time $\tilde{O}((\# \text{ of

contribution is SUPA, the SUrrogate PArticle propagation simulator, an

generation is extremely fast and easy to use compared to Geant4, but still
exhibits the key characteristics and challenges of the detailed simulation. We
support this claim experimentally by showing that performance of generative
models on data from our simulator reflects the performance on a dataset
generated with Geant4. The proposed simulator generates thousands of particle
showers per second on a desktop machine, a speed up of up to 6 orders of
magnitudes over Geant4, and stores detailed geometric information about the
shower propagation. SUPA provides much greater flexibility for setting initial
conditions and defining multiple benchmarks for the development of models.
Moreover, interpreting particle showers as point clouds creates a connection to
geometric machine learning and provides challenging and fundamentally new
datasets for the field.

increased congestion. Crowd-shipping is a sustainable and low-cost alternative
to traditional delivery, but relies heavily on the availability of occasional
couriers. In this work, we propose a hub-based crowd-shipping system that aims
to attract sufficient potential crowd-shippers to serve a large portion of the
demand for small parcels. While small-scale versions of this problem have been
recently addressed, a scaling to larger instances significantly complexifies
the problem. A heuristic approach based on continuum approximation is designed
to evaluate the quality of a potential set of hub locations. By combining an
efficient and accurate approximation method with a large neighborhood search
heuristic, we are able to efficiently find a good set of hub locations, even
for large scale networks. Furthermore, on top of determining good hub
locations, our methods allow to identify the expected number of delivered
parcels in every region, which can be used to design a smart dynamic assignment
strategy. A case study on the Washington DC network shows that hubs are built
at locations that are both geographically central, but most importantly are
popular origins for crowd-shippers. The optimal number of hubs is mainly
dependent on the marginal number of parcels that can be served by
crowd-shippers from a specific hub, relative to the costs involved in opening
that hub. The performance of our algorithm is close to that of a
simulation-optimization algorithm, yet being up to 25 times faster. Thereby,
the results show a dynamic assignment policy based on continuum approximation
estimates outperforms existing assignment strategies.

  Perspective","Submitted to IEEE IoT Journal",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A city is a large human settlement that serves the people who live there, and
a smart city is a concept of how cities might better serve their residents
through new forms of technology. In this paper, we focus on four major smart
city domains according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs: smart utility, smart
transportation, smart homes, and smart healthcare. Numerous IoT applications
have been developed to achieve the intelligence that we desire in our smart
domains, ranging from personal gadgets such as health trackers and smart
watches to large-scale industrial IoT systems such as nuclear and energy
management systems. However, many of the existing smart city IoT solutions can
be made better by considering the suitability of their security strategies.
Inappropriate system security designs generally occur in two scenarios: first,
system designers recognize the importance of security but are unsure of where,
when, or how to implement it; and second, system designers try to fit
traditional security designs to meet the smart city security context. Thus, the
objective of this paper is to provide application designers with the missing
security link they may need to improve their security designs. By evaluating
the specific context of each smart city domain and the context-specific
security requirements, we aim to provide directions on when, where, and how
they should implement security strategies and the possible security challenges
they need to consider. In addition, we present a new perspective on security
issues in smart cities from a data-centric viewpoint by referring to the
reference architecture, the Activity-Network-Things (ANT)-centric architecture,
built upon the concept of ""security in a zero-trust environment"". By doing so,
we reduce the security risks posed by new system interactions or unanticipated
user behaviors while avoiding the hassle of regularly upgrading security
models.

Fixed broken reference",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we provide a geometric analysis of a new hysteresis model that
is based upon singular perturbations. Here hysteresis refers to a type of
regularization of piecewise smooth differential equations where the past of a
trajectory, in a small neighborhood of the discontinuity set, determines the
vector-field at present. In fact, in the limit where the neighborhood of the
discontinuity becomes smaller, hysteresis converges in an appropriate sense to
Filippov's sliding vector-field. Recently, however, in \cite{rev2021a} it has
been shown that hysteresis, in contrast to regularization through smoothing,
leads to chaos in the regularization of grazing bifurcations, even in two
dimensions. The hysteresis model we analyze in the present paper -- which was
developed by Bonet et al \cite{bonet2017a} as an attempt to unify different
regularizations of piecewise smooth systems -- involves two singular
perturbation parameters and includes a combination of slow-fast and nonsmooth
effects. The description of this model is therefore -- from the perspective of
singular perturbation theory -- challenging, even in two dimensions. In this
paper, using blowup as our main technical tool, we present a detailed geometric
description of the dynamics. Specifically, this description allows us to prove
existence of an invariant cylinder carrying fast dynamics in the azimuthal
direction and a slow drift in the axial direction. We find that the slow drift
is given by Filippov's sliding to leading order. In the case of grazing, we
identify two important parameter regimes that relate the model to smoothing and
hysteresis. In particular, in one of these regimes we prove existence of
chaotic dynamics through a horseshoe obtained by a folded saddle and a novel
return mechanism.

(SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly replaced the Delta variant as a dominating SARS-CoV-2
variant because of natural selection, which favors the variant with higher
infectivity and stronger vaccine breakthrough ability. Omicron has three
lineages or subvariants, BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2), and BA.3
(B.1.1.529.3). Among them, BA.1 is the currently prevailing subvariant. BA.2
shares 32 mutations with BA.1 but has 28 distinct ones. BA.3 shares most of its
mutations with BA.1 and BA.2 except for one. BA.2 is found to be able to
alarmingly reinfect patients originally infected by Omicron BA.1. An important
question is whether BA.2 or BA.3 will become a new dominating ""variant of
concern"". Currently, no experimental data has been reported about BA.2 and
BA.3. We construct a novel algebraic topology-based deep learning model trained
with tens of thousands of mutational and deep mutational data to systematically
evaluate BA.2's and BA.3's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough capability, and
antibody resistance. Our comparative analysis of all main variants namely,
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3, unveils that BA.2
is about 1.5 and 4.2 times as contagious as BA.1 and Delta, respectively. It is
also 30% and 17-fold more capable than BA.1 and Delta, respectively, to escape
current vaccines. Therefore, we project that Omicron BA.2 is on its path to
becoming the next dominating variant. We forecast that like Omicron BA.1, BA.2
will also seriously compromise most existing mAbs, except for sotrovimab

relativistic intensities, a spectrum exhibiting a power-law decay with an
exponent of 8/3 or 4/3 is often stated. Here, we analyse the dependence of this
exponent on interaction parameters including the angle of incidence, the

resource-constrained targets, it is necessary to compress the CNN models by
performing quantization, whereby precision representation is converted to a
lower bit representation. To overcome problems such as sensitivity of the
training dataset, high computational requirements, and large time consumption,
post-training quantization methods that do not require retraining have been
proposed. In addition, to compensate for the accuracy drop without retraining,
previous studies on post-training quantization have proposed several
complementary methods: calibration, schemes, clipping, granularity, and
mixed-precision. To generate a quantized model with minimal error, it is
necessary to study all possible combinations of the methods because each of
them is complementary and the CNN models have different characteristics.
However, an exhaustive or a heuristic search is either too time-consuming or
suboptimal. To overcome this challenge, we propose an auto-tuner known as
Quantune, which builds a gradient tree boosting model to accelerate the search
for the configurations of quantization and reduce the quantization error. We
evaluate and compare Quantune with the random, grid, and genetic algorithms.
The experimental results show that Quantune reduces the search time for
quantization by approximately 36.5x with an accuracy loss of 0.07 ~ 0.65%
across six CNN models, including the fragile ones (MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and
ShuffleNet). To support multiple targets and adopt continuously evolving

changes. In performative prediction settings, however, predictors are precisely
intended to induce distribution shift. For example, in many applications in
criminal justice, healthcare, and consumer finance, the purpose of building a
predictor is to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes such as recidivism,
hospitalization, or default on a loan. We formalize the effect of such
predictors as a type of concept shift-a particular variety of distribution
shift-and show both theoretically and via simulated examples how this causes
predictors which are fair when they are trained to become unfair when they are

Multi-connectivity can significantly improve the performance of multicast
services. It especially benefits the cell edge users who often suffer from poor

the performance of multicast streaming. We propose procedures for establishing
multi-connectivity in a multicast system and address the associated resource

NP-hard. We propose a greedy approximation algorithm for this problem and prove
that no other polynomial-time algorithm can provide a better approximation.
Since video streaming is the primary use case under consideration here, we use

simulations. Our simulation results clearly establish that multi-connectivity
results in considerable performance improvement in multicast streaming.

beyond the gluon-intermediated interactions for valence-type quarks,
non-valence effects are included by allowing the pions to couple back in a
self-consistent manner to the quarks. Consequently, the opening of the dominant
$\rho$ decay channel, $\rho \to \pi\pi$, and the presence of a multi-particle
branch cut, setting in when the two-pion threshold is crossed, are included
consistently, first in the correspondingly calculated quark-photon vertex, and
then consequently in the time-like electromagnetic pion form factor. The
obtained results are in agreement with the available experimental data and
provide further evidence for the efficacy of a vector-meson dominance model.

maximum cutoff frequency $K_c$. The reconstruction task is specified as an
optimization problem with total-variation (TV) regularization (in the sense of
measures) involving the $M$-th order derivative regularization operator
$\mathrm{L} = \mathrm{D}^M$. The order $M \geq 1$ determines the degree of the
reconstructed piecewise polynomial spline, whereas the TV regularization norm,
which is known to promote sparsity, guarantees a small number of pieces. We
show that the solution of our optimization problem is always unique, which, to
the best of our knowledge, is a first for TV-based problems. Moreover, we show
that this solution is a periodic spline matched to the regularization operator
$\mathrm{L}$ whose number of knots is upper-bounded by $2 K_c$. We then
consider the grid-based discretization of our optimization problem in the space

baryonic dark matter in the Universe. The onset of S BEC marks the maximum mass
of hadronic neutron stars and it occurs when the condition for the baryon
chemical potential $\mu_b=m_S/2$ is fulfilled in the center of the star,

field of the star the density of the BEC of the S increases until a new state
of the matter is attained, where each of the S-states got dissociated into a
triplet of color-flavor-locked (CFL) diquark states. These diquarks are the
Cooper pairs in the color superconducting CFL phase of quark matter, so that
the developed scenario corresponds to a BEC-BCS transition in strongly

Requirements Engineering and NLP are described as well as an evaluation of over
136 NLP tools. To assess these tools, a set of criteria was defined. The
results are that currently no open source approach exists that allows for the
direct/primary extraction of information structure and even closed source

This model
predicts that a binary system with two early-type stars passing through a
diffuse cloud should both display the same superficial peculiarity. We carried
out a detailed abundance determination of three multiple systems hosting a
candidate lambda Boo star: the remarkable triple system HD 15164/65/65C and the
binary systems HD 193256/281 and HD 198160/161. The abundance analysis of HD
15164/65/65C shows a clear lambda Boo object (HD 15165) and two objects with
near solar composition (HD 15164 and 15165C). Notably, the presence of a lambda
Boo star (HD 15165) together with a near solar early-type object (HD 15164) is
difficult to explain under the accretion scenario. Also, the solar-like
composition derived for the late-type star of the system (HD 15165C) could be
used, for the first time, as a proxy for the initial composition of the lambda
Boo stars. Then, by reviewing abundance analysis of all known binary systems
with candidate lambda Boo stars from literature and including the systems
analyzed here, we find no binary/multiple system having two clear ""bonafide""
lambda Boo stars, as expected from the accretion scenario. The closer
candidates to show two lambda Boo-like stars are HD 84948, HD 171948 and HD
198160; however, in our opinion they show mild rather than clear lambda Boo
patterns. Our results brings little support to the accretion scenario. Then,
there is an urgent need of additional binary and multiple systemsto be analyzed
through a detailed abundance analysis.[abridged]

progress during the last decades in isotope production as well as detection

most noticably when decays proceed directly to continuum states as seems to be
the case in beta-delayed deuteron emission, a process only observed until now
for the halo nuclei $^6$He and $^{11}$Li. The pronounced clustering in halo
states also leaves an imprint on the decay patterns, although the isospin
symmetry remains important; in several cases the isobaric analogue states of
halo states have also been established. Beta-delayed particle emission channels
can be expected to dominate the decays of heavier halo nuclei, if not in terms

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) referred to as the asynchronous composition
model, subject to i.i.d. random delays $(\xi_t)$ with finite mean. The new
vertex at time $t$ is connected to vertices chosen from the graph
$G_{(t-\xi_t)_+}$ according to a construction function $f$ and the graph is
updated by taking union with the graph $G_{t-1}$. This process corresponds to
adding new blocks in a blockchain, where the delays arise due to network
communication. The main question of interest is the end structure of the
asynchronous limit of the graph sequence as time increases to infinity.
  We consider the following construction functions of interest, a) Nakamoto
construction $f_{\mathrm{Nak}}$, in which a vertex is uniformly selected from
those furthest from the root, resulting in a tree, and b) mixture of
construction functions $(f_k)_{1\le k\le \infty}$, where in $f_k$ a random set
of $k$ leaves (all if there are less than $k$ in total) is chosen without
replacement. The main idea behind the analysis is decoupling the time-delay
process from the DAG process and constructing an appropriate regenerative
structure in the time-delay process giving rise to Markovian behavior for a
functional of the DAG process. We establish that the asynchronous limits for
$f_\mathrm{Nak}, (f_k)_{k \ge 2}$, and any non-trivial mixture $f$ are
one-ended, while the asynchronous limit for $f_1$ has infinitely many ends,
almost surely. We also study fundamental growth properties of the longest path
for the sequence of graphs for $f_\mathrm{Nak}$. In addition, we prove a phase
transition on the (time and sample-path dependent) probability of choosing
$f_1$ such that the asynchronous limit either has one or infinitely many ends.
Finally, we show that the construction $f_\infty$ is an appropriate limit of
the $(f_k)_k$.

is efficient, flexible, and scalable. The method is evaluated using one or more

next-nearest neighbor two and three-site interactions, with two questions in
mind: the nature of the transition into the dimerized phase induced by the
three-site interaction, and the possible presence of a critical floating phase
at intermediate values of the next-nearest neighbor interaction. We provide
strong evidence that the continuous transition into the dimerized phase, which
has been found to be generically in the Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)$_{2S}$
universality class up to spin $S=2$, is SU(2)$_5$ only at two isolated points
of the phase diagram, and that it is SU(2)$_3$ in between, in agreement with
the presence of two relevant operators allowed by symmetry for SU(2)$_5$, and
with the conservation of the parity of the level index along the
renormalization flow between SU(2)$_k$ theories with different values of $k$.
We also find that the dimerization induced by the next-nearest neighbor
interaction is a three step process, with first a small partially dimerized
phase followed by a broad critical floating phase with incommensurate
correlations before the fully dimerized phase is reached. Implications for the
iron oxide ${\mathrm{Bi}}_{3}{\mathrm{FeMo}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{12}$ are briefly
discussed.

Corrected typos and improved terminology",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove several results about substructures in Latin squares. First, we
explain how to adapt our recent work on high-girth Steiner triple systems to
the setting of Latin squares, resolving a conjecture of Linial that there exist
Latin squares with arbitrarily high girth. As a consequence, we see that the
number of order-$n$ Latin squares with no intercalate (i.e., no $2\times2$
Latin subsquare) is at least $(e^{-9/4}n-o(n))^{n^{2}}$. Equivalently,
$\mathbb{P}\left[\mathbf{N}=0\right]\ge
e^{-n^{2}/4-o(n^{2})}=e^{-(1+o(1))\mathbb{E}\mathbf{N}}$, where $\mathbf{N}$ is
the number of intercalates in a uniformly random order-$n$ Latin square.
  In fact, extending recent work of Kwan, Sah, and Sawhney, we resolve the
general large-deviation problem for intercalates in random Latin squares, up to
constant factors in the exponent: for any constant $0<\delta\le1$ we have
$\mathbb{P}[\mathbf{N}\le(1-\delta)\mathbb{E}\mathbf{N}]=\exp(-\Theta(n^{2}))$
and for any constant $\delta>0$ we have
$\mathbb{P}[\mathbf{N}\ge(1+\delta)\mathbb{E}\mathbf{N}]=\exp(-\Theta(n^{4/3}\log
n))$.
  Finally, as an application of some new general tools for studying
substructures in random Latin squares, we show that in almost all order-$n$
Latin squares, the number of cuboctahedra (i.e., the number of pairs of
possibly degenerate $2\times2$ submatrices with the same arrangement of
symbols) is of order $n^{4}$, which is the minimum possible. As observed by
Gowers and Long, this number can be interpreted as measuring ``how
associative'' the quasigroup associated with the Latin square is.

Taking into account the anisotropic four-fermion interactions, a tensor current
arises in the magnetized QCD system, which forms an anomalous magnetic moment
(AMM) coupling in the Dirac equation for the quarks. By solving the gap
equations, we find that the sign of the dynamically generated AMM is opposite
to the sign of the quark's charge and its magnitude is definitely smaller than
the constituent mass. We construct two generalized Nambu-Goldstone pions, which
emerge as combinations of the quantum fluctuations around the conventional
scalar and the emergent tensor chiral condensates. We analytically demonstrate
that the Goldstone nature has been spoiled by the dimensional reduction in the
two-particle state and the corresponding decreasing mass of the lighter

discovering abnormal events. Motivated by our empirical findings that
conventional single-stage benchmark approaches may not exhibit satisfactory
performance under our challenging circumstances, we propose a two-stage deep
anomaly detection (TDAD) framework in which two different unsupervised learning
models are adopted depending on types of signals. In Stage I, we select anomaly
candidates by using a model trained by operation cycle signals; in Stage II, we
finally detect abnormal events out of the candidates by using another model,
which is suitable for taking advantage of temporal continuity, trained by
sensor signals. A distinguishable feature of our framework is that operation
cycle signals are exploited first to find likely anomalous points, whereas
sensor signals are leveraged to filter out unlikely anomalous points afterward.
Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the superiority over single-stage
benchmark approaches, the model-agnostic property, and the robustness to
difficult situations.

In this work, we assessed the performance and variability of RRAM-based

under the Gaussian distribution in the challenging \emph{agnostic learning}

Query (SQ) algorithm for agnostically learning the class of intersections of
$k$ halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^n$ to constant excess error either must make
queries of tolerance at most $n^{-\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log k})}$ or must make
$2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}$ queries. We strengthen this result by improving the
tolerance requirement to $n^{-\tilde{\Omega}(\log k)}$. This lower bound is
essentially best possible since an SQ algorithm of Klivans et al. (2008)
agnostically learns this class to any constant excess error using $n^{O(\log
k)}$ queries of tolerance $n^{-O(\log k)}$. We prove two variants of our lower
bound, each of which combines ingredients from Diakonikolas et al. (2021) with
(an extension of) a different earlier approach for agnostic SQ lower bounds for
the Boolean setting due to Dachman-Soled et al. (2014). Our approach also
yields lower bounds for agnostically SQ learning the class of ""convex subspace
juntas"" (studied by Vempala, 2010) and the class of sets with bounded Gaussian
surface area; all of these lower bounds are nearly optimal since they
essentially match known upper bounds from Klivans et al. (2008).

interacting with each other through their social links. Even starting from a

Camera ready version","NeurIPS 2022",,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-armed bandit problems provide a framework to identify the optimal
intervention over a sequence of repeated experiments. Without additional
assumptions, minimax optimal performance (measured by cumulative regret) is
well-understood. With access to additional observed variables that d-separate
the intervention from the outcome (i.e., they are a d-separator), recent
""causal bandit"" algorithms provably incur less regret. However, in practice it
is desirable to be agnostic to whether observed variables are a d-separator.
Ideally, an algorithm should be adaptive; that is, perform nearly as well as an
algorithm with oracle knowledge of the presence or absence of a d-separator. In
this work, we formalize and study this notion of adaptivity, and provide a
novel algorithm that simultaneously achieves (a) optimal regret when a
d-separator is observed, improving on classical minimax algorithms, and (b)
significantly smaller regret than recent causal bandit algorithms when the
observed variables are not a d-separator. Crucially, our algorithm does not
require any oracle knowledge of whether a d-separator is observed. We also
generalize this adaptivity to other conditions, such as the front-door
criterion.

distribution (SED) of galaxies. Yet our understanding of dust attenuation is
limited and our observations suffer from the dust-metallicity-age degeneracy in
SED fitting (single galaxies), large individual variances (ensemble
measurements), and the difficulty in properly dealing with uncertainties
(statistical considerations). In this study, we create a population Bayesian
model to rigorously account for correlated variables and non-Gaussian error
distributions and demonstrate the improvement over a simple Bayesian model. We
employ a flexible 5-D linear interpolation model for the parameters that
control dust attenuation curves as a function of stellar mass, star formation
rate (SFR), metallicity, redshift, and inclination. Our setup allows us to
determine the complex relationships between dust attenuation and these galaxy
properties simultaneously. Using Prospector fits of nearly 30,000 3D-HST
galaxies, we find that the attenuation slope ($n$) flattens with increasing
optical depth ($\tau$), though less so than in previous studies. $\tau$
increases strongly with SFR, though when $\log~{\rm SFR}\lesssim 0$, $\tau$
remains roughly constant over a wide range of stellar masses. Edge-on galaxies
tend to have larger $\tau$ than face-on galaxies, but only for $\log~M_*\gtrsim
10$, reflecting the lack of triaxiality for low-mass galaxies. Redshift
evolution of dust attenuation is strongest for low-mass, low-SFR galaxies, with
higher optical depths but flatter curves at high redshift. Finally, $n$ has a
complex relationship with stellar mass, highlighting the intricacies of the
star-dust geometry. We have publicly released software

completely new means for observing the Universe, allowing us to probe its
structure and evolution like never before. In this thesis, we explore three
distinct but complementary avenues for using GW observations to gain new
insights into cosmology and fundamental physics.
  In chapter 1, we study the astrophysical GW background (AGWB): the cumulative
GW signal arising from a large number of compact binary coalescences (CBCs)
throughout the Universe. Since these compact binaries reside in galaxies, the
AGWB contains anisotropies that trace out the large-scale structure of the
cosmic matter distribution. We investigate the angular power spectrum of the
AGWB, with the goal of developing predictions that can be confronted with
directional AGWB searches.
  In chapter 2, we calculate the nonlinear GW memory emitted by cusps and kinks
on cosmic string loops, which are among the most promising cosmological sources
of GWs. We show that, surprisingly, the cusp memory signal diverges for
sufficiently large loops, indicating a breakdown in the validity of the
weak-field description of the cusp. We then present one tentative possible
solution to this divergence, in which the portion of the string surrounding the
cusp collapses to form a primordial black hole (PBH).
  Finally, in chapter 3 we develop a powerful new method for GW detection based
on precision measurements of the orbits of binary systems. In the presence of a
stochastic GW background (GWB) the trajectories of the binary's components are
perturbed, giving rise to a random walk in the system's orbital parameters over
time. We calculate the sensitivity of binary pulsars and lunar laser ranging to
the GWB through this effect, and show that present data are already sensitive
enough to place the strongest constraints to date in the $\mu$Hz frequency
band.

Here, we demonstrate the use of automated transform by manifold approximation
(AUTOMAP), a generalized framework that maps raw MR signal to the target image
domain, to rapidly reconstruct images from undersampled radial k-space data.
The AUTOMAP neural network was trained to reconstruct images from a
golden-angle radial acquisition, a benchmark for motion-sensitive imaging, on
lung cancer patient data and generic images from ImageNet. Model training was
subsequently augmented with motion-encoded k-space data derived from videos in
the YouTube-8M dataset to encourage motion robust reconstruction. We find that
AUTOMAP-reconstructed radial k-space has equivalent accuracy to CS but with
much shorter processing times after initial fine-tuning on retrospectively
acquired lung cancer patient data. Validation of motion-trained models with a
virtual dynamic lung tumor phantom showed that the generalized motion
properties learned from YouTube lead to improved target tracking accuracy. Our

the encoding process was reversed using an appropriate analog device. In this

is often marred in the presence of acquisition-related distribution shifts
between training and test images. Recently, it has been proposed to tackle this
problem by fine-tuning trained CNNs for each test image. Such
test-time-adaptation (TTA) is a promising and practical strategy for improving
robustness to distribution shifts as it requires neither data sharing between
institutions nor annotating additional data. Previous TTA methods use a helper
model to increase similarity between outputs and/or features extracted from a
test image with those of the training images. Such helpers, which are typically
modeled using CNNs, can be task-specific and themselves vulnerable to
distribution shifts in their inputs. To overcome these problems, we propose to
carry out TTA by matching the feature distributions of test and training
images, as modelled by a field-of-experts (FoE) prior. FoEs model complicated
probability distributions as products of many simpler expert distributions. We
use 1D marginal distributions of a trained task CNN's features as experts in
the FoE model. Further, we compute principal components of patches of the task
CNN's features, and consider the distributions of PCA loadings as additional
experts. We validate the method on 5 MRI segmentation tasks (healthy tissues in
4 anatomical regions and lesions in 1 one anatomy), using data from 17 clinics,
and on a MRI registration task, using data from 3 clinics. We find that the
proposed FoE-based TTA is generically applicable in multiple tasks, and

  inspired fusion framework","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.04882",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  When the parameters of Bayesian Short-time Spectral Amplitude (STSA)
estimator for speech enhancement are selected based on the characteristics of
the human auditory system, the gain function of the estimator becomes more
flexible. Although this type of estimator in acoustic domain is quite effective
in reducing the back-ground noise at high frequencies, it produces more speech
distortions, which make the high-frequency contents of the speech such as
friciatives less perceptible in heavy noise conditions, resulting in
intelligibility reduction. On the other hand, the speech enhancement scheme,
which exploits the psychoacoustic evidence of frequency selectivity in the
modulation domain, is found to be able to increase the intelligibility of noisy
speech by a substantial amount, but also suffers from the temporal slurring
problem due to its essential design constraint. In order to achieve the joint
improvements in both the perceived speech quality and intelligibility, we
proposed and investigated a fusion framework by combining the merits of
acoustic and modulation domain approaches while avoiding their respective
weaknesses. Objective measure evaluation shows that the proposed speech
enhancement fusion framework can provide consistent improvements in the
perceived speech quality and intelligibility across different SNR levels in
various noise conditions, while compared to the other baseline techniques.

better managing urban rail transit (URT) systems. Some emerging deep learning
models provide good insights to improve short-term prediction accuracy.
However, there exist many complex spatiotemporal dependencies in URT systems.
Most previous methods only consider the absolute error between ground truth and
predictions as the optimization objective, which fails to account for spatial
and temporal constraints on the predictions. Furthermore, a large number of
existing prediction models introduce complex neural network layers to improve
accuracy while ignoring their training efficiency and memory occupancy,
decreasing the chances to be applied to the real world. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal graph
generative adversarial network (STG-GAN) model with higher prediction accuracy,
higher efficiency, and lower memory occupancy to predict short-term passenger
flows of the URT network. Our model consists of two major parts, which are
optimized in an adversarial learning manner: (1) a generator network including
gated temporal conventional networks (TCN) and weight sharing graph convolution
networks (GCN) to capture structural spatiotemporal dependencies and generate
predictions with a relatively small computational burden; (2) a discriminator
network including a spatial discriminator and a temporal discriminator to
enhance the spatial and temporal constraints of the predictions. The STG-GAN is
evaluated on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway. A
comparison with those of several state-of-the-art models illustrates its
superiority and robustness. This study can provide critical experience in
conducting short-term passenger flow predictions, especially from the
perspective of real-world applications.

for $SU(3)$, and how these are linked with decomposition of generators into
commuting bivectors. The setting for this work is within a 6d Euclidean
Clifford Algebra. We then go on to consider whether the fundamental forces of
particle physics might arise from symmetry considerations in just the 4d
geometric algebra of spacetime -- the STA. As part of this, a representation of
$SU(3)$ is found wholly within the STA, involving preservation of a bivector
norm. We also show how Octonions can be fully represented within the Spacetime
Algebra, which we believe will be useful in making them understandable and
accessible to a new community in Physics and Engineering. The two strands of
the paper are drawn together in showing how preserving the octonion norm is the
same as preserving the timelike part of the Dirac current of a particle. This
suggests a new model for the symmetries preserved in particle physics.

presents how PV surfaces can be designed to reverse the Earth's radiative
imbalance from increased greenhouse gasses that lead to higher global
temperatures. The new PV surface generate electricity, reflect sub-band gap
radiation, minimize their temperature, generate thermal radiation and emit
additional IR through the atmospheric, with these processes totaling 650
Wm$^{-2}$. This is realized by: (1) PV system efficiency at operating
temperature $>$ 20 \% and sub-band gap reflection of 150 Wm$^{-2}$ for a total
of 350 Wm$^{-2}$ (2) Thermally emitted radiation (radiative cooling) of 150
Wm$^{-2}$; and (3) Active IR emission through an atmospheric window at 1.5
$\mu$ of 150 Wm$^{-2}$. With such PV surfaces, we show that 10 TW of installed
PV can reverse global warming. Using PV to balance global temperatures
introduces additional considerations for PV, focusing on high efficiency,
particularly high efficiency at operating temperatures, radiative cooling, and
new processes for 1.5 $\mu$ emission. We find that depending on their design,

we prove that if $G = H = I$, then $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is not squarefree. Other
natural and related results are derived further. Lastly, we conjecture that the
set $$\mathscr{A} = \{m : \gcd(m,\sigma(m^2))=\gcd(m^2,\sigma(m^2))\}$$ has
asymptotic density zero.

ensuring that no bias or human error exists in the reviewing process. In order
to address this issue, our article suggests a novice cloud framework for

"2202.13880","Abbas Mirzaei","Younes Jahandideh, A. Mirzaei","Allocating Duplicate Copies for IoT Data in Cloud Computing Based on
  Harmony Search Algorithm",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Internet of things (IoT) generates a plethora of data nowadays, and cloud
computing has been introduced as an efficient solution to IoT data management.
A cloud resource administrator usually adopts the replication strategy to
guarantee the reliability of IoT data. This mechanism can significantly reduce
data access time, and evidently, more replicas of data increase the data
storage cost. Furthermore, the process of selecting mini clouds for replica
allocation and sorting replicas in mini clouds is considered an NP-hard
problem. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach based on the harmony search
(HS) algorithm to allocate replicas to the IoT data in the cloud computing
environment in order to mitigate the data access cost. The HS algorithm was
employed in the proposed approach to determine the best location for data
replication in the cloud computing environment. According to the implementation
results, the proposed approach outperformed the other methods and managed to
significantly decrease data access time and delay as well as energy
consumption.

unfair means of practices performed by the athletes to improve their
performance in the game. It includes the intake of hormonal based drugs or
transfusion of blood to increase their strength and the result of their
training. However, the current direct test of detection of these cases includes
the laboratory-based method, which is limited because of the cost factors,
availability of medical experts, etc. This leads us to seek for indirect tests.
With the growing interest of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, it is
important to propose an algorithm based on blood parameters to improve decision
making. In this paper, we proposed a statistical and machine learning-based
approach to identify the presence of doping substance rhEPO in blood samples.

with Novelty Search. Novelty Search finds novel place to search in the search
domain and then Particle Swarm Optimization rigorously searches that area for
global optimum solution. This method is never blocked in local optima because
it is controlled by Novelty Search which is objective free. For those functions
where there are many more local optima and second global optimum is far from
true optimum, the present method works successfully. The present algorithm
never stops until it searches entire search area. A series of experimental
trials prove the robustness and effectiveness of the present algorithm on
complex optimization test functions.
