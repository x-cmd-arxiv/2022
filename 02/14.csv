still lacking a comprehensive understanding of the mobility patterns of sharing

Dockless bike-sharing systems that record detailed information of every trip
provide us a unique opportunity for revealing the hidden patterns behind riding
activities. By treating each bike as an individual entity, we reveal that
distributions of mobility indicators of bikes are quite different from humans;
and mobility patterns are even inconsistent across cities. All above
discrepancies can be well explained by a choice model that is characterized by
a universal scaling. Our model unveils that instead of choosing among the
newest bikes, the distribution of rank values of selected bikes on usage

cities despite various diversities. Our framework would have broad implications
in sharing economy and contribute towards developing a greener, healthier, and
more sustainable future city.

maximize the expected sum throughput of the capacity hungry user, with
consideration of the payload delivery outage probability of the reliability

single-objective sequential decision problem via introducing a dual variable. A
dynamic programming based algorithm is then designed to derive the optimal
policy that maximizes the Lagrangian. Afterwards, a bisection search based

shown by numerical results to be superior to the baseline methods in terms of
the expected return, performance region, and objective value.

stages: Offline learning of policies or utility functions for each potential
goal, and online inference. We provide a first instance of this framework using

alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to implement an energy
approach to cohesive fracture. The ADMM algorithm minimizes a non-smooth,
non-convex potential functional at each strain increment to predict the
evolution of a cohesive-elastic system. The optimization problem bypasses the
explicit stress criterion of force-based (Newtonian) methods, which interferes
with Newton iterations impeding convergence. The model is extended with an
extrapolation method that significantly reduces the computation time of the
sequence of optimizations. The ADMM algorithm is experimentally shown to have
nearly linear time complexity and fast iteration times, allowing it to simulate
much larger problems than were previously feasible. The effectiveness, as well
as the insensitivity of the algorithm to its numerical parameters is
demonstrated through examples. It is shown that the Lagrange multiplier method
of ADMM is more effective than earlier Nitsche and continuation methods for
quasistatic problems. Close spaced minima are identified in complicated
microstructures and their effect discussed.

one can establish that for any real elliptic operator with bounded
coefficients, the quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic measures is
equivalent to the fact that all bounded null solutions satisfy Carleson measure
estimates. In turn, in the same setting these equivalent properties are stable
under Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbations. However, without connectivity,
there is no Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbation result available. In this
paper, we work with a corona decomposition associated with the elliptic measure
and show that it is equivalent to the fact that bounded null solutions satisfy
partial/weak Carleson measure estimates, or to the fact that the Green function
is comparable to the distance to the boundary in the corona sense. This
characterization has profound consequences. We extend Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher's
perturbation to non-connected settings. For the Laplacian, these corona
decompositions or, equivalently, the partial/weak Carleson measure estimates
are meaningful enough to characterize the uniform rectifiability of the
boundary. As a consequence, we obtain that the boundary of the set is uniformly
rectifiable if bounded null solutions for any Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher
perturbation of the Laplacian satisfy Carleson measure estimates. For
Kenig-Pipher operators any of the properties of the characterization is stable
under transposition or symmetrization of the matrices of coefficients. As a
result, we obtain that Carleson measure estimates for bounded null-solutions of
non-symmetric variable operators satisfying an $L^1$-Kenig-Pipher condition
occur if and only if the boundary of the open set is uniformly rectifiable. Our

$X$ defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $0$,
endowed with a birational self-map $\phi$ of dynamical degree $1$, we expect
that either there exists a non-constant rational function $f:X\dashrightarrow

$Y\subset X$ with the property that for any invariant proper subvariety
$Z\subset X$, we have that $Z\subseteq Y$. We prove our conjecture for
automorphisms $\phi$ of dynamical degree $1$ of semiabelian varieties $X$.
Also, we prove a related result for regular dominant self-maps $\phi$ of

rational function, we have that the dynamical degree of $\phi$ is larger than
$1$ if and only if the union of all $\phi$-invariant proper subvarieties of $X$

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.09721",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To account for the massive uncoordinated random access scenario, which is
relevant for the Internet of Things, Polyanskiy (2017) proposed a novel
formulation of the multiple-access problem, commonly referred to as unsourced
multiple access, where all users employ a common codebook and the receiver
decodes up to a permutation of the messages. We extend this seminal work to the
case where the number of active users is random and unknown a priori. We define
a random-access code accounting for both misdetection (MD) and false alarm
(FA), and derive a random-coding achievability bound for the Gaussian multiple
access channel. Our bound captures the fundamental trade-off between MD and FA.
It suggests that the lack of knowledge of the number of active users entails a
small penalty in energy efficiency when the target MD and FA probabilities are
high. However, as the target MD and FA probabilities decrease, the energy
efficiency penalty becomes significant. For example, in a typical IoT scenario,
the required energy per bit to achieve both MD and FA probabilities below 0.1,
predicted by our bound, is only 0.5-0.7 dB higher than that predicted by the
bound in Polyanskiy (2017) for a known number of active users. This gap
increases to 3-4 dB when the target MD and/or FA probability is 0.001. Taking
both MD and FA into account, we use our bound to benchmark the energy
efficiency of slotted ALOHA with multi-packet reception, of a decoder that
treats interference as noise, and of some recently proposed coding schemes.
Numerical results suggest that, when the target MD and FA probabilities are
high, it is effective to estimate the number of active users, then treat this
estimate as the true value, and use a coding scheme that performs well for the
case of known number of active users. However, this approach becomes energy
inefficient when the requirements on MD and FA probabilities are stringent.

complementary view setting provides a practical way to identify perspectively
deformed structures by assessing the deviation between the two views. It also
provides bounding information and reduces uncertainty for learning perspective
deformation. Two representative networks Pix2pixGAN and TransU-Net for
correcting perspective deformation are investigated. Experiments on numerical
bead phantom data demonstrate the advantage of complementary views over
orthogonal views or a single view. They show that Pix2pixGAN as a fully

space, while TransU-Net as a transformer-based hybrid network achieves
comparable performance in Cartesian space to polar space. Further study
demonstrates that the trained model has certain tolerance to geometric

threat to humans worldwide, creating a health crisis that infected millions of
lives, as well as devastating the global economy. Deep learning (DL) techniques
have proved helpful in analysis and delineation of infectious regions in
radiological images in a timely manner. This paper makes an in-depth survey of
DL techniques and draws a taxonomy based on diagnostic strategies and learning
approaches. DL techniques are systematically categorized into classification,
segmentation, and multi-stage approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis at image and
region level analysis. Each category includes pre-trained and custom-made
Convolutional Neural Network architectures for detecting COVID-19 infection in
radiographic imaging modalities; X-Ray, and Computer Tomography (CT).
Furthermore, a discussion is made on challenges in developing diagnostic
techniques such as cross-platform interoperability and examining imaging
modality. Similarly, a review of the various methodologies and performance
measures used in these techniques is also presented. This survey provides an
insight into the promising areas of research in DL for analyzing radiographic
images, and further accelerates the research in designing customized DL based
diagnostic tools for effectively dealing with new variants of COVID-19 and
emerging challenges.

including the biomedical one. The aim of this paper is to investigate the
important concept of schedulers in manipulating the learning rate (LR), for the
liver segmentation task, throughout the training process, focusing on the newly
devised OneCycleLR against the ReduceLRonPlateau. A dataset, published in 2018
and produced by the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge organizers, called
Task 8 Hepatic Vessel (MSDC-T8) has been used for testing and validation. The
reported results that have the same number of maximum epochs (75), and are the
average of 5-fold cross-validation, indicate that ReduceLRonPlateau converges
faster while maintaining a similar or even better loss score on the validation
set when compared to OneCycleLR. The epoch at which the peak LR occurs perhaps
should be made early for the OneCycleLR such that the super-convergence feature
can be observed. Moreover, the overall results outperform the state-of-the-art
results from the researchers who published the liver masks for this dataset. To
conclude, both schedulers are suitable for medical segmentation challenges,
especially the MSDC-T8 dataset, and can be used confidently in rapidly
converging the validation loss with a minimal number of epochs.

propose updating using a `holdout set' -- a subset of the population that does
not receive risk-score-guided interventions -- to prevent this. Since samples
in the holdout set do not benefit from risk predictions, its size must trade
off performance of the updated risk score whilst minimising the number of held
out samples. We prove that this approach outperforms simple alternatives, and
by defining a general loss function describe conditions under which an optimal
holdout size (OHS) can be readily identified. We introduce parametric and
semi-parametric algorithms for OHS estimation and demonstrate their use on a
recent risk score for pre-eclampsia. Based on these results, we argue that a
holdout set is a safe, viable and easily implemented means to safely update
predictive risk scores.

powerful modeling capability for a lot of problems from diverse domains.
Applications of these problems occur in many applied areas, such as robust

machine learning such as empirical risk minimization and generative adversarial
networks training. Therefore, many researchers have actively worked on
developing numerical methods for solving saddle point problems in many
different settings. This paper is devoted to developing a numerical method for
solving saddle point problems in the non-convex uniformly-concave setting. We
study a general class of saddle point problems with composite structure and
H\""older-continuous higher-order derivatives. To solve the problem under
consideration, we propose an approach in which we reduce the problem to a
combination of two auxiliary optimization problems separately for each group of
variables, outer minimization problem w.r.t. primal variables, and inner
maximization problem w.r.t the dual variables. For solving the outer
minimization problem, we use the \textit{Adaptive Gradient Method}, which is
applicable for non-convex problems and also works with an inexact oracle that
is generated by approximately solving the inner problem. For solving the inner
maximization problem, we use the \textit{Restarted Unified Acceleration
Framework}, which is a framework that unifies the high-order acceleration
methods for minimizing a convex function that has H\""older-continuous
higher-order derivatives. Separate complexity bounds are provided for the
number of calls to the first-order oracles for the outer minimization problem
and higher-order oracles for the inner maximization problem. Moreover, the
complexity of the whole proposed approach is then estimated.

determine the compatibility or incompatibility of the corresponding model with

learn backdoor behaviors, which is known as the natural backdoor. Existing
works on anti-backdoor learning are based on weak observations that the
backdoor and benign behaviors can differentiate during training. An adaptive
attack with slow poisoning can bypass such defenses. Moreover, these methods
cannot defend natural backdoors. We found the fundamental differences between
backdoor-related neurons and benign neurons: backdoor-related neurons form a
hyperplane as the classification surface across input domains of all affected
labels. By further analyzing the training process and model architectures, we
found that piece-wise linear functions cause this hyperplane surface. In this
paper, we design a novel training method that forces the training to avoid
generating such hyperplanes and thus remove the injected backdoors. Our
extensive experiments on five datasets against five state-of-the-art attacks

series, direct and inverse problems in partial differential equations, and
uncertainty quantification lead to the question of approximation of a
non-linear operator between metric spaces $\mathfrak{X}$ and $\mathfrak{Y}$. We
study the problem of determining the degree of approximation of such operators
on a compact subset $K_\mathfrak{X}\subset \mathfrak{X}$ using a finite amount
of information. If $\mathcal{F}: K_\mathfrak{X}\to K_\mathfrak{Y}$, a well
established strategy to approximate $\mathcal{F}(F)$ for some $F\in
K_\mathfrak{X}$ is to encode $F$ (respectively, $\mathcal{F}(F)$) in terms of a
finite number $d$ (repectively $m$) of real numbers. Together with appropriate
reconstruction algorithms (decoders), the problem reduces to the approximation
of $m$ functions on a compact subset of a high dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, equivalently, the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$ embedded in
$\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. The problem is challenging because $d$, $m$, as well as the
complexity of the approximation on $\mathbb{S}^d$ are all large, and it is
necessary to estimate the accuracy keeping track of the inter-dependence of all
the approximations involved. In this paper, we establish constructive methods
to do this efficiently; i.e., with the constants involved in the estimates on
the approximation on $\mathbb{S}^d$ being $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/6})$. We study
different smoothness classes for the operators, and also propose a method for
approximation of $\mathcal{F}(F)$ using only information in a small
neighborhood of $F$, resulting in an effective reduction in the number of
parameters involved.

dedicated IRL framework for MFGs that can handle both cooperative and

nanoparticles (rectangular graphene flakes, spherical fullerenes of size $L<10$
nm) on the surface of a thermalized graphene sheet lying on a flat substrate
can be described as the motion of particles in a viscous medium with a constant
coefficient of friction, the value of which depends on the temperature and
particle size. It has been shown that there are two types of effective
friction: diffusion and ballistic. In ballistic regime of motion (at velocities
$v>100$ m/s), deceleration occurs due to the interaction of moving
nanoparticles with thermal out-of-plane bending vibrations of a graphene sheet.
Because of this, with the increasing temperature, the coefficient of friction
monotonically increases. In the diffusion regime of motion (at $v<10$ m/s),
friction arises due to the need for the particle to overcome local energy
barriers, therefore it decreases with increasing emperature. The difference
between ballistic and diffusion friction is most pronounced at low
temperatures, since the mobility of nanoparticles in the ballistic regime of
motion decreases with increasing temperature, while in the diffusion regime it
monotonously increases. It is shown that the presence of a normal force
pressing the nanoparticle to the substrate leads to an increases in its
friction with the substrate.

real-world scenarios, audios are usually contaminated by off-screen sound and
background noise. They will interfere with the procedure of identifying desired
sources and building visual-sound connections, making previous studies
non-applicable. In this work, we propose the Interference Eraser (IEr)
framework, which tackles the problem of audio-visual sound source localization
in the wild. The key idea is to eliminate the interference by redefining and
carving discriminative audio representations. Specifically, we observe that the
previous practice of learning only a single audio representation is
insufficient due to the additive nature of audio signals. We thus extend the
audio representation with our Audio-Instance-Identifier module, which clearly
distinguishes sounding instances when audio signals of different volumes are
unevenly mixed. Then we erase the influence of the audible but off-screen
sounds and the silent but visible objects by a Cross-modal Referrer module with
cross-modality distillation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior results on sound
localization tasks, especially under real-world scenarios. Code is available at

coalition of voters is negligible in a large election. Consequently, there is a
large body of literature on characterizing the likelihood for an election to be
influenced when the votes follow certain distributions, especially the
likelihood of being manipulable by a single voter under the i.i.d. uniform
distribution, known as the Impartial Culture (IC).
  In this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we propose a
more general semi-random model, where a distribution adversary chooses a
worst-case distribution and then a contamination adversary modifies up to
$\psi$ portion of the data, (2) we consider many coalitional influence
problems, including coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various
vote controls and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition
size $B$. Our main theorem provides asymptotically tight bounds on the
semi-random likelihood of the existence of a size-$B$ coalition that can
successfully influence the election under a wide range of voting rules.
Applications of the main theorem and its proof techniques resolve long-standing
open questions about the likelihood of coalitional manipulability under IC, by
showing that the likelihood is $\Theta\left(\min\left\{\frac{B}{\sqrt n},
1\right\}\right)$ for many commonly-studied voting rules.
  The main technical contribution is a characterization of the semi-random
likelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable (PMV) to be unstable, which we
believe to be a general and useful technique with independent interest.

field of such targets has been poorly characterized so far. Gravity estimates
can be used to infer the internal structure and composition of small bodies
and, as such, have strong implications in the fields of planetary science,
planetary defense, and in-situ resource utilization. Current gravimetry
techniques at small bodies mostly rely on tracking the spacecraft orbital
motion, where the gravity observability is low. To date, only lower-degree and
order spherical harmonics of small-body gravity fields could be resolved. In
this paper, we evaluate gravimetry performance for a novel mission architecture
where artificial probes repeatedly hop across the surface of the small body and
perform low-altitude, suborbital arcs. Such probes are tracked using optical
measurements from the mothership's onboard camera and orbit determination is
performed to estimate the probe trajectories, the small body's rotational
kinematics, and the gravity field. The suborbital motion of the probes provides
dense observations at low altitude, where the gravity signal is stronger. We
assess the impact of observation parameters and mission duration on gravity
observability. Results suggest that the gravitational spherical harmonics of a
small body with the same mass as the asteroid Bennu, can be observed at least
up to degree 40 within months of observations. Measurement precision and
frequency are key to achieve high-performance gravimetry.

of the design of experiment schemes for the Physics-Informed Neural Network

differential equations (PDEs) do not have any analytical solution; only
numerical methods are used to solve the equations, which is computationally

numerical methods to reduce the computational budget. PINN uses physical
information in the form of differential equations to enhance the performance of
the neural networks. Though it works efficiently, the choice of the design of
experiment scheme is important as the accuracy of the predicted responses using
PINN depends on the training data. In this study, five different PDEs are used
for numerical purposes, i.e., viscous Burger's equation, Shr\""{o}dinger

utilizes the concept of dynamic time windows to accumulate tasks and find an
optimal stable matching between accumulated tasks and available processor cores
using a modified Gale-Shapely algorithm. The metrics of window and matching
performance are defined to create a dynamic window heuristic to determine the
next time window size based on the current and previous window sizes. Based on

is able to distribute the computational and thermal load throughout the

disperse system load and prevent excess core heating.

131) in various HNC xenograft mouse models and the impact of partial volume
correction on theranostic dosimetry based on 124I-CLR1404 (CLR 124) PET/CT

cell line- and 6 human patient-derived) were intravenously administered 6.5-9.1
MBq of CLR 124 and imaged five times over the course of six days using
microPET/CT. In vivo tumor uptake of CLR 124 was assessed and partial volume
corrections (PVC) for 124I were applied using a novel preclinical phantom.
Using subject-specific theranostic dosimetry estimations for CLR 131 based on
CLR 124 imaging, a discrete radiation dose escalation study was performed to
evaluate tumor growth response to CLR 131 relative to a single fraction of XRT.
Results: PET imaging demonstrated consistent tumor selective uptake and
retention of CLR 124 across all HNC xenograft models. Peak uptake of 4.4 +/-
0.8% and 4.2 +/- 0.4% was observed in SCC-22B and UW-13, respectively. PVC
application increased uptake measures by 47-188% and reduced absolute
differences between in vivo and ex vivo uptake measurements from 3.3 to 1.0
%IA/g. Tumor dosimetry averaged over all HNC models was 0.85 +/- 0.27 Gy/MBq
(1.58 +/- 0.46 Gy/MBq with PVC). Therapeutic CLR 131 studies demonstrated a
variable, but linear relationship between CLR 131 radiation dose and tumor

on time-varying graph signal recovery focus on online estimation and graph
learning based on the assumption that the entire dynamic graphs are not

the entire dynamically changing graph structure have not been well studied. On

dynamic graphs can be easily generated using simple algorithms such as
k-nearest neighbor by exploiting information on time-varying spatial sensor

signal recovery as a constrained convex optimization problem that
simultaneously estimates both time-varying graph signals and sparsely modeled

missing values with known positions and unknown outliers, to achieve robust

powerlines. To enable continuous, robust inspection without human intervention,
the robots must be able to perch on the powerlines to recharge their batteries.
Highly versatile perching capabilities are necessary to adapt to the variety of
configurations and constraints that are present in real powerline systems. This
paper presents a novel perching trajectory generation framework that computes
perception-aware, collision-free, and dynamically-feasible maneuvers to guide
the robot to the desired final state. Trajectory generation is achieved via
solving a Nonlinear Programming problem using the Primal-Dual Interior Point
method. The problem considers the full dynamic model of the robot down to its
single rotor thrusts and minimizes the final pose and velocity errors while
avoiding collisions and maximizing the visibility of the powerline during the
maneuver. The generated maneuvers consider both the perching and the posterior
recovery trajectories. The framework adopts costs and constraints defined by
efficient mathematical representations of powerlines, enabling online onboard
execution in resource-constrained hardware. The method is validated on-board an
agile quadrotor conducting powerline inspection and various perching maneuvers
with final pitch values of up to 180 degrees. The developed code is available

network to support heterogeneous requirements of generic services, namely
ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband

optimize the performance of URLLC and eMBB services. In a large time-scale, an
SDN controller allocates radio resources to gNodeBs according to the
requirements of the eMBB and URLLC services. In a short time-scale, each gNodeB
allocates its available resources to its end-users and requests, if needed,
additional resources from adjacent gNodeBs. We formulate this problem as a
non-linear binary program and prove its NP-hardness. Next, for each time-scale,
we model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the large-time
scale is modeled as a single agent MDP whereas the shorter time-scale is
modeled as a multi-agent MDP. We leverage the exponential-weight algorithm for
exploration and exploitation (EXP3) to solve the single-agent MDP of the large
time-scale MDP and the multi-agent deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm to solve the
multi-agent MDP of the short time-scale resource allocation. Extensive

exciting quantum materials, typically insulators. Here we report dimerization
and CO within the dimers coexisting in metallic NaRu$_2$O$_4$. By combining
high-resolution x-ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations, we
demonstrate that this unique phenomenon occurs through a new type of bonding,

dimerization in legs of zigzag ladders, with short dimers in legs connected by
short zigzag bonds, forming Z-shape clusters: simultaneously, site-centered

the way for flexible sharing of network resources by introducing more

significant challenges, especially in fast-responding network-edge AI
applications. Fortunately, the convolution theorem can be executed on-the-fly
in the optical domain via a joint transform correlator (JTC) offering to
fundamentally reduce the computational complexity. Nonetheless, the iterative
two-step process of a classical JTC renders them unpractical. Here we introduce
a novel implementation of an optical convolution-processor capable of near-zero
latency by utilizing all-optical nonlinearity inside a JTC, thus minimizing
electronic signal or conversion delay. Fundamentally we show how this nonlinear
auto-correlator enables reducing the high $O(n^4)$ scaling complexity of
processing two-dimensional data to only $O(n^2)$. Moreover, this optical JTC
processes millions of channels in time-parallel, ideal for large-matrix machine
learning tasks. Exemplary utilizing the nonlinear process of four-wave mixing,
we show light processing performing a full convolution that is temporally
limited only by geometric features of the lens and the nonlinear material's
response time. We further discuss that the all-optical nonlinearity exhibits
gain in excess of $>10^{3}$ when enhanced by slow-light effects such as
epsilon-near-zero. Such novel implementation for a machine learning accelerator
featuring low-latency and non-iterative massive data parallelism enabled by
fundamental reduced complexity scaling bears significant promise for

polarization effect. We witness that in the presence of the given zeta
potential, an enhancement of ion size invariably lowers the electroosmotic
velocity, thereby increasing the magnitude of electrostatic potential,
irrespective of considering solvent polarization. It is also proved that
solvent polarization allows both the magnitude of electrostatic potential and
the electroosmotic velocities to decrease. In addition, we find that increasing
zeta potential augments not only ion size effect but also solvent polarization
effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decreasing bulk ion number density
causes an increase in electroosmotic velocity at the centerline. We compare the
properties of aqueous electrolytes with those of the electrolytes where solvent
is ethylalcohol. Finally, we study how solvent polarization and ionic size

(mmWave) communications, effective beamforming schemes are required which
incorporate narrow beams with high beamforming gains. The mmWave channel
consists of a few spatial clusters each associated with an angle of departure
(AoD). The narrow beams must be aligned with the channel AoDs to increase the
beamforming gain. This is achieved through a procedure called beam alignment
(BA). Most of the BA schemes in the literature consider channels with a single
dominant path while in practice the channel has a few resolvable paths with
different AoDs, hence, such BA schemes may not work correctly in the presence
of multi-path or at the least do not exploit such multipath to achieve
diversity or increase robustness.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient BA scheme in presence of multi-path.
The proposed BA scheme transmits probing packets using a set of scanning beams
and receives feedback for all the scanning beams at the end of the probing
phase from each user. We formulate the BA scheme as minimizing the expected
value of the average transmission beamwidth under different policies. The
policy is defined as a function from the set of received feedback to the set of
transmission beams (TB). In order to maximize the number of possible feedback
sequences, we prove that the set of scanning beams (SB) has a special form,
namely, Tulip Design. Consequently, we rewrite the minimization problem with a
set of linear constraints and a reduced number of variables which is solved by
using an efficient greedy algorithm.

systematically by varying the strain rate and system size. Here the strain rate
varies over four orders of magnitude and the system size varies from ten
thousand to more than a million granules. A strain rate-dependent transition
from quasistatic to purely inertial flow is observed. At the macroscopic scale,
the contact stresses drop due to the formation of shear-induced instabilities
that serves as an onset of granular flows and initiates mixing between the
granules. The stress-drop displays a profound system size dependence. At the
granular scale, mixing dynamics are correlated with the formation of shear
bands, which result in significantly different timescales of mixing, especially
for those regions that are close to the system walls and the bulk. Overall, our
results reveal that although the transient dynamics display a generic behavior

synthetic data usually has lower quality than real data, and using synthetic

we propose a data generation framework with two methods to improve CL training

generates hard samples for the main model. The generator is jointly learned
with the main model to dynamically customize hard samples based on the training
state of the main model. Besides, a pair of data generators are proposed to
generate similar but distinct samples as positive pairs. In joint learning, the
hardness of a positive pair is progressively increased by decreasing their
similarity. Experimental results on multiple datasets show superior accuracy

quartic interaction due to the scalar mesons, $\sigma^{2}\mathbf{\delta}^{2}$,
is taken into account to investigate the density dependence of nuclear symmetry
energy, $E_{\rm sym}$, and the neutron-star properties. It is found that the
$\delta$ meson increases $E_{\rm sym}$ at high densities, whereas the
$\sigma$-$\delta$ mixing makes $E_{\rm sym}$ soft above the saturation density.
Furthermore, the $\delta$ meson and its mixing have a large influence on the
radius and tidal deformability of a neutron star. In particular, the
$\sigma$-$\delta$ mixing reduces the neutron-star radius, and, thus, the
present calculation can simultaneously reproduce the dimensionless tidal
deformabilities of a canonical $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron star observed from the
binary neutron star merger, GW170817, and from the compact binary coalescence,

multitude of science applications. Only a small number ($\lesssim200$) of solar
twins are known today, all of which are relatively close to our Sun
($\lesssim800\,pc$). The goal of our Survey for Distant Solar Twins (SDST) is
to identify many more solar twin and solar analogue stars out to much larger
distances ($\sim4\,kpc$). In this paper, we present a new method to identify
solar twins using relatively low $S/N$, medium resolving power ($R\sim
28{,}000$) spectra that will be typical of such distant targets observed with
HERMES on the $3.9\,m$ Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). We developed a novel
approach, namely EPIC, to measure stellar parameters which we use to identify
stars similar to our Sun. EPIC determines the stellar atmospheric parameters
(effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, surface gravity $\log g$ and
metallicity [Fe/H]) using differential equivalent width (EW) measurements of
selected spectroscopic absorption features and a simple model, trained on
previously analysed spectra, that connects these EWs to the stellar parameters.
The reference for the EW measurements is a high $S/N$ solar spectrum which is
used to minimise several systematic effects. EPIC is fast, optimised for
Sun-like stars and yields stellar parameter measurements with small enough
uncertainties to enable spectroscopic identification of solar twin and analogue
stars up to $\sim4\,kpc$ away using AAT/HERMES, i.e.\
$\sigma\left(T_{\mathrm{eff}}, \log g, \textrm{[Fe/H]}\right) = \left(50\,K,

the coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture, which consists of retrieving
top-N candidates using global features, and re-ranking top-N with local
features. However, since the two types of features are usually processed
independently, re-ranking may harm global retrieval, termed re-ranking
confusion. Moreover, re-ranking is limited by global retrieval. In this paper,
we propose a tightly coupled learning (TCL) strategy to train triplet models.
Different from original triplet learning (OTL) strategy, it combines global and
local descriptors for joint optimization. In addition, a bidirectional search
dynamic time warping (BS-DTW) algorithm is also proposed to mine locally
spatial information tailored to VPR in re-ranking. The experimental results on
public benchmarks show that the models using TCL outperform the models using
OTL, and TCL can be used as a general strategy to improve performance for
weakly supervised ranking tasks. Further, our lightweight unified model is
better than several state-of-the-art methods and has over an order of magnitude
of computational efficiency to meet the real-time requirements of robots.

This opacity may lead to distrust in their prediction and hamper their wider
adoption in safety-critical applications. In recent, the program reduction
technique is widely being used to identify key input features in order to
explain the prediction of CI models. The approach removes irrelevant parts from
an input program and keeps the minimal snippets that a CI model needs to
maintain its prediction. However, the state-of-the-art approaches mainly use a
syntax-unaware program reduction technique that does not follow the syntax of
programs, which adds significant overhead to the reduction of input programs
and explainability of models. In this paper, we apply a syntax-guided program
reduction technique that follows the syntax of input programs during reduction.
Our experiments on multiple models across different types of input programs
show that the syntax-guided program reduction technique significantly
outperforms the syntax-unaware program reduction technique in reducing the size
of input programs. Extracting key input features from reduced programs reveals
that the syntax-guided reduced programs contain more label-specific key input
features and are more vulnerable to adversarial transformation when renaming
the key tokens in programs. These label-specific key input features may help to
understand the reasoning of models' prediction from different perspectives and
increase the trustworthiness to correct classification given by CI models.

is inspired by the classic artificial neural network (ANN) but for different
usages. Instead of being used as a data-driven classifier, a MNN serves as a
modeling tool with artfully defined inputs, outputs, and activation functions
which have explicit physical meanings. Owing to the same layered form as an
ANN, a MNN can also be optimized using the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. As
an interesting application, the classic problem of line spectral estimation can
be modeled by a MNN. We propose to first initialize the MNN by the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) based spectral estimation, and then optimize the MNN by the BP
algorithm, which automatically yields the maximum likelihood (ML) parameter
estimation of the frequency spectrum. We also design a method of merging and
pruning the hidden-layer nodes of the MNN, which can be used for model-order
selection, i.e., to estimate the number of sinusoids. Numerical simulations
verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

silicates and Fe-Ni metals. The mesosiderite silicates and metals are
considered to have originated from the crust and metal core, respectively, of a
differentiated asteroid. In contrast, mesosiderites rarely contain the olivine
that is mainly included in a mantle. Although a giant impact onto a
differentiated asteroid is considered to be a probable mechanism to mix crust
and metal materials to form mesosiderites, it is not obvious how such a giant
impact can form mesosiderite-like materials without including mantle materials.
We conducted numerical simulations of giant impacts onto differentiated
asteroids, using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, to investigate the
detailed distribution of mixed materials on the resultant bodies. For the
internal structure of a target body, we used a thin-crust model derived from
the magma ocean crystallization model of the asteroid Vesta and a thick-crust
and a large-core model suggested from the proximity observation of Vesta by the
Dawn probe. In the simulations with the former model, excavation of the metal
core requires nearly catastrophic impacts and mantle is exposed over large
surface areas. Thus, stony-iron materials produced on its surface are likely to
include mantle materials and it is difficult to produce mesosiderite-like
materials. Conversely, in the simulations with the latter model, mantle
materials are exposed only at impact sites, even when the impacts excavate the
metal core, and the formation of a surface with little mantle material and the
formation of mesosiderite-like materials are possible. Therefore, our
simulations suggest that an internal structure with a thick crust and a large
core is more likely as a mesosiderite parent body rather than the thin-crust
internal structure inferred from the conventional magma ocean model.

various OSCs including those with high ionization energy (IE=5.8 eV). Moreover,
this doping mechanism endows trityl cation with strong doping ability, leading

time-consuming and resource-intensive particularly in view of the need to visit
the dataset multiple times. In contrast, analytic learning attempts to obtain
the weights in one epoch. However, existing attempts to analytic learning
considered only the multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this article, we propose an
analytic convolutional neural network learning (ACnnL). Theoretically we show
that ACnnL builds a closed-form solution similar to its MLP counterpart, but
differs in their regularization constraints. Consequently, we are able to
answer to a certain extent why CNNs usually generalize better than MLPs from
the implicit regularization point of view. The ACnnL is validated by conducting
classification tasks on several benchmark datasets. It is encouraging that the
ACnnL trains CNNs in a significantly fast manner with reasonably close
prediction accuracies to those using BP. Moreover, our experiments disclose a
unique advantage of ACnnL under the small-sample scenario when training data
are scarce or expensive.

methods have been proposed for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation from the

clinical experts to mitigate the personal bias. However, it is hard to train
the automated deep learning models on multiple labels. A common practice to
tackle the issue is majority vote, e.g., taking the average of multiple labels.
However such a strategy ignores the different expertness of medical experts.
Motivated by the observation that OD/OC segmentation is often used for the
glaucoma diagnosis clinically, in this paper, we propose a novel strategy to
fuse the multi-rater OD/OC segmentation labels via the glaucoma diagnosis
performance. Specifically, we assess the expertness of each rater through an
attentive glaucoma diagnosis network. For each rater, its contribution for the
diagnosis will be reflected as an expertness map. To ensure the expertness maps
are general for different glaucoma diagnosis models, we further propose an
Expertness Generator (ExpG) to eliminate the high-frequency components in the
optimization process. Based on the obtained expertness maps, the multi-rater
labels can be fused as a single ground-truth which we dubbed as Diagnosis First
Ground-truth (DiagFirstGT). Experimental results show that by using DiagFirstGT
as ground-truth, OD/OC segmentation networks will predict the masks with
superior glaucoma diagnosis performance.

performance in computer vision tasks with a simple architecture and relatively
small computational cost. Their success in maintaining computation efficiency
is mainly attributed to avoiding the use of self-attention that is often
computationally heavy, yet this is at the expense of not being able to mix
tokens both globally and locally. In this paper, to exploit both global and
local dependencies without self-attention, we present Mix-Shift-MLP (MS-MLP)
which makes the size of the local receptive field used for mixing increase with
respect to the amount of spatial shifting. In addition to conventional mixing
and shifting techniques, MS-MLP mixes both neighboring and distant tokens from
fine- to coarse-grained levels and then gathers them via a shifting operation.
This directly contributes to the interactions between global and local tokens.
Being simple to implement, MS-MLP achieves competitive performance in multiple
vision benchmarks. For example, an MS-MLP with 85 million parameters achieves
83.8% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Moreover, by combining
MS-MLP with state-of-the-art Vision Transformers such as the Swin Transformer,
we show MS-MLP achieves further improvements on three different model scales,

Challenge to encourage the development of fundus \& OCT-based glaucoma grading.
The primary task of the challenge is to grade glaucoma from both the 2D fundus

a glaucoma annotated dataset with both 2D fundus color photography and 3D OCT

scale dependence is analyzed by counting all pairs on different scales $r$.
Redshift dependence is studied via generalized kurtosis. From this analysis, we
can demonstrate: i) Delaunay tessellation can be used to reconstruct density
field. Density correlations/spectrum are obtained, modeled and compared with
theory; ii) $m$th moment of pairwise velocity can be analytically modelled. On
small scale, even order moments can be modelled by a two-thirds law
$\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n}\rangle\propto{(-\epsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$, while odd order
moments $\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n+1}\rangle=(2n+1)\langle(\Delta

different with its moments analytically derived; v) On large scale, both

  In the first part, we analyze implementable computation over a given quantum
network resource by introducing a new concept, quantum network coding for
quantum computation. We consider a setting of networks where quantum
communication for each edge of a network is restricted to sending one-qubit,
but classical communication is unrestricted. Specifically, we analyze
implementable $k$-qubit unitary operations over a certain class of networks,
called cluster networks. We show that any two-qubit unitary operation is
implementable over the butterfly network and the grail network, which are
fundamental primitive networks for network coding. We also obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions for the probabilistic implementability of unitary
operations over cluster networks.
  In the second part, we investigate resource tradeoffs in DQC. First, we show
that entanglement required for local state discrimination can be substituted by
less entanglement by increasing the rounds of classical communication. Second,
we develop a new framework of deterministic joint quantum operations by using a
causal relation between the outputs and inputs of the local operations without
predefined causal order, called ""classical communication"" without predefined
causal order (CC*). We show that local operations and CC* (LOCC*) is equivalent
to the separable operation (SEP). This result indicates that
entanglement-assisted LOCC implementing SEP can be simulated by LOCC* without
entanglement. We also investigate the relationship between LOCC* and another
formalism for deterministic joint quantum operations without assuming
predefined causal order based on the quantum process formalism. As a result, we
construct an example of non-LOCC SEP by using LOCC*.

guided Transformer, named SCRIPT. SCRIPT first obtains the structural relative
positions between tokens via parsing the ASTs of source code, and then passes
them into two types of Transformer encoders. One Transformer directly adjusts
the input according to the structural relative distance; and the other
Transformer encodes the structural relative positions during computing the
self-attention scores. Finally, we stack these two types of Transformer
encoders to learn representations of source code. Experimental results show
that the proposed SCRIPT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least
1.6%, 1.4% and 2.8% with respect to BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR on benchmark
datasets, respectively. We further show that how the proposed SCRIPT captures
the structural relative dependencies.

semigroup $\mathcal{S}$, generated by a collection ${\mathscr{G}}.$ Using them,
we show that the positive (or negative) Julia set of the semigroup
$\mathcal{S}$, i.e., $\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{S}}^+$ (or
$\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{S}}^-$) is equal to the closure of the union of
individual positive (or negative) Julia sets of the maps, in the semigroup
$\mathcal{S}$. Furthermore, we prove that $\mu_{\mathscr{G}}^+$ is supported on
the whole of $\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{S}}^+$ and is also the unique positive

semi-invariance relation that depends on the generating set ${\mathscr{G}}$.
  Secondly, we study the dynamics of a non-autonomous sequence of H\'{e}non

Further, we use the properties of Green's function to conclude that the
non-autonomous attracting basin of any such sequence $\{h_k\}$, sharing a
common attracting fixed point, is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^2.$

this, there is a growing focus on curating benchmark datasets that capture

that many of them only contain a small number of shifts and they lack
systematic annotation about what is different across different shifts. We
present MetaShift--a collection of 12,868 sets of natural images across 410
classes--to address this challenge. We leverage the natural heterogeneity of
Visual Genome and its annotations to construct MetaShift. The key construction
idea is to cluster images using its metadata, which provides context for each
image (e.g. ""cats with cars"" or ""cats in bathroom"") that represent distinct
data distributions. MetaShift has two important benefits: first, it contains
orders of magnitude more natural data shifts than previously available. Second,
it provides explicit explanations of what is unique about each of its data sets
and a distance score that measures the amount of distribution shift between any
two of its data sets. We demonstrate the utility of MetaShift in benchmarking
several recent proposals for training models to be robust to data shifts. We
find that the simple empirical risk minimization performs the best when shifts
are moderate and no method had a systematic advantage for large shifts. We also
show how MetaShift can help to visualize conflicts between data subsets during
model training.

non-parametric Bayesian model called the infinite Gaussian mixture model

that it better fits iGMM clustering, based on a novel clustering loss based on
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Experimental results based on CALLHOME data show
that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach in terms of

to overfit the training data, while still achieving a good test performance.
This phenomenon is referred to as ""benign overfitting"". Recently, there emerges
a line of works studying ""benign overfitting"" from the theoretical perspective.
However, they are limited to linear models or kernel/random feature models, and
there is still a lack of theoretical understanding about when and how benign
overfitting occurs in neural networks. In this paper, we study the benign
overfitting phenomenon in training a two-layer convolutional neural network

condition, a two-layer CNN trained by gradient descent can achieve arbitrarily
small training and test loss. On the other hand, when this condition does not
hold, overfitting becomes harmful and the obtained CNN can only achieve a
constant level test loss. These together demonstrate a sharp phase transition
between benign overfitting and harmful overfitting, driven by the
signal-to-noise ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that precisely characterizes the conditions under which benign overfitting can
occur in training convolutional neural networks.

nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven Kondo-lattice model on a
triangular lattice. In the system away from the half filling with ferromagnetic
ground state, the photoexcitation of conduction electrons and the photoinduced
renormalization of bandwidth cause reconstruction of band structure and
subsequent redistribution of the electrons through relaxations, which result in
an electronic structure similar to that in the half-filled system at
equilibrium, where the 120-degree spin order is stabilized. In this
photoinduced 120-degree spin ordered phase, domains of different spin-ordered
planes are formed, and vortices of spin chirality vectors called $Z_2$ vortices
appear at points where multiple domains meet. We also discuss favorable
conditions and experimental feasibility to observe the predicted photoinduced
magnetic phase transition by investigating dependencies on the light parameters
(amplitude, frequency, and polarization), the electron filling, the strength of
Kondo coupling, and the effects of antiferromagnetic coupling among the

influences which neuron populations are activated preferentially as well as the

clicking sound. However, the available TMS pulse shape repertoire is still very
limited to a few pulses with sinusoidal or near-rectangular shapes. Monophasic
pulses, though found to be more selective and stronger in neuromodulation, are
generated inefficiently and therefore only available in simple low-frequency
repetitive protocols. Despite a strong interest to exploit the temporal effects
of TMS pulse shapes and pulse sequences, waveform control is relatively
inflexible and only possible parametrically within certain limits. Previously
proposed approaches for flexible pulse shape control, such as through power
electronic inverters, have significant limitations: Existing semiconductor
switches can fail under the immense electrical stress associated with free
pulse shaping, and most conventional power inverter topologies are incapable of
generating smooth electric fields or existing pulse shapes. Leveraging
intensive preliminary work on modular power electronics, we present a modular
pulse synthesizer (MPS) technology that can, for the first time, flexibly
generate high-power TMS pulses with user-defined electric field shape as well
as rapid sequences of pulses with high output quality. The circuit topology
breaks the problem of simultaneous high power and switching speed into smaller,

solve due to the non-convex SINR constraints as well as the unit-modulus phase

coefficients are derived from a general spatial regression model based on
standardized variables. The spatial auto- and lag-regression coefficients are
reduced to a series of statistic parameters and measurements, including
conventional regressive coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, Moran's
indexes, spatial cross-correlation coefficients, and the variance of prediction
residuals. The formulae show determinate inherent relationships between spatial
correlation coefficients and spatial regression coefficients. New finding is as
below: the spatial autoregressive coefficient mainly depends on the Moran's
index of the independent variable, while the spatial lag-regressive coefficient
chiefly depends on the cross-correlation coefficient of independent variable
and dependent variable. The observational data of an urban system in Beijing,
Tianjin, and Hebei region of China were employed to verify the newly derived

ingredient to describe its non-equilibrium properties. We present a general
method to calculate exactly the dynamical correlations of hard-core anyons in
one-dimensional lattices, valid for any type of confining potential and any
temperature. We obtain exact explicit expressions of the Green's function, the
spectral function, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). We find
that the anyonic spectral function displays three main singularity lines which
can be explained as a double spectrum in analogy to the Lieb-Liniger gas. The
dispersion relations of these lines can be given explicitly and they cross at a
\emph{hot point} $(q_m,\omega_m)$, which induces a peak in the momentum
distribution function at $q_m$ and a power-law singularity in the local
spectral function at $\omega_m$. We also find that the anyonic statistics can
induces spatial asymmetry in the Green's function, its spectrum, and the OTOC.
Moreover, the information spreading characterized by the OTOCs shows light-cone
dynamics, asymmetric for general statistics and low temperatures, but symmetric
at infinite temperature. Our results pave the way toward studying the
non-equilibrium dynamics of hard-core anyons and experimentally probing anyonic

Such environments are modeled as discrete Markov decision processes with both

straightforward nominal version of non-deterministic automata, RNNAs feature
ordinary as well as name binding transitions. Correspondingly, words accepted
by RNNAs are strings formed by ordinary letters and name binding letters. Bar
languages are sets of such words modulo $\alpha$-equivalence, and to every

semantics of NOFAs and RNNAs, respectively, arise both as an instance of the
Kleisli-style coalgebraic trace semantics as well as an instance of the
coalgebraic language semantics obtained via generalized determinization. On the
way we revisit coalgebraic trace semantics in general and give a new compact
proof for the main result in that theory stating that an initial algebra for a

Here, by coupling particle-in-cell and Monte Carlo numerical simulations, we
examine possible strategies to optimise neutron sources from ion-induced

acceleration, the laser-irradiated targets are chosen to be ultrathin solid
foils, either standing alone or preceded by a plasma layer of near-critical
density to enhance the laser focusing. We compare the performance of these
single- and double-layer targets, and determine their optimum parameters in
terms of energy and angular spectra of the accelerated ions. These are then
sent into a converter to generate neutrons via nuclear reactions on beryllium

converters or instantaneous neutron fluxes above $10^{23}\,\rm

significance of effective angle of attack and the projected area of the foil
has been emphasized in explaining the dynamics of lift and drag forces and
their relationship with the propulsion. We next investigate the relation
between the streamwise gap and kinematic parameters on propulsion for the
tandem foil system. We show that the propulsive performance strongly depends on
the upstream wake interacting with the downstream foil, and the timing of the
interaction due to the gap between the foils. Through a control volume
analysis, the time-averaged pressure and streamwise velocity have been
investigated to explain the effect of kinematic parameters on the hydrodynamic
forces. Typically in the literature, the formation of jet in the wake has been
attributed to thrust generation. However, in this study, we emphasize and show
the significance of the time-averaged pressure in the wake apart from the
streamwise velocity (jet) for predicting the thrust forces. The study is
concluded with a three-dimensional demonstration of the tandem foils to
understand the possible three-dimensional effects due to the large amplitude

different target materials. The time structure of the 18~MeV proton beam was
shaped with a series of beam-on and beam-off intervals, thereby mimicking a
pulsed proton beam on a long time scale. During beam-on intervals, Compton
imaging was performed utilizing the high energy $\gamma$-rays promptly emitted
from the nuclear reactions occurring in the targets. In the course of the
beam-off intervals in-situ positron-emission tomography was accomplished with
the same imagers using the $\beta^{+}$ decay of activated nuclei. The targets

continuum theories that permits the development of the process of Lagrangian
reduction by symmetry in the relativistic context. Starting with a continuum
version of the Hamilton principle for the relativistic particle, we deduce two
classes of reduced variational principles that are associated to either
spacetime covariance, which is an axiom of the continuum theory, or material
covariance, which is related to particular properties of the system such as
isotropy. The covariance hypotheses and the Lagrangian reduction process are
efficiently formulated by making explicit the dependence of the theory on given
material and spacetime tensor fields that are transported by the world-tube of
the continuum via the push-forward and pull-back operations. It is shown that
the variational formulation, when augmented with the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY)
boundary terms, also yields the Israel-Darmois junction conditions between the
solution at the interior of the relativistic continua and the solution
describing the gravity field produced outside from it. The expression of the
first variation of the GHY term with respect to the hypersurface involves some
extensions of previous results that we also derive in the paper. We consider in
details the application of the variational framework to relativistic fluids and

continuous decreasing minimization problem on base-polyhedra. The continuous
version (under the name of lexicographically optimal base of a polymatroid) was
solved by Fujishige in 1980, with subsequent elaborations described in his book
(1991). The discrete counterpart of the dec-min problem (concerning M-convex
sets) was settled only recently by the present authors, with a strongly
polynomial algorithm to compute not only a single decreasing minimal element
but also the matroidal structure of all decreasing minimal elements and the
dual object called the canonical partition. The objective of this paper is to
offer a complete picture on the relationship between the continuous and
discrete dec-min problems on base-polyhedra by establishing novel technical
results and integrating known results. In particular, we derive proximity
results, asserting the geometric closeness of the decreasingly minimal elements
in the continuous and discrete cases, by revealing the relation between the
principal partition and the canonical partition. We also describe
decomposition-type algorithms for the discrete case following the approach of
Fujishige and Groenevelt.

as automatic speech recognition or machine translation. Unlike conventional
feed-forward DNNs, RNNs remember past information to improve the accuracy of
future predictions and, therefore, they are very effective for sequence
processing problems. For each application run, recurrent layers are executed
many times for processing a potentially large sequence of inputs (words,
images, audio frames, etc.). In this paper, we observe that the output of a
neuron exhibits small changes in consecutive invocations.~We exploit this
property to build a neuron-level fuzzy memoization scheme, which dynamically
caches each neuron's output and reuses it whenever it is predicted that the
current output will be similar to a previously computed result, avoiding in
this way the output computations.
  The main challenge in this scheme is determining whether the new neuron's
output for the current input in the sequence will be similar to a recently
computed result. To this end, we extend the recurrent layer with a much simpler
Bitwise Neural Network (BNN), and show that the BNN and RNN outputs are highly
correlated: if two BNN outputs are very similar, the corresponding outputs in
the original RNN layer are likely to exhibit negligible changes. The BNN
provides a low-cost and effective mechanism for deciding when fuzzy memoization
can be applied with a small impact on accuracy. We evaluate our memoization
scheme on top of a state-of-the-art accelerator for RNNs, for a variety of
different neural networks from multiple application domains. We show that our
technique avoids more than 26.7\% of computations, resulting in 21\% energy
savings and 1.4x speedup on average.

rich-scattering environment where Rayleigh and Rician channel models can be
applied. This work studies the ergodic achievable rate of RIS-assisted
multiple-input multiple-output communication systems in millimeter-wave band
with limited scattering under the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model. Firstly, we
derive an upper bound of the ergodic achievable rate by means of majorization
theory and Jensen's inequality. The upper bound shows that the ergodic
achievable rate increases logarithmically with the number of antennas at the
base station (BS) and user, the number of the reflection units at the RIS, and
the eigenvalues of the steering matrices associated with the BS, user and RIS.
Then, we aim to maximize the ergodic achievable rate by jointly optimizing the
transmit covariance matrix at the BS and the reflection coefficients at the
RIS. Specifically, the transmit covariance matrix is optimized by the
water-filling algorithm and the reflection coefficients are optimized using the
Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms.

top-down oriented detection methods usually directly detect entire objects, and

utilise the key semantic information, which causes a decrease in detection
accuracy. In this study, we developed a single-stage rotating object detector
via two points with a solar corona heatmap (ROTP) to detect oriented objects.
The ROTP predicts parts of the object and then aggregates them to form a whole
image. Herein, we meticulously represent an object in a random direction using
the vertex, centre point with width, and height. Specifically, we regress two
heatmaps that characterise the relative location of each object, which enhances
the accuracy of locating objects and avoids deviations caused by angle
predictions. To rectify the central misjudgement of the Gaussian heatmap on
high-aspect ratio targets, we designed a solar corona heatmap generation method
to improve the perception difference between the central and non-central
samples. Additionally, we predicted the vertex relative to the direction of the
centre point to connect two key points that belong to the same goal.
Experiments on the HRSC 2016, UCASAOD, and DOTA datasets show that our ROTP

different pool-fire structures. Moderate swirl suppresses the global puffing

for the largest heptane pool, higher swirl levels produced vortex breakdown,
resulting in the emergence of a bubble-like recirculation region with a ring
vortex encircling the axis. Measured burning rates increase with increasing
swirl levels as a consequence of the associated increasing inflow velocities
reducing the thickness of the boundary layer within which combustion occurs
right above the liquid surface, eventually forming detached edge flames in the

Still higher circulation reduces the burning rate by decreasing the surface

formation of the blue whirl identified in recent literature, often meandering
over the surface of the liquid in the present experiments. This sequence of

network and sends back features to the bottom network. Internally, we enforce
multi-scale compact constraints on the intermediate layers of deep networks to

on the local boundary-layer thickness. The nature of the resulting instability
depends on the inclination angle $\phi$, measured from the vertical direction.
For values of $\phi$ below a critical value $\phi_c$ the instability is
characterized by the appearance of spanwise traveling waves, whereas for
$\phi>\phi_c$ the bifurcated flow displays G\""ortler-like streamwise vortices.
The Boussinesq approximation, employed in previous linear stability analyses,
ceases to be valid for gaseous flow when the wall-to-ambient temperature ratio
$\Theta_w$ is not close to unity. The corresponding non-Boussinesq analysis is
presented here, accounting also for the variation with temperature of the
different transport properties. A temporal stability analysis including
nonparallel effects of the base flow is used to determine curves of neutral
stability, which are then employed to delineate the dependences of the critical
Grashof number and of its associated wave length on the inclination angle
$\phi$ and on the temperature ratio $\Theta_w$ for the two instability modes,
giving quantitative information of interest for configurations with
$\Theta_w-1\sim 1$. The analysis provides in particular the predicted
dependence of the crossover inclination angle $\phi_c$ on $\Theta_w$,
indicating that for gaseous flow with $\Theta_w-1\sim 1$ spanwise traveling

To depict the material responses and naturally describe the nucleation and
growth of fractures, we consider the peridynamics model. In particular, a
stochastic state-based peridynamic model is developed, where the
micromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random vector,
or a combination of random variables truncating the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve
decomposition or the principle component analysis (PCA). To solve this
stochastic peridynamic problem, probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is
employed to sample the random field representing the micromechanical
parameters. For each sample, the deterministic peridynamic problem is
discretized with an optimization-based meshfree quadrature rule. We present
rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and demonstrate its convergence for a
number of benchmark problems, showing that it sustains the asymptotic
compatibility spatially and achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential
convergence rate in the random space as the number of collocation points grows.
Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach on real-world fracture
problems, we consider the problem of crystallization toughening in
glass-ceramic materials, in which the material at the microstructural scale
contains both amorphous glass and crystalline phases. The proposed stochastic
peridynamic solver is employed to capture the crack initiation and growth for

involving two jets of equal density, thereby removing the vortex-sheet
character of the interface separating the two jet streams. Besides the
geometric parameter $H/R$, the solution depends only on the shape of the
velocity profiles in the feed streams and on the jet momentum-flux ratio. While
conformal mapping can be used to determine the potential solution corresponding
to uniform velocity profiles, numerical integration is required in general to
compute rotational flows, including those arising with Poiseuille velocity
profiles, with simplified solutions found in the limits $H/R \ll 1$ and $H/R
\gg 1$. The results are used to quantify the near-stagnation-point region, of
interest in counterflow-flame studies, including the local value of the strain
rate as well as the curvature of the separating interface and the variations of
the strain rate away from the stagnation point.

  Neural Networks on Fraud Detection",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to numerous fields. A
recent work which combines layered structure and residual connection proposes
an improved deep architecture to extend CAmouflage-REsistant GNN (CARE-GNN) to
deep models named as Residual Layered CARE-GNN (RLC-GNN), which forms
self-correcting and incremental learning mechanism, and achieves significant
performance improvements on fraud detection task. However, we spot three issues
of RLC-GNN, which are the usage of neighboring information reaching limitation,
the training difficulty which is inherent problem to deep models and lack of
comprehensive consideration about node features and external patterns. In this
work, we propose three approaches to solve those three problems respectively.
First, we suggest conducting similarity measure via cosine distance to take
both local features and external patterns into consideration. Then, we combine
the similarity measure module and the idea of adjacency-wise normalization with
node-wise and batch-wise normalization and then propound partial neighborhood
normalization methods to overcome the training difficulty while mitigating the
impact of too much noise caused by high-density of graph. Finally, we put
forward intermediate information supplement to solve the information
limitation. Experiments are conducted on Yelp and Amazon datasets. And the
results show that our proposed methods effectively solve the three problems.
After applying the three methods, we achieve 4.81%, 6.62% and 6.81%
improvements in the metrics of recall, AUC and Macro-F1 respectively on the
Yelp dataset. And we obtain 1.65% and 0.29% improvements in recall and AUC

populations and their continuum counterparts have mainly focused on homogeneous
populations, in which all cells have the same phenotypic characteristics.
However, significant intercellular phenotypic variability is commonly observed
in cellular systems. Therefore, we develop here an individual-based model for
the growth of phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations. In this model, the
phenotypic state of each cell is described by a structuring variable that
captures intercellular variability in cell proliferation and migration rates.
The model tracks the spatial evolutionary dynamics of single cells, which
undergo pressure-dependent proliferation, heritable phenotypic changes and
directional movement in response to pressure differentials. We formally show
that the continuum limit of this model comprises a non-local partial
differential equation for the cell population density, which generalises
earlier models of growing cell populations. Results of the individual-based
model illustrate how proliferation-migration tradeoffs shaping the evolution of
single cells can lead to the formation of travelling waves at the population
level where highly-mobile cells locally dominate at the invasive front, while
more-proliferative cells are found at the rear. We demonstrate that there is an
excellent quantitative agreement between these results and the results of
numerical simulations and formal travelling-wave analysis of the continuum
model, when sufficiently large cell numbers are considered. We provide
numerical evidence of scenarios in which the predictions of the two models may
differ due to demographic stochasticity, which cannot be captured by the
continuum model. This indicates the importance of integrating individual-based
and continuum approaches when modelling the growth of phenotypically
heterogeneous cell populations.

several important computational problems such as cryptanalysis of symmetric
encryption algorithms, RSA algorithm and solving the elliptic curve discrete
log problem (ECDLP) can be addressed as local inversion problems. The
methodology is termed as the \emph{Local Inversion Attack}. It utilizes the
concept of \emph{Linear Complexity} (LC) of a recurrence sequence generated by
the map defined by the cryptanalysis problem and the given data. It is shown
that when the LC of the recurrence is bounded by a bound of polynomial order in
the bit length of the input to the map, the local inversion can be accomplished
in polynomial time. Hence an incomplete local inversion algorithm which
searches a solution within a specified bound on computation can estimate the
density of weak cases of cryptanalysis defined by such data causing low LC.
Such cases can happen accidentally but cannot be avoided in practice and are
fatal insecurity flaws of cryptographic primitives which are wrongly assumed to
be secure on the basis of exponential average case complexity. An incomplete
algorithm is proposed for solving problems such as key recovery of symmetric
encryption algorithms, decryption of RSA ciphertext without factoring the
modulus, decrypting any ciphertext of RSA given one plaintext ciphertext pair
created with same public key in chosen ciphertext attack and solving the
discrete logarithm on elliptic curves over finite fields (ECDLP) as local
inversion problems. It is shown that when the LCs of the respective recurrences
for given data are small, solutions of these problems are possible in
practically feasible time and memory resources.

theoretical studies considered the in-situ mass loss of a close-in planet.
Planets that undergo the atmospheric escape, however, move outward due to the
change in the orbital angular momentum of their star-planet systems. In this
study, we calculate the orbital evolution of an evaporating super-Earth with a
H$_2$/He atmosphere around FGKM-type stars under a stellar X-ray and extreme UV
irradiation (XUV). The rate of increase in the orbital radius of an evaporating
planet is approximately proportional to that of the atmospheric mass loss
during a high stellar XUV phase. We show that super-Earths with a rocky core of
$\lesssim$ 10$\,M_\oplus$ and a H$_2$/He atmosphere at $\lesssim$
0.03-0.1$\,$au ($\lesssim$ 0.01-0.03$\,$au) around G-type stars (M-type stars)

changes in the orbits of the planets would be small, they would rearrange the
orbital configurations of compact, multi-planet systems, such as the TRAPPIST-1
system. We also find that the radius gap and the so-called ""Neptune desert"" in
the observed population of close-in planets around FGK-type stars still appear

M-type stars can be reproduced only by a high stellar XUV luminosity model.

according to patients' diagnoses, which is a critical task in clinics.
Currently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for
complicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it's
difficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors.
This urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help
treat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions.Due
to the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research
interests.Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a
multi-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper,
we propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel
copy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient,
the proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and
medication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses.
Then in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a
medicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one. This process is
quite similar to the decision process of human doctors. We validate the
proposed model on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show
that the proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

regression problem, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is a powerful
surrogate model due to the convolutional layer's good image feature extraction
ability. However, a lot of labeled data is needed to train CNN, and the common
CNN can not quantify the aleatoric uncertainty caused by data noise. In actual
engineering, the noiseless and labeled training data is hardly obtained for the
TFR. To solve these two problems, this paper proposes a deep Monte Carlo
quantile regression (Deep MC-QR) method for reconstructing the temperature
field and quantifying aleatoric uncertainty caused by data noise. On the one
hand, the Deep MC-QR method uses physical knowledge to guide the training of
CNN. Thereby, the Deep MC-QR method can reconstruct an accurate TFR surrogate
model without any labeled training data. On the other hand, the Deep MC-QR
method constructs a quantile level image for each input in each training epoch.
Then, the trained CNN model can quantify aleatoric uncertainty by quantile

the proposed Deep MC-QR method is validated by many experiments, and the

among the most widely used devices in both home and professional environments.
Unfortunately, the vulnerabilities of IP cameras have attracted malicious
activities. For example, in 2016, a massive attack resulted in thousands of
cameras and IoT devices being breached and used to create a botnet. Given this
history and the extremely sensitive nature of the data these devices have
access to, it is natural to question what security measures are in place today.
  In this paper, a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing is
performed on a specific model of IP camera, the TP-Link Tapo C200. More in
detail, our findings show that the IP camera in question suffers from three
vulnerabilities such as: denial of service, video eavesdropping and, finally, a
new type of attack called ""Motion Oracle"". Experiments are not limited to the
offensive part but also propose countermeasures for the camera in question and
for all those that may suffer from the same vulnerabilities. The countermeasure
is based on the use of another IoT device, a Raspberry Pi.

to errors. To automate these tasks, we propose a multi-atlas framework for
automatic segmentation and spatial alignment of the embryo using deep learning
with minimal supervision. Our framework learns to register the embryo to an
atlas, which consists of the US images acquired at a range of gestational age
(GA), segmented and spatially aligned to a predefined standard orientation.
From this, we can derive the segmentation of the embryo and put the embryo in
standard orientation. US images acquired at 8+0 till 12+6 weeks GA were used
and eight subjects were selected as atlas. We evaluated different fusion
strategies to incorporate multiple atlases: 1) training the framework using
atlas images from a single subject, 2) training the framework with data of all
available atlases and 3) ensembling of the frameworks trained per subject. To
evaluate the performance, we calculated the Dice score over the test set. We
found that training the framework using all available atlases outperformed
ensembling and gave similar results compared to the best of all frameworks
trained on a single subject. Furthermore, we found that selecting images from
the four atlases closest in GA out of all available atlases, regardless of the
individual quality, gave the best results with a median Dice score of 0.72. We
conclude that our framework can accurately segment and spatially align the
embryo in first trimester 3D US images and is robust for the variation in
quality that existed in the available atlases. Our code is publicly available

cannot adequately capture the underlying feature information of the data and
cannot jointly extract key global features and deep local features, a
dual-channel network model DC-EBAD based on the ERNIE pre-training model is
proposed. Use ERNIE to extract the lexical, semantic and contextual feature
information at the bottom of the text, generate dynamic word vector
representations fused with context, and then use the BiLSTM-AT network channel
to secondary extract the global features of the data and use the attention

overcome the long-distance text dependence problem and obtain deep local
features. The local and global feature vectors are spliced, and finally passed
to the fully connected layer, and the final classification result is output
through Softmax. The experimental results show that the proposed model improves
the accuracy, precision and F1-score of news headline classification compared

quantitative study of the basic question how close to invariant can one find

applications we show:
  (1) On amenable groups there are always ""almost invariant measures"" with

generally, any $f$-divergence).
  (2) For a free group $F$ and a symmetric measure $\lambda$ supported on its

$F$ of the Furstenberg entropy $h_{\lambda}(F,\eta)$.
  Somewhat surprisingly, while in the case of the uniform measure on the

Poisson boundary of the same measure $\lambda$, in general it is the

Since an infinite number of concrete scenarios can theoretically occur in
real-world road traffic, the extraction of scenarios relevant in terms of the
safety-related behavior of these systems is a key aspect for their successful
verification and validation. Therefore, a method for extracting multimodal
urban traffic scenarios from naturalistic road traffic data in an unsupervised
manner, minimizing the amount of (potentially biased) prior expert knowledge,
is proposed. Rather than an (elaborate) rule-based assignment by extracting
concrete scenarios into predefined functional scenarios, the presented method
deploys an unsupervised machine learning pipeline. The approach allows
exploring the unknown nature of the data and their interpretation as test
scenarios that experts could not have anticipated. The method is evaluated for
naturalistic road traffic data at urban intersections from the inD and the
Silicon Valley Intersections datasets. For this purpose, it is analyzed with
which clustering approach (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN) the
scenario extraction method performs best (referring to an elaborate rule-based
implementation). Subsequently, using hierarchical clustering the results show
both a jump in overall accuracy of around 20% when moving from 4 to 5 clusters
and a saturation effect starting at 41 clusters with an overall accuracy of
84%. These observations can be a valuable contribution in the context of the
trade-off between the number of functional scenarios (i.e., clustering
accuracy) and testing effort. Possible reasons for the observed accuracy
variations of different clusters, each with a fixed total number of given

chemical reactivity patterning has been designed over the graphene surface in a

the spatial selectivity of the graphene functionalization achieved via defect

time, undersampled data may be combined with compressed sensing reconstruction
techniques. Typical CS reconstructions first reconstruct a complex-valued set
of images corresponding to the varying contrasts, followed by a non-linear
signal model fit to obtain the parameter maps. We propose a direct, embedded
reconstruction method for T1rho mapping. The proposed method capitalizes on a
known signal model to directly reconstruct the desired parameter map using a
non-linear optimization model. The proposed reconstruction method also allows
directly regularizing the parameter map of interest, and greatly reduces the
number of unknowns in the reconstruction. We test the proposed model using a

we experimentally realized a 100 ns CZ gate with high fidelity of 99.38%$
\pm$0.34% and the control error being 0.1%. We note that our CZ gates are not
affected by pulse distortion and do not need pulse correction, {providing a

training neural networks. This has been particularly effective when learn
disentangled or compressed representations of high dimensional data. However,
differential entropy (DE), another fundamental measure of information, has not
found widespread use in neural network training. Although DE offers a
potentially wider range of applications than MI, off-the-shelf DE estimators
are either non differentiable, computationally intractable or fail to adapt to
changes in the underlying distribution. These drawbacks prevent them from being
used as regularizers in neural networks training. To address shortcomings in
previously proposed estimators for DE, here we introduce KNIFE, a fully
parameterized, differentiable kernel-based estimator of DE. The flexibility of
our approach also allows us to construct KNIFE-based estimators for conditional
(on either discrete or continuous variables) DE, as well as MI. We empirically
validate our method on high-dimensional synthetic data and further apply it to
guide the training of neural networks for real-world tasks. Our experiments on
a large variety of tasks, including visual domain adaptation, textual fair

challenging, which exists in a myriad of sequential prediction tasks. During
the training process, most existing methods focus on explicitly hard
interactions caused by wrong responses. However, a model might conduct correct
responses by capturing a subset of learnable patterns, which results in
implicitly hard interactions with some unlearned patterns. As such, its
generalization performance is weakened. The problem gets more serious in
sequential prediction due to the interference of substantial similar candidate
targets.
  To this end, we propose a Hardness Aware Interaction Learning framework
(HAIL) that mainly consists of two base sequential learning networks and mutual
exclusivity distillation (MED). The base networks are initialized differently
to learn distinctive view patterns, thus gaining different training
experiences. The experiences in the form of the unlikelihood of correct
responses are drawn from each other by MED, which provides mutual exclusivity
knowledge to figure out implicitly hard interactions. Moreover, we deduce that
the unlikelihood essentially introduces additional gradients to push the
pattern learning of correct responses. Our framework can be easily extended to
more peer base networks. Evaluation is conducted on four datasets covering
cyber and physical spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of top-k based

of distributed networks that use various communication modes. Conceptually, it
is a synchronous message passing model with a local communication mode, where
in each round each node can send large messages to all its neighbors in a local
network (a graph), and a global communication mode, where each node is allotted
limited (polylogarithmic) bandwidth per round which it can use to communicate
with any node in the network.
  Prior work has often focused on shortest paths problems in the local network,
as their global nature makes these an interesting case study how combining
communication modes in the $\mathsf{HYBRID}$ model can overcome the individual
lower bounds of either mode. In this work we consider a similar problem, namely
computation of distance oracles and routing schemes. In the former, all nodes
have to compute local tables, which allows them to look up the distance
(estimates) to any target node in the local network when provided with the
label of the target. In the latter, it suffices that nodes give the next node
on an (approximately) shortest path to the target.
  Our goal is to compute these local tables as fast as possible with labels as
small as possible. We show that this can be done exactly in $\widetilde
O(n^{1/3})$ communication rounds and labels of size $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ bits. For
constant stretch approximations we achieve labels of size $O(\log n)$ in the

computational lower bounds for a variety of problem parameters. For instance,
we show that computing solutions with stretch below a certain constant takes

approximation, i.e., identical inputs for all nodes. Then, this assumption is
relaxed. A more detailed analysis of these two states is discussed. We use the
Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the amount of synchronization. As a
result of the mean-field approach, we find that despite observed changes in
behavior, there is no phase transition. Surprisingly, both the first
(discontinuous) and second (continuous) phase transition occurs by relaxing the
mean-field assumption. We also demonstrate how changes in input can result in
pathological oscillations similar to those observed in epilepsy. Results show
that coupled Jansen-Rit masses emerge a variety of behaviors influenced by
various external and internal inputs. Moreover, our findings indicate that
delta waves can be generated by altering these inputs in a network of

semi-parametric model to jointly characterize the zero-inflated recurrent event
process and the terminal event process. We use a point mass mixture of
non-homogeneous Poisson processes to describe the recurrent intensity and
introduce shared random effects from different sources to bridge the
non-terminal and terminal event processes. To achieve robustness, we consider
nonparametric Dirichlet processes to model the residual of the accelerated
failure time model for the survival process as well as the cluster-specific
frailty distribution, and develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for
posterior inference. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model
compared with competing models via simulations and apply our method to a
pragmatic cluster randomized trial for fall injury prevention among the
elderly.

optimizing over the stationary distribution of stochastic differential equation

using an estimate for the gradient of the stationary distribution. The gradient
estimate is simultaneously updated, asymptotically converging to the direction
of steepest descent. We rigorously prove convergence of our online algorithm
for linear SDE models and present numerical results for nonlinear examples. The
proof requires analysis of the fluctuations of the parameter evolution around
the direction of steepest descent. Bounds on the fluctuations are challenging
to obtain due to the online nature of the algorithm (e.g., the stationary

bounds for the solutions of a new class of Poisson partial differential
equations, which are then used to analyze the parameter fluctuations in the
algorithm.

social distancing via object detection through the use of surveillance cameras

measurement on public transport. The public transport setting has some unique
challenges, including some low-resolution images and camera locations that can

perform accurate detection. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the challenges
of performing accurate social distance measurement on public transportation. We
benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms using real-world
footage taken from the London Underground and bus network. The work highlights
the complexity of performing social distancing measurement on images from
current public transportation onboard cameras. Further, exploiting domain
knowledge of expected passenger behaviour, we attempt to improve the quality of
the detections using various strategies and show improvement over using vanilla
object detection alone.

meteoroid entered the atmosphere with a speed of $14.00 \pm 0.17$ km s$^{-1}$
and followed a $58^{\circ}$ slope trajectory from a height of 75 km down to
18.6 km. Despite the poor angle of triangulated planes between observatories
(29$^{\circ}$) and the large distance from the observatories, a well
constrained kilo-size main mass was predicted to have fallen just South of
Madura in Western Australia. However, the search area was predicted to be large
due to the trajectory uncertainties. Fortunately, the rock was rapidly
recovered along the access track during a reconnaissance trip. The 1.072 kg
meteorite called Madura Cave was classified as an L5 ordinary chondrite. The
calculated orbit is of Aten type (mostly contained within the Earth's orbit),
the second time only a meteorite is observed on such an orbit after Bunburra
Rockhole. Dynamical modelling shows that Madura Cave has been in near-Earth
space for a very long time. The NEO dynamical lifetime for the progenitor
meteoroid is predicted to be $\sim87$ Myr. This peculiar orbit also points to a
delivery from the main asteroid belt via the $\nu6$ resonance, and therefore an
origin in the inner belt. This result contributes to drawing a picture for the

Lyman $\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width (EW$_0$) and spectral properties as
well as ultraviolet (UV) continuum morphology by obtaining reliable EW$_0$
histograms for a statistical sample of galaxies and by assessing the fraction
of objects with large equivalent widths. We used integral field spectroscopy
from MUSE combined with broad-band data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
to measure EW$_0$. We analysed the emission lines of $1920$ Lyman $\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) detected in the full MUSE-Wide (one hour exposure time) and
MUSE-Deep (ten hour exposure time) surveys and found UV continuum counterparts
in archival HST data. We fitted the UV continuum photometric images using the
Galfit software to gain morphological information on the rest-UV emission and
fitted the spectra obtained from MUSE to determine the double peak fraction,
asymmetry, full-width at half maximum, and flux of the Lyman $\alpha$ line. The
two surveys show different histograms of Lyman $\alpha$ EW$_0$. In MUSE-Wide,
$20\%$ of objects have EW$_0 > 240$ \r{A}, while this fraction is only $11\%$
in MUSE-Deep and $\approx 16\%$ for the full sample. This includes objects
without HST continuum counterparts (one-third of our sample), for which we give
lower limits for EW$_0$. The object with the highest securely measured EW$_0$
has EW$_0=589 \pm 193$ \r{A} (the highest lower limit being EW$_0=4464$ \r{A}).
We investigate the connection between EW$_0$ and Lyman $\alpha$ spectral or UV
continuum morphological properties. The survey depth has to be taken into
account when studying EW$_0$ distributions. We find that in general, high
EW$_0$ objects can have a wide range of spectral and UV morphological
properties, which might reflect that the underlying causes for high EW$_0$
values are equally varied. (abridged)

For this case, we find a solution that approaches the exact result for large
values of the number density $\mathscr{N}$ of the molecules. We find the
conditions for the existence of the polaritonic states, as well as expressions
for their energies. The polaritonic states are quite stable against disorder.
Analytical results are verified by comparison with simulations. When
$\epsilon_a$ is equal to that of the cavity state $\epsilon_c$ (on resonance)
the gap between the two polaritonic states is found to increase with disorder,
the increase being equal to $2 \frac{\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\mathscr{N}}|\tilde{V}|}$
where $\tilde{V}$ is the coupling of a molecular excitation to the cavity
state. An analytic expression is found for the disorder induced width of the
polaritonic peak. We results for various densities of states, and the
absorption spectrum. The dark states that exist in the case $\sigma=0$ turn
""grey"" in presence of disorder with their contribution to the absorption
increasing with $\sigma$. We analyze the effect of including lifetimes of the
cavity and molecular states and find that in the strong coupling regime, the
width of the polaritonic peaks is dominated by the lifetime effect and that
disorder plays almost no role, if the Rabi splitting is sufficiently large. We
also consider the case where there is (a) orientational disorder as well as (b)
spatial variation of the cavity field and find that they effectively amount to
a renormlisation of the coupling.

the evolutionary history of a set of species. However, in case the transfer of
genes or other genetic information between the species or their ancestors has
occurred in the past, a tree may not provide a complete picture of their

more refined representation of the species evolution. Such a network is
essentially a phylogenetic tree with some arcs added between the tree edges so
as to represent reticulate events such as gene transfer. Even so, this model
does not permit the representation of evolutionary scenarios where reticulate
events have taken place between different subfamilies or lineages of species.
To represent such scenarios, in this paper we introduce the notion of a
forest-based phylogenetic network, that is, a collection of leaf-disjoint
phylogenetic trees on a set of species with arcs added between the edges of
distinct trees within the collection. Forest-based networks include the
recently introduced class of overlaid species forests which are used to model
introgression. As we shall see, even though the definition of forest-based
networks is closely related to that of tree-based networks, they lead to new
mathematical theory which complements that of tree-based networks. As well as
studying the relationship of forest-based networks with other classes of
phylogenetic networks, such as tree-child networks and universal tree-based
networks, we present some characterizations of some special classes of
forest-based networks. We expect that our results will be useful for developing
new models and algorithms to understand reticulate evolution, such as gene
transfer between collections of bacteria that live in different environments.

empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of
its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries.
Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation

pattern with a maximum number of points (1-cells). Points are not allowed to
touch each other, they have to be separated by 0-cells, and every 0-cell can
find at least one point in its Moore-neighborhood. Probabilistic rules are
designed that can solve this task with asynchronous updating and cyclic
boundary condition. The task is considered as a tiling problem, where point
tiles are used to cover the space with overlaps. A point tile consists of a
center pixel (the kernel with value 1) and 8 surrounding pixels forming the
hull with value 0. The term pixel is used to distinguish the cells of a tile
from the cells of a cellular automaton. For each of the 9 tile pixels a
so-called template is defined by a shift of the point tile. In the rule
application, the 9 templates are tested at the actual cell position. If all
template pixels (except the central reference pixel) of a template match with
the corresponding neighbors of the actual cell under consideration, the cell's
state is adjusted to the reference pixel's value. Otherwise the cell is set to
the random value 0 or 1 with a certain probability. The hull pixels are allowed
to overlap. In order to evolve a maximum of points, the overlap between tiles
has to be maximized. To do that, the number of template hits is counted.
Depending on the hit-number, additional noise is injected with certain

previous work, we consider a more practically relevant batch-centric scenario

and demonstrate upper and lower bounds for the regret of a candidate policy.
Our main theoretical results show that the impact of batch learning is a
multiplicative factor of batch size relative to the regret of online behavior.
Primarily, we study two settings of the stochastic linear bandits: bandits with
finitely and infinitely many arms. While the regret bounds are the same for
both settings, the former setting results hold under milder assumptions. Also,
we provide a more robust result for the 2-armed bandit problem as an important
insight. Finally, we demonstrate the consistency of theoretical results by
conducting empirical experiments and reflect on optimal batch size choice.

ensembling (FGE) and snapshot ensembles have addressed this issue by training

single-model-based methods. In this paper, we propose a new method called
parsimonious FGE (PFGE), which employs a lightweight ensemble of
higher-performing DNNs generated through successive stochastic weight averaging
procedures. Our experimental results on CIFAR-{10,100} and ImageNet datasets

incentive compatibility for agents without contingent reasoning skills:
obviously strategyproof mechanisms guarantee that it is ""obvious"" for these
imperfectly rational agents to behave honestly, whereas non-obviously
manipulable (NOM) mechanisms take a more optimistic view and ensure that these
agents will only misbehave when it is ""obvious"" for them to do so. Technically,
obviousness requires comparing certain extrema (defined over the actions of the
other agents) of an agent's utilities for honest behaviour against dishonest
behaviour.
  We present a technique for designing NOM mechanisms in settings where
monetary transfers are allowed based on cycle monotonicity, which allows us to
disentangle the specification of the mechanism's allocation from the payments.
By leveraging this framework, we completely characterise both allocation and
payment functions of NOM mechanisms for single-parameter agents. We then look
at the classical setting of bilateral trade and study whether and how much
subsidy is needed to guarantee NOM, efficiency, and individual rationality. We
prove a stark dichotomy; no finite subsidy suffices if agents look only at
best-case extremes, whereas no subsidy at all is required when agents focus on
worst-case extremes. We conclude the paper by characterising the NOM mechanisms
that require no subsidies whilst satisfying individual rationality.

Hall effect has received significant attention over the last two decades, which
is strongly justified because of the dominance of this effect in highly
magnetised neutron stars. However, the applicability of the Hall effect is
based on the assumption that the crust does not fail and sustains its rigidity.
This assumption can be violated for substantially strong magnetic fields. If
this is the case, the evolution of the magnetic field is described by a
different set of equations, which include the effects of a non-rigid crust. In
this talk, after a brief review of the main characteristic of the Hall
evolution, I will discuss the impact a plastic flow of the crust has on the
magnetic field, studying axisymmetric models. Moreover, the way the crust fails
impacts the overall evolution, with major differences appearing if the failure
is local, intermediate or global. Quite remarkably, crustal failure and
plasticity do not annul the Hall effect, and under certain circumstances they
may even lead to a more dramatic evolution. I will discuss the impact of these
effects in the context of neutron star timing behaviour, with special focus on
timing noise, outbursts and glitches.

the RIS hyperparameters, according to which the transmitted pilots are directly
used to jointly tune the RIS and the multi-antenna receiver. Our simulation
results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to provide reliable
communications in non-linear channel conditions corrupted by Gaussian noise.

variance (GMV) portfolio by a combination of two techniques: Tikhonov
regularization and direct shrinkage of portfolio weights. More specifically, we
employ a double shrinkage approach, where the covariance matrix and portfolio
weights are shrunk simultaneously. The ridge parameter controls the stability
of the covariance matrix, while the portfolio shrinkage intensity shrinks the
regularized portfolio weights to a predefined target. Both parameters
simultaneously minimize with probability one the out-of-sample variance as the
number of assets $p$ and the sample size $n$ tend to infinity, while their
ratio $p/n$ tends to a constant $c>0$. This method can also be seen as the
optimal combination of the well-established linear shrinkage approach of Ledoit
and Wolf (2004, JMVA) and the shrinkage of the portfolio weights by Bodnar et
al. (2018, EJOR). No specific distribution is assumed for the asset returns
except of the assumption of finite $4+\varepsilon$ moments. The performance of
the double shrinkage estimator is investigated via extensive simulation and
empirical studies. The suggested method significantly outperforms its
predecessor (without regularization) and the nonlinear shrinkage approach in
terms of the out-of-sample variance, Sharpe ratio and other empirical measures

similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores
that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation -
a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest
neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This
control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn
negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and

convergence of the results can be reached. These studies also highlight the
systematic differences between the two families of transport codes, known as
BUU and QMD type codes. However, when the codes were compared in full heavy-ion
collisions using different physical models, as recently for pion production,
they still yielded substantially different results. This calls for further
comparisons of heavy-ion collisions with controlled models and of box
comparisons of important ingredients, like momentum-dependent fields, which are
currently underway. We often indicate improved strategies in performing
transport simulations and thus provide guidance to code developers. Results of
transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions from a given code will have more

However, most researchers focus on improving the performance of the network by
increasing the CNN depth and width, which often requires high computational
effort. Moreover, we can notice that not only the importance of pixels in
different channels is different, but also the importance of pixels in different
positions of the same channel is different. To reduce the computational effort
and to take into account the different importance of pixels, we propose a
lightweight convolutional neural network with a convolutional block attention
module (CBAM) for finger vein recognition, which can achieve a more accurate
capture of visual structures through an attention mechanism. First, image
sequences are fed into a lightweight convolutional neural network we designed
to improve visual features. Afterwards, it learns to assign feature weights in
an adaptive manner with the help of a convolutional block attention module. The
experiments are carried out on two publicly available databases and the results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a stable, highly accurate, and
robust performance in multimodal finger recognition.

socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content,
therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found
using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model.
The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets --

binary system leads to shrinking or expansion of the binary orbit has attracted
considerable interest as it impacts the evolution of binary black holes and
stellar binary stars in their formation phase. We performed two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary discs for a large parameter set of
disc viscosities and thicknesses and two different binary mass ratios for
binaries on circular orbits. For those we measured carefully the net angular
momentum and mass transfer between disc and binary system, and evaluate the
normalised specific angular momentum accretion, $j_\mathrm{s}$ . This is
compared to the theoretical, critical specific angular momentum change
$j_\mathrm{s,crit}$ that separates contracting from expanding cases which
depends on the the binary's mass ratio and the relative accretion onto the two
stars. Using finite and infinite disc models we show that the inferred binary
evolution is very similar for both setups and confirm that $j_\mathrm{s}$ can
be measured accurately with cylindrical simulations that do not include the
central binary. However, to obtain the relative accretion onto the stars for
non-equal mass binaries, simulations that cover the whole domain including the
binary are required. We find that for thick discs with aspect ratio $h = 0.1$
the binaries expand for all viscosities, while discs with $h = 0.05$ lead to an
expansion only for larger viscosities with $\alpha$ exceeding $\sim 0.005$.
Overall, the regime of binary expansion extends to a much wider parameter space
than previously anticipated, but for thin, low viscosity discs the orbits
shrink.

raise questions as to the depth of unprocessed material, and whether the

the coupled thermal and dynamical evolution of Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs),

ejection into interstellar space. We apply a thermal evolution model to a
sample of simulated JFCs obtained from dynamical simulations (arXiv:1706.07447)

that due to the stochastic nature of comet trajectories toward the inner solar

significant modifications of their initial volatile contents. A statistical
analysis constrains the extent of such processing. We suggest that primordial

its carbon counterpart. Both materials are two-dimensional materials that host
Dirac fermions. There are, however, also a few important differences between
these two materials: (1) graphene has a planar honeycomb lattice, whereas
germanene's honeycomb lattice is buckled and (2) the spin-orbit gap in
germanene is predicted to be about three orders of magnitude larger than the
spin-orbit gap in graphene (24 meV for germanene versus 20 $\mu$eV for

layers synthesized on different substrates do not show any sign of the presence
of a spin-orbit gap in germanene. To date the exact origin of the absence of
this spin-orbit gap in the scanning tunneling spectra of germanene has remained
a mystery. In this work we show that the absence of the spin-orbit can be
explained by germanene's exceptionally low work function of only 3.8 eV. The
difference in work function between germanene and the scanning tunneling
microscopy tip (the work functions of most commonly used STM tips are in the
range of 4.5 to 5.5 eV) gives rise to an electric field in the tunnel junction.
This electric field results in a strong suppression of the size of the

source and target feature spaces. Such alignments are imposed by constraints
such as statistical discrepancy minimization or adversarial training. However,
these constraints could lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures
and loss of class discriminability. In this paper, we introduce a novel prompt
learning paradigm for UDA, named Domain Adaptation via Prompt Learning (DAPL).
In contrast to prior works, our approach makes use of pre-trained
vision-language models and optimizes only very few parameters. The main idea is
to embed domain information into prompts, a form of representations generated
from natural language, which is then used to perform classification. This
domain information is shared only by images from the same domain, thereby
dynamically adapting the classifier according to each domain. By adopting this
paradigm, we show that our model not only outperforms previous methods on

It has been shown that, contrary to common belief, money transfer in the

transfer still require a quadratic message complexity per payment, making
attempts to scale hard. In common blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,
this cost is mitigated by payment channels implemented as a second layer on top

regret minimization problem} -- a unified framework that is guaranteed to
perform optimally for both stochastic and adversarial preferences
simultaneously. Moreover, our algorithm is also the first to achieve an optimal
$O(\sum_{i = 1}^K \frac{\log T}{\Delta_i})$ regret bound against the
Condorcet-winner benchmark, which scales optimally both in terms of the
arm-size $K$ and the instance-specific suboptimality gaps $\{\Delta_i\}_{i =
1}^K$. This resolves the long-standing problem of designing an instancewise
gap-dependent order optimal regret algorithm for dueling bandits (with matching
lower bounds up to small constant factors). We further justify the robustness
of our proposed algorithm by proving its optimal regret rate under
adversarially corrupted preferences -- this outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art corrupted dueling results by a large margin. In summary, we
believe our reduction idea will find a broader scope in solving a diverse class
of dueling bandits setting, which are otherwise studied separately from
multi-armed bandits with often more complex solutions and worse guarantees. The
efficacy of our proposed algorithms is empirically corroborated against the
existing dueling bandit methods.

  The tunability of the excitonic resonances via an external field is also
discussed, together with the increasing localization of the excitonic states as

be tuned by varying the coupling strength between the cavity modes and an atom

represented by an effective Hamiltonian with a non-trivial coupling appearing
in the potential, and a renormaized mass. Importantly, the acceleration-gauge
coupling is non-monotonic with the strength cavity-matter interaction. As a
result one obtain effective approximately decoupled field-matter dynamics for
weak and strong interactions. In the weak coupling regime the effective mass is
essentially the original mass. In contrast, the renormalized mass is increased
as the interaction is increased. This results in acceleration gauge dynamics of
atom/molecule with the original Hamiltonian and effective Planck's constant
that is reduced when the interaction is increased. This approach might lead in
particular to the possibility of studying the correspondence of ""quantum-chaos""

remains a critical challenge in optoelectronics. Surface plasmon polaritons (or

response in the visible to trap photons similar to metallic structures.
Overcoming these limitations appears elusive, as it implies devising a path to
circumvent causality in the quantum-mechanical form of matter. Here we
demonstrate that addressing this problem is possible if we employ a novel
approach based on suitably deformed reflective metaphotonic structures. The
complex geometrical shape engineered in these reflectors emulates nondispersive
index responses, which can be inverse-designed following arbitrary form
factors. We discuss the realization of essential components such as resonators
with an ultra-high refractive index of $n=100$ in diverse profiles. These
structures support localization of light in the form of bound states in the
continuum (BIC), fully localized in air, in a platform in which all refractive
index regions are physically accessible. We discuss our approach to sensing
applications, designing a class of sensors where the analyte directly contacts
areas of ultra-high refractive index. Leveraging this feature, we report
differential sensitivities up to $350$~nm/RIU in structures with footprints of
approximately one micron. These performances are two times better than the
closest competitor with a similar form factor. Inversely designed reflective

news recommendation enables collaborative model learning from many clients
without sharing their raw data. It is promising for privacy-preserving news

unclear. In this paper, we study this problem by proposing an untargeted attack
called UA-FedRec. By exploiting the prior knowledge of news recommendation and
federated learning, UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the model performance
with a small percentage of malicious clients. First, the effectiveness of news
recommendation highly depends on user modeling and news modeling. We design a
news similarity perturbation method to make representations of similar news
farther and those of dissimilar news closer to interrupt news modeling, and
propose a user model perturbation method to make malicious user updates in
opposite directions of benign updates to interrupt user modeling. Second,
updates from different clients are typically aggregated by weighted-averaging
based on their sample sizes. We propose a quantity perturbation method to
enlarge sample sizes of malicious clients in a reasonable range to amplify the
impact of malicious updates. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
show that UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the accuracy of existing federated

method, the analysis has been limited to systems where the largest number of
neighbours is small. We devise an efficient implementation of the dynamic
cavity method which substantially reduces the computational complexity of the
method for systems with discrete couplings. Our approach opens up the
possibility to investigate the dynamic properties of networks with fat-tailed
degree distribution. We exploit this new implementation to study properties of
the non-equilibrium steady-state. We extend the dynamical cavity approach to
calculate the pairwise correlations induced by different motifs in the network.
Our results suggest that just two basic motifs of the network are able to
accurately describe the entire statistics of observed correlations. Finally, we
investigate models defined on networks containing bi-directional interactions.
We observe that the stationary state associated with networks with symmetric or
anti-symmetric interactions is biased towards the active or inactive state
respectively, even if independent interaction entries are drawn from a
symmetric distribution. This phenomenon, which can be regarded as a form of
spontaneous symmetry-breaking, is peculiar to systems formulated in terms of

Transformers (ViTs): (1) MSAs improve not only accuracy but also generalization
by flattening the loss landscapes. Such improvement is primarily attributable
to their data specificity, not long-range dependency. On the other hand, ViTs
suffer from non-convex losses. Large datasets and loss landscape smoothing
methods alleviate this problem; (2) MSAs and Convs exhibit opposite behaviors.
For example, MSAs are low-pass filters, but Convs are high-pass filters.
Therefore, MSAs and Convs are complementary; (3) Multi-stage neural networks
behave like a series connection of small individual models. In addition, MSAs
at the end of a stage play a key role in prediction. Based on these insights,
we propose AlterNet, a model in which Conv blocks at the end of a stage are

speeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 3.4 m/s. During the second set of experiments,
we introduce wind gusts, by periodically modulating the wind speed from 1.3 m/s

reducing the power consumption. In contrast, the CrazyFlie's power consumption
stays more constant for different wind speeds. The experiments with the varying

within the last decades due to their potential use as nonvolatile memory such

(HMMs) have been suggested as ideal electrode materials for MTJs to achieve an
extremely large tunnel-magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Despite their high TMR
ratios, MTJs based on HMMs do not exhibit current rectification, i.e., a diode
effect, which was achieved in a magnetic tunnel junction concept based on HMMs
and type-II spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). The proposed concept has
recently been experimentally demonstrated using Heusler compounds. In the
present work, we investigate from first-principles MTJs based on type-II SGS
and HMM quaternary Heusler compounds FeVTaAl, FeVTiSi, MnVTiAl, and CoVTiSb.
Our $ab$ $initio$ quantum transport calculations based on a nonequilibrium
Green's function method have demonstrated that the MTJs under consideration
exhibit current rectification with relatively high on:off ratios. We show that,
in contrast to conventional semiconductor diodes, the rectification bias
voltage window (or breakdown voltage) of the MTJs is limited by the spin gap of
the HMM and SGS Heusler compounds. A unique feature of the present MTJs is that
the diode effect can be configured dynamically, i.e., depending on the relative
orientation of the magnetization of the electrodes, the MTJ allows the
electrical current to pass either in one or the other direction, which leads to
an inverse TMR effect. The combination of nonvolatility, reconfigurable diode
functionality, tunable rectification voltage window, and high Curie temperature
of the electrode materials makes the proposed MTJs very promising for
room-temperature spintronic applications and opens ways to magnetic memory and
logic concepts as well as logic-in-memory computing.

without relying on an accurate model of the environment. Inspired by previous
applications of energy-based controllers for physical interaction, we propose a
passivity-based impedance and wrench tracking controller in combination with a
momentum-based wrench estimator. This is combined with an energy-tank framework
to guarantee the stability of the system, while energy and power flow-based
adaptation policies are deployed to enable safe interaction with any type of
passive environment. The control framework provides formal guarantees of
stability, which is validated in practice considering the challenging task of
pushing a cart of unknown mass, moving on a surface of unknown friction, as
well as subjected to unknown disturbances. For this scenario, we present,
evaluate and discuss three different policies.

the number of qubits required per dimension for any lattices (resp.~random

to solve SVP in dimension up to 28 in a quantum emulation, significantly more

extrapolate the size of NISQ devices that is required to be able to solve

cumulative-risk ratio, or odds ratio. The VE based on incidence rate ratio is
known to be time-invariant over the study period for leaky action vaccines and,
the VE based on cumulative-risk ratio is time-invariant for all-or-none action
vaccines. Consequently, these VE measures are recommended as appropriate
measures of VE for leaky and all-or-none vaccines, respectively. However, in
diseases with multiple pathogen variants and multiple vaccines, investigators
may also be interested in variant-specific VE of a vaccine, the relative VE of
a vaccine against two variants, or the relative VE of different vaccines
against a given variant. In this multi-variant and multi-vaccine scenario, the
temporal properties of the aforementioned VE measures have not been studied
entirely yet. Furthermore, no general-purpose sample size calculator is
available for either studies that intend to estimate variant-specific VE or
relative VE. As a solution, we define variant-specific and relative VE measures
while accounting for multiple competing pathogen variants. We then propose a
generic mode of action for all-or-none vaccines in a multi-variant setting.
Subsequently, we evaluate the conditions and the extent to which various VE
measures can be time-varying. We show that every VE measure is time-varying for
all-or-none action vaccines in a multi-variant and multi-vaccine scenario. For
leaky vaccines, we show that all measures other than those based on incidence
rate ratios are time-varying. We discuss the practical implications of these
results on VE studies in the context of the commonly used cohort, cumulative
case-control, and test-negative study designs. Lastly, for the multi-variant
and multi-vaccine scenario, we implement sample size calculations for both
variant-specific and relative VE in an R package and an online calculator.

study, a platform consisting of a high-throughput screening and a

20,237 Li-containing materials is developed. For the training database, the
ionic conductivity of Na SuperIonic CONductor (NASICON) and Li SuperIonic
CONductor (LISICON) type SSEs are obtained from the previous literature. Then,
the chemical descriptor (CD) and additional structural properties are used as
machine-readable features. Li-SSE candidates are selected through the screening
criteria, and the prediction on the ionic conductivity of those is followed.
Then, to reduce uncertainty in the surrogate model, the ensemble method by
considering the best-performing two models is employed, whose mean prediction
accuracy is 0.843 and 0.829, respectively. Furthermore, first-principles
calculations are conducted for confirming the ionic conductivity of the strong
candidates. Finally, six potential superionic Li-SSEs that have not previously
been investigated are proposed. We believe that the constructed platform can
accelerate the search for Li-SSEs with high ionic conductivity at minimum cost.

proposed, which integrated a deep learning-based subband noise reduction

the first network, a deep learning model was trained with a controllable small
frame shift to satisfy the low-latency demand, i.e., $\le$ 4 ms, so as to
obtain (complex) subband gains, which could be regarded as an adaptive digital
filter in each frame. In the second network, to reduce the latency, this
adaptive digital filter was implicitly shortened by a deep learning-based
framework, and was then applied to noisy speech to reconstruct the enhanced
speech without the overlap-add method. Experimental results on the WSJ0-SI84

much better performance than traditional low-latency speech enhancement

brings benefits for an array of NLP domains, such as speech-to-text and
automated text. Only the punctuation marks period, comma and question marks
were considered for the project, due to a lack of data for more rare marks such
as semicolon. Additionally, some marks are somewhat interchangeable with the
more common, such as exclamation points and periods. Thus, the data set had all
exclamation points replaced with periods. The fine-tuned Swedish BERT model,
dubbed prestoBERT, achieved an overall F1-score of 78.9. The proposed model
scored similarly to international counterparts, with Hungarian and Chinese
models obtaining F1-scores of 82.2 and 75.6 respectively. As further
comparison, a human evaluation case study was carried out. The human test group
achieved an overall F1-score of 81.7, but scored substantially worse than
prestoBERT on both period and comma. Inspecting output sentences from the model
and humans show satisfactory results, despite the difference in F1-score. The
disconnect seems to stem from an unnecessary focus on replicating the exact
same punctuation used in the test set, rather than providing any of the number
of correct interpretations. If the loss function could be rewritten to reward
all grammatically correct outputs, rather than only the one original example,
the performance could improve significantly for both prestoBERT and the human

movement of particles, leading their pathes into more concentrated targets.
Such convergence effect also happens in the case of denser Rayleigh particle
jets. Particle dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic stability analysis
mutually authenticated that the optical field forces suppress the instability
both of long-wave and short-wave on particle jet interfaces, and have
broad-spectrum stabilization characteristics. Therefor, diffusive particles in
vacuum evaporation can also have very good targeted aggregations by laser.

gate-model QPUs. Our focus is on the quality of solutions achieved as
determined by the Normalized and Complementary Wasserstein Distance, $\eta$,
which we present in a manner to expose the QAOA as a transporter of
probability. Using $\eta$ as an application specific benchmark of performance,
we measure it on selection of QPUs as a function of QAOA circuit depth $p$. At
$n = 2$ (2 qubits) we find peak solution quality at $p=5$ for most systems and
for $n = 3$ this peak is at $p=4$ on a trapped ion QPU. Increasing solution
quality with $p$ is also observed using variants of the more general Quantum
Alternating Operator Ans\""{a}tz at $p=2$ for $n = 2$ and $3$ which has not been
previously reported. In identical measurements, $\eta$ is observed to be
variable at a level exceeding the noise produced from the finite number of
shots. This suggests that variability itself should be regarded as a QPU
performance benchmark for given applications. While studying the ideal
execution of QAOA, we find that $p=1$ solution quality degrades when the
portfolio budget $B$ approaches $n/2$ and increases when $B \approx 1$ or
$n-1$. This trend directly corresponds to the binomial coefficient $nCB$ and is
connected with the recently reported phenomenon of reachability deficits.
Derivative-requiring and derivative-free classical optimizers are benchmarked
on the basis of the achieved $\eta$ beyond $p=1$ to find that derivative-free
optimizers are generally more effective for the given computational resources,
problem sizes and circuit depths.

two stages are coupled through disjunctive constraints, which model generators'

develop a smoothing technique to approximate disjunctive constraints into a

especially by introducing indefinite causal order ways of coin tossing and
investigate this modern scenario. We find that an ideal-shape and
fast-spreading uniform distribution can be prepared with our new model. First
we will show how an always-symmetrical instantaneous distribution appears in an
indefinite causal order quantum walk, which then paves the way for deriving
conditions that enables one to interpret an evolved state as a superposition of
its definite causal order counterparts which is however in general prohibited.
This property of temporal superposition of states can be generalized from
two-process scenarios to cases where arbitrary many $\mathcal{N}$ processes are
involved. Finally, we demonstrate how a genuine uniform distribution emerges
from an indefinite causal order quantum walk. Remarkably, besides the ideal
shape of the distribution, our protocol has another powerful advantage, that is
the speed of spatial spreading reaches exactly the theoretical limit in
contrast to conventional cases where one may encounter the well-known issue of
a $1/\sqrt{2}$ degeneration.

quantum or classical correlation shared between the sender and the receiver. To
this aim, we propose a class of two-party communication games, and show that
the games cannot be won given a noiseless 1-bit classical channel from the
sender to the receiver. Interestingly, the goal can be perfectly achieved if
the channel is assisted with classical shared randomness. This resembles an
advantage similar to the quantum superdense coding phenomenon where pre-shared
entanglement can enhance the communication utility of a perfect quantum
communication line. Quite surprisingly, we show that a qubit communication
without any assistance of classical shared randomness can achieve the goal, and
hence establishes a novel quantum advantage in the simplest communication
scenario. In pursuit of a deeper origin of this advantage, we show that an
advantageous quantum strategy must invoke quantum interference both at the
encoding step by the sender and at the decoding step by the receiver. We also
study communication utility of a class of non-classical toy systems described
by symmetric polygonal state spaces. We come up with communication tasks that
can be achieved neither with 1-bit of classical communication nor by
communicating a polygon system, whereas 1-qubit communication yields a perfect
strategy, establishing a strict quantum nature of the advantage. To this end,
we show that the quantum advantages are robust against imperfect
encodings-decodings, making the protocols implementable with presently
available quantum technologies.

include the effect of a finite plasma-$\beta$ and gravity, but the distinctive
feature is that we incorporate a thermal structure with properties similar to
those reported by observations. We developed a semi-analytical method to
compute the equilibrium configuration. Using this method, we obtain cold and
under-dense plasma structures in open magnetic fields representing coronal
holes, while in closed magnetic configurations, we achieve the characteristic
hot and over-dense plasma arrangements of active regions. Although coronal
holes and active regions seem to be antagonistic structures, we find that they
can be described using a common thermal structure that depends on the flux
function. In addition to the force balance, the energy balance is included in
the constructed models using an a posteriori approach. From the two-dimensional
computation of thermal conduction and radiative losses in our models, we infer
the required heating function to achieve energy equilibrium. We find that the
temperature dependence on height is an important parameter that may prevent the
system from accomplishing thermal balance at certain spatial locations. The
implications of these results are discussed in detail.

  Existing networks are typically trained with experimental data gathered from

  Here we introduce a model of network that can be trained with classically
simulated data from a fiducial set of states and measurements, and can later be
used to characterize quantum states that share structural similarities with the
states in the fiducial set. With little guidance of quantum physics, the
network builds its own data-driven representation of quantum states, and then
uses it to predict the outcome statistics of quantum measurements that have not
been performed yet.
  The state representation produced by the network can also be used for tasks
beyond the prediction of outcome statistics, including clustering of quantum
states and identification of different phases of matter.
  Our network model provides a flexible approach that can be applied to online
learning scenarios, where predictions must be generated as soon as experimental
data become available, and to blind learning scenarios where the learner has
only access to an encrypted description of the quantum hardware.

In this paper, we develop a new optimal LAS method in the TDBS, namely LAS-SDT,
by taking advantage of the sequential Doppler shift and TOA measurements. It
achieves higher accuracy compared with the conventional TOA-only method for
user devices (UDs) with motion and clock drift. Another two variant methods,
LAS-SDT-v for the case with UD velocity aiding, and LAS-SDT-k for the case with
UD clock drift aiding, are developed. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) for these different cases. We show analytically that the accuracies of
the estimated UD position, clock offset, velocity and clock drift are all
significantly higher than those of the conventional LAS method using TOAs only.
Numerical results corroborate the theoretical analysis and show the optimal
estimation performance of the LAS-SDT.

Earth. Its abundance in Earth's crust and mantle (the Bulk Silicate Earth, BSE)
is surprisingly high given that carbon is strongly siderophile (metal-loving)
at low pressures and temperatures, and hence should have segregated almost
completely into Earth's core during accretion. Estimates of the concentration
of carbon in the BSE lie in the range 100-260 ppm and are much higher than
expected based on simple models of core-mantle differentiation. Here we show
through experiments at the putative conditions of Earth's core formation (49-71
GPa and 3600-4000 K) that carbon is significantly less siderophile at these
conditions than at the low pressures ($\leq$13 GPa) and temperatures
($\leq$2500 K) of previous large volume press studies, but at least an order of
magnitude more siderophile than proposed recently based on an experimental
approach that is similar to ours. Using our new data along with previously
published results, we derive a new parameterization of the pressure-temperature
dependence of the metal-silicate partitioning of carbon. We apply this
parameterization in a model that combines planet formation and core-mantle
differentiation that is based on astrophysical N-body accretion simulations.
Because differentiated planetesimals were almost completely depleted in carbon
due to sublimation at high temperatures, almost all carbon in the BSE was added
by the accretion of fully-oxidized carbonaceous chondrite material from the
outer solar system. Carbon is added to the mantle continuously throughout
accretion and its concentration reaches values within the BSE range (e.g.
140$\pm$40 ppm) at the end of accretion. The corresponding final core and bulk
Earth carbon concentrations are 1270$\pm$300 ppm and 495$\pm$125 ppm
respectively.

studied fields of research, combining the two settings is just starting to be
explored. We consider the problem of estimating a discrete distribution in
total variation from $n$ contaminated data batches under a local differential
privacy constraint. A fraction $1-\epsilon$ of the batches contain $k$ i.i.d.
samples drawn from a discrete distribution $p$ over $d$ elements. To protect
the users' privacy, each of the samples is privatized using an $\alpha$-locally
differentially private mechanism. The remaining $\epsilon n $ batches are an
adversarial contamination. The minimax rate of estimation under contamination
alone, with no privacy, is known to be $\epsilon/\sqrt{k}+\sqrt{d/kn}$, up to a
$\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)}$ factor. Under the privacy constraint alone, the
minimax rate of estimation is $\sqrt{d^2/\alpha^2 kn}$. We show that combining
the two constraints leads to a minimax estimation rate of
$\epsilon\sqrt{d/\alpha^2 k}+\sqrt{d^2/\alpha^2 kn}$ up to a
$\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)}$ factor, larger than the sum of the two separate
rates. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm achieving this bound, as well as
a matching information theoretic lower bound.

mobile devices to provide healthcare. These models rely on training with a
tremendous amount of labeled data to achieve high accuracy. However, for
medical applications such as dermatological disease diagnosis, the private data
collected by mobile dermatology assistants exist on distributed mobile devices
of patients, and each device only has a limited amount of data. Directly
learning from limited data greatly deteriorates the performance of learned
models. Federated learning (FL) can train models by using data distributed on
devices while keeping the data local for privacy. Existing works on FL assume
all the data have ground-truth labels. However, medical data often comes
without any accompanying labels since labeling requires expertise and results
in prohibitively high labor costs. The recently developed self-supervised
learning approach, contrastive learning (CL), can leverage the unlabeled data
to pre-train a model, after which the model is fine-tuned on limited labeled
data for dermatological disease diagnosis. However, simply combining CL with FL
as federated contrastive learning (FCL) will result in ineffective learning
since CL requires diverse data for learning but each device only has limited
data. In this work, we propose an on-device FCL framework for dermatological
disease diagnosis with limited labels. Features are shared in the FCL
pre-training process to provide diverse and accurate contrastive information.
After that, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with local labeled data
independently on each device or collaboratively with supervised federated
learning on all devices. Experiments on dermatological disease datasets show
that the proposed framework effectively improves the recall and precision of
dermatological disease diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods.

second-order information of DNN task loss, we decompose and approximate the
Hessian-based optimization objective into three diagonal sub-items, which have
different areas corresponding to three dimensions of weight tensor:
element-wise, kernel-wise, and output channel-wise. Then, we progressively
compose sub-items and propose a novel data-free optimization objective in the
discrete domain, minimizing Constrained Absolute Sum of Error (or CASE in
short), which surprisingly does not need any dataset and is even not aware of

back-propagation to further reduce the computation complexity of the objective
solver. Finally, without fine-tuning and synthetic datasets, SQuant accelerates
the data-free quantization process to a sub-second level with >30% accuracy
improvement over the existing data-free post-training quantization works, with
the evaluated models under 4-bit quantization. We have open-sourced the SQuant

the paper proposes a new evaluation metric, test accuracy (Test-Acc), which

choice settings, we explore its usefulness in tackling various combinatorial
optimization problems. We do so by considering an abstract model, in which a
set of agents are asked to act in a particular ordering, called the action
sequence. Each agent acts in a way that gives her the maximum possible value,
given the actions of the agents who preceded her in the action sequence. Our
goal is to compute action sequences that yield approximately optimal total
value to the agents (a.k.a., social welfare). We assume query access to the
value $v_i(S)$ that the agent i gets when she acts after the agents in the
ordered set $S$.
  We establish tight bounds on the social welfare that can be achieved using
polynomially many queries. Even though these bounds show a marginally sublinear
approximation of optimal social welfare in general, excellent approximations
can be obtained when the valuations stem from an underlying combinatorial
domain. Indicatively, when the valuations are defined using bipartite
matchings, arborescences in directed graphs, and satisfiability of Boolean
expressions, simple query-efficient algorithms yield $2$-approximations. We
discuss issues related to truthfulness and show how some of our algorithms can
be implemented truthfully using VCG-like payments. Finally, we introduce and
study the price of serial dictatorship, a notion that provides an optimistic
measure of the quality of combinatorial optimization solutions generated by
action sequences.

years. Modern recommender systems usually resort to 1) representation learning
models which define user-item preference as the distance between their
embedding representations, and 2) embedding-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) search to tackle the efficiency problem introduced by large-scale corpus.
While providing efficient retrieval, the embedding-based retrieval pattern also
limits the model capacity since the form of user-item preference measure is
restricted to the distance between their embedding representations. However,
for other more precise user-item preference measures, e.g., preference scores
directly derived from a deep neural network, they are computationally
intractable because of the lack of an efficient retrieval method, and an
exhaustive search for all user-item pairs is impractical. In this paper, we
propose a novel method to extend ANN search to arbitrary matching functions,
e.g., a deep neural network. Our main idea is to perform a greedy walk with a
matching function in a similarity graph constructed from all items. To solve
the problem that the similarity measures of graph construction and user-item
matching function are heterogeneous, we propose a pluggable adversarial
training task to ensure the graph search with arbitrary matching function can
achieve fairly high precision. Experimental results in both open source and
industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed
method has been fully deployed in the Taobao display advertising platform and
brings a considerable advertising revenue increase. We also summarize our

where the heterogeneity manifests as voids (low elastic modulus regions) and
fibers (high elastic modulus regions) in a matrix are analyzed, and the results
are validated against solutions obtained from a commercial Finite Element (FE)

intention, this paper is devoted to reconstructing the calculation formulae of
the local Moran indexes and Geary coefficients through mathematical derivation
and empirical evidence. Two sets of LISAs were clarified by mathematical
reasoning. One set of LISAs is based on no normalized weights and centralized
variable (MI1 and GC1), and the other set is but the second the set cannot.
Then, the third set of LISA was proposed, treated as canonical forms (MI3 and

standardized variable based on population standard deviation, while the local
Geary coefficients are based on global normalized weights and standardized
variable based on sample standard deviation. This set of LISAs satisfies the
second requirement of based on row normalized weights and standardized variable

that emission rates differ significantly from airline to airline. We also find
that CO2 alone is not a sufficient proxy for emissions, as NOx, when converted

dataset that contains some socio-demographic factors, whether people smoke, and
whether smoking bans exist. Since the observational data used in the study did
not randomize people into with-smoking-bans group and without-smoking-bans
group, confounders may cause bias in the estimation of whether the smoking bans
can reduce smoking rates. The propensity score matching(PSM) method can reduce
these biases via using a logistic regression model to predict the similarities
of people in those 2 groups and using the nearest neighbour matching technique
to match people who are the most similar. After reducing the bias, another
regression model was created to interpret the relationship between the
probability of smoking and the indoor smoking bans. We conclude by arguing that
with the existence of indoor smoking bans, the probability of people who smoke
can be decreased greatly.

  This is different version of the original thesis",,,,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Turing machine halting problem can be explained by several factors,
including arithmetic logic irreversibility and memory erasure, which contribute
to computational uncertainty due to information loss during computation.
Essentially, this means that an algorithm can only preserve information about
an input, rather than generate new information. This uncertainty arises from
characteristics such as arithmetic logical irreversibility, Landauer's
principle, and memory erasure, which ultimately lead to a loss of information
and an increase in entropy. To measure this uncertainty and loss of
information, the concept of arithmetic logical entropy can be used. The Turing
machine and its equivalent, general recursive functions can be understood
through the {\lambda} calculus and the Turing/Church thesis. However, there are
certain recursive functions that cannot be fully understood or predicted by
other algorithms due to the loss of information during logical-arithmetic
operations. In other words, the behaviour of these functions cannot be
completely determined at every stage of the computation due to a lack of
information in their definition. While there are some cases where the behaviour
of recursive functions is highly predictable, the lack of information in most
cases makes it impossible for algorithms to determine if a program will halt or
not. This inability to predict the outcome of the computation is the essence of
the halting problem of the Turing machine. Even in cases where more information
is available about the program, it is still difficult to determine with
certainty if the program will halt or not. This also highlights the importance
of the Turing oracle machine, which introduces information from outside the
computation to compensate for the lack of information and ultimately decide the
result of the computation.

the freedom for different clock synchronizations on frames accelerated from an

Furthermore, our dynamical approach arrives at the interesting conclusion that
Einstein's equivalence principle and gravitational redshift are necessary to
explain special relativistic clock desynchronization. This result shows that
special relativity by itself is an incomplete theory. If our dynamical model
