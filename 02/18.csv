networks that deploy hubs to form trucks into platoons. The trucks belong to
different fleets that are interested in increasing their profits by platooning
across fleets. The profit of each fleet incorporates platooning rewards and
costs for waiting at hubs. Each truck has a fixed route and a waiting time
budget to spend at the hubs along its route. To ensure that all fleets are
willing to participate in the system, we develop a cross-fleet Pareto-improving
coordination strategy that guarantees higher fleet profits than a coordination
strategy without cross-fleet platoons. By leveraging multiple hubs for platoon
formation, the coordination strategy can be implemented in a real-time and
distributed fashion while largely reducing the amount of travel information to
be shared for system-wide coordination. We evaluate the proposed strategy in a
simulation study over the Swedish transportation network. The cross-fleet
platooning strategy significantly improves fleets' profits compared with
single-fleet platooning, especially the profits from smaller fleets. The
cross-fleet platooning strategy also shows strong competitiveness in terms of
the system-wide profit compared to the case when a system planner optimizes all
fleets' total profit.

applicative terms without variables in a setting where the intended semantic

interpreted as a monotone function, or an antitone function, or both. There is
a natural set of five rules for inequational reasoning. One can add variables
and also add a substitution rule, but we observe that this logic would be
incomplete for full structures. This is why the completeness result in this
paper pertains to terms without variables. Since the completeness is already
known for the class of general (Henkin) structures, we are interested in full
structures. We present a completeness theorem. Our result is not optimal
because we restrict to base preorders which have a weak completeness property:
every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound. To compensate we
add several rules to the logic. We also present extensions and variations of
our completeness result.

thermal particles with which recombination can occur leading to the formation
of color-singlet clusters. Color neutralization is assumed to occur locally,
within the same fluid cell occupied by the heavy quark and it proceeds via the
recombination of the latter with light antiquarks (quarks) or diquarks
(anti-diquarks), which are assumed to be present in the medium with thermal
abundance as effective degrees of freedom around the QCD crossover temperature
$T_c$. Typically the resulting color-singlet clusters have quite low invariant

undergo an isotropic 2-body decay in their local rest-frame. Heavier clusters
are instead fragmented as Lund strings. The possibility of recombination with
light diquarks enhances the yields of charmed baryons, in qualitative agreement
with recent measurements. The assumption of local color neutralization leads to
a strong space-momentum correlation, which provides a substantial enhancement
of the collective flow of the final-state charmed hadrons, affecting both their

a clear Bayesian interpretation and enjoys several invariance properties,
making it an appealing prior choice. We show that the proposed method leads to
an accurate approximation of the reduced-bias approach of Firth (1993),

  Self-consistent values for the line-force parameters (k,alpha,delta) and
subsequently for the mass-loss rate and terminal velocity are provided by the
m-CAK prescription introduced in Paper I, updated in this work with

the radiative transfer code FASTWIND, replacing the classical beta-law for our
new calculated velocity profiles.
  We found that self-consistent m-CAK solutions provide values for theoretical
mass-loss rates on the order of the most recent predictions of other studies.
From here, we generate synthetic spectra with self-consistent hydrodynamics to
fit and obtain a new set of stellar and wind parameters for our sample of
O-type stars whose spectra was taken with the high resolution echelle
spectrograph HERMES (R=85000). We find a satisfactory global fit for our
observations, with good accuracy for photospheric He I and He II lines and a
quite acceptable fit for H lines. Although this self-consistent spectral
analysis is currently constrained in the optical wavelength range only, this is
an important step towards the determination of stellar and wind parameters
without using a beta-law. Given these results, we expect that the values
introduced here should be helpful for future studies about the stars

network analysis applications like community detection. Clique, as the densest
model, has been widely investigated. However, in practice, communities rarely
form as cliques for various reasons, e.g., data noise. Therefore, $k$-plex, --
graph with each vertex adjacent to all but at most $k$ vertices, is introduced
as a relaxed version of clique. Often, to better simulate cohesive communities,
an emphasis is placed on connected $k$-plexes with small $k$. In this paper, we
continue the research line of listing all maximal $k$-plexes and maximal
$k$-plexes of prescribed size. Our first contribution is algorithm ListPlex
that lists all maximal $k$-plexes in $O^*(\gamma^D)$ time for each constant
$k$, where $\gamma$ is a value related to $k$ but strictly smaller than 2, and
$D$ is the degeneracy of the graph that is far less than the vertex number $n$
in real-word graphs. Compared to the trivial bound of $2^n$, the improvement is
significant, and our bound is better than all previously known results. In
practice, we further use several techniques to accelerate listing $k$-plexes of
a given size, such as structural-based prune rules, cache-efficient data
structures, and parallel techniques. All these together result in a very
practical algorithm. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions by up to orders of magnitude.

reexamination of the ground state in the high-temperature phase. Here we use
electron diffraction to unveil that a nematic charge order on particular Fe
sites emerges in the high-temperature cubic structure of bulk Fe3O4, and that
upon cooling, a competitive intertwining of charge and lattice orders leads to
the emergence of the Verwey transition. Moreover, MeV ultrafast electron
diffraction (UED) provides a dynamic measure of the strong coupling between
photoexcited electrons and the X3 phonon modes. Our findings discover a new
type of electronic nematicity in correlated materials and offer novel insights
into the Verwey transition mechanism in Fe3O4 via the electron-phonon coupling.

applied on top of a generic forecasting model, including deep learning

use of conformal predictors for time series by removing the requirement of data

easy-to-use in supplying water (and fertilizers) to (mainly) the roots and root
hairs of the desired crop (or plant) for production. We characterize a spray
nozzle delivering water vertically above against the gravity by measuring,
experimentally, its (a) spray drift, (b) spray height, (c) maximum spray angle,
(d) spray width, and (e) droplets sizes. Experiments were carried out at
different inlet pressures and a majority of the above mentioned parameters were
obtained by processing the images captured using optical (or high speed)

studied the spray (or jet) behaviour at different vertical heights and
different horizontal planes using a unique polythene sponge method. We studied
the mass flow rate, the absorption rate, and droplet size dynamics (as a
function of time and pressure) using this method. The water drop/droplet
interaction was also studied in the case of simpler porous and impervious
surfaces as well. We believe that this study can be extrapolated to other
nozzles (especially sprays) to obtain similar characteristic parameters. This
study, hence, is critical in selecting the desired spray system for a given

methods for predicting solar flares. Initial efforts along these lines employed
comparatively simple models, correlating features extracted from observations

models have used physics-inspired features that have been carefully chosen by
experts in order to capture the salient features of such magnetic field
structures. Over time, the sophistication and complexity of the models involved
has grown. However, there has been little evolution in the choice of feature
sets, nor any systematic study of whether the additional model complexity is
truly useful. Our goal is to address these issues. To that end, we compare the
relative prediction performance of machine-learning-based, flare-forecasting
models with varying degrees of complexity. We also revisit the feature set
design, using topological data analysis to extract shape-based features from
magnetic field images of the active regions. Using hyperparameter training for
fair comparison of different machine-learning models across different feature
sets, we show that simpler models with fewer free parameters \textit{generally
perform better than more-complicated models}, ie., powerful machinery does not
necessarily guarantee better prediction performance. Secondly, we find that
\textit{abstract, shape-based features contain just as much useful
information}, for the purposes of flare prediction, as the set of hand-crafted
features developed by the solar-physics community over the years. Finally, we
study the effects of dimensionality reduction, using principal component
analysis, to show that streamlined feature sets, overall, perform just as well

distribution of molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\rm{H_2}}$). Using
observations by PHANGS-ALMA/SDSS and simulations by GRIFFIN/IllustrisTNG we
explore the evolution of this H$_2$ column density distribution function
[$f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$]. The H$_2$ (and HI) column density maps for TNG50 and
TNG100 are derived in post-processing and are made available through the
IllustrisTNG online API. The shape and normalization of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ of
individual main-sequence star-forming galaxies are correlated with the star
formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (${M_*}$), and H$_2$ mass ($M_{\rm{H}_2}$)
in both observations and simulations. TNG100, combined with H$_2$
post-processing models, broadly reproduces observations, albeit with
differences in slope and normalization. Also, an analytically modelled $f(N)$,
based on exponential gas disks, matches well with the simulations. The GRIFFIN
simulation gives first indications that the slope of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ might
not majorly differ when including non-equilibrium chemistry in simulations. The
$f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ by TNG100 implies that higher molecular gas column densities
are reached at $z=3$ than at $z=0$. Further, denser regions contribute more to
the molecular mass density at $z=3$. Finally, H$_2$ starts dominating compared
to HI only at column densities above log($N_{\rm{H}_2} / \rm{cm}^{-2}) \sim
21.8-22$ at both redshifts. These results imply that neutral atomic gas is an
important contributor to the overall cold gas mass found in the ISM of galaxies
including at densities typical for molecular clouds at $z=0$ and $z=3$.

hydrodynamics (RHD) with support for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in a
frequency-integrated, two-moment formulation. The method is based on a
non-local Variable Eddington Tensor (VET) closure computed with a hybrid
characteristics scheme for ray tracing. We use a Godunov method for the
hyperbolic transport of radiation with an implicit backwards-Euler temporal
update to avoid the explicit timestep constraint imposed by the light-crossing
time, and a fixed-point Picard iteration scheme to handle the nonlinear
gas-radiation exchange term, with the two implicit update stages jointly
iterated to convergence. We also develop a modified wave-speed correction
method for AMR, which we find to be crucial for obtaining accurate results in
the diffusion regime. We demonstrate the robustness of our scheme with a suite
of pure radiation and RHD tests, and show that it successfully captures the
streaming, static diffusion, and dynamic diffusion regimes and the spatial
transitions between them, casts sharp shadows, and yields accurate results for
rates of momentum and energy exchange between radiation and gas. A comparison
between different closures for the radiation moment equations, with the
Eddington approximation (0th-moment closure) and the $M_1$ approximation
(1st-moment closure), demonstrates the advantages of the VET method (2nd-moment
closure) over the simpler closure schemes. \texttt{VETTAM} has been coupled to
the AMR \texttt{FLASH} (magneto-)hydrodynamics code and we summarize by
reporting performance features and bottlenecks of our implementation.

through the analysis of wave motions in spherical dynamo models. Our study
focuses on the role of slow magnetostrophic waves, which are generated from
localized balances between the Lorentz, Coriolis and buoyancy (MAC) forces.
Since the slow waves are known to intensify with increasing field strength,
simulations in which the field grows from a small seed towards saturation are
useful in understanding the role of these waves in dynamo action. Axial group
velocity measurements in the energy-containing scales show that fast inertial
waves slightly modified by the magnetic field and buoyancy are dominant under
weak fields. However, the dominance of the slow waves is evident for strong
fields satisfying $|\omega_M/\omega_C| \sim $ 0.1, where $\omega_M$ and
$\omega_C$ are the frequencies of the Alfv\'en and inertial waves respectively.
A MAC wave window of azimuthal wavenumbers is identified wherein helicity
generation by the slow waves strongly correlates with dipole generation.
Analysis of the magnetic induction equation suggests a poloidal--poloidal field
conversion in the formation of the dipole. Finally, the attenuation of slow

maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in finite mixture models. The Wasserstein
distance has become a standard loss function for the analysis of parameter
estimation in these models, due in part to its ability to circumvent label
switching and to accurately characterize the behaviour of fitted mixture
components with vanishing weights. However, the Wasserstein distance is only
able to capture the worst-case convergence rate among the remaining fitted
mixture components. We demonstrate that when the log-likelihood function is
penalized to discourage vanishing mixing weights, stronger loss functions can
be derived to resolve this shortcoming of the Wasserstein distance. These new
loss functions accurately capture the heterogeneity in convergence rates of
fitted mixture components, and we use them to sharpen existing pointwise and
uniform convergence rates in various classes of mixture models. In particular,
these results imply that a subset of the components of the penalized MLE
typically converge significantly faster than could have been anticipated from
past work. We further show that some of these conclusions extend to the
traditional MLE. Our theoretical findings are supported by a simulation study
to illustrate these improved convergence rates.

natural nonconvex and nonsmooth formulation of low-rank matrix recovery with
$\ell_1$-loss, where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix from a limited
number of measurements, a subset of which may be grossly corrupted with noise.
We study a scenario where the rank of the true solution is unknown and
over-estimated instead. The over-estimation of the rank gives rise to an
over-parameterized model in which there are more degrees of freedom than
needed. Such over-parameterization may lead to overfitting, or adversely affect
the performance of the algorithm. We prove that a simple SubGM with small
initialization is agnostic to both over-parameterization and noise in the
measurements. In particular, we show that small initialization nullifies the
effect of over-parameterization on the performance of SubGM, leading to an
exponential improvement in its convergence rate. Moreover, we provide the first
unifying framework for analyzing the behavior of SubGM under both outlier and
Gaussian noise models, showing that SubGM converges to the true solution, even
under arbitrarily large and arbitrarily dense noise values, and--perhaps
surprisingly--even if the globally optimal solutions do not correspond to the
ground truth. At the core of our results is a robust variant of restricted
isometry property, called Sign-RIP, which controls the deviation of the
sub-differential of the $\ell_1$-loss from that of an ideal, expected loss. As
a byproduct of our results, we consider a subclass of robust low-rank matrix
recovery with Gaussian measurements, and show that the number of required
samples to guarantee the global convergence of SubGM is independent of the
over-parameterized rank.

the $p$-eikonal equation does not correspond to a shortest-path graph distance,

graphene, the former can be mapped to twisted bilayers with renormalized
interlayer couplings, along with a remnant gapless monolayer when the number of

bilayers, including the occurrence of `magic angles' characterized by cubic
band crossings when $L \mod 4 = 3$. Owing to their power-law divergent density
of states, such multilayers are highly susceptible to secondary instabilities.

softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its
scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length.
Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the
softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their
performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance
drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we
propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or
better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions.
cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i).
non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme
that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear
substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a
cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language

  The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among 1038 first
level students in the same high school district in Norway. S. aureus persistent
carriage was determined from two nasal swab cultures and genotype from
spa-typing of a positive throat swab culture. Bootstrap, t-tests, logistic
regression, and autocorrelation were used to evaluate social network influence
on host risk factors and S. aureus carriage.
  Both persistent carriage and spa-type were transmitted in the social network
(p<0.001). The probability of carriage increased by 3.7% and 5.0% for each
additional S. aureus positive friend, in univariable regression and
multivariable autocorrelation analysis respectively. Male sex was associated
with a 15% lower risk of transmission compared to women, although the
prevalence of carriage was higher for men (36% versus 24%). Medium physical
activity, medium and high alcohol-use, and normal-weight students had higher
number of contacts, and increased risk of transmission (p<0.002).
  We demonstrate direct social transmission of S. aureus in a general youth
population. Lifestyle factors are associated with risk of transmission
suggesting indirect social group effects from having more similar environmental
exposures. The predominance in carriage is determined by sex-specific
predisposing host characteristics as social transmission is less frequent than
in females. Better understanding of how social interactions influence S. aureus
carriage dynamics in the population is important for developing new preventive

raise the inventory position to the order-up-to-level S. This paper introduces
a new stochastic dynamic program (SDP) based heuristic to compute the (R, s, S)
policy parameters for the non-stationary stochastic lot-sizing problem with
backlogging of the excessive demand, fixed order and review costs, and linear
holding and penalty costs. In a recent work, Visentin et al. (2021) present an
approach to compute optimal policy parameters under these assumptions. Our
model combines a greedy relaxation of the problem with a modified version of
Scarf's (s, S) SDP. A simple implementation of the model requires a prohibitive
computational effort to compute the parameters. However, we can speed up the
computations by using K-convexity property and memorisation techniques. The
resulting algorithm is considerably faster than the state-of-the-art, extending
its adoptability by practitioners. An extensive computational study compares
our approach with the algorithms available in the literature.

approach toward learning a compositional and grounded meaning representation of
language from grounded data, such as paired images and texts. At the core of
G2L2 is a collection of lexicon entries, which map each word to a tuple of a
syntactic type and a neuro-symbolic semantic program. For example, the word
shiny has a syntactic type of adjective; its neuro-symbolic semantic program
has the symbolic form {\lambda}x. filter(x, SHINY), where the concept SHINY is
associated with a neural network embedding, which will be used to classify
shiny objects. Given an input sentence, G2L2 first looks up the lexicon entries
associated with each token. It then derives the meaning of the sentence as an
executable neuro-symbolic program by composing lexical meanings based on
syntax. The recovered meaning programs can be executed on grounded inputs. To
facilitate learning in an exponentially-growing compositional space, we
introduce a joint parsing and expected execution algorithm, which does local
marginalization over derivations to reduce the training time. We evaluate G2L2
on two domains: visual reasoning and language-driven navigation. Results show
that G2L2 can generalize from small amounts of data to novel compositions of

diverse application areas, both numerical and discrete. For example, many
algebraic graph algorithms rely on SpGEMM in the tropical semiring to compute
shortest paths in graphs. Recently, SpGEMM has received growing attention
regarding implementations for specific (parallel) architectures. Yet, this
concerns only the static problem, where both input matrices do not change. In
many applications, however, matrices (or their corresponding graphs) change
over time. Although recomputing from scratch is very expensive, we are not
aware of any dynamic SpGEMM algorithms in the literature. In this paper, we
thus propose a batch-dynamic algorithm for MPI-based parallel computing.
Building on top of a distributed graph/matrix data structure that allows for
fast updates, our dynamic SpGEMM reduces the communication volume
significantly. It does so by exploiting that updates change far fewer matrix
entries than there are non-zeros in the input operands. Our experiments with
popular benchmark graphs show that our approach pays off. For batches of
insertions or removals of matrix entries, our dynamic SpGEMM is substantially
faster than the static algorithms in the state-of-the-art competitors CombBLAS,
CTF and PETSc.

immediate response of the user. This may be misaligned with the true objective,
such as creating long term user satisfaction. In this work we focus on mobile
push notifications, where the long term effects of recommender system decisions
can be particularly strong. For example, sending too many or irrelevant
notifications may annoy a user and cause them to disable notifications.
However, a myopic system will always choose to send a notification since
negative effects occur in the future. This is typically mitigated using
heuristics. However, heuristics can be hard to reason about or improve, require
retuning each time the system is changed, and may be suboptimal. To counter
these drawbacks, there is significant interest in recommender systems that
optimize directly for long-term value (LTV). Here, we describe a method for
maximising LTV by using model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to make
decisions about whether to send push notifications. We model the effects of
sending a notification on the user's future behavior. Much of the prior work
applying RL to maximise LTV in recommender systems has focused on session-based
optimization, while the time horizon for notification decision making in this
work extends over several days. We test this approach in an A/B test on a major
social network. We show that by optimizing decisions about push notifications
we are able to send less notifications and obtain a higher open rate than the
baseline system, while generating the same level of user engagement on the
platform as the existing, heuristic-based, system.

images, or time series) rely on measuring the impact that the
removal/perturbation of features has on the model output. This forces the
explanation language to match the classifier features space. However, when
dealing with graph data, in which the basic features correspond essentially to
the adjacency information describing the graph structure (i.e., the edges),
this matching between features space and explanation language might not be
appropriate. In this regard, we argue that (i) a good explanation method for
graph classification should be fully agnostic with respect to the internal
representation used by the black-box; and (ii) a good explanation language for
graph classification tasks should be represented by higher-order structures,
such as motifs. The need to decouple the feature space (edges) from the
explanation space (motifs) is thus a major challenge towards developing
actionable explanations for graph classification tasks. In this paper we
introduce GRAPHSHAP, a Shapley-based approach able to provide motif-based
explanations for black-box graph classifiers, assuming no knowledge whatsoever
about the model or its training data: the only requirement is that the
black-box can be queried at will. Furthermore, we introduce additional
auxiliary components such as a synthetic graph dataset generator, algorithms
for subgraph mining and ranking, a custom graph convolutional layer, and a
kernel to approximate the explanation scores while maintaining linear time
complexity. Finally, we test GRAPHSHAP on a real-world brain-network dataset
consisting of patients affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and a control

social media, citation networks in academic websites, and threads data in
online forums. Due to the complex topology, it is difficult to process and make
use of the rich information within such data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
shown great advantages on learning representations for structural data.
However, the non-transparency of the deep learning models makes it non-trivial
to explain and interpret the predictions made by GNNs. Meanwhile, it is also a
big challenge to evaluate the GNN explanations, since in many cases, the
ground-truth explanations are unavailable.
  In this paper, we take insights of Counterfactual and Factual (CF^2)
reasoning from causal inference theory, to solve both the learning and
evaluation problems in explainable GNNs. For generating explanations, we
propose a model-agnostic framework by formulating an optimization problem based
on both of the two casual perspectives. This distinguishes CF^2 from previous
explainable GNNs that only consider one of them. Another contribution of the
work is the evaluation of GNN explanations. For quantitatively evaluating the
generated explanations without the requirement of ground-truth, we design
metrics based on Counterfactual and Factual reasoning to evaluate the necessity
and sufficiency of the explanations. Experiments show that no matter
ground-truth explanations are available or not, CF^2 generates better
explanations than previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.
Moreover, the statistic analysis justifies the correlation between the
performance on ground-truth evaluation and our proposed metrics. Source code is

coupling parameter $g$ is less than the critical value $g_c$, the ground state
is a superposition of all configurations with closed strings of spins in a same
single-spin state, which can be obtained by using an adiabatic quantum
algorithm with time complexity $O(\frac{1}{g_c^2} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
N_e^{3/2}(N_v^3 + \frac{N_e}{g_c}}))$, where $N_v$ and $N_e$ are the numbers of
vertices and edges of the graph respectively. A subsequent search for a HC
among those closed-strings solves the HC problem. For some random samples of
small graphs, we demonstrate that the dependence of the average value of $g_c$
on $\sqrt{N_{hc}}$, $N_{hc}$ being the number of HCs, and that of the average
value of $\frac{1}{g_c}$ on $N_e$ are both linear. It is thus suggested that

that the existing xspec spectral fitting models provide good fits to synthetic

condition on graph functions, called \textit{permutation compatibility}, that
relates permutations of weights and features of the graph to functional
constraints. We prove that: (i) a GNN, as a graph function, is necessarily
permutation compatible; (ii) conversely, any permutation compatible function,
when restricted on input graphs with distinct node features, can be generated
by a GNN; (iii) for arbitrary node features (not necessarily distinct), a
simple feature augmentation scheme suffices to generate a permutation
compatible function by a GNN; (iv) permutation compatibility can be verified by
checking only quadratically many functional constraints, rather than an
exhaustive search over all the permutations; (v) GNNs can generate \textit{any}
graph function once we augment the node features with node identities, thus
going beyond graph isomorphism and permutation compatibility. The above
characterizations pave the path to formally study the intricate connection
between GNNs and other algorithmic procedures on graphs. For instance, our
characterization implies that many natural graph problems, such as min-cut
value, max-flow value, max-clique size, and shortest path can be generated by a
GNN using a simple feature augmentation. In contrast, the celebrated
Weisfeiler-Lehman graph-isomorphism test fails whenever a permutation
compatible function with identical features cannot be generated by a GNN. At
the heart of our analysis lies a novel representation theorem that identifies
basis functions for GNNs. This enables us to translate the properties of the
target graph function into properties of the GNN's aggregation function.

inspiration for communities studying artificial life. It is now widely admitted
that the adaptation mechanisms enabling these properties are largely influenced
by the environments they inhabit. Organisms facing environmental variability
have two alternative adaptation mechanisms operating at different timescales:
\textit{plasticity}, the ability of a phenotype to survive in diverse
environments and \textit{evolvability}, the ability to adapt through mutations.
Although vital under environmental variability, both mechanisms are associated
with fitness costs hypothesized to render them unnecessary in stable
environments. In this work, we study the interplay between environmental
dynamics and adaptation in a minimal model of the evolution of plasticity and
evolvability. We experiment with different types of environments characterized
by the presence of niches and a climate function that determines the fitness
landscape. We empirically show that environmental dynamics affect plasticity
and evolvability differently and that the presence of diverse ecological niches
favors adaptability even in stable environments. We perform ablation studies of
the selection mechanisms to separate the role of fitness-based selection and
niche-limited competition. Results obtained from our minimal model allow us to
propose promising research directions in the study of open-endedness in
biological and artificial systems.

estimators based on a set of training instances. These estimators can be used
to evaluate the congruence of test instances with respect to the training set,
to answer two practically useful questions: (1) which test instances will be
reliably predicted by a model trained with the training instances? and (2) can
we identify incongruous regions of the feature space so that data owners
understand the data's limitations or guide future data collection? We
empirically validate Data-SUITE's performance and coverage guarantees and
demonstrate on cross-site medical data, biased data, and data with concept

successful tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres and their mass loss. Forming
those lines requires ionisation and recombination of helium in the exoplanetary
atmosphere. This ionisation is caused by stellar photons at extreme
ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths; however, no currently active telescopes can
observe this part of the stellar spectrum. The relevant part of the stellar EUV
spectrum consists of individual emission lines, many of them being formed by
iron at coronal temperatures. The stellar iron abundance in the corona is often
observed to be depleted for high-activity low-mass stars due to the first
ionisation potential (FIP) effect. I show that stars with high versus low
coronal iron abundances follow different scaling laws that tie together their
X-ray emission and the narrow-band EUV flux that causes helium ionisation. I
also show that the stellar iron to oxygen abundance ratio in the corona can be
measured reasonably well from X-ray CCD spectra, yielding similar results to
high-resolution X-ray observations. Taking coronal iron abundance into account,
the currently observed large scatter in the relationship of EUV irradiation
with exoplanetary helium transit depths can be reduced, improving the target
selection criteria for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy. In particular,

orbits and is completely eclipsed by an active M-dwarf star. Using light curve
data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and follow-up
high-resolution Doppler spectroscopic observations, we find the BD has a radius
of $R_b = 1.08 \pm 0.03{\rm R_J}$, a mass of $M_b = 64.4 \pm 2.3{\rm M_J}$, an
orbital period of $P = 7.200865 \pm 0.00002$ days, and an eccentricity of
$e=0.337\pm 0.002$. The host star has a mass of $M_\star = 0.53 \pm 0.02{\rm
M_\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star= 0.50 \pm 0.01{\rm R_\odot}$, an effective
temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 3621 \pm 48$K, and a metallicity of $\rm
[Fe/H]=+0.06\pm 0.08$. TOI-2119b joins an emerging population of transiting BDs
around M-dwarf host stars, with TOI-2119 being the ninth such system. These
M-dwarf--brown dwarf systems typically occupy mass ratios near $q = M_b/M_\star
\approx 0.1-0.2$, which separates them from the typical mass ratios for systems
with transiting substellar objects and giant exoplanets that orbit more massive
stars. The nature of the secondary eclipse of the BD by the star enables us to
estimate the effective temperature of the substellar object to be $2030\pm
84$K, which is consistent with predictions by substellar evolutionary models.

quantify its strength using the age--[Fe/H] distribution of stars across the
Milky Way with APOGEE data. We find a broken age--[Fe/H] relation in the
Galactic disc at $r>6$ kpc, with a more pronounced break at larger radii. To
quantify the strength of radial migration, we assume stars born at each radius
have a unique age and metallicity, and then decompose the metallicity
distribution function (MDF) of mono-age young populations into different
Gaussian components that originated from various birth radii at $r_{\rm
birth}<13$ kpc. We find that, at ages of 2 and 3 Gyr, roughly half the stars
were formed within 1 kpc of their present radius, and very few stars ($<5$%)
were formed more than 4 kpc away from their present radius. These results
suggest limited short distance radial migration and inefficient long distance
migration in the Milky Way during the last 3 Gyr. In the very outer disc beyond
15~kpc, the observed age--[Fe/H] distribution is consistent with the prediction
of pure radial migration from smaller radii, suggesting a migration origin of
the very outer disc. We also estimate intrinsic metallicity gradients at ages
of 2 and 3 Gyr of $-0.061$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ and $-0.063$ dex kpc$^{-1}$,

This effect, called Intrinsic Alignments (IA), is an important contributor to
the systematic uncertainties for wide-field weak lensing surveys. On
cosmological distance scales, intrinsic shape alignments have been observed in
red galaxies, which are usually bulge-dominated; while blue galaxies, which are
mostly disc-dominated, exhibit shape alignments consistent with a null
detection. However, disc-dominated galaxies typically consist of two prominent
structures: disc and bulge. Since the bulge component has similar properties as
elliptical galaxies and is thought to have formed in a similar fashion,
naturally one could ask whether the bulge components exhibit similar alignments
as ellipticals? In this paper, we investigate how different components of
galaxies exhibit IA in the TNG100-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, as
well as the dependence of IA on the fraction of stars in rotation-dominated
structures at $z=0$. The measurements were controlled for mass differences
between the samples. We find that the bulges exhibit significantly higher IA
signals, with a nonlinear alignment model amplitude of $A_I =
2.98^{+0.36}_{-0.37}$ compared to the amplitude for the galaxies as a whole
(both components), $A_I = 1.13^{+0.37}_{-0.35}$. The results for bulges are
statistically consistent with those for elliptical galaxies, which have $A_I =
3.47^{+0.57}_{-0.57}$. These results highlight the importance of studying
galaxy dynamics in order to understand galaxy alignments and their cosmological
implications.

contribute significantly. Disentangling their contributions has been
challenging for years due to the dominance of the jet. To quantify the
contributions to the spectral variability, we use the statistical technique for
dimensionality reduction Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on a spectroscopic
data set of 26 $\gamma$-ray blazars. This technique allows to model large
numbers of spectra in terms of a reduced number of components.We use a priori
knowledge to obtain components associated to meaningful physical processes. The
sources are classified according to their optical spectrum as host-galaxy
dominated BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), BL Lacs, or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs). Host-galaxy sources show less variability, as expected, and
bluer-when-brighter trends, as the other BL Lacs. For FSRQs, more complicated
colour-flux behaviours are observed: redder-when-brighter for low states
saturating above a certain level and, in some cases, turning to
bluer-when-brighter. We are able to reproduce the variability observed during
10 years using only 2 to 4 components, depending on the type. The simplest
scenario corresponds to host-galaxy blazars, whose spectra are reconstructed
using the stellar population and a power law for the jet. BL Lac spectra are
reproduced using from 2 to 4 power laws. Different components can be associated
to acceleration/cooling processes taking place in the jet. The reconstruction
of FSRQs also incorporates a QSO-like component to account for the BLR, plus a
very steep power law, associated to the accretion disk.

One
extreme case are overcontact systems, which is expected to be part of the
evolution of all stars evolving towards a merger, and is hypothesized to play a
role in the formation of binary black holes. However, important simplifications
are made to model the evolution of overcontact binaries, namely that tidal or
rotational deformation is frequently ignored. Yet, both observation and theory
show that overcontact stars are heavily tidally deformed, leaving a potentially
important effect on the outer layers unaccounted for in models. In this work we
develop the methodology to represented tidally deformed stars. Using numerical
methods, we compute the structure correction factors to the 1D spherical
stellar structure equations due to the binary Roche potential, and compare them
to existing results and the structure corrections of single rotating stars. We
implement the new structure correction factors into the stellar evolution code
MESA and explore several case studies. We compare the differences between our
simulations when no rotation is included, when we treat rotation using single
star corrections (i.e. only accounting for centrifugal deformation) or when we
use tidal deformation. We find that ignoring rotation in deformed detached
eclipsing binaries can produce a radius discrepancy of up to 5%. The difference
between tidal and single star centrifugal distortion models is more benign at
1%, showing that single rotating star models are a suitable approximation of
tidally deformed stars in a binary system. In overcontact configurations, we
find a similar 5% variation in surface properties as a result of tidal
distortion with respect to non-rotating models, showing that it is
inappropriate to model binary stars that fill their Roche lobe significantly,
as non-rotating.

training speech enhancement without the need of a single isolated in-domain

sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is
based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model
on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain
mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing
them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding
pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the
teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the
latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement
datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior
approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation
model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain
adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on
the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model
keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded

searching for interesting patterns in light curves is impractical, requiring an
automated data-mining approach for the characterization of sources.
  Straightforward fitting of temporal models to light curves is not a sure way
to identify them, especially with noisy data. We used unsupervised machine
learning to distill a large data set of light-curve parameters, revealing its
clustering structure in preparation for anomaly detection and subsequent
searches for specific source behaviors (e.g., flares, eclipses).
  Self-organizing maps (SOMs) achieve dimensionality reduction and clustering
within a single framework. They are a type of artificial neural network trained
to approximate the data with a two-dimensional grid of discrete interconnected
units, which can later be visualized on the plane. We trained our SOM on
temporal-only parameters computed from more than 100,000 detections from the
EXTraS catalog.
  The resulting map reveals that about 2500 most variable sources are clustered
based on temporal characteristics. We find distinctive regions of the SOM map
associated with flares, eclipses, dips, linear light curves, and others. Each
group contains sources that appear similar by eye. We single out a handful of
interesting sources for further study.
  The condensed view of our dataset provided by SOMs allowed us to identify
groups of similar sources, speeding up manual characterization by orders of
magnitude. Our method also highlights problems with fitting simple temporal
models to light curves and can be used to mitigate them to an extent. This will
be crucial for fully exploiting the high data volume expected from upcoming
X-ray surveys, and may also help with interpreting supervised classification
models.

subsurface using geophysical well logs (known as well-log correlation) by-hand.
Based on individual well log interpretation and well-to-well comparisons, these
correlations are done in the context of depositional models within a
stratigraphic framework. Recently, many researchers have focused on automatic
well-log correlation using a variety of warping algorithms that measure well
similarity, and both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods that
assign categorical labels based on known tops in many other wells. These
methods require a standardized suite of digital well logs (i.e. gamma ray logs
for every well) along with the depth to the top of the formations, which might
not be available in many cases. Herein, we propose a method that does not use
geophysical well logs for correlation, but rather uses already picked tops in
multiple wells to recommend the depth to the remaining unpicked tops in the
wells. This recommender system calculates the depth to all formation tops in
all the wells for two different datasets in two different basins. The Teapot
Dome dataset is composed of lithostratigraphic formation tops, and the
Mannville Group dataset is composed of sequence-stratigraphic (representing
multiple lithologic groups within a stratigraphic unit) formation tops. For the
demonstration, mean absolute error and root mean squared error of four-fold
cross-validation compares the recommender system predictions to the ground
truth human interpretations. The recommender system is competitive and often
outperforms state of the art spline interpolation methods. Lastly, increasing
the size of the training dataset decreases the prediction error, and that
variance in error decreases with increasing formation tops picked in each
formation and well for the lithostratigraphic top picks.

rate as a function of the diabatic coupling. Its asymptotic $(\hbar \rightarrow
0)$ limit is the semiclassical golden-rule instanton rate theory, which
rigorously approximates nuclear quantum effects, lends itself to efficient
numerical computation and gives physical insight into reaction mechanisms.
However the golden rule by itself becomes insufficient as the strength of the
diabatic coupling increases, so higher-order terms must be additionally
considered. In this work we give a first-principles derivation of the
next-order term beyond the golden rule, represented as a sum of three
components. Two of them lead to new instanton pathways that extend the
golden-rule case and, among other factors, account for the effects of
recrossing on the full rate. The remaining component derives from the
equilibrium partition function and accounts for changes in potential energy
around the reactant and product wells due to diabatic coupling. The new
semiclassical theory demands little computational effort beyond a golden-rule
instanton calculation. It makes it possible to rigorously assess the accuracy
of the golden-rule approximation and sets the stage for future work on general
semiclassical nonadiabatic rate theories.

weaker limits on $g_{a \gamma}$ (by $0.1-0.3$ dex) with different magnetic

astrophysical uncertainties regarding the strength and structure of cluster

leads to performance guarantee of $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ bounds on model
recovery and prediction accuracy under the theoretical setting of training a

interpreting remotely sensed velocity measurements. Here, KE in high-resolution
global simulations (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model; HYCOM, and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology general circulation model; MITgcm), at the sea surface
(0 m) and 15 m, are respectively compared with KE from undrogued and drogued
surface drifters. Global maps and zonal averages are computed for low-frequency
($<$ 0.5 cpd), near-inertial, diurnal, and semi-diurnal bands. Both models
exhibit low-frequency equatorial KE that is low relative to drifter values.
HYCOM near-inertial KE is higher than in MITgcm, and closer to drifter values,
probably due to more frequently updated atmospheric forcing. HYCOM semi-diurnal
KE is lower than in MITgcm, and closer to drifter values, likely due to
inclusion of a parameterized topographic internal wave drag. A concurrent tidal
harmonic analysis in the diurnal band demonstrates that much of the diurnal
flow is non-tidal. We compute a simple proxy of near-surface vertical
structure, the ratio of 0 m KE to 0 m KE plus 15 m KE in model outputs, and
undrogued KE to undrogued KE plus drogued KE in drifter observations. Over most
latitudes and frequency bands, model ratios track the drifter ratios to within
error bars. Values of this ratio demonstrate significant vertical structure in
all frequency bands except the semidiurnal band. Latitudinal dependence in the
ratio is greatest in diurnal and low-frequency bands.

phenomena can be optically probed in moir\'e systems created by stacking two
layers of transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors: optically injected
excitons can interact with itinerant carriers occupying narrow moir\'e bands to
form exciton-polarons sensitive to strong correlations. Here, we investigate
the behaviour of excitons dressed by a Fermi sea localised by the moir\'e
superlattice of a molybdenum diselenide (MoSe$_2$) / tungsten diselenide
(WSe$_2$) twisted hetero-bilayer. At a multitude of fractional fillings of the
moir\'e lattice, we observe ordering of both electrons and holes into stable
correlated electronic states. Magneto-optical measurements reveal extraordinary
Zeeman splittings of the exciton-polarons due to exchange interactions in the
correlated hole phases, with a maximum close to the correlated state at one
hole per site. The temperature dependence of the Zeeman splitting reveals
antiferromagnetic ordering of the correlated holes across a wide range of
fractional fillings. Our results illustrate the nature of exciton-polarons in
the presence of strongly correlated electronic states and reveal the rich
potential of the MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ platform for investigations of Fermi-Hubbard

The missing $B$-band flux is best-explained by line-blanket absorption from
Fe-peak elements in the outer 1% of the ejected mass. The observed $B-V$ color
evolution of the SN also matches the prediction from an over-density of Fe-peak
elements in the same outer 1% of the ejected mass, whereas bluer colors are
expected from a purely monotonic distribution of Fe-peak elements. The presence
of excess nucleosynthetic material in the extreme outer layers of the ejecta

through discrete-time formulations. This has the advantage of a consolidated
theory and very good understanding of success and failure cases. However,
discrete-time SLAM needs tailored algorithms and simplifying assumptions when
high-rate and/or asynchronous measurements, coming from different sensors, are
present in the estimation process. Conversely, continuous-time SLAM, often
overlooked by practitioners, does not suffer from these limitations. Indeed, it
allows integrating new sensor data asynchronously without adding a new
optimization variable for each new measurement. In this way, the integration of
asynchronous or continuous high-rate streams of sensor data does not require
tailored and highly-engineered algorithms, enabling the fusion of multiple
sensor modalities in an intuitive fashion. On the down side, continuous time
introduces a prior that could worsen the trajectory estimates in some
unfavorable situations. In this work, we aim at systematically comparing the
advantages and limitations of the two formulations in vision-based SLAM. To do
so, we perform an extensive experimental analysis, varying robot type, speed of
motion, and sensor modalities. Our experimental analysis suggests that,
independently of the trajectory type, continuous-time SLAM is superior to its
discrete counterpart whenever the sensors are not time-synchronized. In the
context of this work, we developed, and open source, a modular and efficient
software architecture containing state-of-the-art algorithms to solve the SLAM

from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. Let $H$ be a fixed graph with possible loops. In the
list homomorphism problem, denoted by \textsc{LHom}($H$), the instance is a
graph $G$, whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of $V(H)$, called list.
We ask whether there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, such that every
vertex from $G$ is mapped to a vertex from its list.
  We study the complexity of the \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem in intersection
graphs of various geometric objects. In particular, we are interested in
answering the question for what graphs $H$ and for what types of geometric
objects, the \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem can be solved in time subexponential in
the number of vertices of the instance.
  We fully resolve this question for string graphs, i.e., intersection graphs
of continuous curves in the plane. Quite surprisingly, it turns out that the
dichotomy exactly coincides with the analogous dichotomy for graphs excluding a
fixed path as an induced subgraph [Okrasa, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, STACS 2021].
  Then we turn our attention to subclasses of string graphs, defined as
intersections of fat objects. We observe that the (non)existence of
subexponential-time algorithms in such classes is closely related to the size
$\mathrm{mrc}(H)$ of a maximum reflexive clique in $H$, i.e., maximum number of
pairwise adjacent vertices, each of which has a loop. We study the maximum
value of $\mathrm{mrc}(H)$ that guarantees the existence of a
subexponential-time algorithm for \textsc{LHom}($H$) in intersection graphs of
(i) convex fat objects, (ii) fat similarly-sized objects, and (iii) disks. In
the first two cases we obtain optimal results, by giving matching algorithms
and lower bounds.
  Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results to weighted
generalizations of \textsc{LHom}($H$).

contents. Building on past success of model attribution in the image domain, we
discuss algorithmic improvements for generating user-end speech models that
empirically achieve high attribution accuracy, while maintaining high

attempting to remove the watermarks, and the feasibility of learning robust
watermarks against these attacks.

circuit. Using the mathematical formalism of optimal control, these laser
pulses are optimized. This method has been used in quantum computing to
optimize pulses for quantum gate implementations, but has only recently been

advantages over gate based methods such as faster state preparation, simpler

these ideas, we present the development of a novel adjoint based variational
method. This method can be tailored towards and applied in neutral atom quantum

measures $P$ and $Q$ is a problem fraught with computational and statistical
challenges. A promising approach lies in using the dual potential functions
obtained when solving an entropy-regularized OT problem between samples $P_n$
and $Q_n$, which can be used to recover an approximately optimal map. The
negentropy penalization in that scheme introduces, however, an estimation bias
that grows with the regularization strength. A well-known remedy to debias such
estimates, which has gained wide popularity among practitioners of regularized
OT, is to center them, by subtracting auxiliary problems involving $P_n$ and
itself, as well as $Q_n$ and itself. We do prove that, under favorable
conditions on $P$ and $Q$, debiasing can yield better approximations to the
Monge map. However, and perhaps surprisingly, we present a few cases in which
debiasing is provably detrimental in a statistical sense, notably when the
regularization strength is large or the number of samples is small. These
claims are validated experimentally on synthetic and real datasets, and should
reopen the debate on whether debiasing is needed when using entropic optimal
transport.

This odd diffusion emerges in the form of a two-dimensional tensor with an
antisymmetric part. In particular, we show that chiral diffusion is complex,
featuring transitions between super, quasi-normal, and sub diffusion, and very
slowly aging. Moreover, we show that the diffusion tensor elements, including
off-diagonal elements; i.e., odd diffusion coefficient, change sign according
to flow vorticity. Therefore, the chiral fluid has a self regulated diffusion,
controlled by its vorticity.

incorporating this information into portfolio optimization. For this framework,
we introduce the Commonality Principle, providing a solution for the optimal
selection of portfolio drivers as the common drivers. Portfolio constituent
dynamics are modeled by Partial Differential Equations, and solutions
approximated with neural networks. Sensitivities with respect to the common
drivers are obtained via Automatic Adjoint Differentiation. Information on
asset dynamics is incorporated via sensitivities into portfolio optimization.
Portfolio constituents are embedded into the space of sensitivities with
respect to their common drivers, and a distance matrix in this space called the
Sensitivity matrix is used to solve the convex optimization for
diversification. The sensitivity matrix measures the similarity of the
projections of portfolio constituents on a vector space formed by common
drivers' returns and is used to optimize for diversification on both
idiosyncratic and systematic risks while adding directionality and future
behavior information via returns dynamics. For portfolio optimization, we
perform hierarchical clustering on the sensitivity matrix. To the best of the
author's knowledge, this is the first time that sensitivities' dynamics
approximated with neural networks have been used for portfolio optimization.
Secondly, that hierarchical clustering on a matrix of sensitivities is used to
solve the convex optimization problem and incorporate the hierarchical
information of these sensitivities. Thirdly, public and listed variables can be
used to obtain maximum idiosyncratic and systematic diversification by means of
the sensitivity space with respect to optimal portfolio drivers. We reach
over-performance in many experiments with respect to all other out-of-sample
methods for different markets and real datasets.

increasing applications of FL in the area of mobile sensing, such as human

multi-device environment (MDE), wherein each user owns multiple data-producing
devices. With the proliferation of mobile and wearable devices, MDEs are
increasingly becoming popular in ubicomp settings, therefore necessitating the
study of FL in them. FL in MDEs is characterized by being not independent and
identically distributed (non-IID) across clients, complicated by the presence
of both user and device heterogeneities. Further, ensuring efficient
utilization of system resources on FL clients in a MDE remains an important
challenge. In this paper, we propose FLAME, a user-centered FL training
approach to counter statistical and system heterogeneity in MDEs, and bring
consistency in inference performance across devices. FLAME features (i)
user-centered FL training utilizing the time alignment across devices from the
same user; (ii) accuracy- and efficiency-aware device selection; and (iii)
model personalization to devices. We also present an FL evaluation testbed with
realistic energy drain and network bandwidth profiles, and a novel class-based
data partitioning scheme to extend existing HAR datasets to a federated setup.
Our experiment results on three multi-device HAR datasets show that FLAME
outperforms various baselines by 4.3-25.8% higher F1 score, 1.02-2.86x greater
energy efficiency, and up to 2.06x speedup in convergence to target accuracy

of a cluster, while the initial half-mass radius is dominant in setting the
rate of BH exchange interactions in the central cluster regions. We find that
the mass of interacting BHs, rather than how frequently their interactions with
other BHs occur, is more crucial in the thermal expansion and eventual
evaporation of the cluster. We formulate a novel approach to easily quantify
the degree of BH-BH dynamical activity in each model. We report 12 in-cluster

different types (inspiral, eccentric, hierarchical) across the ten $N$-body
models presented. Our DBH merger efficiency is 3--4$\times10^{-5}$ mergers per

determining the number of DBH mergers, with the potential presence of a
transitional density point (between 1.2-3.8$\times10^3$M$_\odot$/pc$^3$) below
which the number of in-cluster mergers increases with cluster density and above
which the increased stellar density acts to prevent in-cluster BH mergers. The
importance of the history of dynamical interactions within the cluster in

words or phrases, most visual classification methods define categories with
numerical indices. However, the language specification of the classes provides
an especially useful prior for biased and noisy datasets, where it can help
disambiguate what features are task-relevant. Recently, large-scale multimodal
models have been shown to recognize a wide variety of high-level concepts from
a language specification even without additional image training data, but they
are often unable to distinguish classes for more fine-grained tasks. CNNs, in
contrast, can extract subtle image features that are required for fine-grained
discrimination, but will overfit to any bias or noise in datasets. Our insight
is to use high-level language specification as advice for constraining the
classification evidence to task-relevant features, instead of distractors. To
do this, we ground task-relevant words or phrases with attention maps from a
pretrained large-scale model. We then use this grounding to supervise a
classifier's spatial attention away from distracting context. We show that
supervising spatial attention in this way improves performance on
classification tasks with biased and noisy data, including about 3-15%
worst-group accuracy improvements and 41-45% relative improvements on fairness
metrics.

conditioning of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem, deep learning approaches
are being actively investigated for better representing object priors and
constraints. This work proposes to use a style-based generative adversarial

where additional information in the form of a prior image of the sought-after
object is available. An optimization problem is formulated in the intermediate
latent-space of a StyleGAN, that is disentangled with respect to meaningful
image attributes or ""styles"", such as the contrast used in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Discrepancy between the sought-after and prior images is
measured in the disentangled latent-space, and is used to regularize the
inverse problem in the form of constraints on specific styles of the
disentangled latent-space. A stylized numerical study inspired by MR imaging is
designed, where the sought-after and the prior image are structurally similar,
but belong to different contrast mechanisms. The presented numerical studies
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach as compared to classical
approaches in the form of traditional metrics.

Moreover, the essential practical details, e.g., selecting a proper pretrained

initializing the GAN training process by a pretrained checkpoint primarily
affects the model's coverage rather than the fidelity of individual samples.
Second, we explicitly describe how pretrained generators and discriminators

benefit of our analysis, we describe a simple recipe to choose an appropriate
GAN checkpoint that is the most suitable for finetuning to a particular target

the breakthrough performance in various cognitive applications. Recently,
neural networks (NN) have been intensively explored to model partial
differential equations as NN can be viewed as universal approximators for
nonlinear functions. A deep network operator (DeepONet) architecture was
proposed to model the general non-linear continuous operators for partial
differential equations (PDE) due to its better generalization capabilities than
existing mainstream deep neural network architectures. However, existing
DeepONet can only accept one input function, which limits its application. In
this work, we explore the DeepONet architecture to extend it to accept two or
more input functions. We propose new Enhanced DeepONet or EDeepONet high-level
neural network structure, in which two input functions are represented by two
branch DNN sub-networks, which are then connected with output truck network via
inner product to generate the output of the whole neural network. The proposed
EDeepONet structure can be easily extended to deal with multiple input
functions. Our numerical results on modeling two partial differential equation
examples shows that the proposed enhanced DeepONet is about 7X-17X or about one
order of magnitude more accurate than the fully connected neural network and is
about 2X-3X more accurate than a simple extended DeepONet for both training and
test.

their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a challenging problem that
calls for rethinking the defense strategy. In this paper, we take a step back
and investigate the causes behind ML models' susceptibility to adversarial
examples. In particular, we focus on exploring the cause-effect link between
adversarial examples and the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. To that end, we
propose an OOD generalization method that stands against both adversary-induced
and natural distribution shifts. Through an OOD to in-distribution mapping
intuition, our approach translates OOD inputs to the data distribution used to
train and test the model. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark
image datasets of different scales (MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet) and by
leveraging image-to-image translation methods, we confirm that the adversarial
examples problem is a special case of the wider OOD generalization problem.
Across all datasets, we show that our translation-based approach consistently
improves robustness to OOD adversarial inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by a significant margin, while preserving the exact accuracy on benign
(in-distribution) data. Furthermore, our method generalizes on naturally OOD
inputs such as darker or sharper images

Additionally, one may still fit a model to the resulting storage and loss

to fitting the data to a model chosen a priori, departing from a model-free
description of the material's frequency behavior guides the selection of the

masses, usually estimated by the reverberation mapping (RM) method or the
relevant secondary methods. The virial factor had been believed to be from the
geometric effect of broad-line region. The measured virial factor of Fe ii is
larger than that of H$\beta$ for 98% of these quasars. The virial factor is
very different from object to object and for different emission lines. For most
of these quasars, the virial factor of H$\beta$ is larger than these averages
that were usually used in determining the masses of black holes. There are
three positive correlations among the measured virial factor of H$\beta$,
dimensionless accretion rate and Fe ii/H$\beta$ line ratio. A positive
three-dimensional correlation is found among these three quantities, and this
correlation indicates that the virial factor is likely dominated by the
dimensionless accretion rate and metallicity. A negative correlation is found
between the redward shift of H$\beta$ and the scaled size of broad-line region
radius in units of the gravitational radius of black hole. This negative
correlation will be expected naturally if the redward shift of H$\beta$ is
mainly from the gravity of black hole. Radiation pressure from accretion disk
may be a significant contributor to the virial factor.

the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and SPHEREx will individually
probe reionization through the power spectra of the 21cm and Ly$\alpha$ lines
respectively, but will be limited by bright foregrounds and instrumental
systematics. Cross-correlating these measurements could reduce systematics,
potentially tightening constraints on the inferred astrophysical parameters. In
this study, we present forecasts of cross-correlation taking into account the
effects of exact uv-sampling and foreground filtering to estimate the
feasibility of HERAxSPHEREx making a detection of the 21cm-Ly$\alpha$

isolating the sources of uncertainty, we explore the impacts of experimental
limitations such as foreground filtering and Ly$\alpha$ thermal noise
uncertainty have on making a detection of the cross-power spectrum. We then
implement this strategy in a simulation of the cross-power spectrum and
observational error to identify redshifts where fiducial 21cmFAST models
predict the highest signal-to-noise detection ($z \sim 8$). We conclude that
detection of the SPHEREx-HERA cross-correlation will require an optimistic
level of 21cm foreground filtering, as well as deeper thermal noise
integrations due to a lack of overlapping sensitive modes but for CDIM with its
larger range of scales and lower noise forecast detection levels, may be

extension to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) where the
action is supplemented with a quadratic torsion term. No assumption is made
about the weakness of the quadratic term although in the weak-field regime the
validity of our previously derived perturbative solution is confirmed.
Regarding the exact nature of the vacuum, it is found that if the center of
symmetry is to be regular, the mathematical conditions on the tetrad at the
isotropy point mimic those of general relativity. With respect to horizons it
is found that, under very mild assumptions, a smooth horizon cannot exist
unless the quadratic torsion coupling, $\alpha$, vanishes, which is the TEGR
limit (with the Schwarzschild tetrad as its solution). This analysis is then
supplemented with computational work utilizing asymptotically Schwarzschild
boundary data. It is verified that in no case studied does a smooth horizon
form. For $\alpha > 0$ naked singularities occur which break down the equations
of motion before a horizon can form. For $\alpha < 0$ there is a limited range
of $\alpha$ where a vacuum horizon might exist but, if present, the horizon is
singular. Therefore physically acceptable black hole horizons are problematic
in the studied theory at least within the realm of vacuum static spherical
symmetry. These results also imply that static spherical matter distributions
generally must have extra restrictions on their spatial extent and
stress-energy bounds so as to render the vacuum solution invalid in the

  Traffic Forecasting","9 pages, 5 figures, currently under review for KDD22",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the
traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently
possesses graph structures, much research efforts have been put with graph
neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown
promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure.
However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases, and do
not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be
problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often
suffers from the unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In
this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive
Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by
progressively adapting to input data during the training and the testing
phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive
adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the
model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit
to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs
the traffic prediction. When applied to four real-world traffic datasets of
diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of
PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in
different study sites with robustness.

In this article, we are performing different analyses for multiple frequencies,
from gamma-rays to radio, as well as, the C IV ${\lambda}$1549 {\AA} emission
line and the ${\lambda}$1350 {\AA} continuum. Using the non-thermal dominance
parameter, we separated the C IV and the continuum light curves for when the
dominant source of continuum is the accretion disk or the jet. We found a
correlation at a delay consistent with zero between the line and the continuum
dominated by disk emission indicating a very small broad-line region (BLR).
From the resulting delay between the 15 GHz and gamma-rays, we estimated the
distance of the gamma-ray emission region from the jet apex to be $\sim$37 pc.
The C IV flux decreases when the continuum and gamma-rays increase at some of
the high activity periods. The C IV profile presents a larger variable
component in its blue wing. The relation between the luminosities of C IV and
the continuum does not completely follow the relation for a quasar sample. Our
results lead us to propose an outflow of BLR material in the jet-flow

with frequency given by the vorticity of the internal rotation velocity.
Finally, the stress-energy-momentum tensor is used to determine the

  Semantic Segmentation","13 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Off-road semantic segmentation with fine-grained labels is necessary for
autonomous vehicles to understand driving scenes, as the coarse-grained road
detection can not satisfy off-road vehicles with various mechanical properties.
Fine-grained semantic segmentation in off-road scenes usually has no unified
category definition due to ambiguous nature environments, and the cost of
pixel-wise labeling is extremely high. Furthermore, semantic properties of
off-road scenes can be very changeable due to various precipitations,
temperature, defoliation, etc. To address these challenges, this research
proposes an active and contrastive learning-based method that does not rely on
pixel-wise labels, but only on patch-based weak annotations for model learning.
There is no need for predefined semantic categories, the contrastive
learning-based feature representation and adaptive clustering will discover the
category model from scene data. In order to actively adapt to new scenes, a
risk evaluation method is proposed to discover and select hard frames with
high-risk predictions for supplemental labeling, so as to update the model
efficiently. Experiments conducted on our self-developed off-road dataset and
DeepScene dataset demonstrate that fine-grained semantic segmentation can be
learned with only dozens of weakly labeled frames, and the model can
efficiently adapt across scenes by weak supervision, while achieving almost the
same level of performance as typical fully supervised baselines.

topology, which inevitably gives rise to the accumulation of magnetic energy
within stressed regions including current sheets. This stored energy is often
released explosively through the process of magnetic reconnection, which
produces a reconfiguration of the magnetic field, along with high-speed flows,
thermal heating, and nonthermal particle acceleration. Either collisional or
kinetic dissipation mechanisms are required to overcome the topological
constraints, both of which have been predicted by theory and validated with in
situ spacecraft observations or laboratory experiments. However, major
challenges remain in understanding magnetic reconnection in large systems, such
as the solar corona, where the collisionality is weak and the kinetic scales
are vanishingly small in comparison to macroscopic scales. The plasmoid
instability or formation of multiple plasmoids in long reconnecting current
sheets is one possible multiscale solution for bridging this vast range of
scales, and new laboratory experiments are poised to study these regimes. In
conjunction with these efforts, we anticipate that the coming era of exascale

appreciation for these dynamics is necessary to understand how a platform

focus on ""reclassification,"" wherein a platform changes its filtering decision

dielectric but the left-hand rule in the dispersive metal/magnetic materials.
In addition to the dispersion, the structural features can affect the
spin-momentum locking significantly. Remarkably, an extraordinary longitudinal
spin originating from the coupling polarization ellipticity is uncovered even

ensemble learning algorithms such as random forests to quantify its
uncertainty. While normality results of IOUS have been studied extensively, its
variance estimation approaches and theoretical properties remain mostly
unexplored. Existing approaches mainly utilize the leading term dominance
property in the Hoeffding decomposition. However, such a view usually leads to
biased estimation when the kernel size is large or the sample size is small. On
the other hand, while several unbiased estimators exist in the literature,
their relationships and theoretical properties, especially the ratio
consistency, have never been studied. These limitations lead to unguaranteed
performances of constructed confidence intervals. To bridge these gaps in the
literature, we propose a new view of the Hoeffding decomposition for variance
estimation that leads to an unbiased estimator. Instead of leading term
dominance, our view utilizes the dominance of the peak region. Moreover, we
establish the connection and equivalence of our estimator with several existing
unbiased variance estimators. Theoretically, we are the first to establish the
ratio consistency of such a variance estimator, which justifies the coverage
rate of confidence intervals constructed from random forests. Numerically, we
further propose a local smoothing procedure to improve the estimator's finite
sample performance. Extensive simulation studies show that our estimators enjoy
lower bias and archive targeted coverage rates.

arctangent soft round (ASR) method, which differs from the straight-through

zero, thereby solving the discrete problem caused by the rounding process.
Finally, to bridge the gap between full-precision and low-bit quantization

determine an accurate gradient in backpropagation. The ASR+MDE method is a
simple alternative to the STE method and is practical for use in different
uniform quantization methods. In our evaluation, the proposed quantizer

decidedly non-trivial, and the stability analysis is equally tricky. Regarding
the angular motion, these constant-$r$ orbits will be seen to exhibit both
precession and nutation -- typically with incommensurate frequencies. Thus this

is generically surface-filling, with the orbits completely covering a symmetric
equatorial band which is a segment of a spherical surface, (a so-called

interplay between the orbital angular momentum and the Carter constant. The

decision-theoretic model pioneered by [Blackwell, 1951, 1953]. Initially, the
data buyer has only partial information about the payoff-relevant state of the
world. A data seller offers additional information about the state of the
world. The information is revealed through signaling schemes, also referred to
as experiments. In the single-agent setting, any mechanism can be represented
as a menu of experiments. [Bergemann et al., 2018] present a complete
characterization of the revenue-optimal mechanism in a binary state and binary
action environment. By contrast, no characterization is known for the case with
more actions. In this paper, we consider more general environments and study
arguably the simplest mechanism, which only sells the fully informative
experiment. In the environment with binary state and $m\geq 3$ actions, we
provide an $O(m)$-approximation to the optimal revenue by selling only the
fully informative experiment and show that the approximation ratio is tight up
to an absolute constant factor. An important corollary of our lower bound is
that the size of the optimal menu must grow at least linearly in the number of
available actions, so no universal upper bound exists for the size of the
optimal menu in the general single-dimensional setting.
  For multi-dimensional environments, we prove that even in arguably the
simplest matching utility environment with 3 states and 3 actions, the ratio
between the optimal revenue and the revenue by selling only the fully
informative experiment can grow immediately to a polynomial of the number of
agent types. Nonetheless, if the distribution is uniform, we show that selling

in the scale of problems they can handle. Particularly, with the increase of
the number of agents, their training costs grow exponentially. In this paper,
we address this limitation by introducing a scalable MARL method called
Distributed multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors (DARL1N).
DARL1N is an off-policy actor-critic method that breaks the curse of
dimensionality by decoupling the global interactions among agents and
restricting information exchanges to one-hop neighbors. Each agent optimizes
its action value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood,
significantly reducing the learning complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness
by training with varying numbers and states of neighbors. This structure allows
us to formulate a distributed learning framework to further speed up the
training procedure. Comparisons with state-of-the-art MARL methods show that
DARL1N significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality
and is scalable as the number of agents increases.

heterogeneous urban graph (HUG) incorporates both the geo-spatial and temporal
people movement variations in a single graph structure. Given a HUG, a set of
meta-paths are designed to capture the rich urban semantics as composite
relations between nodes. Region embedding is carried out using heterogeneous
graph attention network (HAN). HUGAT is designed to consider multiple learning
objectives of city's geo-spatial and mobility variations simultaneously. In our
extensive experiments on NYC data, HUGAT outperformed all the state-of-the-art

various prediction tasks of crime, average personal income, and bike flow as
well as the spatial clustering task.

reconstruction objective for unsupervised GNN training. However, existing graph
auto-encoders are designed to reconstruct the direct links, so GNNs trained in
this way are only optimized towards proximity-oriented graph mining tasks, and
will fall short when the topological structures matter. In this work, we
revisit the graph encoding process of GNNs which essentially learns to encode
the neighborhood information of each node into an embedding vector, and propose
a novel graph decoder to reconstruct the entire neighborhood information
regarding both proximity and structure via Neighborhood Wasserstein
Reconstruction (NWR). Specifically, from the GNN embedding of each node, NWR
jointly predicts its node degree and neighbor feature distribution, where the
distribution prediction adopts an optimal-transport loss based on the
Wasserstein distance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world

NWR have much more advantageous in structure-oriented graph mining tasks, while
also achieving competitive performance in proximity-oriented ones.

study the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in favor of
low-depth solutions when training deep neural networks. We characterize a
notion of effective depth that measures the first layer for which sample

Furthermore, we hypothesize and empirically show that SGD implicitly selects
neural networks of small effective depths.
  Secondly, while neural collapse emerges even when generalization should be
impossible - we argue that the \emph{degree of separability} in the
intermediate layers is related to generalization. We derive a generalization
bound based on comparing the effective depth of the network with the minimal
depth required to fit the same dataset with partially corrupted labels.
Remarkably, this bound provides non-trivial estimations of the test
performance. Finally, we empirically show that the effective depth of a trained
neural network monotonically increases when increasing the number of random

structures has recently attracted lots of attention. In machine learning, deep
generative modeling approaches implicitly estimate distributions of complex
objects by creating new samples from the underlying distribution, and have
achieved great success in generating synthetic realistic-looking images and
texts. A key step in these approaches is the extraction of latent features or
representations (encoding) that can be used for accurately reconstructing the
original data (decoding). In other words, low-dimensional manifold structure is
implicitly assumed and utilized in the distribution modeling and estimation. To
understand the benefit of low-dimensional manifold structure in generative
modeling, we build a general minimax framework for distribution estimation on
unknown submanifold under adversarial losses, with suitable smoothness
assumptions on the target distribution and the manifold. The established
minimax rate elucidates how various problem characteristics, including
intrinsic dimensionality of the data and smoothness levels of the target
distribution and the manifold, affect the fundamental limit of high-dimensional
distribution estimation. To prove the minimax upper bound, we construct an
estimator based on a mixture of locally fitted generative models, which is
motivated by the partition of unity technique from differential geometry and is
necessary to cover cases where the underlying data manifold does not admit a
global parametrization. We also propose a data-driven adaptive estimator that
is shown to simultaneously attain within a logarithmic factor of the optimal
rate over a large collection of distribution classes.

certain conditions, an analytic subvariety of some algebriac variety over a
global field $K$, if it contains many $K$-points, then it is algebraic over
$K.$ This gives a way to show the transcendence of points via the transcendence
of analytic subvarieties. Such a situation often appears when we have a
dynamical system, because we can often produce infinitely many points from one
point via iterates.
  Combing this criteria and the study of invariant subvarieties, we get some
results on the transcendence in arithmetic dynamics. We get a characterization
of products of B\""ottcher coordinates or products of multiplicative canonical
heights for polynomial dynamical pairs to be algebraic. For this, we studied
the invariant subvarieties for product of endomorphisms. In particular, we
partially generate Medvedev-Scanlon's classification of invariant subvarieties
of split polynomial maps to separable endomorphisms on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N$ in
any characteristic. We also get some hight dimensional partial generalization
via introducing of a notion of independence. We then study dominant
endomorphisms $f$ on $\mathbb{A}^N$ over a number field of algebraic degree
$d\geq 2$. We show that in most of the cases (e.g. when such an endomorphism
extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$), there are many analytic curves
centered at infinity which are periodic. We show that for most of them, it is
algebraic if and only if it contains one algebraic point. We also study the
periodic curves. We show that for most of $f$, all periodic curves has degree
at most $2$. When $N=2$, we get a more precise classification result. We show
that under a condition which is satisfied for a general $f$, if $f$ has

checkpoints that any researcher should keep in mind while evaluating the
soundness of technique and declaring it to be decent defence technique. In this
paper, we have suggested few checkpoints that should be taken into
consideration while building and evaluating the soundness of defence models.
All these points are recommended after observing why some past defence models
failed and how some model remained adamant and proved their soundness against
some of the very strong attacks.

or more per wavelength in the near future. To achieve such high data rates,
coherent modulation and detection is used, which conventionally requires
high-speed data conversion and signal processing in the digital domain.
Alternatively, high-speed signal conditioning and processing could be carried
out in co-designed photonic and electronic integrated circuits, in the optical
and electrical analog domains, respectively, to achieve reduced power
consumption, latency, form factor, and cost. A few demonstrations of analog
domain processing electronic integrated circuits (EICs), including those of
equalizer and carrier phase recovery (CPR) modules showcase progress in this
direction in the literature. In this brief, for the first time, we present
integration of a silicon photonic integrated coherent receiver (ICR) module
with a CPR module, as a part of a complete coherent receiver solution. A phase
shifter in the ICR (fabricated in a 220 nm silicon-on-insulator technology)
receives feedback from a CPR EIC, and the combination compensates for the time
varying phase offset between the modulated signal and the unmodulated carrier
in the closed loop configuration. In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we
present experimental results obtained from the stand-alone silicon photonic ICR
along with its system level integration with CPR chip, for QPSK signals. The
technique can be extended to a higher-order modulation format, such as 16-QAM,
for data rate scaling. The proposed scheme is suitable for homodyne systems,
such as polarization multiplexed carrier based self-homodyne links.

giant planets make TNO orbits precess, but non-resonant objects maintain a
nearly constant 'free' inclination ($I_\text{free}$) with respect to a local
forced precession pole. Because of the likely cosmogonic importance of the
distribution of this quantity, we tabulate free inclinations for all main-belt

respect to each object's local forcing pole. We show that the simplest method,
based on the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, is unable to give correct forcing
poles for objects near the $\nu_{18}$ secular resonance, resulting in poorly
conserved $I_\text{free}$ values in much of the main belt. We thus instead
implemented an averaged Hamiltonian to obtain the expected nodal precession for
each TNO, yielding significantly more accurate free inclinations for

However, the pre-training objective of PLM-based methods is unable to model the
consistency between story context and ending. The goal of this paper is to
adopt contrastive learning to generate endings more consistent with story
context, while there are two main challenges in contrastive learning of SEG.
First is the negative sampling of wrong endings inconsistent with story
contexts. The second challenge is the adaptation of contrastive learning for
SEG. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning
framework for Story Ending Generation (CLSEG), which has two steps:
multi-aspect sampling and story-specific contrastive learning. Particularly,
for the first issue, we utilize novel multi-aspect sampling mechanisms to
obtain wrong endings considering the consistency of order, causality, and
sentiment. To solve the second issue, we well-design a story-specific
contrastive training strategy that is adapted for SEG. Experiments show that
CLSEG outperforms baselines and can produce story endings with stronger

large volume of recent theoretical, as well as empirical work, suggests that,

learning. Motivated by an analogy between statistical and causal learning
recently highlighted by Janzing (2019), we investigate whether interpolating
estimators can also learn good causal models. To this end, we consider a simple
linearly confounded model and derive precise asymptotics for the *causal risk*
of the min-norm interpolator and ridge-regularized regressors in the
high-dimensional regime. Under the principle of independent causal mechanisms,
a standard assumption in causal learning, we find that interpolators cannot be
optimal and causal learning requires stronger regularization than statistical
learning. This resolves a recent conjecture in Janzing (2019). Beyond this
assumption, we find a larger range of behavior that can be precisely
characterized with a new measure of *confounding strength*. If the confounding
strength is negative, causal learning requires weaker regularization than
statistical learning, interpolators can be optimal, and the optimal
regularization can even be negative. If the confounding strength is large, the
optimal regularization is infinite, and learning from observational data is

uni-modal fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing

downstream uni-modal tasks and avoid training a new model from scratch. So can
such pre-trained models be applied to multi-modal tasks? Researchers have
explored this problem and made significant progress. This paper surveys recent
advances and new frontiers in vision-language pre-training (VLP), including
image-text and video-text pre-training. To give readers a better overall grasp
of VLP, we first review its recent advances from five aspects: feature
extraction, model architecture, pre-training objectives, pre-training datasets,
and downstream tasks. Then, we summarize the specific VLP models in detail.
Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in VLP. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first survey focused on VLP. We hope that this survey can shed
light on future research in the VLP field.

rising direction, but it remains elusive what mechanism governs such rotation
and how the rotation is related to the initial morphology of the pre-eruptive
filament (and co-spatial sigmoid), filament chirality, and magnetic helicity.
The conventional view regarding the rotation as a result of a magnetic flux
rope (MFR) under-going the ideal kink instability still has confusion in
explaining these relationships. Here we proposed an alternative explanation for
the rotation during eruptions, by analyzing a magnetohydrodynamic simulation in
which magnetic reconnection initiates an eruption from a sheared arcade
configuration and an MFR is formed during eruption through the reconnection.
The simulation reproduces a reverse S-shaped MFR with dextral chirality, and
the axis of this MFR rotates counterclockwise while rising, which compares
favorably with a typical filament eruption observed from dual viewing angles.
By calculating the twist and writhe numbers of the modeled MFR during its
eruption, we found that accompanied with the rotation, the nonlocal writhe of
the MFR's axis decreases while the twist of its surrounding field lines
increases, and this is distinct from the kink instability, which converts
magnetic twist into writhe of the MFR axis.

preferable, except the $y$-redshift and $E(y)$ methods. For the $y$-redshift

main novelty of our method to balance the convergence lies in proposing an
appropriately modified Poisson equation so as to possess the space-independent

fulfill the weak law of large numbers, namely, the time-averaging estimator
converges to the ergodic limit in probability.

Video-to-Speech (VTS) synthesis, little attention is devoted to multi-speaker
VTS that can map silent video to speech, while allowing flexible control of
speaker identity, all in a single system. This paper proposes a novel
multi-speaker VTS system based on cross-modal knowledge transfer from voice
conversion (VC), where vector quantization with contrastive predictive coding
(VQCPC) is used for the content encoder of VC to derive discrete phoneme-like
acoustic units, which are transferred to a Lip-to-Index (Lip2Ind) network to
infer the index sequence of acoustic units. The Lip2Ind network can then
substitute the content encoder of VC to form a multi-speaker VTS system to
convert silent video to acoustic units for reconstructing accurate spoken
content. The VTS system also inherits the advantages of VC by using a speaker
encoder to produce speaker representations to effectively control the speaker
identity of generated speech. Extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness of
proposed approach, which can be applied in both constrained vocabulary and open
vocabulary conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generating
high-quality speech with high naturalness, intelligibility and speaker
similarity. Our demo page is released here:

dysarthric speech, remains a challenge, not only because we need to restore the
speech to be normal, but also must preserve the speaker's identity. The speaker
representation extracted by the speaker encoder (SE) optimized for speaker
verification has been explored to control the speaker identity. However, the SE
may not be able to fully capture the characteristics of dysarthric speakers
that are previously unseen. To address this research problem, we propose a
novel multi-task learning strategy, i.e., adversarial speaker adaptation (ASA).
The primary task of ASA fine-tunes the SE with the speech of the target
dysarthric speaker to effectively capture identity-related information, and the
secondary task applies adversarial training to avoid the incorporation of
abnormal speaking patterns into the reconstructed speech, by regularizing the
distribution of reconstructed speech to be close to that of reference speech
with high quality. Experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve
enhanced speaker similarity and comparable speech naturalness with a strong
baseline approach. Compared with dysarthric speech, the reconstructed speech
achieves 22.3% and 31.5% absolute word error rate reduction for speakers with
moderate and moderate-severe dysarthria respectively. Our demo page is released

spectral properties of one such soft X-ray transient: MAXI J0637$-$430, with
data from the \textit{SXT} and \textit{LAXPC} instruments on-board
\textit{AstroSat} mission. The source was observed for a total of $\sim$ 60 ks
over two observations on 8$^{th}$ and 21$^{st}$ November, 2019 soon after its
discovery. Flux resolved spectral analysis of the source indicates the presence
of a multi-colour blackbody component arising from the accretion disk and a
thermal Comptonization component. The stable low temperature ($\sim$ 0.55
$keV$) of the blackbody component, points to a cool accretion disk with an
inner disk radius of the order of a few hundred $km$. In addition, we report
the presence of a relativistically broadened Gaussian line at 6.4 $keV$. The
disk dominated flux and photon power law index of $\gtrapprox 2$ and a constant
inner disk radius indicate the source to be in the soft state. From the study
we conclude that MAXI J0637$-$430 is a strong black hole X-ray binary

heat $\Delta C_{p}$. Despite its significance, no standard theory exists to
describe it. In this study, first-principles molecular-dynamics (MD)
simulations are used to describe the glass transition of silica glass, which
presents many challenges. The novel view that state variables are extended to
include the equilibrium positions of atoms $\{ \bar{\bf R}_{j} \}$ is fully
used in analyzing the simulation results. Decomposing the internal energy into
three components (structural, phonon, and thermal expansion energies) reveals
that the jump $\Delta C_{p}$ of silica glass is entirely determined by the
component of structural energy. The reason for the small $\Delta C_{p}$ is its
high glass-transition temperature, which makes the fluctuation in the
structural energy insensitive to temperature changes. This significantly
affects how the Prigogine-Defay ratio $\it{\Pi}$ is interpreted, which was
previously unknown. The ratio $\it{\Pi}$ represents the ratio of the total
energy change to the contribution of thermal expansion energy at the glass
transition. The general property, $\it{\Pi}>1$, of glasses indicates that glass
transitions occur mainly by changes in the structural energy. Silica glass is
an extreme case in that the transition occurs entirely by the change in
internal structure, such as the distribution of the bending angle of Si--O--Si
bond.

  illustration and simulation using logistic regression","Main paper 21 pages, Supplement 53 pages",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Methods to correct class imbalance, i.e. imbalance between the frequency of
outcome events and non-events, are receiving increasing interest for developing
prediction models. We examined the effect of imbalance correction on the
performance of standard and penalized (ridge) logistic regression models in
terms of discrimination, calibration, and classification. We examined random
undersampling, random oversampling and SMOTE using Monte Carlo simulations and
a case study on ovarian cancer diagnosis. The results indicated that all
imbalance correction methods led to poor calibration (strong overestimation of
the probability to belong to the minority class), but not to better
discrimination in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve. Imbalance correction improved classification in terms of sensitivity and
specificity, but similar results were obtained by shifting the probability
threshold instead. Our study shows that outcome imbalance is not a problem in
itself, and that imbalance correction may even worsen model performance.

  Analysis in Tennis Matches",,,,,"cs.SD cs.MM eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Professional athletes increasingly use automated analysis of meta- and signal
data to improve their training and game performance. As in other related
human-to-human research fields, signal data, in particular, contain important
performance- and mood-specific indicators for automated analysis. In this
paper, we introduce the novel data set SCORE! to investigate the performance of
several features and machine learning paradigms in the prediction of the sex
and immediate stroke success in tennis matches, based only on vocal expression
through players' grunts. The data was gathered from YouTube, labelled under the
exact same definition, and the audio processed for modelling. We extract
several widely used basic, expert-knowledge, and deep acoustic features of the
audio samples and evaluate their effectiveness in combination with various
machine learning approaches. In a binary setting, the best system, using
spectrograms and a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, achieves an
unweighted average recall (UAR) of 84.0 % for the player sex prediction task,
and 60.3 % predicting stroke success, based only on acoustic cues in players'
grunts of both sexes. Further, we achieve a UAR of 58.3 %, and 61.3 %, when the
models are exclusively trained on female or male grunts, respectively.

extensions of the Higgs sector; but it has two potential fine-tuning problems,
related to the electroweak (EW) breaking and the requirement of alignment with
the SM Higgs boson. We have quantified the fine-tunings obtaining analytical
expressions, both in terms of the initial 2HDM parameters and the physical ones
(masses, mixing angles, etc.). We also provide simple approximate expressions.
We have taken into account that the fine-tunings are not independent and
removed the ""double counting"" by projecting the variations of the alignment
onto the constant-${\rm v}^2$ hypersurface. The EW and the alignment
fine-tunings become severe in different, even opposite, regions of the
parameter space, namely in the regimes of large and small extra-Higgs masses,
respectively; emerging an intermediate region, $500\ {\rm GeV} \leq \{m_H, m_A,
m_{H^\pm}\} \leq 700\ {\rm GeV}$, where both are acceptably small. We also
discuss a remarkable trend that is not obvious at first glance. Namely, for
large $\tan\beta$ both the EW and the alignment fine-tunings become mitigated.
In consequence, the 2HDM becomes quite natural for $\tan\beta\geq {\cal O}
(10)$, even if $m_H, m_A, m_{H^\pm}$ are as large as 1500 GeV. We explain why
this is not the case for the 2HDM stemming from supersymmetry. We have
illustrated all these trends by numerically analyzing several representative
scenarios.

among the defining forms of the hyperplanes are generated by ones corresponding
to intersections of codimension two. The significance of this notion stems from
the fact that complex arrangements with aspherical complements are formal. The
aim of this note is twofold. While work of Yuzvinsky shows that formality is
not combinatorial, in our first main theorem we prove that the combinatorial
property of niceness of arrangements does entail formality. Our second main
theorem shows that formality is hereditary, i.e. is passed to restrictions.
This is rather counter-intuitive, as in contrast the known sufficient
conditions for formality, i.e. asphericity, freeness and niceness (owed to our
first theorem), are not hereditary themselves. We also demonstrate that the
stronger property of $k$-formality, due to Brandt and Terao, is not hereditary.

optimize. An event-triggered distributed model predictive control method is
proposed to solve the optimal scheduling of waiting times at hubs for
individual trucks. In this distributed framework, trucks are allowed to decide
their waiting times independently and only limited information is shared
between trucks. Both the predicted reward gained from platooning and the
predicted cost for waiting at hubs are included in each truck's utility
function. The performance of the coordination method is demonstrated in a
simulation with one hundred trucks over the Swedish road network.

  Pronunciation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this work, we investigate pronunciation differences in English spoken by
Singaporean children in relation to their American and British counterparts by
conducting Kmeans clustering and Archetypal analysis on selected vowel pairs
and approximants. Given that Singapore adopts British English as the
institutional standard due to historical reasons, one might expect Singaporean
children to follow British pronunciation patterns. Indeed, Singaporean and
British children are more similar in their production of syllable-final /r/ --
they do not lower their third formant nearly as much as American children do,
suggesting a lack of rhoticity. Interestingly, Singaporean children also
present similar patterns to American children when it comes to their fronting
of vowels as demonstrated across various vowels including TRAP-BATH split
vowels. Singaporean children's English also demonstrated characteristics that
do not resemble any of the other two populations. We observe that Singaporean
children's vowel height characteristics are distinct from both that of American
and British children. In tense and lax vowel pairs, we also consistently
observe that the distinction is less conspicuous for Singaporean children
compared to the other speaker groups. Further, while American and British
children demonstrate lowering of F1 and F2 formants in transitions into
syllable-final /l/s, a wide gap between F2 and F3 formants, and small
difference between F1 and F2 formants, all of these are not exhibited in
Singaporean children's pronunciation. These findings point towards potential
sociolinguistic implications of how Singapore English might be evolving to
embody more than British pronunciation characteristics. Furthermore, these
findings also suggest that Singapore English could be have been influenced by
languages beyond American and British English, potentially due to Singapore's
multilingual environment.

we describe an algorithm to draw an unbraided wiring diagram whose associated

Starkston, where the lens space with its canonical contact structure is viewed
as the contact link of a cyclic quotient singularity, is equivalent to the
Lefschetz fibration we constructed on each Stein filling of the lens space at

following result as a corollary: The wiring diagram we describe can be extended
to an arrangement of symplectic graphical disks in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with marked
points, including all the intersection points of these disks, so that by
removing the proper transforms of these disks from the blowup of $\mathbb{C}^2$
along those marked points one recovers the Stein filling along with the
Lefschetz fibration. Moreover, the arrangement is related to the decorated
plane curve germ representing the cyclic quotient singularity by a smooth
graphical homotopy.

fillings of any lens space with its canonical contact structure, and the Milnor
fibers of the corresponding cyclic quotient singularity, which was first

problem is modeled as a stopping rule problem wherein the objective is to
maximize the average platooning benefit of the vehicles located at the hub and

ensure this, and a constructive lifting procedure is presented. The resulting

and Jahn-Teller-active NiO$_6$ edge-sharing octahedra. At ambient pressure it
undergoes a broad phase transition from a monoclinic to rhombohedral structure
between $\sim$465 K and $\sim$495 K, associated with the loss of long-range
orbital ordering. In this work, we present the results of a neutron powder
diffraction study on powdered NaNiO$_2$ as a function of pressure and
temperature from ambient pressure to $\sim$5 GPa between 290 K and 490 K. The
290 K and 460 K isothermal compressions remained in the monoclinic phase up to
the maximum pressures studied, whereas the 490 K isotherm was mixed-phase
throughout. The unit-cell volume was fitted to a 2nd-order Birch-Murnaghan
equation of state, with $B=113(1)$ GPa. We observe at 490 K that the fraction
of Jahn-Teller-distorted phase increases with increasing pressure, from
67.8(6)% at 0.71(2) GPa to 80.2(9)% at 4.20(6) GPa. Using this observation, in
conjunction with neutron diffraction measurements at 490 K from 5.46(9) GPa to
0.342(13) GPa, we show that the Jahn-Teller transition temperature increases
with pressure. Our results are used to present a structural
pressure-temperature phase diagram for NaNiO$_2$. To our knowledge, this is the
first diffraction study of the effect of pressure on the Jahn-Teller transition
temperature in materials with edge-sharing Jahn-Teller-distorted octahedra, and
the first variable-pressure study on a JT-active edge-sharing nickelate.

formulate a problem to find the optimal precoders and the number of active RF

consumption of low-resolution Digital-to-Analog Converters on each RF chain
under communications and radar performance constraints. We consider
Rate-Splitting Multiple Access to perform multi-user communications with

non-convex optimization problem is solved by means of a novel algorithm. We
demonstrate by numerical results that Rate Splitting Multiple Access achieves
an improved energy-efficiency by employing a smaller number of RF chains

is ubiquitous in nature and technology and recently gained significant
attention across scientific disciplines, due to the discovery of biomolecular
condensates. It is well understood that sessile droplets, undergoing phase
separation in a static wetting configuration, exhibit microdroplet nucleation
at their contact lines, forming an oil ring during later stages. However, very
little is known about the dynamic counterpart, when phase separation occurs in
a non-equilibrium wetting configuration, i.e., spreading droplets. Here we
report that liquid-liquid phase separation strongly couples to the spreading
motion of three-phase contact lines. Thus, the classical Cox-Voinov law is not
applicable anymore, because phase separation adds an active spreading force
beyond the capillary driving. Intriguingly, we observe that spreading starts
well before any visible nucleation of microdroplets in the main droplet. Using
high-speed ellipsometry, we further demonstrate that surface forces cause an
even earlier nucleation in the wetting precursor film around the droplet,
initiating the observed wetting transition. We expect our findings to enrich
the fundamental understanding of phase separation processes that involve
dynamical contact lines and/or surface forces, with implications in a wide
range of applications, from oil recovery or inkjet printing to material
synthesis and biomolecular condensates.

network architecture to learn the nonlinear graph representations for the
specific learning tasks. The core operation in GNNs is message propagation in
which each node updates its representation by aggregating its neighbors'
representations. Existing GNNs mainly adopt either linear neighborhood
aggregation (mean,sum) or max aggregator in their message propagation. (1) For
linear aggregators, the whole nonlinearity and network's capacity of GNNs are
generally limited due to deeper GNNs usually suffer from over-smoothing issue.
(2) For max aggregator, it usually fails to be aware of the detailed
information of node representations within neighborhood. To overcome these
issues, we re-think the message propagation mechanism in GNNs and aim to
develop the general nonlinear aggregators for neighborhood information
aggregation in GNNs. One main aspect of our proposed nonlinear aggregators is
that they provide the optimally balanced aggregators between max and mean/sum
aggregations. Thus, our aggregators can inherit both (i) high nonlinearity that
increases network's capacity and (ii) detail-sensitivity that preserves the

commonly-used CNN-based methods either process multiple image resolutions after
training or use a single resolution and limit multi-scale feature extraction to
the last convolutional layer during training. In this paper, we augment NetVLAD
representation learning with low-resolution image pyramid encoding which leads
to richer place representations. The resultant multi-resolution feature pyramid
can be conveniently aggregated through VLAD into a single compact
representation, avoiding the need for concatenation or summation of multiple
patches in recent multi-scale approaches. Furthermore, we show that the
underlying learnt feature tensor can be combined with existing multi-scale
approaches to improve their baseline performance. Evaluation on 15
viewpoint-varying and viewpoint-consistent benchmarking datasets confirm that
the proposed MultiRes-NetVLAD leads to state-of-the-art Recall@N performance
for global descriptor based retrieval, compared against 11 existing techniques.

  signatures of mixed flow fan analyzed using novel CFD-informed methods","43 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leading-edge (LE) noise is a common source of broadband noise for fans that
can be suppressed using appended LE serrations. We conduct an integrated study
of the morphological effects of interval, length, and inclination angle of
owl-inspired LE serrations on the aeroacoustic characteristics of a mixed flow
fan using experiments, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the Ffowcs
Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. A novel method for surface noise strength
(SNS) visualization was developed based on the FWH analogy with large-eddy
simulations, and a CFD-informed index SAPG is proposed to evaluate the severity
of flow separation with pressure gradient, which are verified to be effective
in examining the acoustic sources and chordwise separation. Acoustic
measurements show the robust tradeoff solving capability of the serrations
under various morphologies and the SNS visualizations indicate that the
separation-induced LE noise is suppressed considerably. One-third octave
analyses suggest that extending serration length can lower separation noise
more effectively than shrinking the interval over 100-3k Hz. A smaller interval
is more desirable while an optimal length exists in association with tonal
noise. Moreover, small inclination angles (below 20 degrees) enable the
deceleration of oncoming flows with stagnation relieved, and consequently,
further suppress the LE noise, by a flow-buffering effect. Heavy inclination
angles (over 40 degrees) induce an additional tip vortex, causing
high-coherence turbulence impingement noise and resulting in a drastic increase
in broadband noise at frequencies exceeding 4k Hz. Our study thus clarifies the
morphological effects of LE serrations on aeroacoustic signatures of rotary
devices while providing useful methods for acoustic analyses.

the mechanical degradation of the magnetocaloric material during processing and
operation, leading to limited service-life. The mechanical properties of
hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)13-based magnetocaloric material are studied using
macroscale bending tests of polycrystalline specimens and in situ micropillar
compression tests of single crystal specimens. The impact of hydrogenation on
the mechanical properties are quantified. Understanding of the
deformation/failure mechanisms is aided by characterization with transmission
electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to reveal the arrangement of
hydrogen atoms in the crystal lattice. Results indicate that the intrinsic
strength of this material is ~3-6 GPa and is dependent on the crystal
orientation. Single crystals under compressive load exhibit shearing along
specific crystallographic planes. Hydrogen deteriorates the strength of
La(Fe,Mn,Si)13 through promotion of transgranular fracture. The weakening
effect of hydrogen on single crystals is anisotropic; it is significant upon
shearing parallel to the {111} crystallographic planes but is negligible when
the shear plane is {001}-oriented. APT analysis suggests that this is
associated with the close arrangement of hydrogen atoms on {222} planes.

minimized subject to the Allen-Cahn equation using distributed controls that

sufficient conditions are proved. The lowest order discontinuous Galerkin - in

adjoint state mappings. Under a suitable restriction on maximum size of the
temporal and spatial discretization parameters $k$, $h$ respectively in terms
of the parameter $\epsilon$ that describes the thickness of the interface
layer, a-priori estimates are proved with constants depending polynomially upon
$1/ \epsilon$. Unlike to previous works for the uncontrolled Allen-Cahn problem
our approach does not rely on a construction of an approximation of the

regularity assumptions imposed by the optimal control setting. These estimates
are also valid in cases where the solution and its discrete approximation do
not satisfy uniform space-time bounds independent of $\epsilon$. These

method that can be used to deploy AI-dependent IoT applications while
protecting client data privacy and security. Due to the differences of clients,
a single global model may not perform well on all clients, so the personalized
federated learning method, which trains a personalized model for each client
that better suits its individual needs, becomes a research hotspot. Most
personalized federated learning research, however, focuses on data
heterogeneity while ignoring the need for model architecture heterogeneity.
Most existing federated learning methods uniformly set the model architecture
of all clients participating in federated learning, which is inconvenient for
each client's individual model and local data distribution requirements, and
also increases the risk of client model leakage. This paper proposes a
federated learning method based on co-training and generative adversarial
networks(GANs) that allows each client to design its own model to participate
in federated learning training independently without sharing any model
architecture or parameter information with other clients or a center. In our
experiments, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in mean test
accuracy by 42% when the client's model architecture and data distribution vary
significantly.

quenching (up to 50%) after the arrival of the terahertz pulse followed by a
reversible recovery of the emission on the time scale of 50ps at T =10K.
Microscopic calculations reveal that the origin of the photoluminescence
quenching is the terahertz absorption by photo-excited carriers: this leads to
a heating of the carriers and a broadening of their distribution, which reduces
the probability of bimolecular electron-hole recombination and, therefore, the
luminescence. By numerically evaluating the Boltzmann equation, we are able to
clarify the individual roles of optical and acoustic phonons in the subsequent
cooling process. The same PL quenchingmechanismis expected in other van

groups with respect to possible confounders, which makes the analysis
straightforward. However, when analysing observational data, the potential for
unmeasured confounding makes comparing treatment effects much more challenging.
Causal inference methods such as Instrumental Variable and Prior Even Rate
Ratio approaches make it possible to circumvent the need to adjust for
confounding factors that have not been measured in the data or measured with
error. Direct confounder adjustment via multivariable regression and Propensity
score matching also have considerable utility. Each method relies on a
different set of assumptions and leverages different aspects of the data. In
this paper, we describe the assumptions of each method and assess the impact of
violating these assumptions in a simulation study. We propose the prior outcome
augmented Instrumental Variable method that leverages data from before and

of the rigidity or flexibility of bar-joint frameworks in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that
admit some non-trivial symmetry. When $d=2$ there is a large literature on this
topic. In particular, it is typical to quotient the symmetric graph by the
group and analyse the rigidity of symmetric, but otherwise generic frameworks,
using the combinatorial structure of the appropriate group-labelled quotient
graph. However, mirroring the situation for generic rigidity, little is known
combinatorially when $d\geq 3$. Nevertheless in the periodic case, a key result
of Borcea and Streinu characterises when a quotient graph can be lifted to a
rigid periodic framework in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We develop an analogous theory for
symmetric frameworks in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The results obtained apply to all
finite and infinite 2-dimensional point groups, and then in arbitrary dimension
they concern a wide range of infinite point groups, sufficiently large finite
groups and groups containing translations and rotations. For the case of finite
groups we also derive results concerning the probability of assigning group
labels to a quotient graph so that the resulting lift is symmetrically rigid in
$\mathbb{R}^d$.

applied in social science research, one important issue is often not addressed:
the extent to which these embeddings are valid representations of constructs
relevant for social science research. We therefore propose the use of the
classic construct validity framework to evaluate the validity of text
embeddings. We show how this framework can be adapted to the opaque and
high-dimensional nature of text embeddings, with application to survey
questions. We include several popular text embedding methods (e.g. fastText,
GloVe, BERT, Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder) in our construct
validity analyses. We find evidence of convergent and discriminant validity in
some cases. We also show that embeddings can be used to predict respondent's
answers to completely new survey questions. Furthermore, BERT-based embedding
techniques and the Universal Sentence Encoder provide more valid
representations of survey questions than do others. Our results thus highlight
the necessity to examine the construct validity of text embeddings before
deploying them in social science research.

effect of bias in a set of sampling locations on inference when a
geostatistical model is used to explain observed responses at the sampled
locations. In particular, it enables modification of spatial prediction
adjusted for the bias. Its original presentation in the literature addressed
assessment of the presence of such sampling bias while follow on work focused
on regression specification to improve spatial interpolation under such bias.
All of the work in the literature to date considers the case of a univariate
response variable at each location, either continuous or modeled through a
latent continuous variable. The contribution here is to extend the notion of
preferential sampling to the case of bivariate response at each location. This
exposes sampling scenarios where both responses are observed at a given
location as well as scenarios where, for some locations, only one of the
responses is recorded. That is, there may be different sampling bias for one
response than for the other. It leads to assessing the impact of such bias on
co-kriging. It also exposes the possibility that preferential sampling can bias
inference regarding dependence between responses at a location. We develop the
idea of bivariate preferential sampling through various model specifications
and illustrate the effect of these specifications on prediction and dependence
behavior. We do this both through simulation examples as well as with a
forestry dataset that provides mean diameter at breast height (MDBH) and trees
per hectare (TPH) as the point-referenced bivariate responses.

well-known class of weaving knots but also contains an infinite family of

propose a Graph-based spectral clustering method that takes advantage of a
velocity-augmented kernel to connect data points belonging to the same

eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Graph Laplacian and show that they form a
set of orthogonal embedding spaces, one for each sub-dynamics. We prove that
there always exist a set of 2-dimensional embedding spaces in which the

  While the growth rates are rational, like in the case of previously known

correction to the exponential growth does not appear to follow from the now

the underlying tandem walk. However a heuristic argument suggests that these
exponents are $-1-\pi/\arccos(9/16)\approx -4.23$ for $p_n$ and
$-1-\pi/\arccos(22/27)\approx -6.08$ for $s_n$, which would imply that the

on algebraic varieties via derived algebraic geometry. We focus here on the
specific case of globally defined vector fields and the global behaviour of
their algebraic integral curves. For a smooth and proper variety $X$ with a
global vector field $\nu$, we consider the induced vector field $\nu_{g,n}$ on
the derived stack of stable maps, of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, to $X$.
When $(g,n)$ is either $(0,2)$ or $(1,0)$, the derived stack of zeros of
$\nu_{g,n}$ defines a proper \emph{moduli of algebraic trajectories} of $\nu$.
When $(g,n)=(0,2)$ algebraic trajectories behave very much like rational
algebraic paths from one zero of $\nu$ to another, and in particular they can
be composed. This composition is represented by the usual gluing maps in
Gromov-Witten theory, and we use it give three categorical constructions, of
different categorical levels, related, in a certain sense, by
decategorification. In order to do this, in particular, we have to deal with
virtual fundamental classes of non-quasi-smooth derived stacks. When
$(g,n)=(1,0)$, zeros of $\nu_{1,0}$ might be thought as algebraic analogues of
periodic orbits of vector fields on smooth real manifolds. In particular, we
propose a Zeta function counting the zeros of $\nu_{1,0}$, that we like to
think of as an algebraic version of Ruelle's dynamical Zeta function. We
conclude the paper with a brief indication on how to extend these results to
the case of general one dimensional foliation $F$, by considering the derived

disjoint horoballs, each tangent to the boundary at a parabolic fixed point.
The diameter of such a horoball can be thought of as the `inverse cost' of
approximating an arbitrary point in the limit set by the associated parabolic
point. A result of Stratmann and Velani allows one to count horoballs of a
given size and, roughly speaking, for small $r>0$ there are $r^{-\delta}$ many
horoballs of size approximately $r$, where $\delta$ is the Poincar\'e exponent
of the group. We investigate localisations of this result, where we seek to
count horoballs of size approximately $r$ inside a given ball $B(z,R)$. Roughly
speaking, if $r \lesssim R^2$, then we obtain an analogue of the
Stratmann-Velani result (normalised by the Patterson-Sullivan measure of
$B(z,R)$). However, for larger values of $r$, the count depends in a subtle way
on $z$. Our counting results have several applications, especially to the
geometry of conformal measures supported on the limit set. For example, we
compute or estimate several `fractal dimensions' of certain $s$-conformal

$s$-conformal measures at $s=\delta$.

a step focusing on spatial information, or vice versa. In this paper, we
present a method for incorporating spatial neighborhood information into
distance-based dimensionality reduction methods, such as t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We achieve this by modifying the
distance measure between high-dimensional attribute vectors associated with
each pixel such that it takes the pixel's spatial neighborhood into account.
Based on a classification of different methods for comparing image patches, we
explore a number of different approaches. We compare these approaches from a

the proposed methods by qualitative and quantitative evaluation on synthetic

however, do not converge and remain nearly unchanged regardless of whether a
cold or a hot initial state is used. Furthermore, we show that different flow
structures in the deep atmospheric layers arise. There, we find that WASP-43b
exhibits a deep equatorial jet, driven by the relatively fast tidally locked
rotation of this planet (0.81 days), as compared to HD 209458b (3.47 days).
However, by comparing simulations with different rotation periods, we find that
the resulting flow structures only marginally influence the temperature
evolution in the deep atmosphere, which is almost completely dominated by
radiative heating and cooling. Furthermore, we find that the evolution of
deeper layers can influence the 3D temperature structure in the photosphere of
WASP-43b. Thus, dayside emission spectra of WASP-43b may shed more light onto
the dynamical processes occurring at greater depths.

over a communication network. Emerging applications, such as telerobotics,
drones and autonomous driving are the most prominent examples of such systems.
Regular and timely information sharing between the components of NCSs is
essential to fulfill the desired control tasks, as stale information can lead
to performance degradation or even physical damage. In this work, we consider
multiple heterogeneous NCSs that transmit their system state over a shared
physical wireless channel towards a gateway node. We conduct a comprehensive
experimental study on selected MAC protocols using software-defined radios with
state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions that have been designed to increase
information freshness and control performance. As a significant improvement
over the SotA, we propose a novel contention-free algorithm that is able to
outperform the existing solutions by combining their strengths in one protocol.
In addition, we propose a new metric called normalized mean squared error that
maps the age of information to a dimensionless quantity that captures the
expected value of a control system's next transmission. We demonstrate its
adoption and effectiveness for wireless resource scheduling in a case study
involving multiple inverted pendulums. From our experimental study and results,
we observe that value-aware prioritization of the sub-systems contributes to
minimizing the negative effects of information staleness on control
performance. In particular, as the number of devices increases, the benefit of
control-awareness to the quality of control stands out when compared to
protocols that focus solely on maximizing information freshness.

circuit optimisation and synthesis, rely on being able to efficiently translate
a ZX-diagram back into a quantum circuit of comparable size. While several
sufficient conditions are known for describing families of ZX-diagrams that can
be efficiently transformed back into circuits, it has previously been
conjectured that the general problem of circuit extraction is hard. That is,
that it should not be possible to efficiently convert an arbitrary ZX-diagram

important problem in music signal processing. Frame-wise transcription or
multi-pitch estimation aims for detecting the simultaneous activity of pitches
in polyphonic music recordings and has recently seen major improvements thanks
to deep-learning techniques, with a variety of proposed network architectures.
In this paper, we realize different architectures based on CNNs, the U-net
structure, and self-attention components. We propose several modifications to
these architectures including self-attention modules for skip connections,
recurrent layers to replace the self-attention, and a multi-task strategy with
simultaneous prediction of the degree of polyphony. We compare variants of
these architectures in different sizes for multi-pitch estimation, focusing on
Western classical music beyond the piano-solo scenario using the MusicNet and
Schubert Winterreise datasets. Our experiments indicate that most architectures
yield competitive results and that larger model variants seem to be beneficial.
However, we find that these results substantially depend on randomization
effects and the particular choice of the training-test split, which questions
the claim of superiority for particular architectures given only small
improvements. We therefore investigate the influence of dataset splits in the
presence of several movements of a work cycle (cross-version evaluation) and
propose a best-practice splitting strategy for MusicNet, which weakens the
influence of individual test tracks and suppresses overfitting to specific
works and recording conditions. A final evaluation on a mixed dataset suggests
that improvements on one specific dataset do not necessarily generalize to
other scenarios, thus emphasizing the need for further high-quality multi-pitch
datasets in order to reliably measure progress in music transcription tasks.

clever decompositions of chunks of magic states into sums of efficiently
simulable stabiliser states. We show here how, by considering certain
non-stabiliser entangled states which have more favourable decompositions, we
can speed up these simulations. This is made possible by using the ZX-calculus,
which allows us to easily find instances of these entangled states in the
simplified diagram representing the quantum circuit to be simulated. We
additionally find a new technique of partial stabiliser decompositions that
allow us to trade magic states for stabiliser terms. With this technique we
require only $2^{\alpha t}$ stabiliser terms, where $\alpha\approx 0.396$, to
simulate a circuit with T-count $t$. This matches the $\alpha$ found by Qassim
et al., but whereas they only get this scaling in the asymptotic limit, ours
applies for a circuit of any size. Our method builds upon a recently proposed
scheme for simulation combining stabiliser decompositions and optimisation
strategies implemented in the software QuiZX. With our techniques we manage to
reliably simulate 50-qubit 1400 T-count hidden shift circuits in a couple of
minutes on a consumer laptop.

value problem of Maxwell's equations in the exterior domain of the obstacle.
Based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator, which is defined by an
infinite series, an exact transparent boundary condition is introduced and the
scattering problem is reduced equivalently into a bounded domain. An a
posteriori error estimate based adaptive finite element DtN method is developed
to solve the discrete variational problem, where the DtN operator is truncated
into a sum of finitely many terms. The a posteriori error estimate takes into
account both the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of
the DtN operator. The latter is shown to decay exponentially with respect to
the truncation parameter. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

ill-posed. Recent work based on deep neural networks has shown promising

tackle this problem by combining lighting estimates from several image views

we introduce a transformer architecture that is trained in an end-2-end fashion

we propose a positional encoding that takes into account the camera calibration

natural systems, remains a challenge to investigate in both experiments and
simulations. This is particularly so for very low molecular Prandtl numbers as
in stellar convection and in Earth's outer core. The present study reports
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection in square boxes of side length $L$ and height $H$ with the aspect
ratio $\Gamma =L/H$ of 25, for Prandtl numbers that span almost 4 orders of

obtained by massively parallel computations on grids of up to $5.36\times

controlled laboratory measurements. We report the essential properties of the
flow and their trends with Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, in particular the
global transport of momentum and heat -- the latter decomposed into convective
and diffusive contributions -- across the convection layer, mean vertical
profiles of the temperature and temperature fluctuations, and the kinetic
energy and thermal dissipation rates. We also explore the degree to which the
turbulence in the bulk of the convection layer resembles classical homogeneous
and isotropic turbulence in terms of spectra, increment moments, and
dissipative anomaly, and find close similarities. Finally, we show that a
characteristic scale on the order of the mesoscale seems to saturate to a
wavelength of $\lambda\gtrsim 3H$ for $Pr\lesssim 0.005$. We briefly discuss
possible implications of these results for the development of subgrid scale

smoothing on temporal signals in such a way that: (i) temporally smoothed
signals at coarser temporal scales are guaranteed to constitute simplifications
of corresponding temporally smoothed signals at any finer temporal scale
(including the original signal) and (ii) the temporal smoothing process is both
time-causal and time-recursive, in the sense that it does not require access to
future information and can be performed with no other temporal memory buffer of
the past than the resulting smoothed temporal scale-space representations
themselves.
  For specific subsets of parameter settings for the classes of linear and
shift-invariant temporal smoothing operators that obey this property, it is
shown how temporal scale covariance can be additionally obtained, guaranteeing
that if the temporal input signal is rescaled by a uniform scaling factor, then
also the resulting temporal scale-space representations of the rescaled
temporal signal will constitute mere rescalings of the temporal scale-space
representations of the original input signal, complemented by a shift along the
temporal scale dimension. The resulting time-causal limit kernel that obeys
this property constitutes a canonical temporal kernel for processing temporal
signal in real-time scenarios when the regular Gaussian kernel cannot be used
because of its non-causal access to information from the future and we cannot
additionally require the temporal smoothing process to comprise a complementary
memory of the past beyond the information contained in the temporal smoothing
process itself, which in this way also serves as a multi-scale temporal memory
of the past.
  This theory is generally applicable for both: (i) modelling continuous
temporal phenomena over multiple temporal scales and (ii) digital processing of
measured temporal signals in real time.

called order-competitive ratio. It is defined as the worst case (over all

lack of knowledge of the arrival order. Despite the growing interest in the
role of the arrival order on the performance of online algorithms, this loss
has been overlooked thus far.

problem, for the two common objective functions of (i) maximizing the expected
value, and (ii) maximizing the probability of obtaining the largest value; and
with respect to two families of algorithms, namely (i) adaptive algorithms, and

combinations, with respect to deterministic algorithms. Our analysis requires
new ideas and departs from standard techniques. In particular, our adaptive
algorithms inevitably go beyond single-threshold algorithms. The results with
respect to the order-competitive ratio measure capture the intuition that
adaptive algorithms are stronger than single-threshold ones, and may lead to a
better algorithmic advice than the classical competitive ratio measure.

events expected at the LArTPC of DUNEND. Each deficit is due to two sources:
the active neutrinos, decay products of the heavy ones, that do not hit the
DUNEND and the disappearance oscillation of the active neutrinos, decay
products of the parent mesons. We get limits of $|U_{\mu4}|^2 < 6.5 \times

DUNE direct searches for the case of a 20%(0%) uncertainty. We can also impose
limits on $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ in a mass region free of constraints (40 eV - 1 MeV).
For masses below 1 MeV, we improve the current experimental constraints by up

successfully adjusting to a changing number of active users in the network. The

done by, first, computing a Gr\""obner basis for the degree reverse
lexicographic order, and next computing the lexicographic Gr\""obner basis with
a change of order algorithm. Currently, the change of order now takes a
significant part of the whole solving time for many generic instances.
  Like the fastest known change of order algorithms, this work focuses on the
situation where the ideal defined by the system satisfies natural properties
which can be recovered in generic coordinates. First, the ideal has a
\emph{shape} lexicographic Gr\""obner basis. Second, the set of leading terms
with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic order has a \emph{stability}
property; in particular, the multiplication matrix can be read on the input
Gr\""obner basis.
  The current fastest algorithms rely on the sparsity of this matrix. Actually,
this sparsity is a consequence of an algebraic structure, which can be
exploited to represent the matrix concisely as a univariate polynomial matrix.
We show that the Hermite normal form of that matrix yields the sought
lexicographic Gr\""obner basis, under assumptions which cover the shape position
case. Under some mild assumption implying $n \le t$, the arithmetic complexity
of our algorithm is $O\tilde{~}(t^{\omega-1}D)$, where $n$ is the number of

degree of the zero-dimensional ideal under consideration, and $\omega$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication. This improves upon both state-of-the-art
complexity bounds $O\tilde{~}(tD^2)$ and $O\tilde{~}(D^\omega)$, since $\omega
< 3$ and $t\le D$. Practical experiments, based on the libraries msolve and

applications, and it is often proposed as a paradigm to write distributed
applications. One such type of application is *prosumer* applications, which
are distributed applications that both produce and consume many events. We
analyse the problems that occur when using a reactive programming language or
framework to implement prosumer applications. We find that the assumption of an
open network, which means prosumers of various types spontaneously join and
leave the network, can cause a lot of code complexity or run-time inefficiency.
At the basis of these issues lies *acquaintance management*: the ability to
discover prosumers as they join and leave the network, and correctly
maintaining this state throughout the reactive program. Most existing reactive
programming languages and frameworks have limited support for managing
acquaintances, resulting in accidental complexity of the code or inefficient
computations.
  In this paper we present acquaintance management for reactive programs.
First, we design an *acquaintance discovery* mechanism to create a *flock* that
automatically discovers prosumers on the network. An important aspect of flocks
is their integration with reactive programs, such that a reactive program can
correctly and efficiently maintain its state. To this end we design an
*acquaintance maintenance* mechanism: a new type of operator for functional
reactive programming languages that we call `deploy-*`. The `deploy-*` operator
enables correct and efficient reactions to time-varying collections of
discovered prosumers. The proposed mechanisms are implemented in a reactive
programming language called Stella, which serves as a linguistic vehicle to
demonstrate the ideas of our approach. Our implementation of acquaintance
management results in computationally efficient and idiomatic reactive code.
  We evaluate our approach quantitatively via benchmarks that show that our
implementation is efficient: computations will efficiently update whenever a
new prosumer is discovered, or a connected prosumer is dropped. To evaluate the
distributed capabilities of our prototype implementation, we implement a
use-case that simulates the bike-sharing infrastructure of Brussels, and we run
it on a Raspberry Pi cluster computer. We consider our work to be an important
step to use functional reactive programming to build distributed systems for
open networks, in other words, distributed reactive programs that involve many
prosumer devices and sensors that spontaneously join and leave the network.

teaching and learning of computer programming. Through this paper which is an
essay about programming, we aim to contribute to the plethora of existing
pedagogies, approaches and philosophies, by discussing a specific feature of
our approach in teaching principled programming to undergraduate students, in
their first semester of studies, namely the utilization of pictures, both
text-based and raster-based graphics. Although the given course has evolved
substantially over the thirty years of its delivery regarding the programming
languages (Miranda, C, C++, Java) and paradigms (functional, imperative,
object-oriented, combination of procedural and object-oriented) used, the
discussed visual feature has been maintained and steadily strengthened.
  We list abstraction, problem decomposition and synthesis, information hiding,
reusability, modularity and extensibility as key principles of problem solving
and algorithmic thinking. These principles are closely aligned with the
advocated computational thinking techniques of problem decomposition, pattern
recognition, pattern generalization and algorithm design. We aim for our
students to familiarize themselves with all the above principles through
practical problem solving. Our ongoing inquiry has been whether the problem
domain of pictures is contributing valuably towards this aim. Moreover, an
added-value is that students get a glimpse of computational complexity in a
visual, empirical way.
  The presented work is not related to visual programming, since the students
write their programs textually and not graphically; it's the output of their
programs which is in visual form. Our approach though is loosely related to the
classical paradigm of turtle graphics. However, our focus is Computer Science
majors, who should be able to design and build turtles and other objects and
not just use them. Indeed, the programming principles course helps them to do
both and also to appreciate the multitude of algorithmic ways for producing the
same visual output. Currently the given programming principles are approached
both from a procedural, process-based and an object-oriented, concept-based
perspective and the course uses the Java language. Through the presented
example problems, we aim to show the appropriateness of the visual domain of
pictures for supporting the learning of principled programming. The problem
domain of pictures is abundantly rich with potential examples to draw from.
Moreover, as reported in the literature, female students may show higher
interest towards visual problem domains in programming classes, in relation to
other problem domains. We plan to investigate this conjecture in the context of
our broader aim to encourage more females to follow university studies in
computer science; in this paper only a cursory finding is presented, that bears
some relation to what is reported in the literature.

hypergraphs, are ubiquitous in programming. This paper focuses on representing
graphs in a purely functional programming language like Haskell. There are
several existing approaches; one of the most recently developed ones is the
""algebraic graphs"" approach (2017). It uses an algebraic data type to represent
graphs and has attracted users, including from industry, due to its emphasis on
equational reasoning and making a common class of bugs impossible by
eliminating internal invariants.
  The previous formulation of algebraic graphs did not support edge labels,
which was a serious practical limitation. In this paper, we redesign the main
algebraic data type and remove this limitation. We follow a fairly standard
approach of parameterising a data structure with a semiring of edge labels. The
new formulation is both more general and simpler: the two operations for
composing graphs used in the previous work can now be obtained from a single
operation by fixing the semiring parameter to zero and one, respectively.
  By instantiating the new data type with different semirings, and working out
laws for interpreting the resulting expression trees, we discover an unusual
algebraic structure, which we call ""united monoids"", that is, a pair of monoids
whose unit elements coincide. We believe that it is worth studying united
monoids in their full generality, going beyond the graphs which prompted their
discovery. To that end, we characterise united monoids with a minimal set of
axioms, prove a few basic theorems, and discuss several notable examples.
  We validate the presented approach by implementing it in the open-source
*algebraic-graphs* library. Our theoretical contributions are supported by
proofs that are included in the paper and have also been machine-checked in
Agda. By extending algebraic graphs with support for edge labels, we make them
suitable for a much larger class of possible applications. By studying united
monoids, we provide a theoretical foundation for further research in this area.

  Issue 3, Article 13","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2022/6/13",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: It is common for programming languages that their reference
implementation is implemented in the language itself. This requires a
""bootstrap"": a copy of a previous version of the implementation is provided
along with the sources, to be able to run the implementation itself. Those
bootstrap files are opaque binaries; they could contain bugs, or even malicious
changes that could reproduce themselves when running the source version of the
language implementation -- this is called the ""trusting trust attack"". For this
reason, a collective project called Bootstrappable was launched in 2016 to
remove those bootstraps, providing alternative build paths that do not rely on
opaque binaries.
  Inquiry: Debootstrapping generally combines a mix of two approaches. The
""archaeological"" approach works by locating old versions of systems, or legacy
alternative implementations, that do not need the bootstrap, and by preserving
or restoring the ability to run them. The ""tailored"" approach re-implements a
new, non-bootstrapped implementation of the system to debootstrap. Currently,
the ""tailored"" approach is dominant for low-level system components (C,
coreutils), and the ""archaeological"" approach is dominant among the few
higher-level languages that were debootstrapped.
  Approach: We advocate for the benefits of ""tailored"" debootstrapping
implementations of high-level languages. The new implementation needs not be
production-ready, it suffices that it is able to run the reference
implementation correctly. We argue that this is feasible with a reasonable
development effort, with several side benefits besides debootstrapping.
  Knowledge: We propose a specific design of composing/stacking several
implementations: a reference interpreter for the language of interest,
implemented in a small subset of the language, and a compiler for this small
subset (in another language). Developing a reference interpreter is valuable
independently of debootstrapping: it may help clarify the language semantics,
and can be reused for other purposes such as differential testing of the other
implementations.
  Grounding: We present Camlboot, our project to debootstrap the OCaml
compiler, version 4.07. Once we converged on this final design, the last
version of Camlboot took about a person-month of implementation effort,
demonstrating feasibility. Using diverse double-compilation, we were able to
prove the absence of trusting trust attack in the existing bootstrap of the
standard OCaml implementation.
  Importance: To our knowledge, this document is the first scholarly discussion
of ""tailored"" debootstrapping for high-level programming languages.
Debootstrapping is an interesting problem which recently grew an active
community of free software contributors, but so far the interactions with the
programming-language research community have been minimal. We share our
experience on Camlboot, trying to highlight aspects that are of interest to
other language designers and implementors; we hope to foster stronger ties
between the Bootstrappable project and relevant academic communities. In
particular, the debootstrapping experience has been an interesting reflection
on OCaml design and implementation, and we hope that other language
implementors would find it equally valuable.

calculated by subtracting the phase vectors of a smaller slit from those of a
larger one. This method is also demonstrated by using a diffraction calculation
tool when an obstacle is positioned behind a double slit. The approach of phase
vector integration is expanded to calculate the quantum probability current.
Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi- and the stationary Schr\""odinger- equation, the
quantum probability current is calculated and its continuity is shown. The
time-dependent differential equation of the probabilty current velocity is
numerically solved. For a large number of integrations it is statistically
shown that the distribution of the flux per area is consistent with the

densities (PSD) as a Gaussian mixture, thus, having a structural restriction:
by assuming the existence of a PSD, the method is only suited for multi-output
stationary applications. We develop a nonstationary extension of MOSM by
proposing the family of harmonizable kernels for MOGPs, a class of kernels that
contains both stationary and a vast majority of non-stationary processes. A
main contribution of the proposed harmonizable kernels is that they
automatically identify a possible nonstationary behaviour meaning that
practitioners do not need to choose between stationary or non-stationary
kernels. The proposed method is first validated on synthetic data with the
purpose of illustrating the key properties of our approach, and then compared

convexity arguments. Moreover, for certain anisotropic parts, we prove that for
large values of the parameter the global minimizer is only given by vertically
concentrated measures corresponding to one dimensional minimizers. We also show
that these ellipse-supported configurations generically do not collapse to a
vertically concentrated measure at the critical value for convexity, leading to
an interesting gap of the parameters in between. In this intermediate range, we
conclude by infinitesimal concavity that any superlevel set of any local
minimizer in a suitable sense does not have interior points. Furthermore, for
certain anisotropic parts, their support cannot contain any vertical segment
for a restricted range of parameters, and moreover the global minimizers are

factors 2-10 after this. Our results are important both for demonstrating
validity of LTE expansion opacities for an initial phase (few days), while

to developing policies to mitigate the social and clinical impact of
SARS-CoV-2. Publicly available vaccination data are frequently cited as a proxy
for population immunity, but this metric ignores the effects of
naturally-acquired immunity, which varies broadly throughout the country and
world. Without broad or random sampling of the population, accurate measurement
of persistent immunity post natural infection is generally unavailable. To
enable tracking of both naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced immunity, we set
up a synthetic random proxy based on routine hospital testing for estimating
total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) prevalence in the sampled community. Our approach
analyzes viral IgG testing data of asymptomatic patients who present for
elective procedures within a hospital system. We apply multilevel regression
and poststratification to adjust for demographic and geographic discrepancies
between the sample and the community population. We then apply state-based
vaccination data to categorize immune status as driven by natural infection or
by vaccine. We have validated the model using verified clinical metrics of
viral and symptomatic disease incidence to show the expected biological
correlation of these entities with the timing, rate, and magnitude of
seroprevalence. In mid-July 2021, the estimated immunity level was 74% with the
administered vaccination rate of 45% in the two counties. The metric improves
real-time understanding of immunity to COVID-19 as it evolves and the
coordination of policy responses to the disease, toward an inexpensive and
easily operational surveillance system that transcends the limits of
vaccination datasets alone.

thermodynamical multi-hair has been advocated to describe perfectly the
thermodynamical character of the generic four-dimensional Taub-NUT spacetimes.
According to this scheme, the Komar mass M, the gravito-magnetic charge and/or
the dual (magnetic) mass N, together with a new secondary hair J_N=MN, namely,
a Kerr-like conserved angular momentum, enter into the standard forms of the
first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula. Distinguished from other recent
attempts, our consistent thermodynamic differential and integral mass formulae
are both obtainable from a meaningful Christodoulou-Ruffini-type squared mass
formula of almost all of the four-dimensional NUT-charged spacetimes. As an
excellent consequence, the famous Bekenstein-Hawking one-quarter area-entropy
relation can be naturally restored not only in the Lorentzian sector and but
also in the Euclidian counterpart of the generic Taub-NUT-type spacetimes
without imposing any constraint condition. However, only purely
electric-charged cases in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity theory
with a NUT charge have been addressed there. In this paper, we shall follow the
simple, systematic way proposed in that article to further investigate the
dyonic NUT-charged case. It is shown that the standard thermodynamic relations
continue to hold true provided that no new secondary charge is added, however,
the so-obtained electrostatic and magneto-static potentials are not coincident
with those computed via the standard method. To rectify this inconsistence, a
simple strategy is provided by further introducing two additional secondary
hairs: Q_N=QN and P_N=PN, together with their thermodynamical conjugate
potentials, so that the first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula are still
satisfied.

using V-CRAN, to determine the benefits of cell-free networking. The numerical
results demonstrate that cell-free massive MIMO increases the maximum rate
substantially, which can be provided with almost the same energy per bit. We
show that it is more power-efficient to activate cell-free massive MIMO already
at low spectral efficiencies (above 1 bit/s/Hz).

acquisition may not always be feasible. Alternatively, high-resolution images
can be created from low-resolution acquisitions using conventional upsampling
methods, but such methods cannot exploit high-level contextual information
contained in the images. Recently, better performing deep-learning based
super-resolution methods have been introduced. However, these methods are
limited by their supervised character, i.e. they require high-resolution
examples for training. Instead, we propose an unsupervised deep learning
semantic interpolation approach that synthesizes new intermediate slices from
encoded low-resolution examples. To achieve semantically smooth interpolation
in through-plane direction, the method exploits the latent space generated by
autoencoders. To generate new intermediate slices, latent space encodings of
two spatially adjacent slices are combined using their convex combination.
Subsequently, the combined encoding is decoded to an intermediate slice. To
constrain the model, a notion of semantic similarity is defined for a given
dataset. For this, a new loss is introduced that exploits the spatial
relationship between slices of the same volume. During training, an existing
in-between slice is generated using a convex combination of its neighboring
slice encodings. The method was trained and evaluated using publicly available
cardiac cine, neonatal brain and adult brain MRI scans. In all evaluations, the
new method produces significantly better results in terms of Structural
Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (p< 0.001 using
one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test) than a cubic B-spline interpolation
approach. Given the unsupervised nature of the method, high-resolution training

modalities. Generally, models that fuse complementary information from multiple
modalities outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, a successful model
that fuses modalities requires components that can effectively aggregate
task-relevant information from each modality. As cross-modal attention is seen
as an effective mechanism for multi-modal fusion, in this paper we quantify the
gain that such a mechanism brings compared to the corresponding self-attention
mechanism. To this end, we implement and compare a cross-attention and a
self-attention model. In addition to attention, each model uses convolutional
layers for local feature extraction and recurrent layers for global sequential
modelling. We compare the models using different modality combinations for a
7-class emotion classification task using the IEMOCAP dataset. Experimental

The problem of data-informativity for stabilization or control with quadratic

unfalsified systems or achieves a desired quadratic performance. Recent results
in the literature provide informativity conditions for control based on
input-state data and ellipsoidal noise bounds, such as energy or magnitude
bounds. In this paper, we consider informativity of input-state data for
control where noise bounds are defined through the cross-covariance of the

originally as a noise characterization in parameter bounding identification.
The considered cross-covariance bounds are defined by a finite number of

as video question-answering (QA), typically construct such graphs for every
video frame. These approaches often ignore the fact that videos are essentially
sequences of 2D ""views"" of events happening in a 3D space, and that the
semantics of the 3D scene can thus be carried over from frame to frame.
Leveraging this insight, we propose a (2.5+1)D scene graph representation to
better capture the spatio-temporal information flows inside the videos.
Specifically, we first create a 2.5D (pseudo-3D) scene graph by transforming
every 2D frame to have an inferred 3D structure using an off-the-shelf 2D-to-3D
transformation module, following which we register the video frames into a
shared (2.5+1)D spatio-temporal space and ground each 2D scene graph within it.
Such a (2.5+1)D graph is then segregated into a static sub-graph and a dynamic
sub-graph, corresponding to whether the objects within them usually move in the
world. The nodes in the dynamic graph are enriched with motion features
capturing their interactions with other graph nodes. Next, for the video QA
task, we present a novel transformer-based reasoning pipeline that embeds the
(2.5+1)D graph into a spatio-temporal hierarchical latent space, where the
sub-graphs and their interactions are captured at varied granularity. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on the
NExT-QA and AVSD-QA datasets. Our results show that our proposed (2.5+1)D
representation leads to faster training and inference, while our hierarchical
model showcases superior performance on the video QA task versus the state of
the art.

especially important as knowledge about data access times is crucial to
establish bounds on execution times and guarantee the meeting of deadlines.We
propose in this paper a refinement of our previously sketched approach of
Migration-Based Synchronization (MBS) as well as its first practical
implementation. The core concept of MBS is the replacement of data migration
with control-flow migration to achieve synchronized memory accesses with
guaranteed data locality. This leads to both shorter and more predictable
execution times for critical sections. As MBS can be used as a substitute for
classical locks, it can be employed in legacy applications without code
alterations.We further examine how the gained data locality improves the
results of worst-case timing analyses and results in tighter bounds on
execution and response time. We reason about the similarity of MBS to existing
synchronization approaches and how it enables us to reuse existing analysis
techniques.Finally, we evaluate our prototype implementation, showing that MBS
can exploit data locality with similar overheads as traditional locking
mechanisms.

Traditionally, to prevent such an escape, the partial control technique has
been applied. This method stands out for considering disturbances (noise)
affecting the map and for finding a special region of the phase space, called
the safe set, where the control required to sustain the orbits is small.
However, in this work we will apply a new approach of the partial control
method that has been recently developed. This new approach is based on finding
a special function called the safety function, which allows to automatically
find the minimum control necessary to avoid the escape of the orbits.
Furthermore, we will show the strong connection between the safety function and
the classical safe set. To illustrate that, we will compute for the first time,
safety functions for the two-dimensional H\'enon and Lozi maps, where we also

these parameters, LED array position deviation is recovered based on the
features of brightfield to darkfield transition low-resolution images while the

information (e.g medical, financial, personal government records). Hence, a
data breach in a system storing such information can have devastating
consequences. Deep learning is widely utilized for face recognition (FR);
however, such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks executed by malicious
parties. Backdoor attacks cause a model to misclassify a particular class as a
target class during recognition. This vulnerability can allow adversaries to
gain access to highly sensitive data protected by biometric authentication
measures or allow the malicious party to masquerade as an individual with
higher system permissions. Such breaches pose a serious privacy threat.
Previous methods integrate noise addition mechanisms into face recognition
models to mitigate this issue and improve the robustness of classification
against backdoor attacks. However, this can drastically affect model accuracy.
We propose a novel and generalizable approach (named BA-BAM: Biometric
Authentication - Backdoor Attack Mitigation), that aims to prevent backdoor
attacks on face authentication deep learning models through transfer learning
and selective image perturbation. The empirical evidence shows that BA-BAM is
highly robust and incurs a maximal accuracy drop of 2.4%, while reducing the
attack success rate to a maximum of 20%. Comparisons with existing approaches
show that BA-BAM provides a more practical backdoor mitigation approach for

foreground-background imbalance. There have been some recent efforts that
attempt to address this issue by proposing sophisticated neural network
architectures, since they can be used to extract informative multi-scale
feature representations and increase the discrimination of object boundaries.
Nevertheless, many of them merely utilize those multi-scale representations in
ad-hoc measures but disregard the fact that the semantic meaning of objects
with various sizes could be better identified via receptive fields of diverse
ranges. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Focus Framework (AF$_2$), which
adopts a hierarchical segmentation procedure and focuses on adaptively
utilizing multi-scale representations generated by widely adopted neural
network architectures. Particularly, a learnable module, called Adaptive
Confidence Mechanism (ACM), is proposed to determine which scale of
representation should be used for the segmentation of different objects.
Comprehensive experiments show that AF$_2$ has significantly improved the

applications. The spatial light modulator and optical data projector both rely
on precisely configurable optical elements to shape a light beam. Here we
explore an image-projection approach which does not require a configurable
beam-shaping element. We term this approach ghost projection on account of its
conceptual relation to computational ghost imaging. Instead of a configurable
beam shaping element, the method transversely displaces a single illuminated
mask, such as a spatially-random screen, to create specified distributions of
radiant exposure. The method has potential applicability to image projection
employing a variety of radiation and matter wave fields, such as hard x rays,
neutrons, muons, atomic beams and molecular beams. Building on our previous
theoretical and computational studies, we here seek to understand the effects,
sensitivity, and tolerance of some key experimental limitations of the method.
Focusing on the case of hard x rays, we employ experimentally acquired masks to
numerically study the deleterious effects of photon shot noise, inaccuracies in
random-mask exposure time, and inaccuracies in mask positioning, as well as
adapting to spatially non-uniform illumination. Understanding the influence of
these factors will assist in optimizing experimental design and work towards
achieving ghost projection in practice.

Transformer suffers from the scalability problem when dealing with graphs. The
computational complexity is unacceptable for large-scale graphs, e.g.,
knowledge graphs. One solution is to consider only the near neighbors, which,
however, will lose the key merit of Transformer to attend to the elements at
any distance. In this paper, we propose a new Transformer architecture, named
dual-encoding Transformer (DET). DET has a structural encoder to aggregate
information from connected neighbors and a semantic encoder to focus on
semantically useful distant nodes. In comparison with resorting to multi-hop
neighbors, DET seeks the desired distant neighbors via self-supervised
training. We further find these two encoders can be incorporated to boost each
others' performance. Our experiments demonstrate DET has achieved superior
performance compared to the respective state-of-the-art methods in dealing with
molecules, networks and knowledge graphs with various sizes.

attack, we found that CAD came out of the effect of pseudo-deletion of data. We
provided a preliminary explanation of this phenomenon from the perspective of
model classification boundaries and observed that this pseudo-deletion had
advantages over direct deletion in the data debiasing problem. Based on the

  In this paper, we propose DeepSketch, a new reference search technique for

to achieve higher accuracy in reference search for delta compression, thereby
improving data-reduction efficiency. DeepSketch uses a deep neural network to
extract a data block's sketch, i.e., to create an approximate data signature of

real-world scenarios, there exist multiple forecasting entities (e.g. power
station in the solar system, stations in the traffic system). A straightforward
forecasting solution is to mine the temporal dependency for each individual
entity through 1d-CNN, RNN, transformer, etc. This approach overlooks the
relations between these entities and, in consequence, loses the opportunity to
improve performance using spatial-temporal relation. However, in many
real-world scenarios, beside explicit relation, there could exist crucial yet
implicit relation between entities. How to discover the useful implicit
relation between entities and effectively utilize the relations for each entity

Particularly, a Gumbel-softmax based auto graph learner is designed to
automatically capture the implicit relation among forecasting entities. We

for the express system pick up packages in certain areas of interest (AOI)

with time. While the assignment results are generally static without changing
with time. Using the historical pick-up request number to conduct AOI
assignment (or pick-up request assignment) for couriers is thus unreasonable.
Moreover, even we can first predict future pick-up requests and then use the
prediction results to conduct the assignments, this kind of two-stage method is
also impractical and trivial, and exists some drawbacks, such as the best
prediction results might not ensure the best clustering results. To solve these
problems, we put forward an intelligent end-to-end predict-then-optimize

AOIs based on the prediction results. We finally propose a one-stage end-to-end

attention because of its advantages such as decentralization and privacy

allocation of resources for clients in BCFL. In the BCFL framework where the FL
clients and the blockchain miners are the same devices, clients broadcast the
trained model updates to the blockchain network and then perform mining to
generate new blocks. Since each client has a limited amount of computing
resources, the problem of allocating computing resources into training and
mining needs to be carefully addressed. In this paper, we design an incentive
mechanism to assign each client appropriate rewards for training and mining,
and then the client will determine the amount of computing power to allocate
for each subtask based on these rewards using the two-stage Stackelberg game.
After analyzing the utilities of the model owner (MO) (i.e., the BCFL task
publisher) and clients, we transform the game model into two optimization
problems, which are sequentially solved to derive the optimal strategies for
both the MO and clients. Further, considering the fact that local training
related information of each client may not be known by others, we extend the
game model with analytical solutions to the incomplete information scenario.

prediction accuracy of machine learning methods by optimally incorporating
advice about the future into online algorithms. In particular, we characterize
the Pareto frontier that captures the tradeoff between consistency (performance

always achieves performance on this Pareto frontier. We also study the class of
protection level policies, which is the most widely-deployed technique for
single-leg revenue management: we provide an algorithm to incorporate advice

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  How are abstract concepts and musical themes recognized on the basis of some
previous experience? It is interesting to compare the different behaviors of
human and of artificial intelligences with respect to this problem. Generally,
a human mind that abstracts a concept (say, table) from a given set of known
examples creates a table-Gestalt: a kind of vague and out of focus image that
does not fully correspond to a particular table with well determined features.
A similar situation arises in the case of musical themes. Can the construction
of a gestaltic pattern, which is so natural for human minds, be taught to an
intelligent machine? This problem can be successfully discussed in the
framework of a quantum approach to pattern recognition and to machine learning.
The basic idea is replacing classical data sets with quantum data sets, where
either objects or musical themes can be formally represented as pieces of
quantum information, involving the uncertainties and the ambiguities that
characterize the quantum world. In this framework, the intuitive concept of
Gestalt can be simulated by the mathematical concept of positive centroid of a
given quantum data set. Accordingly, the crucial problem ""how can we classify a
new object or a new musical theme (we have listened to) on the basis of a
previous experience?"" can be dealt with in terms of some special quantum
similarity-relations. Although recognition procedures are different for human
and for artificial intelligences, there is a common method of ""facing the

bottom part of the produced spherical surface for our tomographic applications,
we take the absolute value of the vertical component in the Cartesian

However, the use of these data is frequently challenged by its sheer volume and

ten major areas, spanning the energy value chain. Within each research area, we
distill and critically discuss major features that are relevant to energy

since the ball is served until one of the two teams on the court scores the
point. In this process, athletes evolve in response to physical and information
constraints, spanning several spatiotemporal scales and interplaying
co-adaptively with the environment. Aiming to study the emergence of complexity
in this system, we carried out a study focused on three steps: data collection,
data analysis, and modeling. First, we collected data from 20 high-level
professional volleyball games. Then we conducted a data-driven analysis from
where we identified fundamental insights that we used to define a parsimonious
stochastic model for the dynamics of the game. On these bases, we show that it
is possible to give a closed-form expression for the probability that the
players perform n hits in a rally using only two stochastic variables. Our
results fully agree with the empirical observations and represent a new advance
in the comprehension of team-sports competition complexity and dynamics.

importance of cloud computing in remote learning and education. This study
conducted multiple-case analyses of 22 online platforms of higher education in
Chinese universities during the epidemic. A comparative analysis of the 22
platforms revealed that they applied different cloud computing models and tools
based on their unique requirements and needs. The study results provide
strategic insights to higher education institutions regarding effective
approaches to applying cloud computing-based platforms for remote education,
especially during crisis situations.

satisfy their needs. The relation between needs and technology is so
fundamental that the US National Research Council defined the distinguishing
characteristic of technology as its goal ""to make modifications in the world to
meet human needs"". Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising
emerging technologies of our time. Similar to other technologies, AI is
expected ""to meet [human] needs"". In this article, we reflect on the
relationship between needs and AI, and call for the realisation of needs-aware
AI systems. We argue that re-thinking needs for, through, and by AI can be a
very useful means towards the development of realistic approaches for
Sustainable, Human-centric, Accountable, Lawful, and Ethical (HALE) AI systems.
We discuss some of the most critical gaps, barriers, enablers, and drivers of
co-creating future AI-based socio-technical systems in which [human] needs are
well considered and met. Finally, we provide an overview of potential threats
and HALE considerations that should be carefully taken into account, and call
for joint, immediate, and interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations.

competitive alternatives to television for children's entertainment.
Consequently, YouTube Kids' content should receive an additional level of
scrutiny to ensure children's safety. While research on detecting offensive or
inappropriate content for kids is gaining momentum, little or no current work
exists that investigates to what extent AI applications can (accidentally)
introduce content that is inappropriate for kids.
  In this paper, we present a novel (and troubling) finding that well-known
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may produce text content highly
inappropriate for kids while transcribing YouTube Kids' videos. We dub this
phenomenon as \emph{inappropriate content hallucination}. Our analyses suggest
that such hallucinations are far from occasional, and the ASR systems often
produce them with high confidence. We release a first-of-its-kind data set of
audios for which the existing state-of-the-art ASR systems hallucinate
inappropriate content for kids. In addition, we demonstrate that some of these
errors can be fixed using language models.

perturbatively in powers of the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$ using the
Seiberg-Witten map between ordinary classical fields and their NC counterparts.
The leading order term represents classical ($\theta=0$) action while
higher-order terms give us $\theta$-dependent NC corrections that ought to
capture some aspects of quantum gravity. Building on previous work of Aschieri
and Castellani on NC Chern-Simons (CS) gauge and gravity theories, showing that
non-trivial $\theta$-dependence exists only for spacetime dimensions $D\geq 5$,
we investigate a correlated effect of these extra spatial dimensions and
noncommutativity on four-dimensional physics, up to first-order in $\theta$.
Assuming that one spatial dimension is compactified into a circle, we apply the
Kaluza-Klein reduction procedure on the NC $D=5$ CS theory for the conformal
gauge group $SO(4,2)$, to obtain an effective, $\theta$-dependent
four-dimensional theory of gravity that has Einstein-Hilbert gravity with
negative cosmological constant as its commutative limit. We derive field
equations for this modified theory of gravity and study the effect of NC
interactions on some classical geometries, such as the AdS-Schwarzschild black
hole. We find that this NC background spacetime gives rise to chiral
gravitational anomaly due to the nonvanishing $\theta$-dependent Pontryagin
density.

  Approaches to Software Engineering (FASE'22)",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Product Engineering Processes (PEPs) are used for describing complex product
developments in big enterprises such as automotive and avionics industries. The
Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) is a widely used language to encode
interactions among several participants in such PEPs. In this paper, we present
SMC4PEP as a tool to convert graphical representations of a business process
using the BPMN standard to an equivalent discrete-time stochastic control
process called Markov Decision Process (MDP). To this aim, we first follow the
approach described in an earlier investigation to generate a semantically
equivalent business process which is more capable of handling the PEP
complexity. In particular, the interaction between different levels of
abstraction is realized by events rather than direct message flows. Afterwards,
SMC4PEP converts the generated process to an MDP model described by the syntax
of the probabilistic model checking tool PRISM. As such, SMC4PEP provides a
framework for automatic verification and validation of business processes in
particular with respect to requirements from legal standards such as Automotive
SPICE. Moreover, our experimental results confirm a faster verification routine
due to smaller MDP models generated from the alternative event-based BPMN
models.
