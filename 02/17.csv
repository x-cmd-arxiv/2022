REAL-FND exploits cross-domain and within-domain knowledge that makes it robust

the proposed model, especially when limited labeled data is available in the

quality and intelligibility degradations, making training low-resource TTS

a target speaker. It uses voice conversion (VC) as a post-processing module
appended to a pre-existing high-quality TTS system and marks a conceptual shift
in the existing TTS paradigm, framing the few-shot TTS problem as a VC task.
Furthermore, we propose to use a duration-controllable TTS system to create a

crucial for solar cell and optoelectronic applications. Non-adiabatic molecular
dynamics (NAMD) simulations based on time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) are widely used to study excited-state carrier dynamics. However, the
calculated carrier lifetimes are often different from experimental results by
orders of magnitude. In this work, by revisiting the definition of carrier
lifetime and considering different recombination mechanisms, we report a
systematic procedure for calculating the effective carrier lifetime in
realistic semiconductor crystals that can be compared directly to experimental
measurements. The procedure shows that considering all recombination mechanisms
and using reasonable densities of carriers and defects are crucial in
calculating the effective lifetime. When NAMD simulations consider only
Shockey-Read-Hall (SRH) defect-assisted and band-to-band non-radiative
recombination while neglect band-to-band radiative recombination, and the
densities of non-equilibrium carriers and defects in supercell simulations are
much higher than those in realistic semiconductors under solar illumination,
the calculated lifetimes are ineffective and thus differ from experiments.
Using our procedure, the calculated effective lifetime of the halide perovskite
CH3NH3PbI3 agrees with experiments. It is mainly determined by band-to-band
radiative and defect-assisted non-radiative recombination, while band-to-band
non-radiative recombination is negligible. These results indicate that it is
possible to calculate carrier lifetimes accurately based on NAMD simulations,
but the directly calculated values should be converted to effective lifetimes
for comparison to experiments. The revised procedure can be widely applied in
future carrier lifetime simulations.

approximation to provide a L2-stable reconstruction of three types of defects:
a local perturbation inside the waveguide, a bending of the waveguide, and a
localized defect in the geometry of the waveguide. This method is based on a
mode-by-mode spacial Fourier inversion from the available partial data in the
Fourier domain. Indeed, in the available data, some high and low spatial

both a compact support hypothesis and a minimal smoothness hypothesis on the

morphological properties are powerful tracers of galaxy evolution. With the
upcoming Large-scale Imaging Surveys, billions of galaxy images challenge
astronomers to accomplish the classification task by applying traditional
methods or human inspection. Consequently, machine learning, in particular
supervised deep learning, has been widely employed to classify galaxy
morphologies recently due to its exceptional automation, efficiency, and
accuracy. However, supervised deep learning requires extensive training sets,
which causes considerable workloads; also, the results are strongly dependent
on the characteristics of training sets, which leads to biased outcomes
potentially. In this study, we attempt Few-shot Learning to bypass the two
issues. Our research adopts the dataset from Galaxy Zoo Challenge Project on
Kaggle, and we divide it into five categories according to the corresponding

on Siamese Networks and supervised deep learning based on AlexNet, VGG_16, and
ResNet_50 trained with different volumes of training sets separately, we find
that few-shot learning achieves the highest accuracy in most cases, and the
most significant improvement is $21\%$ compared to AlexNet when the training
sets contain 1000 images. In addition, to guarantee the accuracy is no less
than 90\%, few-shot learning needs $\sim$6300 images for training, while
ResNet_50 requires 13000 images. Considering the advantages stated above,
foreseeably, few-shot learning is suitable for the taxonomy of galaxy

to determine a subset $S$ of $k$ centers minimizing the sum of all squared

formulation, known as k-means with $z$ outliers, introduced to deal with noisy

a distributed coreset-based 3-round approximation algorithm for k-means with

model. Our distributed algorithm requires sublinear local memory per reducer,
and yields a solution whose approximation ratio is an additive term $O(\gamma)$

battery-free devices capable of machine learning and inference in underwater

implications for a new generation of underwater sensing and monitoring
applications for environmental monitoring, scientific exploration, and
climate/weather prediction.
  To answer this question, we explore the feasibility of bridging advances from
the past decade in two fields: battery-free networking and low-power machine
learning. Our exploration demonstrates that it is indeed possible to enable
battery-free inference in underwater environments. We designed a device that
can harvest energy from underwater sound, power up an ultra-low-power
microcontroller and on-board sensor, perform local inference on sensed
measurements using a lightweight Deep Neural Network, and communicate the
inference result via backscatter to a receiver. We tested our prototype in an
emulated marine bioacoustics application, demonstrating the potential to
recognize underwater animal sounds without batteries. Through this exploration,
we highlight the challenges and opportunities for making underwater
battery-free inference and machine learning ubiquitous.

GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walk

the geometry of the minimum-volume confidence sets for the multinomial
parameter. When used in place of more standard confidence sets and intervals
based on bounds and asymptotic approximation, learning algorithms can exhibit
improved sample complexity. Prior work showed the minimum-volume confidence
sets are the level-sets of a discontinuous function defined by an exact
p-value. While the confidence sets are optimal in that they have minimum
average volume, computation of membership of a single point in the set is
challenging for problems of modest size. Since the confidence sets are
level-sets of discontinuous functions, little is apparent about their geometry.
This paper studies the geometry of the minimum volume confidence sets by
enumerating and covering the continuous regions of the exact p-value function.
This addresses a fundamental question in A/B testing: given two multinomial
outcomes, how can one determine if their corresponding minimum volume
confidence sets are disjoint? We answer this question in a restricted setting.

we minimize the absolute peak value subject to a constraint based on auditory

in deep learning for beamforming prediction using deep neural networks (DNNs)
in 6G wireless networks, which treats the beamforming prediction as a
multi-output regression problem. It is indicated that the initial DNN model is
vulnerable against adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method
(FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and
Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), because the initial DNN model is sensitive to
the perturbations of the adversarial samples of the training data. This study
also offers two mitigation methods, such as adversarial training and defensive
distillation, for adversarial attacks against artificial intelligence
(AI)-based models used in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beamforming prediction.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be used in situations where the data are
corrupted due to the adversarial examples in the training data. Experimental
results show that the proposed methods effectively defend the DNN models

by Fomin and Villanger (Combinatorica 32, 2012) that uses $O(2.616^n)$ time and
polynomial space. We show three quantum algorithms with the following
complexity, using QRAM in both exponential space algorithms: $\bullet$
$O(1.618^n)$ time and polynomial space; $\bullet$ $O(1.554^n)$ time and
$O(1.452^n)$ space; $\bullet$ $O(1.538^n)$ time and space. In contrast, the
fastest known classical algorithm for treewidth uses $O(1.755^n)$ time and
space. The first two speed-ups are obtained in a fairly straightforward way.
The first version uses additionally only Grover's search and provides a
quadratic speedup. The second speedup is more time-efficient and uses both
Grover's search and the quantum exponential dynamic programming by Ambainis et
al. (SODA '19). The third version uses the specific properties of the classical
algorithm and treewidth, with a modified version of the quantum dynamic
programming on the hypercube. Lastly, as a small side result, we also give a
new classical time-space tradeoff for computing treewidth in $O^*(2^n)$ time

The main goal of this study is to map the intra-group baryons in the pair, in
the form of diffuse light and globular clusters (GCs). Taking advantage from
the large covered area, which extends for $\sim$ 3.9 square degrees around the
pair, and the long integration time, we can map the light distribution out to
$\sim$ 63 kpc and down to $\sim$ 30 mag/arcsec$^2$ in the $g$ band and $\sim$
29 mag/arcsec$^2$ in the $r$ band, deeper than previous data available for this
target. The map of the intra-group light (IGL) presents two very faint ($\mu_g
\sim$ 28-29 mag/arcsec$^2$) streams protruding from the brightest group member
NGC~3379 and elongated toward North-West and South. We estimate that the
fraction of the stellar halo around NGC~3379 plus the IGL is $\sim 17 \pm 2\%$
in both $g$ and $r$ bands, with an average color $g$-$r$= $0.75 \pm 0.04$~mag.
The color distribution of the GCs appears multi-modal, with two dominant peaks
at (u-r) = 1.8 mag and (u-r) = 2.1 mag, respectively. The GC population
stretches from North-East to South-West and from North-West to South of the
pair, in the last case overlapping with the streams of IGL, as well as the PNe
distribution found by \citet{Hartke2020} and \citet{Hartke2022arXiv220108710H}.
Since these structures are elongated in the direction of the two nearby
galaxies M96 and NGC~3338, they could be the remnant of a past gravitational
interactions with the pair.

potential to transform wireless environments into controllable systems, through
programmable propagation of information-bearing signals. Techniques stemming
from the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have recently gained
popularity in maximizing the sum-rate performance in multi-user communication
systems empowered by RISs. Such approaches are commonly based on Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In this paper, we instead investigate the sum-rate
design problem under the scope of the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) setting, which
is a relaxation of the MDP framework. Nevertheless, in many cases, the MAB
formulation is more appropriate to the channel and system models under the
assumptions typically made in the RIS literature. To this end, we propose a
simpler DRL approach for orchestrating multiple metasurfaces in RIS-empowered
multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) systems, which we numerically
show to perform equally well with a state-of-the-art MDP-based approach, while
being less demanding computationally.

  Pathology Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nuclei segmentation is a crucial task for whole slide image analysis in
digital pathology. Generally, the segmentation performance of fully-supervised
learning heavily depends on the amount and quality of the annotated data.
However, it is time-consuming and expensive for professional pathologists to
provide accurate pixel-level ground truth, while it is much easier to get
coarse labels such as point annotations. In this paper, we propose a
weakly-supervised learning method for nuclei segmentation that only requires
point annotations for training. The proposed method achieves label propagation
in a coarse-to-fine manner as follows. First, coarse pixel-level labels are
derived from the point annotations based on the Voronoi diagram and the k-means
clustering method to avoid overfitting. Second, a co-training strategy with an
exponential moving average method is designed to refine the incomplete
supervision of the coarse labels. Third, a self-supervised visual
representation learning method is tailored for nuclei segmentation of pathology
images that transforms the hematoxylin component images into the H\&E stained
images to gain better understanding of the relationship between the nuclei and
cytoplasm. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method using two public
datasets. Both visual and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of
our method to the state-of-the-art methods, and its competitive performance
compared to the fully-supervised methods. The source codes for implementing the
experiments will be released after acceptance.

systems. Most existing works are under the supervision of expensive and
time-consuming full annotations, which require the surgeons to repeat watching
videos to find the precise start and end time for a surgical phase. In this
paper, we introduce timestamp supervision for surgical phase recognition to
train the models with timestamp annotations, where the surgeons are asked to
identify only a single timestamp within the temporal boundary of a phase. This
annotation can significantly reduce the manual annotation cost compared to the
full annotations. To make full use of such timestamp supervisions, we propose a
novel method called uncertainty-aware temporal diffusion (UATD) to generate
trustworthy pseudo labels for training. Our proposed UATD is motivated by the
property of surgical videos, i.e., the phases are long events consisting of
consecutive frames. To be specific, UATD diffuses the single labelled timestamp
to its corresponding high confident ( i.e., low uncertainty) neighbour frames
in an iterative way. Our study uncovers unique insights of surgical phase
recognition with timestamp supervisions: 1) timestamp annotation can reduce 74%
annotation time compared with the full annotation, and surgeons tend to
annotate those timestamps near the middle of phases; 2) extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive results compared with full
supervision methods, while reducing manual annotation cost; 3) less is more in
surgical phase recognition, i.e., less but discriminative pseudo labels
outperform full but containing ambiguous frames; 4) the proposed UATD can be
used as a plug and play method to clean ambiguous labels near boundaries
between phases, and improve the performance of the current surgical phase
recognition methods.

to optimize the source efficiency. Here, we review the physics of HHG with
emphasis on the macroscopic aspects of the nonlinear interaction. We analyze
the influence of medium length, pressure, position of the medium and intensity
of the driving laser on the HHG conversion efficiency (CE), using both
numerical modelling and analytical expressions. We find that efficient
high-order harmonic generation can be realized over a large range of pressures
and medium lengths, if these follow a certain hyperbolic equation. The spatial
and temporal properties of the generated radiation are, however, strongly
dependent on the choice of pressure and medium length. Our results explain the
large versatility in gas target design for efficient HHG and provide design

are transported by advection or through a reaction-diffusion process. Such
systems are especially challenging for model order reduction since the
transport cannot be captured by linear reduction methods. Moreover, topological
changes, such as splitting or merging of fronts pose difficulties for many
nonlinear reduction methods and the small non-vanishing support of the
underlying partial differential equations dynamics makes most nonlinear
hyper-reduction methods infeasible. We propose a new decomposition method
together with a hyper-reduction scheme that addresses these shortcomings. The
decomposition uses a level-set function to parameterize the transport and a
nonlinear activation function that captures the structure of the front. This
approach is similar to autoencoder artificial neural networks, but additionally
provides insights into the system, which can be used for efficient reduced
order models. We make use of this property and are thus able to solve the
advection equation with the same complexity as the POD-Galerkin approach while
obtaining errors of less than one percent for representative examples.
Furthermore, we outline a special hyper-reduction method for more complicated
advection-reaction-diffusion systems. The capability of the approach is
illustrated by various numerical examples in one and two spatial dimensions,

Using Buzzard simulations, we quantify one such systematic, the triaxiality
distribution of clusters identified with the redMaPPer optical cluster finding
algorithm, which was used in the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 (DES Y1) cluster
cosmology analysis. We test whether redMaPPer selection biases the clusters'
shape and orientation and find that it only biases orientation, preferentially
selecting clusters with their major axes oriented along the line of sight.
Modeling the richness-mass relation as a log-linear relation, we find that the
log-richness amplitude $\ln(A)$ is boosted from the lowest to highest
orientation bin with a significance of $14\sigma$, while the orientation
dependence of the richness-mass slope and intrinsic scatter is minimal. We also
find that the weak lensing shear-profile ratios of cluster-associated dark
halos in different orientation bins resemble a ""bottleneck"" shape that can be
quantified with a Cauchy function. We test the correlation of orientation with
two other leading systematics in cluster cosmology -- miscentering and
projection -- and find a null correlation. Analytic templates for the
triaxiality bias of observed-richness and lensing profiles are mapped as
corrections to the observable of richness-binned lensing profiles for redMaPPer
clusters. The resulting mass bias confirms the DES Y1 finding that triaxiality
is a leading source of bias in cluster cosmology. However, the
richness-dependence of the bias confirms that triaxiality does not fully
resolve the tension at low-richness between DES Y1 cluster cosmology and other
probes. Our model can be used for quantifying the impact of triaxiality bias on
cosmological constraints for upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters.

substantially uses peculiarities of characteristic $0$ regime and does not give
a clue on how to prove lower bounds neither for finite fields nor for CNFs.
Aiming at constructing a bridge between lower bounds for the binary value

proving dag-like Res(lin$_{\mathbb{F}_p}$) lower bounds for tautologies of the
form $b\notin A(\{0,1\}^n)$, where $A$ is a linear map. The negation of such a
tautology can be represented in the language of Res(lin$_{\mathbb{F}_p}$) as a

state is constrained by cost-precision (dissipation-fluctuation) tradeoff
relations, delineated by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). However,
coherent quantum electronic nanojunctions can escape such a constraint, showing
finite charge current and nonzero entropic cost with vanishing current
fluctuations. Here, we analyze the absence, and restoration, of cost-precision
tradeoff relations in fermionic nanojunctions under different affinities:
voltage and temperature biases. With analytic work and simulations, we show
that both charge and energy currents can display the absence of cost-precision
tradeoff if we engineer the transmission probability as a boxcar function --
with a perfect transmission and hard energy cutoffs. Specifically for charge
current under voltage bias, the standard TUR may be immediately violated as we
depart from equilibrium, and it is exponentially suppressed with increased
voltage. However, beyond idealized, hard-cutoff energy-filtered transmission
functions, we show that realistic models with soft cutoffs or imperfect
transmission functions follow cost-precision tradeoffs, and eventually recover
the standard TUR sufficiently far from equilibrium. The existence of
cost-precision tradeoff relations is thus suggested as a generic feature of
realistic nonequilibrium quantum transport junctions.

elicit conversational speech input from older adult participants for supporting
assessment of cognitive abilities. As an initial step, this paper presents
research in developing the backchanneling ability in CAs in the form of a
verbal response to engage the speaker. We analyzed 246 conversations of
cognitive assessments between older adults and human assessors, and derived the
categories of reactive backchannels (e.g. ""hmm"") and proactive backchannels
(e.g. ""please keep going""). This is used in the development of TalkTive, a CA

backchanneling feature. Results show that proactive backchanneling is more
appreciated by participants than reactive backchanneling.

two encodings for the candidate solutions, namely the truth table and the
weightwise balanced representations. Somewhat surprisingly, the results show
that GA with the weightwise balanced representation outperforms GP with the
classical truth table phenotype in finding highly nonlinear WPB functions. This
finding is in stark contrast to previous findings on the evolution of globally
balanced Boolean functions, where GP always performs best.

related to the cosmological model through the Alcock-Paczy\'{n}ski parameters

sometimes the parameters do not change significantly and remain close to their

consideration of the linear approximation of the model function around the
initial parameters. In the lazy regime, this linear approximation imitates the
behavior of the parameterized function whose associated kernel, called the
tangent kernel, specifies the training performance of the model. Lazy training
is known to occur in the case of (classical) neural networks with large widths.
In this paper, we show that the training of geometrically local parameterized
quantum circuits enters the lazy regime for large numbers of qubits. More
precisely, we prove bounds on the rate of changes of the parameters of such a
geometrically local parameterized quantum circuit in the training process, and
on the precision of the linear approximation of the associated quantum model
function; both of these bounds tend to zero as the number of qubits grows. We
support our analytic results with numerical simulations.

graph-structured data, have demonstrated remarkable performance on numerous
graph learning tasks. To address the data noise and data scarcity issues in
deep graph learning, the research on graph data augmentation has intensified
lately. However, conventional data augmentation methods can hardly handle
graph-structured data which is defined in non-Euclidean space with
multi-modality. In this survey, we formally formulate the problem of graph data
augmentation and further review the representative techniques and their
applications in different deep graph learning problems. Specifically, we first
propose a taxonomy for graph data augmentation techniques and then provide a
structured review by categorizing the related work based on the augmented
information modalities. Moreover, we summarize the applications of graph data
augmentation in two representative problems in data-centric deep graph
learning: (1) reliable graph learning which focuses on enhancing the utility of
input graph as well as the model capacity via graph data augmentation; and (2)
low-resource graph learning which targets on enlarging the labeled training
data scale through graph data augmentation. For each problem, we also provide a
hierarchical problem taxonomy and review the existing literature related to
graph data augmentation. Finally, we point out promising research directions
and the challenges in future research.

predisposed to breast cancer. It is often challenging because of low contrast
and fluctuations in mammograms' fatty tissue background. Most of the time, the
breast density is estimated manually where a radiologist assigns one of the
four density categories decided by the Breast Imaging and Reporting Data
Systems (BI-RADS). There have been efforts in the direction of automating a
breast density classification pipeline.
  Breast density estimation is one of the key tasks performed during a
screening exam. Dense breasts are more susceptible to breast cancer. The
density estimation is challenging because of low contrast and fluctuations in
mammograms' fatty tissue background. Traditional mammograms are being replaced
by tomosynthesis and its other low radiation dose variants (for example
Hologic' Intelligent 2D and C-View). Because of the low-dose requirement,
increasingly more screening centers are favoring the Intelligent 2D view and
C-View. Deep-learning studies for breast density estimation use only a single
modality for training a neural network. However, doing so restricts the number
of images in the dataset. In this paper, we show that a neural network trained
on all the modalities at once performs better than a neural network trained on
any single modality. We discuss these results using the area under the receiver

gravitational-wave compact binary sources as a cosmological probe. These
standard siren sources provide direct measurements of luminosity distance. In
addition, features in the mass distribution, such as mass gaps or peaks, will
redshift, and thus provide independent constraints on their redshift
distribution. We argue that the entire mass spectrum should be utilized to
provide cosmological constraints. For example, we find that the mass spectrum
of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA events introduces at least five independent mass
``features'': the upper and lower edges of the pair instability supernova
(PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of the neutron star--black hole gap, and
the minimum neutron star mass. We find that although the PISN gap dominates the
cosmological inference with current detectors (2G), as shown in previous work,
it is the lower mass gap that will provide the most powerful constraints in the
era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (3G). By using the full mass
distribution, we demonstrate that degeneracies between mass evolution and
cosmological evolution can be broken, unless an astrophysical conspiracy shifts
all features of the full mass distribution simultaneously following the
(non-trivial) Hubble diagram evolution. We find that this self-calibrating
``spectral siren'' method has the potential to provide precision constraints of
both cosmology and the evolution of the mass distribution, with 2G achieving
better than $10\%$ precision on $H(z)$ at $z\lesssim1$ within a year, and 3G

the differences in the antineutrino yield and spectra resulting from uranium

channels, which relies on double volume-averaging. We show that quasi-developed
macro-scale flow is characterized by velocity modes which decay exponentially
in the main flow direction. We prove that the closure force can be represented
by an exact permeability tensor consisting of two parts. The first part, which
is due to the developed macro-scale flow, is uniform everywhere, except in the
side-wall region, where it is affected by the macro-scale velocity profile and
its slip length. The second part expresses the resistance against the velocity
mode, so it decays exponentially as the flow develops. It satisfies a specific
closure problem on a transversal row of the array. From these properties, we
assess the validity of the classical closure problem for the volume-averaged
flow equations. We show that all its underlying assumptions are partly violated
by an exponentially vanishing error during flow development. Furthermore, we
show that it modifies the eigenvalues, modes, and onset point of
quasi-developed flow, when it is applied to reconstruct the macro-scale flow.
The former theoretical aspects are illustrated for high-aspect-ratio channels
with high-porosity arrays of equidistant in-line square cylinders, by means of
direct numerical simulation and explicit filtering of the flow. In particular,
we present extensive solutions of the classical closure problem for Reynolds
numbers up to 600, porosities between 0.2 and 0.95, and flow directions between

if a program might diverge but otherwise has no side-effects, then whenever it
terminates under call-by-value, it terminates with the same result under

The key ingredient is Levy's call-by-push-value calculus, which we use as a
framework for reasoning about evaluation orders. We show that the call-by-value

related observable behaviour under certain conditions on side-effects, which we
identify. We then use this fact to construct maps between the call-by-value and

side-effects that imply these maps form a Galois connection. These properties
hold for some side-effects (such as divergence), but not others (such as

shape of the Miram curve knee is an important figure of merit for thermionic

previous work on modeling nonuniform thermionic emission revealed that the
space charge effect and patch field effect are key pieces of physics which
impact the shape of the Miram curve knee. This work provides a more complete

their relative impact on the shape of the knee, including the smoothness, the

transformation, coinciding with a quantum Fourier transform circuit in the
simplest case. This allows fast sampling from parametrized distributions using
a single-shot readout. Importantly, simplified latent space training provides
models that are automatically differentiable, and we show how samples from
distributions propagated by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be
accessed by solving stationary and time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations with
a quantum protocol. Finally, our approach opens a route to multidimensional
generative modelling with qubit registers explicitly correlated via a (fixed)
entangling layer. In this case quantum computers can offer advantage as
efficient samplers, which perform complex inverse transform sampling enabled by

inferred from UV/optical photometric observations, and spectral line content
and evolution. We identify transient, double-peaked Bowen (N III), He I, He II
and Halpha emission lines. We model medium resolution optical spectroscopy of
the He II (after careful deblending of the N III contribution) and Halpha lines
during the rise, peak and early decline of the light curve using relativistic,
elliptical accretion disk models. We find that the spectral evolution before
peak can be explained by optical depth effects consistent with an outflowing,
optically thick Eddington envelope. Around peak the envelope reaches its
maximum extent (approximately 10^15 or 3000-6000 gravitational radii for an
inferred black hole mass of 5-10 10^5) and becomes optically thin. The Halpha
and He II emission lines at and after peak can be reproduced with a highly
inclined (i=85+-5 degrees), highly elliptical (e=0.97+-0.01) and relatively
compact (Rin = several 100 Rg and Rout = several 1000 Rg ) accretion disk.
Overall, the line profiles suggest a highly elliptical geometry for the new
accretion flow, consistent with theoretical expectations of newly formed TDE
disks. We quantitatively confirm, for the first time, the high inclination
nature of a Bowen (and X-ray dim) TDE, consistent with the unification picture
of TDEs where the inclination largely determines the observational appearance.
Rapid line profile variations rule out the binary SMBH hypothesis as the origin
of the eccentricity; these results thus provide a direct link between a TDE in
an AGN and the eccentric accretion disk. We illustrate for the first time how
optical spectroscopy can be used to constrain the black hole spin, through (the
lack of) disk precession signatures (changes in inferred inclination) - and
rule out high black hole spin values (a < 0.8).

state and separating DH and DL modes. We report the discovery of flat-topped
broadband noise in the DH state of two of them, with break frequencies of 2.8

variability is similar to that seen in disk-accreting X-ray binaries in the

tMSPs. We find strong variability in the DH state around 1 Hz, not typical of

unknown. Here we investigate the possibility that the obliquities are (or were)

configuration can be ruled out with existing data; any tertiary star that is
sufficiently close or massive to overcome the strong spin-orbit coupling of the

possible that the orbit of DI Herculis was initially wider and the obliquity
was excited during high-eccentricity tidal migration driven by a tertiary
companion, but in this scenario it would be difficult to explain why the
observed spin rates are much faster than the pseudo-synchronous rate. In
addition, inward migration is most likely to arise when the mass of the
perturbing star is comparable to the binary mass, and such a bright tertiary
would have been detected in imaging or spectroscopic data. Alternative
explanations that do not invoke a tertiary star should be sought for the large

existence of two new avatars of Thompson moonshine: a new module giving rise to
weight zero modular functions, and a new module giving rise to forms of weight
one-half. We explain how the newer modules are related to the older ones by
Borcherds products and traces of singular moduli. In so doing we clarify the
relationship between the previously known modules, and expose a new arithmetic
aspect to moonshine for the Thompson group. We also present evidence that this
phenomenon extends to a correspondence between other cases of generalized
monstrous moonshine and penumbral moonshine, and thereby enriches these

However, not only the CKM phase but also the baryon asymmetric Universe
requires sources of CP violation. In this study, we show that a supersymmetric
NB mechanism can naturally accommodate the Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis

with new heavy quarks. Focusing on one of the directions, we find that the
correct baryon asymmetry is obtained with a sufficiently low reheating
temperature which does not cause the gravitino problem. Some parameter space is
consistent with the gravitino dark matter. We assess radiative corrections to
the strong CP phase induced by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking and
CP-violating heavy fields and show that the strong CP problem is solved in a
viable parameter space where the visible sector supersymmetric particles must
be lighter than O(100) TeV. Even in the case that they are heavier than the TeV
scale, our model predicts the neutron electric dipole moment within the reach
of the near future experiments. Our model addresses the electroweak naturalness

the model may give a new compelling paradigm of physics beyond the Standard

Infalling gas forms an accretion disk, and the $\rm SMBH$ launches

considered as two-dimensional conformal correlators of a putative
two-dimensional celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). The simplest way of
converting momentum space amplitudes into CCFT correlators is by taking their
Mellin transforms with respect to light-cone energies. For massless particles,
like gluons, however, such a construction leads to three-point and four-point
correlators that vanish everywhere except for a measure zero hypersurface of
celestial coordinates. This is due to the four-dimensional momentum
conservation law that constrains the insertion points of the operators
associated with massless particles. These correlators are reminiscent of
Coulomb gas correlators that, in the absence of background charges, vanish due
to charge conservation. We supply the background momentum by coupling
Yang-Mills theory to a background dilaton field, with the (complex) dilaton
source localized on the celestial sphere. This picture emerges from the
physical interpretation of the solutions of the system of differential
equations discovered by Banerjee and Ghosh. We show that the solutions can be
written as Mellin transforms of the amplitudes evaluated in such a dilaton
background. The resultant three-gluon and four-gluon amplitudes are
single-valued functions of celestial coordinates enjoying crossing symmetry and
all other properties expected from standard CFT correlators. We use them to
extract OPEs and compare them with the OPEs extracted from multi-gluon
celestial amplitudes without a dilaton background. We perform the conformal
block decomposition of the four-gluon single-valued correlator and determine
the dimensions, spin and group representations of the entire primary field

  abridged. v2: minor improvements",,,,"hep-th gr-qc hep-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum gravity is likely the deepest problem facing current physics. While
traditionally associated with short distance nonrenormalizability, it is
evident that the long distance problem of unitarity, arising at high energies
with black hole formation, is more profound. This reveals a conflict between
foundational principles of quantum field theory: those of quantum mechanics,
relativity, and locality. Difficulties modifying quantum mechanics suggest a
""quantum-first"" approach, with other principles as mathematical properties of a
quantum space of states. A challenge is how to describe locality, in terms of
Hilbert space structure. Perturbative gravity gives clues, with structure
apparently different than in field theory. The mathematical structure of
subsystems plausibly supplants conventional locality and plays a foundational
role in the theory. This view differs from one of spacetime ""emerging"" from
another quantum system. If a black hole behaves as a subsystem, a ""black hole
theorem"" says that unitarity requires interactions with its environment
depending on its state, or more drastic phenomena. Minimal interactions can be
parameterized, in an effective approach; they could arise from wormholes or
other fundamental dynamics. These or other near-horizon modifications
potentially alter electromagnetic or gravitational signatures of this strong
gravity region, now being probed in a new era of observation; it is important
to seek observational clues for or constraints on such scenarios. One may also
investigate quantum gravity via its S-matrix. New perturbative structure has
been discovered there, but the harder question again goes beyond to the
nonperturbative regime. Long-distance behavior of amplitudes indicates novel
analytic behavior; further exploration may provide important clues. Other key
questions regard quantum description of cosmologies, and of associated
observables.

parallelized over pulsar datasets. This Factorized Likelihood (FL) technique
empowers a modular approach to parameter estimation of the GW background,
multi-stage model selection of a spectrally-common stochastic process and
quadrupolar inter-pulsar correlations, and statistical cross-validation of
measured signals between independent pulsar sub-arrays. We demonstrate the
equivalence of this technique's efficacy with the full pulsar-timing array

fields describe the parallel transport of points. In the Hamiltonian model this
is represented by having labels on the plaquettes of the lattice, as well as
the edges. In this paper we summarize our findings in an accessible manner,
with more detailed results and proofs to be presented in the other papers in
the series. The Hamiltonian model supports both point-like and loop-like
excitations, with non-trivial braiding between these excitations. We explicitly
construct operators to produce and move these excitations, and use these to
find the loop-loop and point-loop braiding relations. These creation operators
also reveal that some of the excitations are confined, costing energy to
separate. This is discussed in the context of condensation/confinement
transitions between different cases of this model. We also discuss the
topological charges of the model and use explicit measurement operators to
re-derive a relationship between the number of charges measured by a 2-torus
and the ground-state degeneracy of the model on the 3-torus. From these
measurement operators, we can see that the ground state degeneracy on the
3-torus is related to the number of types of linked loop-like excitations.

score, which is the average mean absolute voxel-by-voxel difference in dose a
model achieved; the deviation in dose-volume histogram (DVH) criterion; and the
frequency of clinical planning criteria satisfaction. We also performed a
theoretical investigation to justify our dose mimicking models. The range in
rank order correlation of the dose score between predictions and their KBP
pipelines was 0.50 to 0.62, which indicates that the quality of the predictions
is generally positively correlated with the quality of the plans. Additionally,
compared to the input predictions, the KBP-generated plans performed
significantly better (P<0.05; one-sided Wilcoxon test) on 18 of 23 DVH

the canonical rectilinear shearing flows including plane Couette, plane and
pipe Poiseuille flows; (ii) viscometric shearing flows with curved streamlines
such as those in the Taylor-Couette, cone-and-plate and parallel-plate

shearing flows. While the underlying focus in all these cases is on results
obtained using the Oldroyd-B model, we also discuss their relation to the
actual instability, and as to how the shortcomings of the Oldroyd-B model may
be overcome by the use of more realistic constitutive models. All the three
commonly used tools of stability analysis, viz., modal linear stability,
nonmodal stability, and weakly nonlinear stability analyses are discussed, with
supporting evidence from experiments and numerical simulations as appropriate.
Despite only accounting for a shear-rate-independent viscosity and first normal
stress coefficient, the Oldroyd-B model is able to qualitatively predict the
majority of instabilities in the aforementioned shearing flows. The review also
highlights, where appropriate, open questions in the area of viscoelastic
stability.

combination of experiments and numerical simulations to examine the wake and
drag characteristics of porous arrays of cylinders, which serve as simplified
models of mangrove root networks. Optimal arrangements of the arrays are
obtained by coupling Navier-Stokes simulations with a multi-objective
optimization algorithm, which seeks configurations that minimize wake enstrophy
and maximize drag acting on the porous structure. These optimal configurations
are investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry, and the internal and
external flow around the porous arrays are analyzed using a combination of
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Lagrangian particle tracking. Large
variations in drag and enstrophy are observed by varying the relative positions
of the cylinders, which indicates that the geometrical arrangement of porous
arrays plays a prominent role in determining wake and drag characteristics. A
sensitivity analysis suggests that enstrophy is more sensitive than drag to
specific cylinder placement, and depends on distinctive flow patterns that
develop in the interior due to interactions among individual cylinders. Arrays
with higher drag are found to have higher average flow speeds in the wake and
give rise to time-varying Lagrangian Coherent Structures, making them
unfavorable for particle deposition and erosion. Overall, the results indicate
that high-level metrics such as array porosity may not be sufficient on their

image database by an explicit and intuitive demonstration of integrating
conceptional differential privacy with images. To this end, we design a
lightweight approach dedicating to privatizing image database as a whole and
preserving the statistical semantics of the image database to an adjustable
level, while making individual images' contribution to such statistics
indistinguishable. The designed approach leverages principle component analysis
(PCA) to reduce the raw image with large amount of attributes to a lower
dimensional space whereby DP is performed, so as to decrease the DP load of
calculating sensitivity attribute-by-attribute. The DP-exerted image data,
which is not visible in its privatized format, is visualized through PCA
inverse such that both a human and machine inspector can evaluate the
privatization and quantify the privacy-accuracy trade-off in an analysis on the
privatized image database. Using the devised approach, we demonstrate the
contextualization of DP in images by two use cases based on deep learning
models, where we show the indistinguishability of individual images induced by
DP and the privatized images' retention of statistical semantics in deep
learning tasks, which is elaborated by quantitative analyses on the
privacy-accuracy trade-off under different privatization settings.

evolution and the collision rate of the unseen planetesimals. Thanks to the
ever-increasing angular resolution of contemporary instruments and facilities,
we are beginning to constrain the scale height of a handful of debris disks,
either at near-infrared or millimeter wavelengths. Nonetheless, this is often
done for individual targets only. We present here the geometric modeling of
eight disks close to edge-on, all observed with the same instrument (SPHERE)
and using the same mode (dual-beam polarimetric imaging). Motivated by the
presence of CO gas in two out of the eight disks, we then investigate the
impact that gas can have on the scale height by performing N-body simulations
including gas drag and collisions. We show that gas can quickly alter the
dynamics of particles (both in the radial and vertical directions), otherwise
governed by gravity and radiation pressure. We find that, in the presence of
gas, particles smaller than a few tens of microns can efficiently settle toward
the midplane at the same time as they migrate outward beyond the birth ring.
For second generation gas ($M_\mathrm{gas} \leq 0.1$ $M_\oplus$), the vertical
settling should be best observed in scattered light images compared to
observations at millimeter wavelengths. But if the gas has a primordial origin
($M_\mathrm{gas} \geq 1$ $M_\oplus$), the disk will appear very flat both at
near-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. Finally, far beyond the birth ring, our
results suggest that the surface brightness profile can be as shallow as $\sim
-2.25$.

spurious relations, self-loops, and back-jumps. This is due to the fact that
event sequence as described in classical event logs differs from event
causation. In this paper, we address the research problem of representing the
causal structure of process-related event data. To this end, we develop a new
approach called Causal Process Mining. This approach renounces the use of flat
event logs and considers relational databases of event data as an input. More
specifically, we transform the relational data structures based on the Causal
Process Template into what we call Causal Event Graph. We evaluate our approach

a case study with an European food production company. Our results demonstrate
that directly-follows miners produce a large number of spurious relationships,

Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to draw posterior inferences about the
population survival effects of multiple treatments and examine the variability
in cluster-level effects. We further propose an interpretable sensitivity
analysis approach to evaluate the sensitivity of drawn causal inferences about
treatment effect to the potential magnitude of departure from the causal
assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Expansive simulations empirically
validate and demonstrate good practical operating characteristics of our
proposed methods. Applying the proposed methods to a dataset on older high-risk

of finite radius on the stability of a two-dimensional Rankine vortex in
semi-dilute dusty flows. Unlike the particle-free case where no unstable modes
exist, we show that the feedback force from the particles triggers a novel
instability. The mechanisms driving the instability are characterized using
linear stability analysis for weakly inertial particles and further validated
against Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations. We show that the particle-laden vortex
is always unstable if the mass loading $M>0$. Surprisingly, even non-inertial
particles destabilize the vortex by a mechanism analogous to the centrifugal
Rayleigh-Taylor instability in radially stratified vortex with density jump. We
identify a critical mass loading above which an eigenmode $m$ becomes unstable.
This critical mass loading drops to zero as m increases. When particles are
inertial, modes that fall below the critical mass loading become unstable,
whereas, modes above it remain unstable but with lower growth rates compared to
the non-inertial case. Comparison with Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations shows
that growth rates computed from simulations match well the theoretical
predictions. Past the linear stage, we observe the emergence of high-wavenumber
modes that turn into spiraling arms of concentrated particles emanating out of
the core, while regions of particle-free flow are sucked inward. The vorticity
field displays similar pattern which lead to the breakdown of the initial
Rankine structure. This novel instability for a dusty vortex highlights how the
feedback force from the disperse phase can induce the breakdown of an otherwise
resilient vortical structure.

driving scale is known as the turbulent dynamo. The ISM is a multiphase medium
and observations suggest that the properties of magnetic fields differ with the
phase. Here, we aim to study how the properties of the turbulent dynamo depend
on the phase. We simulate the non-isothermal turbulent dynamo in a two-phase
medium (most previous work assumes an isothermal gas). We show that the warm

is supersonic. We find that the growth rate of magnetic fields in the
exponentially growing stage is similar in both phases. We compute the terms
responsible for amplification and destruction of vorticity and show that in
both phases vorticity is amplified due to turbulent motions, further amplified
by the baroclinic term in the warm phase, and destroyed by the term for viscous
interactions in the presence of logarithmic density gradients in the cold
phase. We find that the final ratio of magnetic to turbulent kinetic energy is
lower in the cold phase due to a stronger Lorentz force. We show that the

results are the linear-time tractability of Horn formulas (Aspvall, Plass, and

Backdoors, introduced by Williams Gomes and Selman (2003), gradually extend
such a tractable class to all formulas of bounded distance to the class.
Backdoor size provides a natural but rather crude distance measure between a
formula and a tractable class. Backdoor depth, introduced by M\""{a}hlmann,
Siebertz, and Vigny (2021), is a more refined distance measure, which admits
the utilization of different backdoor variables in parallel. Bounded backdoor
size implies bounded backdoor depth, but there are formulas of constant

promising way of leveraging unlabeled data. Currently, most methods are based
on contrastive learning adapted from the image domain, which requires view
generation and a sufficient number of negative samples. In contrast, existing
predictive models do not require negative sampling, but lack theoretical
guidance on the design of pretext training tasks. In this work, we propose the
LaGraph, a theoretically grounded predictive SSL framework based on latent
graph prediction. Learning objectives of LaGraph are derived as self-supervised
upper bounds to objectives for predicting unobserved latent graphs. In addition
to its improved performance, LaGraph provides explanations for recent successes
of predictive models that include invariance-based objectives. We provide
theoretical analysis comparing LaGraph to related methods in different domains.
Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of LaGraph in performance
and the robustness to decreasing of training sample size on both graph-level

  originality)",,,,"math.AC math.FA math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine several classical concepts from topology and functional analysis,
using methods of commutative algebra. We show that these various concepts are
all controlled by BC R-rings and their maximal spectra.
  A BC R-ring is a ring A that is isomorphic to the ring of bounded continuous
R-valued functions on some compact topological space X. These rings are not
topologized.
  We prove that the category of BC R-rings is dual to the category of compact
topological spaces. Next we prove that for every topological space X the ring
of bounded continuous functions on it is a BC R-ring. These theorems combined
yield an algebraic construction of the Stone-Cech Compactification of an
arbitrary topological space.
  There is a similar notion of BC C-ring. Every BC C-ring A has a canonical
involution. The canonical hermitian subring of A is a BC R-ring, and this is an
equivalence of categories from BC C-rings to BC R-rings.
  Let K be either R or C. We prove that a BC K-ring A has a canonical norm on
it, making it into a Banach K-ring. We then prove that the forgetful functor is
an equivalence from Banach^* K-rings (better known as commutative unital C^*
K-algebras) to BC K-rings. The quasi-inverse of the forgetful functor endows a
BC K-ring with its canonical norm, and the canonical involution when K = C.
  Stone topological spaces, also known as profinite topological spaces, are
traditionally related to boolean rings - this is Stone Duality. We give a BC
ring characterization of Stone spaces. From that we obtain a very easy proof of
the fact that the Stone-Cech Compactification of a discrete space is a Stone
space.
  Most of the results in this paper are not new. However, most of our proofs
seem to be new - and our methods could potentially lead to genuine progress
related to these classical topics.

High-fecundity marine populations are characterized by low ratios of effective

from very few parents dominate the population (whereby multiple mergers, or
subsets of lineages with star-like trees, arise) and thus, the loss of genetic
diversity is significant. Under high reproductive-variance conditions (assuming
that reproduction occurs by sampling from the Pareto distribution), this paper
explores the distribution of heterozygosity across generations. The result
shows that zero heterozygosity is not achieved, implying that the populations
may decline without evident loss of genetic variation. It is also found that
there are singularities in the heterozygosity distributions. However, in the

hidden variables exist, they must be contextual and non local. But they can
also be explained questioning the probability space employed, or the validity
of the Kolmogorov axioms. In this article we explore the additional constrains
which can be deduced from two widely used objetive probability theories:
frequentism and propensities.
  One of the strongest objections in the deduction of one version of Bell
inequalities goes about the probability space, which assumes the existence of
values for the output of the experiment in each run, while only two of the four
values can be measured each time, making them counterfactual. It is shown that
frequentism rejects the possibility of using counterfactual situations, while
long-run propensities allow their use. In this case the introduction of
locality and contextuality does not help to explain the violation, and an
alternative explanation could point to a failure of the probability.
  Single case propensities were designed to associate probabilities to single
events, but they need to be conditional to the whole universe, and do not have
a clear link with the observed relative frequencies. It heavily limits their
use.

problems were studied considering many types of rearrangements (such as
reversals, transpositions, transreversals, and revrevs) and considering the

address a cost function related to the number of fragmentations caused by a
rearrangement, proving that the problem of finding a minimum cost sorting

  Towards Greater Accessibility of Clinical and Healthcare Decision Models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Increasingly, decision-making in healthcare relies on computer
models, be it clinical prediction models at point of care or decision-analytic
models at the policymaking level. Given the important role models play in both
contexts, their structure and implementation be rigorously scrutinized. The
ability to interrogate input/output associations without facing barriers can
improve quality assurance mechanisms while satisfying privacy/confidentiality
concerns and facilitating the integration of models into decision-making. This
paper reports on the development of Programmable Interface for Statistical &
Simulation Models (PRISM), a cloud-based platform for model accessibility.
Methods: PRISM emphasizes two main principles: 1) minimal specifications on the
side of model developer to make the model fit for cloud hosting, and 2) making
client access completely independent of the resource requirement and software
dependencies of the model. The server architecture integrates a RESTful
Application Programming Interface (API) infrastructure, JSON for data transfer,
a routing layer for access management, container technology for management of
computer resources and package dependencies, and the capacity for synchronous
or asynchronous model calls. Results: We discuss the architecture, the minimal
API standards that enable a universal language for access to such models, the
underlying server infrastructure, and the standards used for data transfer. An
instance of PRISM is available as a service via the Peer Models Network
http://peermodelsnetwork.com. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate
how interrogating models becomes possible in standardized fashion, in a way
that is irrespective of the specifics of any model. Conclusions: We have
developed a publicly accessible platform and minimalist standards that
facilitate model accessibility for both clinical and policy models.

apply the Watts-Strogatz rewiring technique to introduce long range random
connections in the load transmission network and analyze how the ultimate
strength of the bundle and the statistics of the size of failure cascades
change when the rewiring probability is gradually increased. Our calculations
revealed that the degree of strength disorder of nodes of the network has a
substantial effect on the localized to mean field transition. In particular, we
show that the transition sets on at a finite value of the rewiring probability,
which shifts to higher values as the degree of disorder is reduced. The
transition is limited to a well defined range of disorder, so that there exists
a threshold disorder of nodes' strength below which the randomization of the
network structure does not provide any improvement neither of the overall load
bearing capacity nor of the cascade tolerance of the system. At low strength
disorder the fully random network is the most stable one, while at high
disorder best cascade tolerance is obtained at a lower structural randomness.
Based on the interplay of the network structure and strength disorder we
construct an analytical argument which provides a reasonable description of the
numerical findings.

suddenly erupts due to catastrophe, which also drives a fast shock above the

chromospheric matter squeezed into it. The plasmoid instability occurs and
multiple magnetic islands appear in the CS once the Lundquist number reaches

discussed its central role in causal inference with observational studies.
Their paper, however, caused a fundamental incoherence with an early paper by
\citet{Rubin78}, which showed that the propensity score does not play any role
in the Bayesian analysis of unconfounded observational studies if the priors on
the propensity score and outcome models are independent. Despite the serious
efforts made in the literature, it is generally difficult to reconcile these
contradicting results. We offer a simple approach to incorporating the
propensity score in Bayesian causal inference based on the posterior predictive
$p$-value. To motivate a simple procedure, we focus on the model with the
strong null hypothesis of no causal effects for any units whatsoever.
Computationally, the proposed posterior predictive $p$-value equals the classic
$p$-value based on the Fisher randomization test averaged over the posterior
predictive distribution of the propensity score. Moreover, using the
studentized doubly robust estimator as the test statistic, the proposed
$p$-value inherits the doubly robust property and is also asymptotically valid
for testing the weak null hypothesis of zero average causal effect. Perhaps
surprisingly, this Bayesianly motivated $p$-value can have better frequentist's
finite-sample performance than the frequentist's $p$-value based on the
asymptotic approximation especially when the propensity scores can take extreme
values.

models to small, carefully constructed longitudinal survey datasets. Although
modern machine learning methods offer promise for such problems, these survey
datasets are too small to take advantage of them. In recent years large
datasets of online resumes have also become available, providing data about the
career trajectories of millions of individuals. However, standard econometric
models cannot take advantage of their scale or incorporate them into the
analysis of survey data. To this end we develop CAREER, a transformer-based
model that uses transfer learning to learn representations of job sequences.
CAREER is first fit to large, passively-collected resume data and then
fine-tuned to smaller, better-curated datasets for economic inferences. We fit
CAREER to a dataset of 24 million job sequences from resumes, and fine-tune its
representations on longitudinal survey datasets. We find that CAREER forms
accurate predictions of job sequences on three widely-used economics datasets.
We further find that CAREER can be used to form good predictions of other

builds a combinatorial representation representing the underlying system's

forward propagating short trajectories over a state-space discretization, which
needs to be a Lipschitz-continuous function. The framework is evaluated given
either numerical or data-driven controllers for classical robotic benchmarks.
It is compared against established analytical and recent machine learning
alternatives for estimating the RoAs of such controllers. It is shown to
outperform them in accuracy and efficiency. It also provides deeper insights as
it describes the global dynamics up to the discretization's resolution. This
allows to use the Morse graph to identify how to synthesize controllers to form

exploration studying this phenomenon. Our motivation is to study the upper
limits of this research program: How far will understanding Neural Collapse
take us in understanding deep learning? First, we investigate its role in
generalization. We refine the Neural Collapse conjecture into two separate
conjectures: collapse on the train set (an optimization property) and collapse
on the test distribution (a generalization property). We find that while Neural
Collapse often occurs on the train set, it does not occur on the test set. We
thus conclude that Neural Collapse is primarily an optimization phenomenon,
with as-yet-unclear connections to generalization. Second, we investigate the
role of Neural Collapse in feature learning. We show simple, realistic
experiments where training longer leads to worse last-layer features, as
measured by transfer-performance on a downstream task. This suggests that
neural collapse is not always desirable for representation learning, as
previously claimed. Finally, we give preliminary evidence of a ""cascading
collapse"" phenomenon, wherein some form of Neural Collapse occurs not only for
the last layer, but in earlier layers as well. We hope our work encourages the
community to continue the rich line of Neural Collapse research, while also
considering its inherent limitations.

composition, population bottlenecks are considered highly important for
evolution. However, despite such significance, the mechanisms governing the
impact of a given population bottleneck remain poorly understood. In this
context, we show that long-term post-bottleneck outcomes can depend crucially
on the rate at which a diminished population grows whilst recovering. That is,
two otherwise identical populations, each having undergone the same bottleneck,
can fixate on dramatically different demographics due to different rates of
post-bottleneck growth. This behaviour is moreover shown to change
non-trivially with different levels of mutation. The underlying mechanism can
be traced to intrinsic fluctuations whose standard deviation decreases in time
with the inverse square root of the growing population size. Crucially, such
decreasing fluctuations couple to the underlying dynamics and result in
distinct regimes of (non-equilibrium) demographic behaviour, delimited by
abrupt transitions at critical population sizes. Seen through this lens, growth
and mutation alter evolutionary outcomes by changing the duration and character

have demonstrated great potential for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration
thanks to their high energy efficiency. However, these emerging devices can
suffer from significant variations during the mapping process i.e., programming
weights to the devices), and if left undealt with, can cause significant
accuracy degradation. The non-ideality of weight mapping can be compensated by
iterative programming with a write-verify scheme, i.e., reading the conductance
and rewriting if necessary. In all existing works, such a practice is applied
to every single weight of a DNN as it is being mapped, which requires extensive
programming time. In this work, we show that it is only necessary to select a
small portion of the weights for write-verify to maintain the DNN accuracy,
thus achieving significant speedup. We further introduce a second derivative
based technique SWIM, which only requires a single pass of forward and
backpropagation, to efficiently select the weights that need write-verify.
Experimental results on various DNN architectures for different datasets show
that SWIM can achieve up to 10x programming speedup compared with conventional
full-blown write-verify while attaining a comparable accuracy.

atmosphere rotates many times faster than the surface does. Another
characteristics of Titan's atmosphere is the presence of thick haze layer. In
this paper, we performed numerical experiments using a General Circulation
Model (GCM), to explore the effects of the haze layer on the stratospheric
superrotation. We employed a semi-gray radiation model of Titan's atmosphere
following McKay et al. (1999), which takes account of the sunlight absorption
by haze particles. The phase change of methane or the seasonal changes were not
taken into account. Our model with the radiation parameters tuned for Titan
yielded the global eastward wind around the equator with larger velocities at
higher altitudes except at around 70 km after $10^5$ Earth days. Although the
atmosphere is not in an equilibrium state, the zonal wind profiles is
approximately consistent with the observed one. Analysis on our experiments
suggests that the quasi-stationary stratospheric superrotation is maintained by
the balance between the meridional circulation decoupled from the surface, and
the eddies that transport angular momentum equatorward. This is different from,
but similar to, the so-called Gierasch mechanism, in which momentum is supplied
from the surface. This structure may explain the no-wind region at about $80$
km in altitude.

continuous function. We train GP models to map five fundamental inputs (mass,
equivalent evolutionary phase, initial metallicity, initial helium fraction,
and the mixing-length parameter) to observable outputs (effective temperature,
surface gravity, radius, surface metallicity, and stellar age). We test the GP
predictions for the five outputs using off-grid stellar models and find no
obvious systematic offsets, indicating good accuracy in predictions.As a
further validation, we apply these GP models to characterise 1,000 fake stars.
Inferred masses and ages determined with GP models well recover true values
within one standard deviation. An important consequence of using GP-based
interpolation is that stellar ages are more precise than those estimated with
the original sparse grid because of the full sampling of fundamental inputs.

new spatiotemporal motion planning algorithm that efficiently solves a

quadratic regulator (iLQR), which takes into account the uncertain driving
behaviors of the traffic vehicles and minimizes the collision risks between the
self-driving vehicle (referred to as the ""ego"" vehicle) and the traffic
vehicles such that the ego vehicle is able to maintain sufficiently large
distances to all the surrounding vehicles for achieving the desired collision
avoidance maneuver in traffic. To this end, we introduce the concept of the
""collision polygon"" for computing the minimum distances between the ego vehicle
and the traffic vehicles, and provide two different solutions for designing the
constraints of the motion planning problem by properly modeling the behaviors
of the traffic vehicles in order to evaluate the collision risk. Finally, the
iLQR motion planning algorithm is validated in multiple real-time tasks for
collision avoidance using both a simulator and a level-3 autonomous driving

robotic manipulation tasks. Current methods focus on developing the feedback
control around a single modality while underrating the synergy of the sensors.
Fusing different sensor modalities is necessary but remains challenging. A key
challenge is to achieve an effective multi-modal and generalized control scheme
to novel objects with precision. This paper proposes a practical multi-modal
sensor fusion mechanism using hierarchical policy learning. To begin with, we
use a self-supervised encoder that extracts multi-view visual features and a
hybrid motion/force controller that regulates force behaviors. Next, the
multi-modality fusion is simplified by hierarchical integration of the vision,
force, and proprioceptive data in the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.
Moreover, with hierarchical policy learning, the control scheme can exploit the
visual feedback limits and explore the contribution of individual modality in
precise tasks. Experiments indicate that robots with the control scheme could
assemble objects with 0.25mm clearance in simulation. The system could be
generalized to widely varied initial configurations and new shapes. Experiments
validate that the simulated system can be robustly transferred to reality

and may lead to a better health care for patients. AutoScore is a machine
learning-based automatic clinical score generator for binary outcomes. This
study aims to expand the AutoScore framework to provide a tool for
interpretable risk prediction for ordinal outcomes. Methods: The
AutoScore-Ordinal framework is generated using the same 6 modules of the
original AutoScore algorithm including variable ranking, variable
transformation, score derivation (from proportional odds models), model
selection, score fine-tuning, and model evaluation. To illustrate the
AutoScore-Ordinal performance, the method was conducted on electronic health
records data from the emergency department at Singapore General Hospital over
2008 to 2017. The model was trained on 70% of the data, validated on 10% and
tested on the remaining 20%. Results: This study included 445,989 inpatient
cases, where the distribution of the ordinal outcome was 80.7% alive without
30-day readmission, 12.5% alive with 30-day readmission, and 6.8% died
inpatient or by day 30 post discharge. Two point-based risk prediction models
were developed using two sets of 8 predictor variables identified by the
flexible variable selection procedure. The two models indicated reasonably good
performance measured by mean area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (0.785 and 0.793) and generalized c-index (0.737 and 0.760), which were
comparable to alternative models. Conclusion: AutoScore-Ordinal provides an
automated and easy-to-use framework for development and validation of risk
prediction models for ordinal outcomes, which can systematically identify
potential predictors from high-dimensional data.

mathematical economics to solvability axioms in mathematical psychology, and
ranks them under alternative supplementary assumptions. Theorem 1 connects
notions of continuity (full, separate, Wold, weak Wold, Archimedean, mixture)
with those of solvability (restricted, unrestricted) under the completeness and
transitivity of a binary relation. Theorem 2 uses the primitive notion of a
separately-continuous function to answer the question when an analogous
property on a relation is fully continuous. Theorem 3 provides a portmanteau
theorem on the equivalence between restricted solvability and various notions
of continuity under weak monotonicity. Finally, Theorem 4 presents a variant of
Theorem 3 that follows Theorem 1 in dispensing with the dimensionality
requirement and in providing partial equivalences between solvability and
continuity notions. These theorems are motivated for their potential use in
representation theorems.

single-peaked HI profiles, as well as a greater tendency for the HI central
velocity to deviate from the systemic optical velocity of the galaxy. By

effective, this approach has several disadvantages: (1) it is computationally
expensive, (2) it can take many updates to integrate experiences into the

appropriately influence the agent's behavior, and (4) behavior is limited by
the capacity of the model. In this paper we explore an alternative paradigm in
which we train a network to map a dataset of past experiences to optimal
behavior. Specifically, we augment an RL agent with a retrieval process
(parameterized as a neural network) that has direct access to a dataset of
experiences. This dataset can come from the agent's past experiences, expert
demonstrations, or any other relevant source. The retrieval process is trained
to retrieve information from the dataset that may be useful in the current
context, to help the agent achieve its goal faster and more efficiently. he
proposed method facilitates learning agents that at test-time can condition
their behavior on the entire dataset and not only the current state, or current

DQN agent and an online R2D2 agent. In offline multi-task problems, we show
that the retrieval-augmented DQN agent avoids task interference and learns
faster than the baseline DQN agent. On Atari, we show that retrieval-augmented
R2D2 learns significantly faster than the baseline R2D2 agent and achieves
higher scores. We run extensive ablations to measure the contributions of the

time-correlated sparsification with hybrid aggregation (TCS-H) for

its own important parameters, which are aggregated via digital communication
with orthogonal multiple access. We further design device scheduling and power
allocation algorithms for TCS-H. Experiment results show that, under limited

compared to the conventional top-K sparsification with orthogonal model

PTRS and destroys the topological phase. Nevertheless, it respects a magnetic
two-fold rotational symmetry which protects a second-order topological phase
with corner modes in bilayer and hinge modes along stacking direction.
Moreover, an introduced staggered interlayer coupling establishes a
Z$_{2}$$\times$Z topology, giving rise to gapped topological surface modes
carrying non-zero Chern numbers. Consequently, chiral hinge modes propagate
along the horizontal hinges in a cuboid geometry and are robust against
disorders. Our work bridges the higher-order topology and magnons in van der

However, the origins of the magnetic phase separation and spin glass state
below $T_{C}$ in this ordered compound are two unresolved yet important puzzles
in understanding its magnetism. Here, we report the discovery of local symmetry
breaking surprisingly co-emerges with the onset of ferromagnetic order in
Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$, by a combined use of neutron total scattering and half
polarized neutron diffraction. The mismatch of local and average symmetries
occurs below $T_{C}$, indicating that Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$ evolves to an
intrinsically lattice disordered system when the ferromagnetic order is
established. The local symmetry breaking with intrinsic lattice disorder
provides new understandings to the puzzling magnetic properties. Our density
function theory calculation indicates that the local symmetry breaking is
expected to reorient local ferromagnetic moments, unveiling the existence of
the ferromagnetic instability associated with the lattice instability.
Furthermore, DFT calculation unveils that the local symmetry breaking could
affect the Weyl property by breaking mirror plane. Our findings highlight the
fundamentally important role that the local symmetry breaking plays in
advancing our understanding on the magnetic and topological properties in

These tools, due to containerization, do improve sharing of results. However,
they do not improve the efficiency of replay. In this paper, we present the
multiversion replay problem which arises when multiple versions of an
application are containerized, and each version must be replayed to repeat
results. To avoid executing each version separately, we develop CHEX, which
checkpoints program state and determines when it is permissible to reuse
program state across versions. It does so using system call-based execution
lineage. Our capability to identify common computations across versions enables
us to consider optimizing replay using an in-memory cache, based on a
checkpoint-restore-switch system. We show the multiversion replay problem is
NP-hard, and propose efficient heuristics for it. CHEX reduces overall replay
time by sharing common computations but avoids storing a large number of
checkpoints. We demonstrate that CHEX maintains lightweight package sharing,

doing so examine to what degree the decrease in correlation with initial
conditions may be contaminated by velocity-based nonlinearities. With a
thorough analysis of the monopole-quadrupole ratio, we find the best-fit value
for the Eulerian velocity dispersion, $\sigma_p = 378.3$ km/s. The covariance
of the cosmological linear growth rate $f$, is estimated in the Eulerian and
Lagrangian cases. Comparing Lagrangian and Eulerian, we find that the error in
$f$ improves by a factor of 3, without the need for nonlinear velocity
dispersion modelling.

an end-to-end framework called PENCIL, which can update both network parameters

backbone network structure and does not need an auxiliary clean dataset or
prior information about noise, thus it is more general and robust than existing
methods and is easy to apply. PENCIL can even be used repeatedly to obtain
better performance. PENCIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by
large margins on both synthetic and real-world datasets with different noise

propose a fusion penalized logistic threshold regression (FILTER) model, where
a fused lasso penalty is employed to control the total variation and shrink the

modeling graph-structured data. Till now, a great variety of Transformers has
been proposed to adapt to the graph-structured data. However, a comprehensive
literature review and systematical evaluation of these Transformer variants for
graphs are still unavailable. It's imperative to sort out the existing
Transformer models for graphs and systematically investigate their
effectiveness on various graph tasks. In this survey, we provide a
comprehensive review of various Graph Transformer models from the architectural
design perspective. We first disassemble the existing models and conclude three
typical ways to incorporate the graph information into the vanilla Transformer:
1) GNNs as Auxiliary Modules, 2) Improved Positional Embedding from Graphs, and
3) Improved Attention Matrix from Graphs. Furthermore, we implement the
representative components in three groups and conduct a comprehensive
comparison on various kinds of famous graph data benchmarks to investigate the
real performance gain of each component. Our experiments confirm the benefits
of current graph-specific modules on Transformer and reveal their advantages on
different kinds of graph tasks.

under some mild linear independence assumptions. Aided with the resulting
explicit formulae of the underlying normal cone, the so-called F-stationary

prove that, with this extra insight, the utility of the insightful pool could

game has a pure Nash equilibrium; (b) honest mining is a Nash equilibrium if
the largest mining pool has a fraction of mining power no more than 1/3; (c)

  Couette-Poiseuille flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Here we report some interesting new features of the spatio-temporal
instability of the incompressible plane Couette-Poiseuille flow (CPF). First of
all, this flow represents the first instance of a ""non-inflectional"" absolute
instability, within constant-viscosity formulation, which is triggered when one
of the plates moves opposite to the bulk motion. More strikingly, with further
increase in the negative plate motion, the absolute instability ($\textrm{AI}$)
transitions to an ""upstream"" convective instability ($\textrm{CI}^-$), wherein
an unstable wave packet moves opposite to the direction of the bulk flow. Thus,
the CPF exhibits a unique $\textrm{CI}^+ \to \textrm{AI} \to \textrm{CI}^-$
transition, for a given Reynolds number ($Re$), where $\textrm{CI}^+$ denotes
the commonly-observed case of a ""downstream"" convective instability. This type
of transition has not been reported for other known examples of absolutely
unstable flows. We compute the leading and trailing edge velocities for an
amplifying wave packet and find that, for the plane Poiseuille flow, both these
velocities approach zero as $Re \to \infty$. As a result, at high $Re$, even
the slightest of negative plate motions is sufficient to trigger $\textrm{AI}$
and subsequently $\textrm{CI}^-$, as observed for the CPF. The wave-packet
dispersion first increases with $Re$, followed by a decrease, which points to a
peculiar ""dual"" role of viscosity in sustaining $\textrm{AI}$ in the CPF,
namely, viscosity promotes sustenance of $\textrm{AI}$ at moderate Reynolds
numbers but suppresses it at low and high Reynolds numbers. These results can
be well understood within the Ginzburg-Landau framework, and therefore can be
expected to have a wider applicability.

Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As
data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some
companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts
of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive
ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense
harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused
by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive
Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of
Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own
encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file
encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive
ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker's RSA
private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware.
It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive

for learning generalizable node representations in a self-supervised manner. In
general, the contrastive learning process in GCL is performed on top of the
representations learned by a graph neural network (GNN) backbone, which
transforms and propagates the node contextual information based on its local
neighborhoods. However, nodes sharing similar characteristics may not always be
geographically close, which poses a great challenge for unsupervised GCL
efforts due to their inherent limitations in capturing such global graph
knowledge. In this work, we address their inherent limitations by proposing a
simple yet effective framework -- Simple Neural Networks with Structural and
Semantic Contrastive Learning} (S^3-CL). Notably, by virtue of the proposed
structural and semantic contrastive learning algorithms, even a simple neural
network can learn expressive node representations that preserve valuable global
structural and semantic patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the node
representations learned by S^3-CL achieve superior performance on different
downstream tasks compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised GCL methods.

interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, uniaxial

antiskyrmions and these magnetic interactions remains to be elucidated. In this
work, we control the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)$_3$P

particular, doping with Pd induces easy-axis anisotropy, giving rise to
formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature-induced spin reorientation is
observed in a Rh-doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we quantitatively analyze
the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and
demagnetization energy, and demonstrate that subtle balance between them is
necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

expensive to construct a globally accurate surrogate model for Bayesian
inference in a high-dimensional design space, which limits uncertainty
quantification for complex flow configurations. Borrowing ideas from stratified
sampling and inherited sampling, an adaptive model refinement approach is
proposed in this work, which concentrates on asymptotically improving the local
accuracy of the surrogate model in the high-posterior-density region by
adaptively appending model evaluation points. To achieve this goal, a
modification of inherited Latin hypercube sampling is proposed and then
integrated into the Bayesian framework. The effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed approach are demonstrated through a two-dimensional heat source
inversion problem and its extension to a high-dimensional design space.
Compared with the prior-based method, the adaptive model refinement approach
has the ability to obtain more reliable inference results using fewer
evaluation points. Finally, the approach is applied to parametric uncertainty
quantification of the Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model for an
axisymmetric transonic bump flow and provides convincing numerical results.

  Bevameter",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robot mobility is critical for mission success, especially in soft or
deformable terrains, where the complex wheel-soil interaction mechanics often
leads to excessive wheel slip and sinkage, causing the eventual mission
failure. To improve the success rate, online mobility prediction using vision,
infrared imaging, or model-based stochastic methods have been used in the
literature. This paper proposes an on-board mobility prediction approach using
an articulated wheeled bevameter that consists of a force-controlled arm and an
instrumented bevameter (with force and vision sensors) as its end-effector. The
proposed bevameter, which emulates the traditional terramechanics tests such as
pressure-sinkage and shear experiments, can measure contact parameters ahead of
the rover's body in real-time, and predict the slip and sinkage of supporting
wheels over the probed region. Based on the predicted mobility, the rover can
select a safer path in order to avoid dangerous regions such as those covered
with quicksand. Compared to the literature, our proposed method can avoid the
complicated terramechanics modeling and time-consuming stochastic prediction;
it can also mitigate the inaccuracy issues arising in non-contact vision-based
methods. We also conduct multiple experiments to validate the proposed
approach.

several times in the same individual. For example, medical researchers are
interested in treatment effects on hospitalizations in heart failure patients
and sports injuries in athletes. Competing events, such as death, complicate
causal inference in studies of recurrent events because once a competing event
occurs, an individual cannot have more recurrent events. Several statistical
estimands have been studied in recurrent event settings, with and without
competing events. However, the causal interpretations of these estimands, and
the conditions that are required to identify these estimands from observed
data, have yet to be formalized. Here we use a counterfactual framework for
causal inference to formulate several causal estimands in recurrent event
settings, with and without competing events. When competing events exist, we
clarify when commonly used classical statistical estimands can be interpreted
as causal quantities from the causal mediation literature, such as (controlled)
direct effects and total effects. Furthermore, we show that recent results on
interventionist mediation estimands allow us to define new causal estimands
with recurrent and competing events that may be of particular clinical
relevance in many subject matter settings. We use causal directed acyclic
graphs and single world intervention graphs to illustrate how to reason about
identification conditions for the various causal estimands using subject matter
knowledge. Furthermore, using results on counting processes, we show how our
causal estimands and their identification conditions, which are articulated in
discrete time, converge to classical continuous-time counterparts in the limit
of fine discretizations of time. Finally, we propose several estimators and
establish their consistency for the various identifying functionals.

time-consuming and laborious to collect sufficient high-quality labeled data in
most practical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an
effective solution to reduce the cost of labeling by simultaneously leveraging
both labeled and unlabeled data. In this work, we present Cross Labeling
Supervision (CLS), a framework that generalizes the typical pseudo-labeling
process. Based on FixMatch, where a pseudo label is generated from a
weakly-augmented sample to teach the prediction on a strong augmentation of the
same input sample, CLS allows the creation of both pseudo and complementary
labels to support both positive and negative learning. To mitigate the
confirmation bias of self-labeling and boost the tolerance to false labels, two
different initialized networks with the same structure are trained
simultaneously. Each network utilizes high-confidence labels from the other
network as additional supervision signals. During the label generation phase,
adaptive sample weights are assigned to artificial labels according to their
prediction confidence. The sample weight plays two roles: quantify the
generated labels' quality and reduce the disruption of inaccurate labels on

biology, economy, and social sciences. Social exclusion is believed to be an
answer to this conundrum. However, previously related studies often assume
one-shot interactions and ignore how free-riding is identified, which seem to
be too idealistic. In this work, we consider repeated interactions where
excluders need to pay a monitoring cost to identify free-riders for exclusion
and free-riders cannot participate in the following possible game interactions
once they are identified and excluded by excluders in the repeated interaction
process. We reveal that the introduction of such exclusion can prevent the
breakdown of cooperation in repeated group interactions. In particular, we
demonstrate that an evolutionary oscillation among cooperators, defectors, and
excluders can appear in infinitely large populations when early exclusion is
implemented. In addition, we find that the population spends most of the time
in states where cooperators dominate for early exclusion when stochastic
mutation-selection is considered in finite populations. Our results highlight
that early exclusion is successful in solving the mentioned enigma of
cooperation in repeated group interactions.

risk in public transportation systems. However, quantitative analysis of the
effectiveness of transmission risk mitigation methods in public transportation
is lacking. The paper develops a transmission risk modeling framework based on
the Wells-Riley model using as inputs transit operating characteristics,
schedule, Origin-Destination (OD) demand, and virus characteristics. The model
is sensitive to various factors that operators can control, as well as external
factors that may be subject of broader policy decisions (e.g. mask wearing).
The model is utilized to assess transmission risk as a function of OD flows,
planned operations, and factors such as mask-wearing, ventilation, and
infection rates. Using actual data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority (MBTA) Red Line, the paper explores the transmission risk under
different infection rate scenarios, both in magnitude and spatial
characteristics. The paper assesses the combined impact from viral load related
factors and passenger load factors. Increasing frequency can mitigate
transmission risk, but cannot fully compensate for increases in infection
rates. Imbalanced passenger distribution on different cars of a train is shown
to increase the overall system-wide infection probability. Spatial infection
rate patterns should also be taken into account during policymaking as it is
shown to impact transmission risk. For lines with branches, demand distribution
among the branches is important and headway allocation adjustment among
branches to balance the load on trains to different branches can help reduce
risk.

way of advanced analysis. A popular solution is imputation, where the
fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This
paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for
missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a
joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted
combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA
explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations
between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed.
Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign
weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the
attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments
quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and
reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern
recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

we investigate the formation process of two such phenomena. We studied the
dynamic and thermal properties of two large plumes using observations from New
Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Solar Dynamic Observatory, and the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead. We find that two large plumes observed
with high-resolution data are quite different from previously studied
small-scale plumes. They are born at the top of a prominence bubble with a
large projected area of 10-20 Mm^2 . Before the occurrence of each large plume,
the bubble expands and takes on a quasi-semicircular appearance. Meanwhile, the
emission intensity of extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) bands increases in the bubble.
A small-scale filament is found to erupt in the bubble during the second large
plume. At the point at which the height of the bubble is comparable with half
the width of the bubble, the bubble becomes unstable and generates the plumes.
During the formation of plumes, two side edges of the top of the bubble, which
are dominated by opposite Doppler signals, approach each other. The large plume
then emerges and keeps rising up with a constant speed of about 13-15 km/s.
These two large plumes have temperatures of 1.3 x 10^6 Kelvin and densities of
2.0 x 10^9 cm^-3, two orders hotter and one order less dense than the typical
prominence. We also find that the bubble is a hot, low-density volume instead
of a void region beneath the cold and dense prominence. Therefore, we conclude
that these two large plumes are the result of the breakup of the prominence
bubble triggered by an enhancement of thermal pressure; they separate from the
bubble, most likely by magnetic reconnection.

clustering or community detection in networks. It has received great attention
in the last decade and the balanced case, i.e., assuming all clusters have
large size, has been well studied. However, our understanding of SBM with
unbalanced communities (arguably, more relevant in practice) is still very
limited. In this paper, we provide a simple SVD-based algorithm for recovering
the communities in the SBM with communities of varying sizes. We improve upon a
result of Ailon, Chen and Xu [ICML 2013] by removing the assumption that there
is a large interval such that the sizes of clusters do not fall in. Under the
planted clique conjecture, the size of the clusters that can be recovered by
our algorithm is nearly optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) when the
probability parameters are constant.
  As a byproduct, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm with sublinear query
complexity for a clustering problem with a faulty oracle, which finds all
clusters of size larger than $\tilde{\Omega}({\sqrt{n}})$ even if $\Omega(n)$
small clusters co-exist in the graph. In contrast, all the previous efficient
algorithms that makes sublinear number of queries cannot recover any large
cluster, if there are more than $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})$ small clusters.

usually assume that only a single type of interaction exists between user and
item, and fail to model the multiplex user-item relationships from multi-typed
user behavior data, such as page view, add-to-favourite and purchase. While
some recent studies propose to capture the dependencies across different types
of behaviors, two important challenges have been less explored: i) Dealing with
the sparse supervision signal under target behaviors (e.g., purchase). ii)
Capturing the personalized multi-behavior patterns with customized dependency
modeling. To tackle the above challenges, we devise a new model CML,
Contrastive Meta Learning (CML), to maintain dedicated cross-type behavior
dependency for different users. In particular, we propose a multi-behavior
contrastive learning framework to distill transferable knowledge across
different types of behaviors via the constructed contrastive loss. In addition,
to capture the diverse multi-behavior patterns, we design a contrastive meta
network to encode the customized behavior heterogeneity for different users.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets indicate that our method
consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Our
empirical studies further suggest that the contrastive meta learning paradigm
offers great potential for capturing the behavior multiplicity in

  Fairness-Aware Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Fairness-aware machine learning (fair-ml) techniques are algorithmic
interventions designed to ensure that individuals who are affected by the
predictions of a machine learning model are treated fairly, typically measured
in terms of a quantitative fairness metric. Despite the multitude of fairness
metrics and fair-ml algorithms, there is still little guidance on the
suitability of different approaches in practice. In this paper, we present a
framework for moral reasoning about the justification of fairness metrics and
explore the moral implications of the use of fair-ml algorithms that optimize
for them. In particular, we argue that whether a distribution of outcomes is
fair, depends not only on the cause of inequalities but also on what moral
claims decision subjects have to receive a particular benefit or avoid a
burden. We use our framework to analyze the suitability of two fairness metrics
under different circumstances. Subsequently, we explore moral arguments that
support or reject the use of the fair-ml algorithm introduced by Hardt et al.
(2016). We argue that under very specific circumstances, particular metrics
correspond to a fair distribution of burdens and benefits. However, we also
illustrate that enforcing a fairness metric by means of a fair-ml algorithm may
not result in the fair distribution of outcomes and can have several
undesirable side effects. We end with a call for a more holistic evaluation of
fair-ml algorithms, beyond their direct optimization objectives.

application, e.g, object detection and object tracking. Recent learning-based
methods demonstrate astonishing performance on underwater image enhancement,
however, most of these works use synthetic pair data for supervised learning

a domain adaptation framework for underwater image enhancement via content and
style separation, different from prior works of domain adaptation for
underwater image enhancement, which target to minimize the latent discrepancy
of synthesis and real-world data, we aim to separate encoded feature into
content and style latent and distinguish style latent from different domains,
i.e. synthesis, real-world underwater and clean domain, and process domain
adaptation and image enhancement in latent space. By latent manipulation, our
model provide a user interact interface to adjust different enhanced level for
continuous change. Experiment on various public real-world underwater
benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable to perform domain
adaptation for underwater image enhancement and outperform various
state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms in quantity and

paper, a distribution system service restoration method considering the

electricity, water, and natural gas supplies to critical customers in the
desired ratio according to their needs after an extreme event. The operational
constraints of electricity, water, and natural gas networks are considered. The
characteristics of electricity-driven coupling components, including water
pumps and gas compressors, are also modeled. Relaxation techniques are applied
to nonconvex constraints posed by physical laws of those networks.
Consequently, the restoration problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
second-order cone program, which can readily be solved by the off-the-shelf
solvers. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations on
electricity-water-gas integrated systems, developed based on benchmark models
of the subsystems. The results indicate that considering the interdependency
refines the allocation of limited generation resources and demonstrate the
exactness of the proposed convex relaxation.

relation arising out of the fluid equations has been studied for the
conventional low frequency and high frequency electrostatic drift waves. This
equation is then decomposed into two second order equations as the order of the
equation becomes reduced after this kind of decomposition under certain
conditions. The detailed analysis of fixed points as well as bifurcations of
the phase portraits have been performed using the theory of planar dynamical

intersection of the solutions of these two reduced second order equations
provides the solutions of the original third order nonlinear evolution
equation; it is verified that the solutions of the reduced nonlinear second
order equation are subsets of the oscillatory solution of the reduced linear

$1/\sigma$ times the uniform density. Second, the setting of $K$-hint
transductive learning, where the learner is given access to $K$ hints per time

dataset, we have utilized several machine learning, convolutional neural
networks and novel transformer-based classifiers for experimentation and

results show that the deep learning method performs well on the EBHI dataset.
Traditional machine learning methods achieve maximum accuracy of 76.02% and

generation mechanism and is more easily accessible in practice. Specifically,
we propose a dual-path generator, where one path is responsible for depth
generation, whose intermediate features are injected into the other path as the
condition for appearance rendering. Such a design eases the 3D-aware synthesis
with explicit geometry information. Meanwhile, we introduce a switchable
discriminator both to differentiate real v.s. fake domains and to predict the
depth from a given input. In this way, the discriminator can take the spatial
arrangement into account and advise the generator to learn an appropriate depth
condition. Extensive experimental results suggest that our approach is capable
of synthesizing indoor scenes with impressively good quality and 3D
consistency, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

components in various domains. Many previous studies exploit GPUs for SpMM
acceleration because GPUs provide high bandwidth and parallelism. We point out
that a static design does not always improve the performance of SpMM on
different input data (e.g., >85\% performance loss with a single algorithm). In
this paper, we consider the challenge of input dynamics from a novel
auto-tuning perspective, while following issues remain to be solved: (1)
Orthogonal design principles considering sparsity. Orthogonal design principles
for such a sparse problem should be extracted to form different algorithms, and
further used for performance tuning. (2) Nontrivial implementations in the
algorithm space. Combining orthogonal design principles to create new
algorithms needs to tackle with new challenges like thread race handling. (3)
Heuristic adaptability to input dynamics. The heuristic adaptability is
required to dynamically optimize code for input dynamics.
  To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel three-loop model to
extract orthogonal design principles for SpMM on GPUs. The model not only
covers previous SpMM designs, but also comes up with new designs absent from
previous studies. We propose techniques like conditional reduction to implement
algorithms missing in previous studies. We further propose DA-SpMM, a
Data-Aware heuristic GPU kernel for SpMM. DA-SpMM adaptively optimizes code
considering input dynamics. Extensive experimental results show that, DA-SpMM
achieves 1.26x~1.37x speedup compared with the best NVIDIA cuSPARSE algorithm

quantitative inference about subsurface properties with a wavelength-scale
resolution. Its frequency-domain formulation is computationally efficient when
processing only a few discrete frequencies. However, classical FWI, which is
formulated on the reduced-parameter space, requires starting the inversion with
a sufficiently-accurate initial model and low frequency to prevent being stuck
in local minima due to cycle skipping. FWI with extended search space has been
proposed to mitigate this issue. It contains two main steps: first,
data-assimilated (DA) wavefields are computed by allowing for wave-equation
errors to match the data at receivers closely. Then, subsurface parameters are
estimated from these wavefields by minimizing the wave-equation errors. The DA
wavefields are the least-squares solution of an overdetermined system gathering
the wave and observation equations. The numerical bandwidth of the resulting
normal-equation system is two times that of the wave-equation system, which can
be a limiting factor for 3D large-scale applications. Therefore, computing
highly accurate DA wavefields at a reasonable computational cost is an issue in
extended FWI. This issue is addressed here by rewriting the normal system such
that its solution can be computed by solving the time-harmonic wave equation
several times in sequence. Moreover, the computational burden of
multi-right-hand side (RHS) simulations is mitigated with a sketching method.
Finally, we solve the time-harmonic wave equation with the convergent Born
series method, which conciliates accuracy and computational efficiency.
Application of the new extended FWI algorithm on the salt benchmark shows that
it reconstructs at a reasonable cost subsurface models that are similar to
those obtained with the classical extended FWI.

particle from a two-dimensional truncated harmonic potential under the
influence of Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. The particle is
driven anisotropically by subjecting it to noises with different strengths
along different spatial directions. We show that the escape time can largely be
tuned by the anisotropic driving. While the escape process becomes anisotropic
due to the two different noises, the spatial symmetry is restored in the limit
of large magnetic fields. This is attributed to the Lorentz force induced
coupling between the spatial degrees of freedom which makes the difference
between two noises irrelevant at high magnetic fields. The theoretical
predictions are verified by Brownian dynamics simulations. In principle, our
predictions can be tested by experiments with a Brownian gyrator in the

It relies on spin-orbit interaction of light when a relativistically-strong
circularly polarized laser pulse irradiates a micro-plasma-waveguide. The
intense laser field drives a strong surface wave at the inner boundary of the
waveguide, which leads to high-order harmonic generation as the laser traveling
inside. For a circularly polarized drive laser, the optical chirality is
imprinted to the surface wave, which facilitates conversion of spin angular
momentum of the fundamental light into orbital angular momenta of the
harmonics. A ""shaken waveguide"" model is developed showing that the
aforementioned phenomena arises due to nonlinear plasma response that modifies
electromagnetic mode at high intensities. We further show the phase velocities
of all the harmonic beams are automatically matched to the driving laser, so
that the harmonic intensities increase with propagation distance. The
efficiency of harmonic production are related to the surface wave breaking
effect, which can be significantly enhanced using a tightly focused laser. Our
simulation suggests an overall conversion efficiency $\sim5\%$ can be achieved.

complexity related to the diverse structure, functionality, spatiality, and

integration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing
engineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that
are considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is
computed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020,
concerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a
conceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows
introducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic
resilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of
this attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively
related to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and
depended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in
the low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the
worldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and
centrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between
diachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical
distance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by
the specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in
ecological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and
Oceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on
the globe and supports a further research hypothesis that political instability
is a main determinant of low economic resilience, addressing avenues of further
research.

speed from 0.5 {\AA}/ps to 0.0625 {\AA}/ps. Consistent with prior macroscopic
experimental findings, the atomistic results suggest that additive
manufacturing using thinner layers imparts higher ultimate tensile strength
(UTS) than fabricating with thicker layers. The latter, however, requires a
shorter process time but induces keyhole defect formation if the laser-induced

useful in mitigating this problem. Enhancement of UTS for the multi-rowed

tension between the results of different cosmological measurements. We compare
X-ray hydrostatic masses with masses estimated using the caustic method (based
on galaxy velocities) in order to explore the systematic uncertainties of both
methods and place new constraints on the level of hydrostatic bias. Hydrostatic
and caustic mass profiles were determined independently for a sample of 44
clusters based on Chandra observations of clusters from the Hectospec Cluster
Survey. This is the largest systematic comparison of its kind. Masses were
compared at a standardised radius ($R_{500}$) using a model that includes
possible bias and scatter in both mass estimates. The systematics affecting
both mass determination methods were explored in detail. The hydrostatic masses
were found to be systematically higher than caustic masses on average, and we
found evidence that the caustic method increasingly underestimates the mass
when fewer galaxies are used to measure the caustics. We limit our analysis to
the 14 clusters with the best-sampled caustics where this bias is minimised
($\ge210$ galaxies), and find that the average ratio of hydrostatic to caustic
mass at $R_{500}$ is $M_X/M_C=1.12^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$. We interpret this result
as a constraint on the level of hydrostatic bias, favouring small or zero
levels of hydrostatic bias (less than $20\%$ at the $3\sigma$ level). However,

Network models by learning field dependencies from a set of historical input
instances, representing the values of the fields that have been filled in the

mine the local dependencies of fields in a cluster of input instances. During
the form filling phase, LAFF uses such models to predict possible values of a

their dependencies; the predicted values (endorsed based on field dependencies

the removal of a single observation have been well documented in the

eigenvalues may change due to the removal of an observation, and with that so
too does the perceived importance of the corresponding eigenvector. We refer to
this problem as ""switching of eigenvalues"". Since there is not enough
information in the new eigenvalues post observation removal to indicate that
this has happened, how do we know that this switching has occurred? In this
paper, we show that approximations to the eigenvalues can be used to help
determine when switching may have occurred. We then discuss possible actions
researchers can take based on this knowledge, for example making better choices
when it comes to deciding how many principal components should be retained and
adjustments to approximate influence diagnostics that perform poorly when
switching has occurred. Our results are easily applied to any eigenvalue

analysis of anatomical structures which is a crucial step in clinical
practices. However, shape representations through SSMs are based on shape
coefficients and lack an explicit one-to-one relationship with anatomical
measures of clinical relevance. While a shape coefficient embeds a combination
of anatomical measures, a formalized approach to find the relationship between
them remains elusive in the literature. This limits the use of SSMs to
subjective evaluations in clinical practices. We propose a novel SSM controlled
by anatomical parameters derived from morphometric analysis. The proposed
anatomically parameterized SSM (ANAT-SSM) is based on learning a linear mapping
between shape coefficients and selected anatomical parameters. This mapping is
learned from a synthetic population generated by the standard SSM. Determining
the pseudo-inverse of the mapping allows us to build the ANAT-SSM. We further
impose orthogonality constraints to the anatomical parameterization to obtain
independent shape variation patterns. The proposed contribution was evaluated
on two skeletal databases of femoral and scapular bone shapes using clinically
relevant anatomical parameters. Anatomical measures of the synthetically
generated shapes exhibited realistic statistics. The learned matrices
corroborated well with the obtained statistical relationship, while the two
SSMs achieved moderate to excellent performance in predicting anatomical
parameters on unseen shapes. This study demonstrates the use of anatomical
representation for creating anatomically parameterized SSM and as a result,
removes the limited clinical interpretability of standard SSMs. The proposed
models could help analyze differences in relevant bone morphometry between
populations, and be integrated in patient-specific pre-surgery planning or
in-surgery assessment.

recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial
input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can
capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first
propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate
point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple
latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a
coarse-tofine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D
convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into
a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is
used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse
intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point
distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a
self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the
generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative
experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-theart point cloud completion approaches.

that the transient metallic phase is a highly orthorhombically strained rutile

of particles in the vicinity of the outlet of a 2D silo using molecular
dynamics simulations. Most studies on this granular system focus in the bulk of
the medium. In this region contacts are permanent or long-lived, so continuous
approximations are able to yield results for velocity distributions or mass
flow. Close to the exit, however, the density of the medium decreases and
contacts are instantaneous. Thus, the collisional nature of the dynamics
becomes significant, warranting a dedicated investigation as carried out in
this work. More interesting, the vicinity of the outlet is the region where the
arches that block the flow for small apertures are formed. It is found that the
transition from the clogging regime (at small apertures) to the continuous flow
regime is smooth in collisional variables. Furthermore, the dynamics of
particles as reflected by the distributions of the velocities is as well
unaffected. This result implies that there is no critical outlet size that
separates both regimes, as had been proposed in the literature. Instead, the
results achieved support the alternative picture in which a clog is possible

Low-order polynomials reconstruct the low-frequency information of the image

Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver). Here, Alice possesses both even and odd spin
coherent states and makes repeated GHZ states measurements (GHZSMs) on the pair

luminous early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe (MK<-25, recession
velocity < 7,500 km/s) as seen by the 150 MHz Low-Frequency ARray (LOFAR)
observations. LOFAR images are available for 188 of these giant ETGs (gETGs)
and 146 (78%) of them are detected above a typical luminosity of ~10E21 W/Hz.
They show a large spread in power, reaching up to ~10E26 W/Hz. We confirm a
positive link between the stellar luminosity of gETGs and their median radio
power, the detection rate, and the fraction of extended sources. About
two-thirds (91) of the detected gETGs are unresolved, with sizes <4 kpc,
confirming the prevalence of compact radio sources in local sources. Forty-six
gETGs show extended emission on scales ranging from 4 to 340 kpc, at least 80%
of which have a FRI class morphology. Based on the morphology and spectral
index of the extended sources, ~30% of them might be remnant or restarted
sources but further studies are needed to confirm this. Optical spectroscopy
(available for 44 gETGs) indicates that for seven of them the nuclear gas is
ionized by young stars suggesting a contribution to their radio emission from
star forming regions. Their radio luminosities correspond to a star formation
rate (SFR) in the range 0.1-8 Msun/yr and a median specific SFR of 0.8x10E-12
yr-1. The gas flowing toward the center of gETGs can accrete onto the
supermassive black hole but also stall at larger radii and form new stars, an
indication that feedback does not completely quench star formation. The most
luminous gETGs (25 galaxies with MK < -25.8) are all detected at 150 MHz
however they are not all currently turned on: at least four of them are remnant
sources and at least one is likely powered by star formation.

to train a new transformer-based network architecture, exploiting quality
ranking of different distorted sequences rather than minimizing the L2 or L1

equilibrium is crucially governed by the energy transfer from electronic
degrees of freedom, where the energy of the pump source is usually absorbed, to
lattice degrees of freedom. In conventional metals such process leads to an
overall heating of the lattice, usually described by an effective lattice
temperature $T_{\rm ph}$, until final equilibrium with all the degrees of
freedom is reached. In specific materials, however, few lattice modes provide a
preferential channel for the energy transfer, leading to a non-thermal
distribution of vibrations and to the onset of {\em hot phonons}, i.e., lattice
modes with a much higher population than the other modes. Hot phonons are
usually encountered in semiconductors or semimetal compounds, like graphene,
where the preferential channel towards hot modes is dictated by the reduced
electronic phase space. Following a different path, the possibility of
obtaining hot-phonon physics also in metals has been however also recently
prompted in literature, as a result of a strong anisotropy of the
electron-phonon (el-ph) coupling. In the present paper, taking MgB$_2$ as a
representative example, we review the physical conditions that allow a
hot-phonon scenario in metals with anisotropic el-ph coupling, and we discuss
the observable fingerprints of hot phonons. Novel perspectives towards the
prediction and experimental observation of hot phonons in other metallic

intractable computational problems will be solved efficiently. However, quantum
technology is held down by decoherence, a phenomenon that is omnipresent in the
quantum paradigm and that renders quantum information useless when left
unchecked. The science of quantum error correction, a discipline that seeks to
combine and protect quantum information from the effects of decoherence using
structures known as codes, has arisen to meet this challenge. Stabilizer codes,
a particular subclass of quantum codes, have enabled fast progress in the field
of quantum error correction by allowing parallels to be drawn with the widely
studied field of classical error correction. This has resulted in the
construction of the quantum counterparts of well-known capacity-approaching
classical codes like sparse codes and quantum turbo codes. However, quantum
codes obtained in this manner do not entirely evoke the stupendous error
correcting abilities of their classical counterparts. This occurs because
classical strategies ignore important differences between the quantum and
classical paradigms, an issue that needs to be addressed if quantum error
correction is to succeed in its battle with decoherence. In this dissertation
we study a phenomenon exclusive to the quantum paradigm, known as degeneracy,
and its effects on the performance of sparse quantum codes. Furthermore, we
also analyze and present methods to improve the performance of a specific
family of sparse quantum codes in various different scenarios.

via applications such as drug design, process optimization, unbreakable

suffer from errors caused by the so-called decoherence, which describes the
loss in coherence of quantum states associated to their interactions with the
surrounding environment. This decoherence phenomenon is present in every
quantum information task, be it transmission, processing or even storage of
quantum information. Consequently, the protection of quantum information via
quantum error correction codes (QECC) is of paramount importance to construct
fully operational quantum computers. Understanding environmental decoherence
processes and the way they are modeled is fundamental in order to construct
effective error correction methods capable of protecting quantum information.
In this thesis, the nature of decoherence is studied and mathematically
modelled; and QECCs are designed and optimized so that they exhibit better

states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an
order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off.
In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this
adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of
the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis
of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the
suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of
transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after
property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as
well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously
breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically
prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase
uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with
the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic
preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the
adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of
quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.

discrete eccentricities from 0 to 0.4 at 0.1 Hz in $10^3$ random orientations.
The multiple harmonics induced by eccentricity can break the degeneracy between

a nonvanishing eccentricity ($0.01\sim0.4$) can significantly improve the

(linear crossing of chiral) LLs on the lattice for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$
($\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$). Remarkably, we find that the sheet Hall
conductivity becomes quantized for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$ even when two Weyl
nodes project onto a single Fermi point in two opposite surfaces, forming a
Fermi loop with $k_z$ as the good quantum number. On the other hand, the Fermi
loop, connecting two distinct Fermi points in two opposite surfaces, with $k_x$
being the good quantum number, causes the quantization in sheet Hall
conductivity for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$. The quantization is almost lost
(perfectly remained) in the type-II phase for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$
($\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$). Interestingly, the jump profiles between the
adjacent quantized plateaus change with the topological charge for both of the
above cases. The momentum-integrated three-dimensional Hall conductivity is not
quantized; however, it bears the signature of chiral LLs as resulting in the
linear dependence on $\mu$ for small $\mu$. The linear zone (its slope) reduces
(increases) as the tilt (topological charge) of the underlying WSM increases.

  indirectly-patterned hyperbolic cavities",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A conventional optical cavity supports modes which are confined because they
are unable to leak out of the cavity. Bound state in continuum (BIC) cavities
are an unconventional alternative, where light can leak out, but is confined by
multimodal destructive interference. BICs are a general wave phenomenon, of
particular interest to optics, but BICs and multimodal interference have never
been demonstrated at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate the first nanophotonic
cavities based on BIC-like multimodal interference. This novel confinement
mechanism for deep sub-wavelength light shows orders of magnitude improvement
in several confinement metrics. Specifically, we obtain cavity volumes below
100x100x3nm^3 with quality factors about 100, with extreme cases having
23x23x3nm^3 volumes or quality factors above 400. Key to our approach, is the
use of pristine crystalline hyperbolic dispersion media (HyM) which can support
large momentum excitations with relatively low losses. Making a HyM cavity is
complicated by the additional modes that appear in a HyM. Ordinarily, these
serve as additional channels for leakage, reducing cavity performance. But, in
our experiments, we find a BIC-like cavity confinement enhancement effect,
which is intimately related to the ray-like nature of HyM excitations. In fact,
the quality factors of our cavities exceed the maximum that is possible in the
absence of higher order modes. The alliance of HyM with BICs in our work yields
a radically novel way to confine light and is expected to have far reaching
consequences wherever strong optical confinement is utilized, from ultra-strong
light-matter interactions, to mid-IR nonlinear optics and a range of sensing
applications.

Fundamental understanding on the mechanism underlying NPR plays an important

based on machine learning technique, we constructed a moment tensor potential

files containing voice commands and audio reproduction methods in an offensive
fashion, to gain control of Amazon Echo devices for a prolonged amount of time.
AvA leverages the fact that Alexa running on an Echo device correctly
interprets voice commands originated from audio files even when they are played
by the device itself -- i.e., it leverages a command self-issue vulnerability.
Hence, AvA removes the necessity of having a rogue speaker in proximity of the
victim's Echo, a constraint that many attacks share. With AvA, an attacker can
self-issue any permissible command to Echo, controlling it on behalf of the
legitimate user. We have verified that, via AvA, attackers can control smart
appliances within the household, buy unwanted items, tamper linked calendars
and eavesdrop on the user. We also discovered two additional Echo
vulnerabilities, which we call Full Volume and Break Tag Chain. The Full Volume
increases the self-issue command recognition rate, by doubling it on average,
hence allowing attackers to perform additional self-issue commands. Break Tag
Chain increases the time a skill can run without user interaction, from eight
seconds to more than one hour, hence enabling attackers to setup realistic
social engineering scenarios. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, the
adversary can self-issue commands that are correctly executed 99% of the times
and can keep control of the device for a prolonged amount of time. We reported
these vulnerabilities to Amazon via their vulnerability research program, who
rated them with a Medium severity score. Finally, to assess limitations of AvA
on a larger scale, we provide the results of a survey performed on a study

protostellar core that is proposed to be a precursor of a hot core. We
performed an unbiased spectral survey towards the hot core precursor associated
with clump G328.2551-0.5321 between 159GHz and 374GHz. To identify the spectral
lines, we used rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modelling assuming
LTE. We detected 39 species and 26 isotopologues, and were able to distinguish
a warm and compact inner region, a colder more extended envelope, and the
kinematic signatures of the accretion shocks that have previously been observed
with ALMA. We associate most of the emission of the small molecules with the
cold gas, while the molecular emission of the warm gas is enriched by complex
organic molecules (COMs). We find a high abundance of S-bearing molecules in
the cold gas phase suggesting a low sulphur depletion, with a factor of > 1%.
We identify nine COMs in the warm gas, four in the cold gas, and four towards
the accretion shocks. The high abundances of S-bearing species originating from
the undisturbed gas may suggest a contribution from shocked gas at the outflow
cavity walls. The molecular composition of the warm gas is similar to that of
both hot cores and hot corinos, but the molecular abundances are closer to the
values found towards hot corinos than to values found towards hot cores.
Considering the compactness of the warm region and its moderate temperature, we
suggest that thermal desorption has not been completed towards this object yet,
representing an early phase of the emergence of hot cores.

low mass stars, <0.5Mo, ejects a dusty equatorial outflow that obscures and
temporarily causes the disappearance of a massive star, >8Mo. The merger of the
low-mass inner binary powers a faint outburst, i.e., a faint intermediate
luminosity optical transient (ILOT), but its main effect that can last for
decades is to (almost) disappear the luminous massive star of the triple
system. The typical orbital period of the triple system in about a year. The
merger process proceeds as the more massive star of the two low-mass pre-main
sequence star starts to transfer mass to the least massive star in the triple
system and as a result of that expands. This 'type II obscuring ILOT' scenario
in a triple star system might account for the fading, re-brightening, and then
re-fading of the massive post-main sequence star M101-OC1. It might recover in
about 20-100 year. Our study strengthens the claim that there are alternative
scenarios to account for the (almost) disappearing of massive stars, removing
the need for failed supernovae. In these scenarios the disappearing is
temporary, months to decades, and therefore at later time the massive star
explodes as a core collapse supernova even if it forms a black hole.

micropumps. It has been predicted that the interaction with their
self-generated chemical fields can lead to multistable higher-order flows and
chemodynamic phenomena. However, it remains unclear how such
reaction-advection-diffusion instabilities can emerge from the interplay
between chemical reactions and interfacial hydrodynamics. Here, we
simultaneously measure the flow fields and the chemical concentration fields
using dual-channel microscopy for oil droplets that dynamically solubilize in a
supramicellar aqueous surfactant solution. We developed an experimentally
tractable setup with micropumps, droplets that are pinned between the top and
bottom surfaces of a microfluidic reservoir, which we compare directly to
predictions from a Brinkman squirmer model to account for the confinement. With
increasing droplet radius, we observe (i) a migration of vortex flows from the
posterior to the anterior of the droplet, analogous to a transition from
pusher- to puller-type swimmers, (ii) a bistability between dipolar and
quadrupolar flow modes, and, eventually, (iii) a transition to multipolar
modes. We also investigate how the dynamics evolve over long time periods.
Together, our observations suggest that a local build-up of chemical products
leads to a saturation of the surface, which controls the propulsion mechanism.
These multistable dynamics can be explained by the competing time scales of
slow micellar diffusion governing the chemical buildup and faster molecular
diffusion powering the underlying transport mechanism. Our results are directly
relevant to phoretic micropumps, but also shed light on the interfacial
activity dynamics of self-propelled droplets and other active emulsion systems

Generic GID solvers are proposed for SDP and LWP. It is shown that information

elements of the null space under various specific strategies. However, as the
paper shows the ISD variants do not search through the entire space, while our
solvers do even when they use just one Gaussian elimination. Apart from these,
our GID framework clearly shows how each ISD algorithm, except for Prange's
solution, can be used as an SDP or LWP solver. A tight reduction from our
problems, viewed as optimization problems, to the MIN-SAT problem is also

We have recently shown that we can use the bright laser beam that pumps
spontaneous parametric down conversion to control the spatial correlations
between entangled photons for compensating their scattering. In this work, we
apply the pump-shaping technique to compensate for scrambling of correlations
between entangled photons that scatter by emulated atmospheric turbulence. We
use a spatial light modulator and Kolmogorov's turbulence model to emulate
atmospheric turbulence in the lab, and enhance the entangled photons' signal by
a factor of fifteen using pump optimization. We show this for both static and

realizing free-space quantum links with entangled photons, used in applications

such a context, the voting can only be sparse, as the number of alternatives is
too large for any individual to review a significant fraction of all of them.
Moreover, in critical applications, malicious players might seek to hack the
voting process by entering dishonest reviews or creating fake accounts.
Classical voting methods are unfit for this task, as they usually (a) require
each reviewer to assess all available alternatives and (b) can be easily
manipulated by malicious players.
  This paper defines precisely the problem of robust sparse voting, highlights
its underlying technical challenges, and presents Mehestan, a novel voting
mechanism that solves the problem. Namely, we prove that by using Mehestan, no
(malicious) voter can have more than a small parametrizable effect on each
alternative's score, and we identify conditions of voters comparability under
which any unanimous preferences can be recovered, even when these preferences
are expressed by voters on very different scales.

de Jong and Escard\'o have formalized this result in the constructive domain

learn with SGD for two extremal parameterizations: neural networks in the
linear regime, and neural networks with no structural constraints. However, for
the main parametrization of interest (non-linear but regular networks) no tight
characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments.
  We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks
trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs
that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of
coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how
neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent
low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.
Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large
ambient dimension $d$.
  Our main results characterize a hierarchical property, the ""merged-staircase
property"", that is both necessary and nearly sufficient for learning in this
setting.
  We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of
functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of
learning efficiently. The key tools are a new ""dimension-free"" dynamics
approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of
low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity
testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for
non-almost orthogonal functions.

field determination techniques. One of the strongest scattering polarization
signals in the photosphere is measured in the Sr I line at 4607.3 {\AA} when
observed close to the solar limb. Here, we present the first observational
evidence of Hanle rotation in the linearly polarized spectrum of this at
several limb distances. We observed with the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter,
ZIMPOL, at the IRSOL observatory, with exceptionally good seeing conditions,
allowing for long integration times. We combined the fast modulating
polarimeter with a slow modulator installed in front of the telescope. This
combination allows the measurement of spectropolarimetric data being highly
precise and unprecedentedly accurate. Fixing the reference direction for
positive Stokes $Q$ parallel to the limb, we detect singly-peaked $U/I$ signals
well above the noise level. We can exclude instrumental origin for such $U/I$
signals. These signatures are exclusively found in the Sr I line, but not in
the adjoining Fe I line, therefore eliminating the Zeeman effect as the
mechanism responsible for their appearance. However, we find a clear spatial
correlation between the circular polarization produced by the Zeeman effect and
the $U/I$ amplitudes. This suggests that the detected $U/I$ signals are the
signatures of Hanle rotation caused by a spatially resolved magnetic field. A
novel measurement technique allows for determining the absolute level of
polarization with unprecedented precision. Using this technique, high-precision
spectropolarimetric observations reveal for the first time unambiguous $U/I$
signals due to Hanle rotation in the Sr I line.

objects using gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing compact binaries
can be helped by utilizing the phenomenon of tidal heating (TH), which leaves
its imprint on binary waveforms through the horizon parameters. We investigate
the effects of TH on GWs to probe the observability of the horizon parameters,
mainly using Fisher matrix analysis to determine the errors and covariances
between them. The horizon parameters are defined as $H_1$ and $H_2$ for the two
binary components, with $H_{1,2} \in [0,1]$, and combined with the component
masses and spins to form two new parameters, $H_{\rm eff5}$ and $H_{\rm eff8}$,
to minimize their covariances in parameter estimation studies. In this work, we
add the phase contribution due to TH in terms of $H_{\rm eff5}$ and $H_{\rm

measurement errors with the binary's total mass, mass ratio, luminosity
distance, and component spins. Since the Fisher matrix approach works well for
high signal-to-noise ratio, we focus mainly on third-generation (3G) GW
detectors Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and use LIGO and Virgo for
comparison. We find that the region in the total binary mass where measurements
of $H_{\rm eff5}$ and $H_{\rm eff8}$ are most precise are $\sim 20 - 30M_\odot$
for LIGO-Virgo and $\sim 50 - 80M_\odot$ for 3G detectors. Higher component
spins allow more precise measurements of $H_{\rm eff5}$ and $H_{\rm eff8}$. For
a binary situated at 200 Mpc with component masses $12M_\odot$ and $18M_\odot$,
equal spins $\chi_1=\chi_2=0.8$, and $H_{\rm eff5}=0.6$, $H_{\rm eff8}=12$, the

of Teff > 7000 K) that were observed as part of GES. We present the procedures
and techniques that have been applied to the reduced spectra, in order to
determine the stellar parameters and abundances of these stars. The procedure
used is similar to that of other working groups in GES. A number of groups
(called `Nodes') each independently analyse the spectra, using their
state-of-the-art techniques and codes. Specific for the analysis in WG13 is the
large temperature range that is covered (Teff = 7000 - 50,000 K), requiring the
use of different analysis codes. Most Nodes can therefore only handle part of
the data. Quality checks are applied to the results of these Nodes by comparing
them to benchmark stars, and by comparing them one to another. For each star
the Node values are then homogenised into a single result: the recommended
parameters and abundances. Eight Nodes each analysed (part of) the data. In
total 17,693 spectra of 6462 stars were analysed, most of them in 37 open star
clusters. The homogenisation led to stellar parameters for 5584 stars.
Abundances were determined for a more limited number of stars. Elements studied

metals are ubiquitous in a wide range of technological applications. The
theoretical modelling of such reactions presents a formidable challenge for
theory because nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can play a prominent role and the
coupling of the atomic motion with the electrons in the metal gives rise to
important non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) that alter atomic dynamics. In this
work, we derive a theoretical framework that captures both NQEs and NAEs and,
due to its high efficiency, can be applied to first-principles calculations of
reaction rates in high-dimensional realistic systems. In more detail, we
develop a method that we coin ring polymer instanton with explicit friction
(RPI-EF), starting from the ring-polymer instanton formalism applied to a
system-bath model. We derive general equations that incorporate the spatial and
frequency dependence of the friction tensor, and then combine this method with
the \textit{ab initio} electronic friction formalism for the calculation of
thermal reaction rates. We show that the connection between RPI-EF and the form
of the electronic friction tensor presented in this work does not require any
further approximations, and it is expected to be valid as long as the
approximations of both underlying theories remain valid.

after decades of research on their detection and prevention. Various
mitigations have been proposed for C/C++, ranging from language dialects to
instrumentation. Among these, compiler-based instrumentation is particularly
promising, not requiring manual code modifications and being able to achieve
precise memory safety. Unfortunately, existing compiler-based solutions
compromise in many areas, including performance but also usability and memory
safety guarantees. New developments in hardware can help improve performance
and security of compiler-based memory safety. ARM Pointer Authentication, added
in the ARMv8.3 architecture, is intended to enable hardware-assisted Control
Flow Integrity (CFI). But since its operations are generic, it also enables
other, more comprehensive hardware-supported runtime integrity approaches. As
such, we propose CryptSan, a memory safety approach based on ARM Pointer
Authentication. CryptSan uses pointer signatures to retrofit memory safety to
C/C++ programs, protecting heap, stack, and globals against temporal and
spatial vulnerabilities. We present a full LLVM-based prototype implementation,
running on an M1 MacBook Pro, i.e., on actual ARMv8.3 hardware. Our prototype
evaluation shows that the system outperforms similar approaches under
real-world conditions. This, together with its interoperability with
uninstrumented libraries and cryptographic protection against attacks on
metadata, makes CryptSan a viable solution for retrofitting memory safety to
C/C++ programs.

data, are a nuisance for the binary black hole (BBH) searches. They affect the
BBH search sensitivity significantly because their time-domain morphologies are
very similar, and that creates difficulty in vetoing them. In this work, we
construct a deep-learning neural network to efficiently distinguish BBH signals
from blip glitches. We introduce sine-Gaussian projection (SGP) maps, which are
projections of GW frequency-domain data snippets on a basis of sine-Gaussians
defined by the quality factor and central frequency. We feed the SGP maps to
our deep-learning neural network, which classifies the BBH signals and blips.
Whereas the BBH signals are simulated, the blips used are taken from real data
throughout our analysis. We show that our network significantly improves the
identification of the BBH signals in comparison to the results obtained using
traditional-$\chi^2$ and sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$. For example, our network
improves the sensitivity by 75% at a false-positive rate of $10^{-2}$ for BBHs
with total mass in the range $[80,140]~M_{\odot}$ and SNR in the range $[3,8]$.
Also, it correctly identifies 95% of the real GW events in GWTC-3. The
computation time for classification is a few minutes for thousands of SGP maps
on a single core. With further optimisation in the next version of our
algorithm, we expect a further reduction in the computational cost. Our
proposed method can potentially improve the veto process in the LIGO--Virgo GW
data analysis and conceivably support identifying GW signals in low-latency
pipelines.

scalar field and metric couplings in the Lagrangian. In this work we study
departures from the restrictive degeneracy condition -- starting from a
fiducial model containing an exact Minkowski space solution, we break the
degeneracy condition in numerous simple ways to test if the resulting models
maintain certain key features -- specifically the dynamical cancellation of a
large vacuum energy by the scalar field and the existence of a low energy

points of the dynamical system, generically rendering both the scalar field and
metric time dependent. Our results indicate that when violating the degeneracy
condition but preserving shift symmetry, the metric maintains an asymptotic
Minkowski state, irrespective of the presence of the cosmological constant. In
contrast, when shift symmetry is also broken the asymptotic behaviour can
radically alter. Regardless, the non-degenerate models in this work share an
attractive quality; harboring low energy, late-time asymptotic states that are
independent of the vacuum energy. The tadpole allows for a broader class of
non-degenerate, self-tuning models than was previously realized.

high frequency regime ($ \gtrsim 1000 $ Hz) where current LIGO-Virgo detectors

$\mathcal{O}(10~\mathrm{Mpc})$, such events are likely to be rare. In this
work, we speculate on the possibility of detecting the postmerger from BNSs
coalescing in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH). The redshift
produced by the gravitational field of the SMBH, as well as the BNS's proper
motion around the SMBH, could effectively ""stretch"" the postmerger signal into
the band of the detectors. We demonstrate, using a phenomenological model, that
such BNS coalescences would enable constraints on the peak of the postmerger

redshifting due to the SMBH can be independently acquired. We further show how
such mergers would improve EOS model selection using the postmerger signal. We

required. It is surprising to find a DM-free galaxy for a number of reasons,
one being that a bare Newtonian disk having low velocity dispersion would be
expected to be unstable to both axi- and non-axisymmetric perturbations that
would change the structure of the disc on a dynamical timescale, as has been
known for decades. We present $N$-body simulations of the DM-free model, and
one having a low-density DM halo, that confirm this expectation: the disc is
chronically unstable to just such instabilities. Since it is unlikely that a
galaxy that is observed to have a near-regular velocity pattern would be
unstable, our finding calls into question the suggestion that the galaxy may
lack, or have little, dark matter. We also show that if the inclination of this
near face-on system has been substantially overestimated, the consequent
increased amplitude of the rotation curve would accommodate a halo massive
enough for the galaxy to be stable.

attention over the years due to its importance in theoretical computer science,
and in particular in complexity theory. The problem is specified by three
parameters: field size $q$, degree $d$ and proximity parameter $\delta$, and
the goal is to design a tester making as few as possible queries to a given
function, which is able to distinguish between the case the given function has
degree at most $d$, and the case the given function is $\delta$-far from any
degree $d$ function.
  A tester is called optimal if it makes $O(q^d+1/\delta)$ queries (which are
known to be necessary). For the field of size $q$, the natural $t$-flat tester
was shown to be optimal first by Bhattacharyya et al. for $q=2$, and later by
Haramaty et al. for all prime powers $q$. The dependency on the field size,
however, is a tower-type function.
  We improve the results above, showing that the dependency on the field size
is polynomial. Our approach also applies in the more general setting of lifted
affine invariant codes, and is based on studying the structure of the
collection of erroneous subspaces. i.e. subspaces $A$ such that $f|_{A}$ has
degree greater than $d$. Towards this end, we observe that these sets are
poorly expanding in the affine version of the Grassmann graph and use that to
establish structural results on them via global hypercontractivity. We then use
this structure to perform local correction on $f$.

port-Hamiltonian system. Energy shaping is a powerful technique that allows to
systematically find feedback law to shape the Hamiltonian of a controlled
system so that, under a general passivity condition, it converges or tracks a
desired configuration. Energy shaping has been recently generalized to consider
stochastic port-Hamiltonian system. Nonetheless the resulting theory presents
several limitation in the application so that relevant examples, such as the
additive noise case, are immediately ruled out from the possible application of
energy shaping. The current paper continues the investigation of the properties
of a weak notion of passivity for a stochastic system and a consequent weak
notion of convergence for the shaped system considered recently by the authors.
Such weak notion of passivity is strictly related to the existence and
uniqueness of an invariant measure for the system so that the theory developed
has a purely probabilistic flavour. We will show how all the relevant results
of energy shaping can be recover under the weak setting developed. We will also
show how the weak passivity setting considered draw an insightful connection
between stochastic port-Hamiltonian systems and infinite-dimensional

Further integrating a quadratic COM system with a squeezing medium can lead to
another $3$ orders enhancement, well below the standard quantum limit and

quantum nonlinear COM sensors in fundamental physics experiments and in a wide

two-dimensional (2D), long-lived and strongly interacting diatomic polar
molecular gas was successfully prepared via controllable electric field
technique. Surprisingly, the effective repulsive and attractive Van der Waals
interactions of two molecules would emerge when scanning the strength of the
electric fields. Those results were also generalized to the three-dimensional
(3D) case in a later experiment [J. Li et al, Nature Physics 17, 1144 (2021)].
Motivated by these experiments, in this paper we provide the two-body exact
solutions for the 2D and 3D Schr\""{o}dinger equation with isotropic Van der
Waals potentials ($\pm1/r^{6}$). Furthermore, base on these exact solutions, we
build the analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) for quasi-2D and 3D
geometries, and then apply QDT to study the scattering properties and bound
states of two ultracold polar molecules confined in quasi-2D and 3D geometries.
Interestingly, we find that for the attractive (repulsive) Van der Waals
potential cases, the two-body short range potential can be approximated by an
square barrier with infinity height (square potential with finite depth) which
yields the wide (narrow) and dense (dilute) resonances of the quantum defect
parameter. For the quasi-2D attractive case, the scattering resonances of
different partial waves can orderly happen which is featured by the phase jumps
when varying the scattering energy. The analytical expansions in the low energy

work, we introduce a physically motivated model of the Epoch of Reionisation in
the cosmological analysis of CMB data, which is coherent on all scales. In
particular, at high multipoles, the power spectrum of the kinetic SZ (kSZ)
effect is inferred from a set of cosmological and reionisation parameters by a
machine-learning algorithm. First including an asymmetric parameterisation of
the reionisation history in the Planck 2018 data analysis, we retrieve a value
of the optical depth consistent with previous results, but stemming from a
completely different history of reionisation in which the first luminous
sources light up as early as $z=15$. Considering the latest small-scale data
from the SPT and letting the cosmology free to vary, we find that including the
new cosmology-dependent SZ spectra helps tighten the constraints on their
amplitudes by breaking their degeneracy. We report a $5\sigma$ measurement of
the kSZ signal at $\ell=3000$, $\mathcal{D}_{3000}^\mathrm{kSZ} =
3.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\,\mu\mathrm{K}^2$ at the 68% confidence level, marginalised
over cosmology, as well as an upper limit on the patchy signal from
reionisation $\mathcal{D}_{3000}^\mathrm{pkSZ}<1.6~\mu\mathrm{K}^2$ (95% C.L.).
Additionally, we find that the SPT data favour slightly earlier reionisation
scenarios than Planck, leading to $\tau = 0.062 ^{+0.012}_{-0.015}$ and a
reionisation midpoint $z_\mathrm{re} = 7.9^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ (68% C.L.), which is

from the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) to predict at the User Equipment (UE) the
decoding outcome at the BaseBand Unit (BBU) ahead of actual decoding. In
particular, we propose a Dual Autoencoding 2-Stage Gaussian Mixture Model
(DA2SGMM) that is trained in an end-to-end fashion over the whole C-RAN setup.
Using realistic link-level simulations in the sub-THz band at 100 GHz, we show
that the novel DA2SGMM HARQ prediction scheme clearly outperforms all other
adapted and state-of-the-art schemes. The DA2SGMM shows a superior performance
in terms of blockage detection as well as HARQ prediction in the no-blockage
and single-blockage cases. In particular, the DA2SGMM with 4~bit feedback
achieves a more than 200 % higher throughput in average compared to its best
alternative. Compared to regular HARQ, the DA2SGMM reduces the maximum
transmission latency by more than 72.4 %, while maintaining more than 75 % of
the throughput in the no-blockage scenario. In the single-blockage scenario,
DA2SGMM significantly increases the throughput for most of the evaluated
Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) compared to regular HARQ.

learn the dynamical rules of a stochastic system by observation of a single

model of active matter undergoing continuous-time Monte Carlo dynamics,
simulated at a density at which its steady state comprises small, dispersed
clusters. We train a neural network called a transformer on a single trajectory
of the model. The transformer, which we show has the capacity to represent
dynamical rules that are numerous and nonlocal, learns that the dynamics of
this model consists of a small number of processes. Forward-propagated
trajectories of the trained transformer, at densities not encountered during
training, exhibit motility-induced phase separation and so predict the
existence of a nonequilibrium phase transition. Transformers have the
flexibility to learn dynamical rules from observation without explicit
enumeration of rates or coarse-graining of configuration space, and so the
procedure used here can be applied to a wide range of physical systems,
including those with large and complex dynamical generators.

adoption of analog/hybrid array solutions, where multiple antenna elements are
driven by a common radio front end to form a beam along a specific angle in
order to maximize the beamforming gain. Many heuristics have been proposed to
sample the angular domain by trading off between sampling step size and
overhead, where arbitrarily small angular step size is only attainable with
infinite sampling overhead. We show that, for uniform linear and rectangular
arrays, lossless reconstruction of the array's angular responses at arbitrary
angular precision is possible using a finite number of samples without
resorting to assumptions of angular sparsity. The proposed method, sampling and
reconstructing angular domain (SARA), defines how many and which angles to be
sampled and the corresponding reconstruction. This general solution to scan the
angular domain can therefore be applied not only to beam acquisition and
channel estimation, but also to radio imaging techniques, making it a candidate
for future integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Extensive simulation
results for target detection and radio imaging have demonstrated clear
advantages of SARA versus other considered baselines, both in terms of angular
reconstruction performance and computational complexity.

strong-lensing system whose source is a coalescing compact binary emitting
gravitational waves will provide a model-independent measurement of the shear
viscosity of dark matter along the line of sight. These individual measurements
could be a probe of large-scale distribution of dark matter and its properties.
Our results indicate that with 10-1000 strongly lensed gravitational waves from
ET and DECIGO, robust constraints on the large-scale distribution of
self-interacting dark matter might be produced. More stringent limits on the
dark matter scattering cross-section per unit mass ($\sigma_{\chi}/m_{\chi}$)
relevant to galaxy and cluster scales are also expected, compared with the

materials. However, many materials, such as porous media or metamaterials,
exhibit a pronounced microstructure. As a result, the classical continuum
theory cannot capture their mechanical behaviour without fully resolving the
underlying microstructure. In terms of finite element computations, this can be
done by modelling the entire body, including every interior cell. The relaxed
micromorphic continuum offers an alternative method by instead enriching the
kinematics of the mathematical model. The theory introduces a microdistortion
field, encompassing nine extra degrees of freedom for each material point. The
corresponding elastic energy functional contains the gradient of the
displacement field, the microdistortion field and its Curl (the
micro-dislocation). Therefore, the natural spaces of the fields are
$[\mathit{H}^1]^3$ for the displacement and $[\mathit{H}(\mathrm{curl})]^3$ for
the microdistortion, leading to unusual finite element formulations. In this
work we describe the construction of appropriate finite elements using
N\'ed\'elec and Raviart-Thomas subspaces, encompassing solutions to the
orientation problem and the discrete consistent coupling condition. Further, we
explore the numerical behaviour of the relaxed micromorphic model for both a
primal and a mixed formulation. The focus of our benchmarks lies in the
influence of the characteristic length $L_\mathrm{c}$ and the correlation to
the classical Cauchy continuum theory.

transformations as vectors living in a tangent space, and the non-contextual
conditions as discrete closed paths implying null vertical phases. Two
equivalent interpretations hold. The geometrical or realistic view, where flat
space is imposed, implies that the contextual behavior becomes equivalent to
the curvature (non-trivial holonomy) of the probabilistic functions, in analogy
with the electromagnetic tensor; as a modification of the valuation function,
it can be used to connect contextuality with interference, non-commutativity,
and signed measures. The topological or anti-realistic view, where the
valuation functions must be preserved, implies that the contextual behavior can
be translated as topological failures (non-trivial monodromy); it can be used
to connect contextuality with non-embeddability and a generalized Voroby'ev
theorem. Both views can be related to contextual fraction, and the disturbance
in ontic models can be presented as non-trivial transition maps.

conditions. To establish the controllability of the linearised equation, we use
a bilinear control acting through four directions: three Fourier modes and one
generic direction. The Fourier modes are appropriately chosen so that they
satisfy a saturation property. These modes allow to control approximately the
linearised Schr\""odinger equation. We show that the reachable set for the
linearised equation is closed. This is achieved by representing the resolving
operator as a sum of two linear continuous mappings: one is surjective (here
the control in generic direction is used) and the other is compact. A mapping
with dense and closed image is surjective, so the linearised Schr\""odinger
equation is exactly controllable. Then local exact controllability of the
nonlinear equation is derived using the inverse mapping theorem.

systems are ultimately problems of human cognition as much as machine learning,
yet the effectiveness of AI recommendations and the trust afforded by end-users
are typically not evaluated quantitatively. We developed and validated a
general purpose Human-AI interaction paradigm which quantifies the impact of AI
recommendations on human decisions. In our paradigm we confronted human users
with quantitative prediction tasks: asking them for a first response, before
confronting them with an AI's recommendations (and explanation), and then
asking the human user to provide an updated final response. The difference
between final and first responses constitutes the shift or sway in the human
decision which we use as metric of the AI's recommendation impact on the human,
representing the trust they place on the AI. We evaluated this paradigm on
hundreds of users through Amazon Mechanical Turk using a multi-branched
experiment confronting users with good/poor AI systems that had good, poor or
no explainability. Our proof-of-principle paradigm allows one to quantitatively
compare the rapidly growing set of XAI/IAI approaches in terms of their effect
on the end-user and opens up the possibility of (machine) learning trust.

non-adaptive CGT, where groups are designed a priori and all tests can be done
in parallel. The design of the groups can be done using Cover-Free Families
(CFFs). The main assumption behind CFFs is that a small number $d$ of positives
are randomly spread across a population of $n$ individuals. However, for
infectious diseases, it is reasonable to assume that infections show up in
clusters of individuals with high contact (children in the same classroom
within a school, households within a neighbourhood, students taking the same

The general structure of these communities can be modeled using hypergraphs,

overlapping edges (first two examples and last two examples, respectively). We
give constructions of what we call structure-aware CFF, which uses the

several experiments (egg-speriments) that involve the singular properties of
the liquids contained inside the eggshell, especially the egg white. We first
characterize the rheology of an egg white in a rotational rheometer for
constant and oscillatory shear stresses revealing its shear-thinning behavior
and visco-elastic properties. Then, we measure the tendency of the fluid to
generate very long filaments when stretched that we relate to the shear modulus
of the material. Second, we explore the anisotropic crack pattern that forms on
a thin film of egg white after it is spread on a surface and let dried. The
anisotropy results from the long protein chains present in the egg white which
are straightened during film deposition. Finally, we consider the ""spin test""
that permits to distinguish between raw and hard-boiled eggs. To do so, we
measure the residual rotation of a spinning raw egg after a short stop which
reflects the continuation of the internal flow. These observations are
interpreted in terms of viscous damping of the internal flow consistently with

intriguing experimental result that a wide class of silver-based layered

sub-lattices, which ultimately requires conformal symmetry breaking within the
context of the idealised model, resulting in a cation monolayer-bilayer phase
transition. Other relevant experimental, theoretical and computational

an indispensable way of moving for urban residents with fixed routes and

patterns, specifically the complex relationships between bus passengers, are
deeply hidden in this fixed mobility mode. Although many models exist to
predict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in
this regard. To reduce this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge
from this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow

Firstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships
between passengers based on bus record data. Then, we employ GCN to extract
features from the graph by learning useful topology information and introduce a
deep clustering method to recognize mobility patterns hidden in bus passengers.
Furthermore, to fully utilize Spatio-temporal information, we propose GCN2Flow
to predict passenger flow based on various mobility patterns. To the best of

predict the bus passenger flow from graph learning. We design a case study for
optimizing routes. Extensive experiments upon a real-world bus dataset

communication applications because of the giant enhancement in
electromechanical coupling after alloying with rocksalt nitrides such as YbN or
ScN. Herein, the Yb-substitution induced enhancement for electromechanical
coupling in wurtzite III-V nitrides is studied via theoretical calculations and
experiments. The substitution induced mechanical softening and local strain can
enhance electromechanical coupling. The mechanical softening induced by Yb
substitution shows less dependence on the parent AlN or GaN, which is caused by
the Yb-Yb pair interaction in the c-axis direction, and the difference of
electromechanical coupling between the GaN- and AlN-based alloys mainly comes
from their enhancement effect of Yb substitution for piezoelectric response.
The largest change in piezoelectric response relative to the parent nitride is
observed in GaN-based alloy, which is mainly considered as a consequence of
small piezoelectric constant of the parent GaN. Our calculations also reveal
that the substitutional element with a closer ionic size to the host cation is
easier to substitute into the host nitride, and produces a larger internal
strain to partly contribute to the enhancement in piezoelectric response. This
can serve as a simple guideline to identify alloying components in a search for
a massive increase in electromechanical coupling.

this work, we propose a pre-training scheme and a new loss function for
improving deep-learning-based nowcasting. First, we adapt U-Net, a widely-used
deep-learning model, for the two problems of interest here: precipitation
nowcasting and precipitation estimation from radar images. We formulate the
former as a classification problem with three precipitation intervals and the
latter as a regression problem. For these tasks, we propose to pre-train the
model to predict radar images in the near future without requiring ground-truth
precipitation, and we also propose the use of a new loss function for
fine-tuning to mitigate the class imbalance problem. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using radar images and precipitation datasets
collected from South Korea over seven years. It is highlighted that our
pre-training scheme and new loss function improve the critical success index
(CSI) of nowcasting of heavy rainfall (at least 10 mm/hr) by up to 95.7% and
43.6%, respectively, at a 5-hr lead time. We also demonstrate that our approach
reduces the precipitation estimation error by up to 10.7%, compared to the
conventional approach, for light rainfall (between 1 and 10 mm/hr). Lastly, we
report the sensitivity of our approach to different resolutions and a detailed
analysis of four cases of heavy rainfall.

framework (MOF) that exhibits an outstanding performance with an almost
billion-fold enhancement in the electrical response due to its optimized
hydrophobicity, which allows the easy migration of iodine molecules though the
channels and the presence of suitable interaction sites, temporarily anchoring
the target molecule for ultra-trace sensing. The prototype sensor tested in
demanding environments demonstrates its high selectivity, ultra-trace parts per
billion (ppb)-level sensitivity, good reversibility, and a very fast response
time even at high frequencies compared to existing adsorbents, including
commercially available materials. Further, the iodine sensing at the atomic
level was studied in detail by measuring the electrical response of a single
crystal and, the optimal thickness of the MOF layer was identified for an
industrially-viable prototype sensor by using inkjet printing. In a wider
perspective, we propose a general strategy towards electrically efficient
sensing materials with hybrid functionalities for engineering high-sensitivity

their collection, and they frequently come with missing values: incomplete
observations. These large databases are well suited to train machine-learning
models, for instance for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical
settings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative -- rather than
generative -- modeling, and thus open the door to new missing-values
strategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing
values have focused on inferential statistics. RESULTS: Here we conduct a
systematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a
focus on large health databases: four electronic health record datasets, a
population brain imaging one, a health survey and two intensive care ones.
Using gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with
simple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate
prediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we
find that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is
important, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate
missing values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies
but requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model
missing values-with missing incorporated attribute-leads to robust, fast, and
well-performing predictive modeling. CONCLUSIONS: Native support for missing
values in supervised machine learning predicts better than state-of-the-art
imputation with much less computational cost. When using imputation, it is
important to add indicator columns expressing which values have been imputed.

events is likely to happen and when the event will occur given a history of a
sequence of events. There are various examples of occurrence dynamics in the
daily life, and it is important to train the temporal dynamics and solve two
different prediction problems, time and type predictions. Especially, deep
neural network based models have outperformed the statistical models, such as
Hawkes processes and Poisson processes. However, many existing approaches
overfit to specific events, instead of learning and predicting various event
types. Therefore, such approaches could not cope with the modified
relationships between events and fail to predict the intensity functions of
temporal point processes very well. In this paper, to solve these problems, we
propose a variational neural temporal point process (VNTPP). We introduce the
inference and the generative networks, and train a distribution of latent
variable to deal with stochastic property on deep neural network. The intensity
functions are computed using the distribution of latent variable so that we can
predict event types and the arrival times of the events more accurately. We
empirically demonstrate that our model can generalize the representations of
various event types. Moreover, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that
our model outperforms other deep neural network based models and statistical
processes on synthetic and real-world datasets.

While several approaches have been proposed, one view towards mitigating bias
is through adversarial learning. A discriminator is used to identify the bias
attributes such as gender, age or race in question. This discriminator is used
adversarially to ensure that it cannot distinguish the bias attributes. The
main drawback in such a model is that it directly introduces a trade-off with
accuracy as the features that the discriminator deems to be sensitive for
discrimination of bias could be correlated with classification. In this work we
solve the problem. We show that a biased discriminator can actually be used to
improve this bias-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, this is achieved by using a
feature masking approach using the discriminator's gradients. We ensure that
the features favoured for the bias discrimination are de-emphasized and the
unbiased features are enhanced during classification. We show that this simple
approach works well to reduce bias as well as improve accuracy significantly.
We evaluate the proposed model on standard benchmarks. We improve the accuracy
of the adversarial methods while maintaining or even improving the unbiasness
and also outperform several other recent methods.

to samples of prices that customers were previously offered, whether they
purchased at that price, and auxiliary features describing the customer and/or
item being sold. This is in contrast to the well-studied setting in which
samples of the customer's valuation (willingness to pay) are observed. In our
setting, the observed data is influenced by the previous pricing policy, and we
do not know how customers would have responded to alternative prices. We
introduce suitable loss functions for this setting that can be directly
optimized to find an effective pricing policy with expected revenue guarantees,
without the need for estimation of an intermediate demand function. We focus on
convex loss functions. This is particularly relevant when linear pricing
policies are desired for interpretability reasons, resulting in a tractable
convex revenue optimization problem. We propose generalized hinge and quantile
pricing loss functions that price at a multiplicative factor of the conditional
expected valuation or a particular quantile of the prices that sold, despite
the valuation data not being observed. We prove expected revenue bounds for
these pricing policies respectively when the valuation distribution is
log-concave, and we provide generalization bounds for the finite sample case.
Finally, we conduct simulations on both synthetic and real-world data to
demonstrate that this approach is competitive with, and in some settings
outperforms, state-of-the-art methods in contextual pricing.

of envy-freeness cannot always be achieved. Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX),

relaxations of envy-freeness, which remain elusive in many settings. We study a
natural relaxation of these two fairness constraints, where we place the agents
on the vertices of an undirected graph, and only require that our allocations
satisfy the EFX (resp. HEF) constraint on the edges of the graph. We refer to
these allocations as graph-EFX (resp. graph-HEF) or simply $G$-EFX (resp.
$G$-HEF) allocations. We show that for any graph $G$, there always exists a
$G$-HEF-$k$ allocation of goods, where $k$ is the size of a minimum vertex
cover of $G$, and that this is essentially tight. We show that $G$-EFX
allocations of goods exist for three different classes of graphs -- two of them
generalizing the star $K_{1, n-1}$ and the third generalizing the three-edge
path $P_4$. Many of these results extend to allocations of chores as well.
Overall, we show several natural settings in which the graph structure helps
obtain strong fairness guarantees. Finally, we evaluate an algorithm using
problem instances from Spliddit to show that $G$-EFX allocations appear to
exist for paths $P_n$, pointing the way towards showing EFX for even broader

rank a relevant set of continuous-time event sequences for a given query
sequence, from a large corpus of sequences. More specifically, NEUROSEQRET
first applies a trainable unwarping function on the query sequence, which makes
it comparable with corpus sequences, especially when a relevant query-corpus

sequence and the corpus sequence into MTPP guided neural relevance models. We
develop two variants of the relevance model which offer a tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. We also propose an optimization framework to learn
binary sequence embeddings from the relevance scores, suitable for the
locality-sensitive hashing leading to a significant speedup in returning top-K

presented a basic and important identity in linear commutative algebra,
so-called {\bf the eigenvector-eigenvalue identity} (formally named in [BAMS,
2021]), which is a convenient and powerful tool to succinctly determine
eigenvectors from eigenvalues. The identity relates the eigenvector component
to the eigenvalues of $A$ and the minor $M_j$, which is formulated in an
elegant form as \[ \lvert v_{i,j} \rvert^2\prod_{k=1;k\ne
i}^{n-1}({\lambda_i}(A)-{\lambda_k}(A))=\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}({\lambda_i}(A)-{\lambda_k}(M_j)).
\,\,\,%\mbox{(\cite{tao-eig,D-P-T-Z})} \]
  In fact, it has been widely applied in various fields such as numerical
linear algebra, random matrix theory, inverse eigenvalue problem, graph theory,
neutrino physics and so on. In this paper, we extend the eigenvector-eigenvalue
identity to the quaternion division ring, which is non-commutative. A version
of eigenvector-eigenvalue identity for the quaternion matrix is established.
Furthermore, we give a new method and algorithm to compute the eigenvectors
from the right eigenvalues for the quaternion Hermitian matrix. A program is
designed to realize the algorithm to compute the eigenvectors. An open problem
ends the paper. Some examples show a good performance of the algorithm and the
program.

  Classification in Heterogeneous Computing","Accepted to ICASSP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.DC cs.NE eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The rapid development of quantum computing has demonstrated many unique
characteristics of quantum advantages, such as richer feature representation
and more secured protection on model parameters. This work proposes a vertical
federated learning architecture based on variational quantum circuits to
demonstrate the competitive performance of a quantum-enhanced pre-trained BERT
model for text classification. In particular, our proposed hybrid
classical-quantum model consists of a novel random quantum temporal convolution
(QTC) learning framework replacing some layers in the BERT-based decoder. Our
experiments on intent classification show that our proposed BERT-QTC model
attains competitive experimental results in the Snips and ATIS spoken language
datasets. Particularly, the BERT-QTC boosts the performance of the existing
quantum circuit-based language model in two text classification datasets by
1.57% and 1.52% relative improvements. Furthermore, BERT-QTC can be feasibly
deployed on both existing commercial-accessible quantum computation hardware
and CPU-based interface for ensuring data isolation.

of protein. In CASP14, a blind structure prediction challenge, it performed
significantly better than other competitors, which makes it the best available
structure prediction tool. One of the outputs of AlphaFold is the probability
profile of residue-residue distances. This makes it possible to score any
conformation of the studied protein to express its compliance with the
AlphaFold model. Here we show how this score can be used to drive protein
folding simulation by metadynamics and parallel tempering metadynamics. By
parallel tempering metadynamics, we simulated folding of a mini-protein
Trp-cage beta hairpin and predicted their folding equilibria. We see the
potential of AlphaFold-based collective variable in applications beyond
structure prediction, such as in structure refinement or prediction of the
outcome of a mutation.

the level of intensity to which a human expresses them is what makes it
challenging to robustly classify and generate images of facial expressions.
Lack of good quality data can hinder the performance of a deep learning model.
In this article, we have proposed a Facial Expression Generation method for
Meta-Humans (FExGAN-Meta) that works robustly with the images of Meta-Humans.
We have prepared a large dataset of facial expressions exhibited by ten
Meta-Humans when placed in a studio environment and then we have evaluated
FExGAN-Meta on the collected images. The results show that FExGAN-Meta robustly
generates and classifies the images of Meta-Humans for the simple as well as
the complex facial expressions.

that various service providers collect, process, and analyze data. MCS offers
novel processes where data is sensed and shared through mobile devices of the
users to support various applications and services for cutting-edge
technologies. However, various threats, such as data poisoning, clogging task
attacks and fake sensing tasks adversely affect the performance of MCS systems,
especially their sensing, and computational capacities. Since fake sensing task
submissions aim at the successful completion of the legitimate tasks and mobile
device resources, they also drain MCS platform resources. In this work, Self
Organizing Feature Map (SOFM), an artificial neural network that is trained in
an unsupervised manner, is utilized to pre-cluster the legitimate data in the
dataset, thus fake tasks can be detected more effectively through less
imbalanced data where legitimate/fake tasks ratio is lower in the new dataset.
After pre-clustered legitimate tasks are separated from the original dataset,
the remaining dataset is used to train a Deep Neural Network (DeepNN) to reach
the ultimate performance goal. Pre-clustered legitimate tasks are appended to
the positive prediction outputs of DeepNN to boost the performance of the
proposed technique, which we refer to as pre-clustered DeepNN (PrecDeepNN). The
results prove that the initial average accuracy to discriminate the legitimate
and fake tasks obtained from DeepNN with the selected set of features can be
improved up to an average accuracy of 0.9812 obtained from the proposed machine
learning technique.
