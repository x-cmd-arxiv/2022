strongly connected with eye gaze. In this work, we determine such intention by
analyzing real-time eye gaze data with a low-cost regular webcam. We extracted
unique features (e.g., Fixation Count, Eye Movement Ratio) from the eye gaze
data of 31 participants to generate a dataset containing 124 samples of visual
intention for perceiving textual or graphical information, labeled as either
TEXT or IMAGE, having 48.39% and 51.61% distribution, respectively. Using this
dataset, we analyzed 5 classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM)
(Accuracy: 92.19%). Using the trained SVM, we investigated the variation of
visual intention among 30 participants, distributed in 3 age groups, and found
out that young users were more leaned towards graphical contents whereas older
adults felt more interested in textual ones. This finding suggests that
real-time eye gaze data can be a potential source of identifying visual
intention, analyzing which intention aware interactive interfaces can be
designed and developed to facilitate human cognition.

(MQMDPA) for manifold short-range orders in liquids has been successfully
extended to multicomponent solutions. The extension is conducted by means of
the geometrical interpolation method. Three types of interpolation models,
namely Kohler, Toop and Chou, are introduced to initially formulate the pair
interaction energies in ternary solutions by employing those in their
constituent binary solutions. The pair energies can be expanded in terms of the
pair fractions (configuration-dependent) or in terms of the
coordination-equivalent fractions (composition-dependent). These methods are
subsequently extended for use in multicomponent solutions. A general formalism
for the combined Kohler-Toop model is employed to permit complete freedom of
choice to treat any ternary subsystems with a symmetric or asymmetric model.
Meanwhile, a general Chou model is also used to treat all ternary subsystems
without any human interference to select symmetric or asymmetric components but
only dependent upon the similarity and difference in properties from each two
binary solutions with a co-member. Advantages and shortcomings are critically
discussed regarding the utilization of different interpolation models.

cuprate superconductors. Does the pseudogap line cross the superconducting
$T_c$-dome or not? To answer, we have revisited the experimental magnetic
susceptibility and knight shift of four different compounds,
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_{1-x}$Y$_x$Cu$_2$O$_8$,
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+y}$, and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$, as a function of
temperature and doping. The susceptibility can be described by the same
function for all materials, having a magnetic and an electronic contributions.
The former is the 2D antiferromagnetic (AF) square lattice response, with a
characteristic temperature of magnetic correlations $T_{max}$. The latter is
the `Pauli' term, revealing the gap opening in the electronic density of states
at the pseudogap temperature $T^*$.
  From precise fits of the data, we find that $T_{max}(p)$ decreases linearly
as a function of doping ($p$) over a wide range, but saturates abruptly in the
overdoped regime. Concomitantly, $T^*(p)$ is {\it linear and tangent} to the
dome, either crossing or approaching $T_{max}(p)$ at the top of the dome,
indicating a qualitative change of behavior from underdoped to overdoped
regimes.
  Contrary to the idea that the pseudogap terminates just above optimal doping,
our analysis suggests that the gap exists throughout the phase diagram. It is
consistent with a pseudogap due to hole pairs, or `pairons', above $T_c$. We
conclude that $T_{max}$, reflecting the AF magnetic correlations, has often
been misinterpreted as the pseudogap temperature $T^*$.

abnormalities inter-relate and their mechanisms are unclear. We computed grey
matter volumetric changes and white matter structural connectivity
abnormalities in 144 patients with unilateral TLE and 96 healthy controls.
Regional volumes were calculated using T1-weighted MRI, while structural
connectivity was derived using white matter fibre tractography from
diffusion-weighted MRI. For each regional volume and each connection strength,
we calculated the effect size between patient and control groups in a
group-level analysis. We then applied hierarchical regression to investigate
the relationship between volumetric and structural connectivity abnormalities
in individuals. Additionally, we quantified whether abnormalities co-localised
within individual patients by computing Dice similarity scores. In TLE, white
matter connectivity abnormalities were greater when joining two grey matter
regions with abnormal volumes. Similarly, grey matter volumetric abnormalities
were greater when joined by abnormal white matter connections. The extent of
volumetric and connectivity abnormalities related to epilepsy duration, but
co-localisation did not. Co-localisation was primarily driven by neighbouring
abnormalities in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Overall, volumetric and structural
connectivity abnormalities were related in TLE. Our results suggest that shared
mechanisms may underlie changes in both volume and connectivity alterations in
patients with TLE.

non-equilibrium regimes of energy fluctuations originated by the interaction
between a quantum system and a measurement apparatus applying a sequence of
repeated quantum measurements. To properly quantify the information about
energy fluctuations, both the exchanged heat probability density function and
the corresponding characteristic function are derived and interpreted. Then, we
discuss the conditions allowing for the validity of the fluctuation theorem in
Jarzynski form $\langle e^{-\beta Q}\rangle = 1$, thus showing that the
fluctuation relation is robust against the presence of randomness in the time
intervals between measurements. Moreover, also the late-time, asymptotic
properties of the heat characteristic function are analyzed, in the
thermodynamic limit of many intermediate quantum measurements. In such a limit,
the quantum system tends to the maximally mixed state (thus corresponding to a
thermal state with infinite temperature) unless the system's Hamiltonian and
the intermediate measurement observable share a common invariant subspace.
Then, in this context, we also discuss how energy fluctuation relations change
when the system operates in the quantum Zeno regime. Finally, the theoretical
results are illustrated for the special cases of two- and three-levels quantum
systems, now ubiquitous for quantum applications and technologies.

energy-minimizing shape of a two-dimensional void under biaxial loading. In
particular, we consider void shapes with corners for which the strain energy
density is singular at the corner. The elasticity problem is formulated as a
boundary integral equation using complex potentials. By incorporating the
asymptotic behavior of the singular elastic fields at corners of the void, we
develop a numerical spectral method for determining the stress for a class of
arbitrary void shapes and corner angles. We minimize the total energy of
surface energy and elastic potential energy using calculus of variations to
obtain an Euler-Lagrange equation on the boundary that is coupled to the
elastic field. The shape of the void boundary is determined using a numerical
spectral method that simultaneously determines the equilibrium void shape and
singular elastic fields. Our results show that the precise corner angles that
minimize the total energy are not affected by the presence of the singular
elastic fields. However, the stress singularity on the void surface at the
corner must be balanced by a singularity in the curvature at the corner that
effectively changes the macroscopic geometry of the shape and effectively
changes the apparent corner angle. These results reconcile the apparent
contradiction regarding the effect of elasticity on equilibrium corner angles
in the results of Srolovitz and Davis (2001) and Siegel, Miksis and Voorhees

corners on free-boundary elasticity problems.

study of different centrality measures on graphs. They showed that CP can be
solved in linear time in trees, but it is known to be NP-hard in many classes

  We investigate the path eccentricity of a connected graph~$G$ as a parameter.
Let pe$(G)$ denote the value of ecc$_G(P)$ for a central path $P$ of $G$. We
obtain tight upper bounds for pe$(G)$ in some graph classes. We show that
pe$(G) \leq 1$ on biconvex graphs and that pe$(G) \leq 2$ on bipartite convex
graphs. Moreover, we design algorithms that find such a path in linear time. On
the other hand, by investigating the longest paths of a graph, we obtain tight
upper bounds for pe$(G)$ on general graphs and $k$-connected graphs.
  Finally, we study the relation between a central path and a longest path in a
graph. We show that on trees, and bipartite permutation graphs, a longest path
is also a central path. Furthermore, for superclasses of these graphs, we
exhibit counterexamples for this property.

remains, as per today, the most significant one ever observed. TXS 0506+056 was
a poorly studied object before the IceCube-170922A event. To better
characterize its broad-band emission, we organized a multi-wavelength campaign
lasting 16 months (November 2017 to February 2019), covering the radio-band
(Mets\""ahovi, OVRO), the optical/UV (ASAS-SN, KVA, REM, Swift/UVOT), the X-rays
(Swift/XRT, NuSTAR), the high-energy $\gamma$ rays (Fermi/LAT) and the
very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$ rays (MAGIC). In $\gamma$ rays, the behaviour
of the source was significantly different from the 2017 one: MAGIC observations
show the presence of flaring activity during December 2018, while the source
only shows an excess at the 4$\sigma$ level during the rest of the campaign (74
hours of accumulated exposure); Fermi/LAT observations show several short
(days-to-week timescale) flares, different from the long-term brightening of
2017. No significant flares are detected at lower energies. The radio light
curve shows an increasing flux trend, not seen in other wavelengths. We model
the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions in a lepto-hadronic
scenario, in which the hadronic emission emerges as Bethe-Heitler and
pion-decay cascade in the X-rays and VHE $\gamma$ rays. According to the model
presented here, the December 2018 $\gamma$-ray flare was connected to a
neutrino emission that was too brief and not bright enough to be detected by
current neutrino instruments.

controls the distance with respect to the two nearest predecessors. In this
topology, the second predecessor is communicated via a Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
link. The individual trajectories of CAVs under the Nash equilibrium are
derived in closed-form for these two information topologies. Finally, general
information topology is examined and the differential game is formulated in
this context. In all these options, Pontryagin's principle is employed to
investigate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and obtain its
corresponding trajectories. In the general topology, we suppose numerical
computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. All these approaches represent
promising and powerful analytical representations of the CAV platoons under the
differential games. Simulation experiments have verified the efficiency of the
proposed models and their solutions.

Distribution, for shape reconstruction of a celestial body that has been
observed to occult a star, using the photometric time-series observations of
the occultation. $\textit{COD}$ finds a solution to the light-curve inversion
problem for an optically thick occulter having an approximately convex shape,
together with an estimate of its size, impact parameter and velocity, relative
to the occulted star. The algorithm is based on an optimization scheme that
uses topological constraints and an objective function for the geometry of the
occulter. The constraints of the problem follow linear relations, which enable
the use of linear programming optimization as the mathematical framework.
Multiple tests of the algorithm were performed, all of which resulted in high
correlations between the simulated and obtained shapes of the occulting
objects, with errors within $5\%$ in their projected velocities and horizontal
sizes, and within $0.1$ in their impact parameters. These tests include a video
of a solar eclipse by Phobos, as seen by NASA's Curiosity rover, which was
collapsed into its corresponding light curve and reconstructed afterwards. We
applied $\textit{COD}$ to the mysterious case of VVV-WIT-08 -- a single deep
occultation ($\sim 96 \%$) of a giant star lasting for over 200 days. The
analysis, which did not assume any specific shape of the occulter, suggested an
object with a projected opacity distribution resembling an ellipse with an
eccentricity of $\sim 0.5$, tilted at $\sim 30$ degrees relative to the
direction of motion, with a semi-minor axis similar to the stellar radius.

for color histogram matching and transfer, and a colorization subnet that
learns to predict the chroma elements of the images conditioned on chromatic
reference signals. The whole system takes advantage of the color histogram
priors in a given reference image, which vastly reduces the dependency on
large-scale training data. Apart from the proposed method, we also create, to

Substantial technical and editorial revision",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.

calculate its von Neumann entropy in terms of structure functions, that are
measured by DIS on mesons (hadrons in general). We found that the entropy is
bounded by an area law with logarithmic divergences, proportional to the
rapidity of the meson. The evolution of the entanglement entropy with rapidity,
is fixed by the cumulative singlet PDF, and bounded from above by a
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of 1. At low-$x$, the entanglement exhibits an
asymptotic expansion, similar to the forward meson-meson scattering amplitude
in the Regge limit. The evolution of the entanglement entropy in parton-$x$ per
unit rapidity, measures the meson singlet PDF. The re-summed entanglement
entropy along the single meson Regge trajectory, is string-like. We suggest
that its extension to multi-meson states, models DIS scattering on a large 2D

xenon, obtained using both the NEXT-White TPC and a dedicated setup. Detailed
comparison with first-principle calculations allows us to assign this
scintillation mechanism to neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS), a process that has
been postulated to exist in xenon that has been largely overlooked. For photon
emission below 1000 nm, the NBrS yield increases from about 10$^{-2}$
photon/e$^{-}$ cm$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$ at pressure-reduced electric field values
of 50 V cm$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$ to above 3$\times$10$^{-1}$ photon/e$^{-}$
cm$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$ at 500 V cm$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$. Above 1.5 kV cm$^{-1}$
bar$^{-1}$, values that are typically employed for electroluminescence, it is
estimated that NBrS is present with an intensity around 1 photon/e$^{-}$
cm$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$, which is about two orders of magnitude lower than
conventional, excimer-based electroluminescence. Despite being fainter than its
excimeric counterpart, our calculations reveal that NBrS causes luminous
backgrounds that can interfere, in either gas or liquid phase, with the ability
to distinguish and/or to precisely measure low primary-scintillation signals
(S1). In particular, we show this to be the case in the ""buffer"" and ""veto""
regions, where keeping the electric field below the electroluminescence (EL)
threshold will not suffice to extinguish secondary scintillation. The electric
field in these regions should be chosen carefully to avoid intolerable levels
of NBrS emission. Furthermore, we show that this new source of light emission
opens up a viable path towards obtaining S2 signals for discrimination purposes
in future single-phase liquid TPCs for neutrino and dark matter physics, with
estimated yields up to 20-50 photons/e$^{-}$ cm$^{-1}$.

considered based on the concept of Zero Trust, an increasingly popular design

principles upon which the reliance on trust in network components is eliminated
in favour of dynamic verification of network interactions. An initial

definition of Zero Trust Digital Forensics is proposed, specifically that it is
a strategy adopted by investigators whereby each aspect of an investigation is

artificial intelligence, the strengthening of which, in the face of adversarial
attacks is of particular importance. An appropriate solution to adversarial
attacks is adversarial training, which reaches a trade-off between robustness
and generalization. This paper introduces a novel framework (Layer
Sustainability Analysis (LSA)) for the analysis of layer vulnerability in an
arbitrary neural network in the scenario of adversarial attacks. LSA can be a
helpful toolkit to assess deep neural networks and to extend the adversarial
training approaches towards improving the sustainability of model layers via
layer monitoring and analysis. The LSA framework identifies a list of Most
Vulnerable Layers (MVL list) of the given network. The relative error, as a
comparison measure, is used to evaluate representation sustainability of each
layer against adversarial inputs. The proposed approach for obtaining robust
neural networks to fend off adversarial attacks is based on a layer-wise
regularization (LR) over LSA proposal(s) for adversarial training (AT); i.e.
the AT-LR procedure. AT-LR could be used with any benchmark adversarial attack
to reduce the vulnerability of network layers and to improve conventional
adversarial training approaches. The proposed idea performs well theoretically
and experimentally for state-of-the-art multilayer perceptron and convolutional
neural network architectures. Compared with the AT-LR and its corresponding
base adversarial training, the classification accuracy of more significant
perturbations increased by 16.35%, 21.79%, and 10.730% on Moon, MNIST, and

leads to a sequence of failures spread through the system. The interconnection
between different components in a power system causes failures to easily
propagate across the system. The situation gets worse by considering the
interconnection between cyber and physical layers in power systems. A plethora
of work has studied the cascading failure in power systems to calculate its
impact on the system. Understanding how failures propagate into the system in
time and space can help the system operator to take preventive actions and
upgrade the system accordingly. Due to the nonlinearity of the power flow
equation as well as the engineering constraints in the power system, it is
essential to understand the spatio-temporal failure propagation in
cyber-physical power systems (CPPS). This paper proposes an asynchronous
algorithm for investigating failure propagation in CPPS. The physics of the
power system is addressed by the full AC power flow equations. Various
practical constraints including load shedding, load-generation balance, and
island operation are considered to address practical constraints in power
system operation. The propagation of various random initial attacks of
different sizes is analyzed and visualized to elaborate on the applicability of
the proposed approach. Our findings shed light on the cascading failure

through an aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data,
thus restricting its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, we
propose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks, namely
Finite Aggregation. In contrast to DPA, which directly splits the training set
into disjoint subsets, our method first splits the training set into smaller
disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates of them to build larger (but not
disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers. This reduces the worst-case
impacts of poison samples and thus improves certified robustness bounds. In
addition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging the designs of
deterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses. Empirically,
our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87% and
4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPA's,
effectively establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certified
robustness against data poisoning.

conventional refractive lenses, or lens arrays, utilizing nanoscale resonant

meta-atoms such as nanoscale dielectric pillars. Achromatic focusing -
associated with traditional multi-element refractive counterparts - is
frequently attempted with single-layer metalens designs, which has proven
difficult to achieve with bounded refractive indices and total lens thickness.
A recent study (F.Presutti and F.Monticone, 2020) formalized this, applying
optical delay-line limitations to metalenses, resulting in a generalized
trade-off in achromaticity for focusing systems. In this work, we (1)
theoretically explore achromaticity in metalens design, and (2) propose a
thin-film multilayer design as an alternative to the discrete meta-atom
approach for large numerical aperture (NA) achromatic metalenses. It is shown
that wavefront modulation can also be achieved with spectrally-varying
transmission magnitudes, rather than purely matching a phase profile. In fact,
even with a bounded refractive index, perfect achromatic operation over a given
spectral range can be offset by imperfect operation elsewhere, resulting in a
NA limited by the smallest general spectral feature controlled. These
considerations lead to a generalized phase-matching optimization routine, and a
thin-film metalens is simulated, utilizing layered TiO2/MgF2 with total
thicknesses under 1 {\mu}m (20 layers), focusing across 6 simultaneous
wavelengths (350-740 nm, {\Delta}{\lambda}~65 nm). A significant proportion

embedding representations to capture underlying structure in the data and
improve performance. In order to characterize model flaws and choose a
desirable representation, model builders often need to compare across multiple
embedding spaces, a challenging analytical task supported by few existing
tools. We first interviewed nine embedding experts in a variety of fields to
characterize the diverse challenges they face and techniques they use when
analyzing embedding spaces. Informed by these perspectives, we developed a
novel system called Emblaze that integrates embedding space comparison within a
computational notebook environment. Emblaze uses an animated, interactive
scatter plot with a novel Star Trail augmentation to enable visual comparison.
It also employs novel neighborhood analysis and clustering procedures to
dynamically suggest groups of points with interesting changes between spaces.
Through a series of case studies with ML experts, we demonstrate how
interactive comparison with Emblaze can help gain new insights into embedding
space structure.

networks, but has been deemed uncompetitive by either post-training pruning or
sparse training. In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight a
perhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can be
quite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without any
delicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, we
empirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network from
scratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two key
factors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as the
original dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training a
randomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its dense
equivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsity
ratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be another
important performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetwork
of Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense Wide
ResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networks
outperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such as
out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarial
robustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-expected
room for sparse training at scale, and the benefits of sparsity might be more
universal beyond carefully designed pruning. Our source code can be found at

wave-like field oscillating near the Compton frequency of the bosons. If a
measurement scheme for the direct detection of UBDM interactions is sensitive
to a signature quadratic in the field, then there is a near-zero-frequency (dc)
component of the signal. Thus, a detector with a given finite bandwidth can be
used to search for bosons with Compton frequencies many orders of magnitude
larger than its bandwidth. This opens the possibility of a detection scheme
analogous to Hanbury Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry. Assuming that
the UBDM is virialized in the galactic gravitational potential, the random
velocities produce slight deviations from the Compton frequency. These result
in stochastic fluctuations of the intensity on a time scale determined by the
spread in kinetic energies. In order to mitigate ubiquitous local low-frequency
noise, a network of sensors can be used to search for the stochastic intensity
fluctuations by measuring cross-correlation between the sensors. This method is
inherently broadband, since a large range of Compton frequencies will yield
near-zero-frequency components within the sensor bandwidth that can be searched
for simultaneously. Measurements with existing sensor networks have sufficient
sensitivity to search experimentally unexplored parameter space.

physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the

approximations that fulfill the physical problem at hand. However, to make the

  Understanding the effect of data augmentation","Accepted at VISAPP 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Autonomous driving (AD) datasets have progressively grown in size in the past
few years to enable better deep representation learning. Active learning (AL)
has re-gained attention recently to address reduction of annotation costs and
dataset size. AL has remained relatively unexplored for AD datasets, especially
on point cloud data from LiDARs. This paper performs a principled evaluation of
AL based dataset distillation on (1/4th) of the large Semantic-KITTI dataset.
Further on, the gains in model performance due to data augmentation (DA) are
demonstrated across different subsets of the AL loop. We also demonstrate how
DA improves the selection of informative samples to annotate. We observe that
data augmentation achieves full dataset accuracy using only 60\% of samples
from the selected dataset configuration. This provides faster training time and
subsequent gains in annotation costs.

(ii) Restricted mixed goods (RMG), where for each item $j$, every agent has
either a non-positive value for $j$, or values $j$ at the same $v_j>0$. We

the Coherent Alignment Method (COHAM), which aims at reducing Coriolis effects
by allowing small mismatches in the G-vector alignment, reducing cabin
rotations. Simulations show that as long as these mismatches remain within a
region where humans perceive the G-vector as 'coherent', the Coherent Alignment
Zone (CAZ), the cabin angular accelerations can indeed be reduced. COHAM was
tested in a high G-maneuver task with a fixed CAZ threshold obtained in a

using metrics such as sickness, comfort and false cues. Results show that
sickness, dizziness and discomfort are reduced, making the centrifuge sessions
more bearable. It is recommended to further improve the filter design and

the code that need to be examined with more scrutiny. Recent work proposed the
use of function names as semantic cues that can be learned by a deep neural
network (DNN) to aid in the hunt for vulnerability of functions.
  Combining identifier splitting, which splits each function name into its
constituent words, with a novel frequency-based algorithm, we explore the
extent to which the words that make up a function's name can predict
potentially vulnerable functions. In contrast to *lightweight* predictions by a
DNN that considers only function names, avoiding the use of a DNN provides
*featherweight* predictions. The underlying idea is that function names that
contain certain ""dangerous"" words are more likely to accompany vulnerable
functions. Of course, this assumes that the frequency-based algorithm can be
properly tuned to focus on truly dangerous words.
  Because it is more transparent than a DNN, the frequency-based algorithm
enables us to investigate the inner workings of the DNN. If successful, this
investigation into what the DNN does and does not learn will help us train more
effective future models.
  We empirically evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset containing
over 73000 functions labeled vulnerable, and over 950000 functions labeled
benign. Our analysis shows that words alone account for a significant portion
of the DNN's classification ability. We also find that words are of greatest
value in the datasets with a more homogeneous vocabulary. Thus, when working
within the scope of a given project, where the vocabulary is unavoidably
homogeneous, our approach provides a cheaper, potentially complementary,
technique to aid in the hunt for source-code vulnerabilities. Finally, this
approach has the advantage that it is viable with orders of magnitude less

Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo. It can reduce but not increase the
variance in Monte Carlo. For quasi-Monte Carlo it can bring about improved
regularity of the integrand with potentially greatly improved accuracy.
Pre-integration is ordinarily done by integrating out one of $d$ input
variables to a function. In the common case of a Gaussian integral one can also
pre-integrate over any linear combination of variables. We propose to do that
and we choose the first eigenvector in an active subspace decomposition to be
the pre-integrated linear combination. We find in numerical examples that this
active subspace pre-integration strategy is competitive with pre-integrating
the first variable in the principal components construction on the Asian option
where principal components are known to be very effective. It outperforms other
pre-integration methods on some basket options where there is no well
established default. We show theoretically that, just as in Monte Carlo,
pre-integration can reduce but not increase the variance when one uses
scrambled net integration. We show that the lead eigenvector in an active
subspace decomposition is closely related to the vector that maximizes a less
computationally tractable criterion using a Sobol' index to find the most
important linear combination of Gaussian variables. They optimize similar
expectations involving the gradient. We show that the Sobol' index criterion
for the leading eigenvector is invariant to the way that one chooses the
remaining $d-1$ eigenvectors with which to sample the Gaussian vector.

chondrites. The remarkable feature of FGRs is their submicron-sized and
non-porous nature. The typical thickness of FGRs around chondrules is 10--100
$\mu$m. Recently, a novel idea was proposed for the origin of FGRs: high-speed
collisions between chondrules and fine dust grains called the kinetic dust
aggregation process. Experimental studies revealed that (sub)micron-sized
ceramic particles can stick to a ceramic substrate in a vacuum when the impact
velocity is approximately in the range of 0.1--1 km/s. In this study, we
examine the possibility of FGR formation via kinetic dust aggregation in
chondrule-forming shock waves. When shock waves are created by undifferentiated
icy planetesimals, fine dust grains would be released from the planetary
surface due to evaporation of icy planetesimals. We consider the dynamics of
chondrules behind the shock front and calculate the growth of FGRs via kinetic
dust aggregation based on simple one-dimensional calculations. We found that
non-porous FGRs with the thickness of 10--100 $\mu$m would be formed in shock
waves around evaporating icy planetesimals.

gain to enhance detection/estimation performance. In Stage 1, the base station
(BS) sends downlink pilots (DP) for initial target search, and the user sends
uplink pilots (UP) for channel estimation. Then the BS performs joint target
detection and channel estimation based on the reflected DP and received UP
signals. In Stage 2, the BS exploits the prior information obtained in Stage 1
to optimize the DP signal to achieve beamforming gain and further refine the
performance. A Turbo Sparse Bayesian inference algorithm is proposed for joint
target detection and channel estimation in both stages. The pilot optimization
problem in Stage 2 is a semi-definite programming with rank-1 constraints. By
replacing the rank-1 constraint with a tight and smooth approximation, we
propose an efficient pilot optimization algorithm based on the

non-singular cosmological scenario in which the universe initially contracts
through an ekpyrotic phase having a bouncing like behaviour, and following the
bounce, it smoothly transits to a matter or radiation like deceleration era
which is further smoothly connected to the dark energy era at present epoch. We
consider the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling function in such a way that it gets
compatible with the event GW170817. Using suitable reconstruction technique, we
obtain the non-trivial scalar field potential as well as the GB coupling
function. Such scalar potential and GB coupling function source a smooth
unified scenario from an ekpyrotic bounce to the dark energy era with an
intermediate deceleration era. The occurrence of ekpyrotic contraction phase
justifies the resolution of the anisotropic problem (also known as BKL
instability) in the background evolution. The Hubble radius shows an asymmetric
behaviour around the bounce, in particular, the evolution of the Hubble radius
leads to the generation era of the primordial perturbation modes far before the
bounce in the deep sub-Hubble regime. Accordingly we perform the scalar and
tensor perturbation evolution in the present context, and as a result, the
scalar power spectrum at large scale modes is found to be problematic. Thus an
extended scenario is proposed where we consider a pre-ekpyrotic phase having
the equation of state parameter is less than unity, and re-examine the scalar
and tensor power spectra, on large scales that cross the Hubble radius during
the pre-ekpyrotic stage. In this regard, the GB coupling function shows
considerable effects in reducing the tensor to scalar ratio compared to the
case where the GB coupling is absent. Furthermore the dark energy epoch is
consistent with the Planck+SNe+BAO data.

Currently, many existing methods attempt to extract user potential interests
from historical click behavior sequences. However, it is difficult to handle
sparse user behaviors or broaden interest exploration. Recently, some
researchers incorporate the item-item co-occurrence graph as an auxiliary. Due
to the elusiveness of user interests, those works still fail to determine the
real motivation of user click behaviors. Besides, those works are more biased
towards popular or similar commodities. They lack an effective mechanism to
break the diversity restrictions. In this paper, we point out two special
properties of triangles in the item-item graphs for recommendation systems:
Intra-triangle homophily and Inter-triangle heterophiy. Based on this, we
propose a novel and effective framework named Triangle Graph Interest Network
(TGIN). For each clicked item in user behavior sequences, we introduce the
triangles in its neighborhood of the item-item graphs as a supplement. TGIN
regards these triangles as the basic units of user interests, which provide the
clues to capture the real motivation for a user clicking an item. We
characterize every click behavior by aggregating the information of several
interest units to alleviate the elusive motivation problem. The attention
mechanism determines users' preference for different interest units. By
selecting diverse and relative triangles, TGIN brings in novel and
serendipitous items to expand exploration opportunities of user interests.
Then, we aggregate the multi-level interests of historical behavior sequences
to improve CTR prediction. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial
datasets clearly verify the effectiveness of our framework.

Hyper-convolutions decouple kernel size from the total number of learnable
parameters, enabling a more flexible architecture design. We demonstrate in our

improve performance with less parameters, and increase robustness against

text is contrary to what is expressed. Further, the use of code-mix language to
express sarcasm is increasing day by day. Current NLP techniques for code-mix

a method that explicitly encourages face manipulation to focus on the intended

one dimensional Brownian motion in the presence of stochastic resetting. A
first-passage functional is defined as $V=\int_0^{t_f} Z[x(\tau)]$ where $t_f$
is the first-passage time of a reset Brownian process $x(\tau)$, i.e., the
first time the process crosses zero. In here, the particle is reset to $x_R>0$
at a constant rate $r$ starting from $x_0>0$ and we focus on the following
functionals: (i) local time $T_{loc} = \int _0^{t_f}d \tau ~ \delta (x-x_R)$,
(ii) residence time $T_{res} = \int _0^{t_f} d \tau ~\theta (x-x_R)$, and (iii)
functionals of the form $A_n = \int _{0}^{t_f} d \tau [x(\tau)]^n $ with $n
>-2$. For first two functionals, we analytically derive the exact expressions
for the moments and distributions. Interestingly, the residence time moments
reach minima at some optimal resetting rates. A similar phenomena is also
observed for the moments of the functional $A_n$. Finally, we show that the
distribution of $A_n$ for large $A_n$ decays exponentially as $\sim
\text{exp}\left( -A_n/a_n\right)$ for all values of $n$ and the corresponding
decay length $a_n$ is also estimated. In particular, exact distribution for the
first passage time under resetting (which corresponds to the $n=0$ case) is
derived and shown to be exponential at large time limit in accordance with the
generic observation. This behavioural drift from the underlying process can be
understood as a ramification due to the resetting mechanism which curtails the
undesired long Brownian first passage trajectories and leads to an accelerated
completion. We confirm our results to high precision by numerical simulations.

sample size usually needs to be considerably large resulting in a long
computing time to obtain a single approximation. In this paper we introduce a
new approximation strategy for parametric approximation problems including the
parametric financial pricing problems described above. A central aspect of the
approximation strategy proposed in this article is to combine MC algorithms
with machine learning techniques to, roughly speaking, learn the random
variables (LRV) in MC simulations. In other words, we employ stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods not to train parameters of standard
artificial neural networks (ANNs) but to learn random variables appearing in MC
approximations. We numerically test the LRV strategy on various parametric
problems with convincing results when compared with standard MC simulations,
Quasi-Monte Carlo simulations, SGD-trained shallow ANNs, and SGD-trained deep
ANNs. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that the LRV strategy might
be capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the $L^\infty$-norm in
several cases where the standard deep learning approach has been proven not to
be able to do so. This is not a contradiction to lower bounds established in
the scientific literature because this new LRV strategy is outside of the class
of algorithms for which lower bounds have been established in the scientific
literature. The proposed LRV strategy is of general nature and not only
restricted to the parametric financial pricing problems described above, but
applicable to a large class of approximation problems.

to consider the phenomenon of deactivation by coking. In this framework, the
interaction of internal particle pore structure and mass transfer under the

investigation has been performed as an introduction to the development of the
model. Then, the effect of structural features namely macroporosity and pore
size ratio, the deactivation properties, the maximum loading of coke as well as
the transport properties, the pore Damkohler number on the net reaction rate
and deactivation of the particle have been investigated. Three deactivation
mechanisms are accounted for, namely, the site coverage, the pore narrowing,
and the pore blockage. It is found that the deactivation of the catalyst
particle can be divided into two conditions: the kineticsal deactivation and
the structural deactivation. It is shown that depending on the Damkohler
number, increasing the macroporosity does not necessarily improve the
reactivity and deactivation resistance of the catalyst. The key finding of this
work is to demonstrate and quantify how changing the typical fresh catalyst
microstructure observed in the experimental characterization into a

acoustic instability of the inhomogeneous cylindrical plasma. This instability
is spatially localized in the region of strong gradients of the helicon wave
electric field and of the plasma density, where it is more stronger than the
parametric instabilities driven by the oscillating motion of the electrons
relative to ions in the helicon wave.

suspensions is studied based on Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Two-dimensional
configuration is considered, and a skeletal chemical mechanism (24 species and
104 reactions) is applied for methane combustion. The gas and particulate phase
equations are solved using an OpenFOAM code for two-phase compressible reacting
flow, RYrhoCentralFOAM. The effects of char combustion on methane detonation
dynamics are investigated and devolatized coal particles are modelled. The
results show that propagation of the methane detonation wave in coal particle
suspensions are considerably affected by coal particle concentration and size.
Detonation extinction occurs when the coal particle size is small and
concentration is high. The averaged lead shock speed generally decreases with
increased particle concentration and decreased particle size. Mean structure of
methane and coal particle hybrid detonation is analysed, based on the gas and
particle quantities. It is found that char combustion proceeds in the subsonic
region behind the detonation wave and heat release is relatively distributed
compared to that from gas phase reaction. Moreover, for 1 {\mu}m particle, if
the particle concentration is beyond a threshold value, detonation
re-initiation occurs after it is quenched at the beginning of the coal dust
suspensions. This is caused by hot spots from the shock focusing along the
reaction front in a decoupled detonation and these shocks are generated from
char combustion behind the lead shock. A regime map of detonation propagation
and extinction is predicted. It is found that the re-initiation location
decreases with the particle concentration and approaches a constant value when
the concentration exceeds 1000 g/m3. The results from this study are useful for
prevention and suppression of methane/coal dust hybrid explosion.

automatically synthesized by the model. The network is trained as a usual
Variational Autoencoder with a negative loglikelihood loss between training and
reconstructed images. No additional loss is required for $\hat{x_1},\hat{x_2}$
or $\sigma$, neither any form of human tuning. The decomposition is
nondeterministic, but follows two main schemes, that we may roughly categorize
as either \say{syntactic} or \say{semantic}. In the first case, the map tends
to exploit the strong correlation between adjacent pixels, splitting the image
in two complementary high frequency sub-images. In the second case, the map
typically focuses on the contours of objects, splitting the image in
interesting variations of its content, with more marked and distinctive
features. In this case, according to empirical observations, the Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) of $\hat{x_1}$ and $\hat{x_2}$ is usually lower (hence
better) than that of $\hat{x}$, that clearly suffers from being the average of
the former. In a sense, a SVAE forces the Variational Autoencoder to make
choices, in contrast with its intrinsic tendency to {\em average} between
alternatives with the aim to minimize the reconstruction loss towards a
specific sample. According to the FID metric, our technique, tested on typical
datasets such as Mnist, Cifar10 and CelebA, allows us to outperform all
previous purely variational architectures (not relying on normalization flows).

reflecting the marginal role played by $s$-electrons. In the superconducting
state, we observe a reduction of the Knight shift and an exponential decrease
of the NMR relaxation rate $1/T_1$, typical of $s$-wave superconductivity. This
is further supported by the observation of a small but distinct coherence peak
just below $T_c$ in the $^{13}$C NMR relaxation-rate, in agreement with the
fully-gapped superconducting state inferred from the electronic specific-heat

single particle of each type. We assume that particle types differ from each
other not only by the laws of branching, as in multi-type branching processes,
but also by the laws of walking. For a critical branching process at each
lattice point and recurrent random walk of particles, the effect of limit
spatial clustering of particles over the lattice is studied. A model
illustrating epidemic propagation is also considered. In this model, we
consider two types of particles: infected and immunity generated. Initially,
there is an infected particle that can infect others. Here, for the local
number of particles of each type at a lattice point, we study the moments and
their limiting behavior. Additionally, the effect of intermittency of the
infected particles is studied for a supercritical branching process at each
lattice point. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effect of limit
clustering for the epidemiological model.

demonstrate that the water molecule can be spontaneously dissociated on GO
supported by the (111) surface of the copper substrate (Copper-GO). This
process involves a proton transferring from water to the interfacial oxygen
group, and a hydroxide covalently bonding to GO. Compared to that on GO, the
water dissociation barrier on Copper-GO is significantly decreased to be less
than or comparable to thermal fluctuations. This is ascribed to the
orbital-hybridizing interaction between copper substrate and GO, which enhances
the reaction activity of interfacial oxygen groups along the basal plane of GO
for water dissociation. Our work provides a novel strategy to access water
dissociation via the substrate-enhanced reaction activity of interfacial oxygen
groups on GO and indicates that the substrate can serve as an essential key to
tuning the catalytic performance of various two-dimensional material devices.

linear regressions, in which the plant matrices and state initial conditions
are the unknown parameters. Secondly, such regressions are substituted into the

exponential rate of convergence. To the best of the authors knowledge, such a
method is the first one to provide the following features simultaneously: 1) it
is applicable for the generic completely unknown MIMO systems (e.g. without any
information about state or control allocation matrices, the sign of the latter,

tracking errors under the mild requirement of the regressor finite excitation;
3) it ensures monotonicity of the transient curves of the control law

a rapidly rotating density-stratified layer of fluid is subject to a meridional
temperature gradient in thermal wind balance with a uniform vertically sheared
zonal flow. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we show that the
transport properties of the resulting turbulent flow are governed by
quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics in the rapidly rotating strongly stratified
regime. The 'vortex gas' scaling predictions put forward in the context of the
two-layer QG model carry over to this fully 3D system: the functional
dependence of the meridional flux on the control parameters is the same, the
two ajustable parameters entering the theory taking slightly different values.
In line with the QG prediction, the meridional buoyancy flux is
depth-independent. The vertical buoyancy flux is such that turbulence
transports buoyancy along isopycnals, except in narrow layers near the the top
and bottom boundaries, the thickness of which decreases as the diffusivities go
to zero. The emergent (re)stratification is set by a simple balance between the
vertical buoyancy flux and diffusion along the vertical direction. Overall,
this study demonstrates how the vortex-gas scaling theory can be adapted to
quantitatively predict the magnitude and vertical structure of the meridional
and vertical buoyancy fluxes, and of the emergent stratification, without
additional fitting parameters.

models that exhibit remarkable empirical performance. Score-based generative
modelling (SGM) consists of a ``noising'' stage, whereby a diffusion is used to
gradually add Gaussian noise to data, and a generative model, which entails a
``denoising'' process defined by approximating the time-reversal of the
diffusion. Existing SGMs assume that data is supported on a Euclidean space,
i.e. a manifold with flat geometry. In many domains such as robotics,
geoscience or protein modelling, data is often naturally described by
distributions living on Riemannian manifolds and current SGM techniques are not
appropriate. We introduce here Riemannian Score-based Generative Models
(RSGMs), a class of generative models extending SGMs to Riemannian manifolds.
We demonstrate our approach on a variety of manifolds, and in particular with
earth and climate science spherical data.

increased the speed of data acquisition, labeling of virtual slides requires a
substantial time investment from pathologists. Eye gaze annotations have the
potential to speed up the slide labeling process. This work explores the
viability and timing comparisons of eye gaze labeling compared to conventional
manual labeling for training object detectors. Challenges associated with gaze
based labeling and methods to refine the coarse data annotations for subsequent
object detection are also discussed. Results demonstrate that gaze tracking
based labeling can save valuable pathologist time and delivers good performance
when employed for training a deep object detector. Using the task of
localization of Keratin Pearls in cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma as a
test case, we compare the performance gap between deep object detectors trained
using hand-labelled and gaze-labelled data. On average, compared to
`Bounding-box' based hand-labeling, gaze-labeling required $57.6\%$ less time
per label and compared to `Freehand' labeling, gaze-labeling required on
average $85\%$ less time per label.

alternatives to the unfeasible direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent

observational constraints, it is a formidable challenge to determine if these
strategies adequately capture the physics of the system. Here we address this
problem by analyzing numerical convergence of ILES of turbulent convection in
2D, with resolutions between $64^2$ and $2048^2$ grid points, along with the
estimation of their effective viscosities, resulting in effective Reynolds
numbers between $1$ and $\sim10^4$. The thermodynamic structure of our model
resembles the solar interior, including a fraction of the radiative zone and
the convection zone. In the convective layer, the ILES solutions converge for
the simulations with $\ge 512^2$ grid points, as evidenced by the integral
properties of the flow and its power spectra. Most importantly, we found that
even a resolution of $128^2$ grid points, Re$\sim10$, is sufficient to capture
the dynamics of the large scales accurately. This is a consequence of the ILES
method allowing that the energy contained in these scales is the same in
simulations with low and high resolution. Special attention is needed in
regions with a small density scale height driving the formation of fine
structures unresolved by the numerical grid. In the stable layer we found the
excitation of internal gravity waves, yet high resolution is needed to capture
their development and interaction.

showing the rate is either exponentially fast (with a rate constant predicted

presence of non-integrable zero modes). In the first case, the nonlinear
dynamics are well-approximated by exponentially decaying eigenmodes up to at

important quantity that plays a crucial role in distribution estimation,
particularly in the large alphabet regime. In this work, we consider the
problem of estimation of missing mass, which has been well-studied under
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) sampling, in the case when
sampling is ""sticky"". Precisely, we consider the scenario where each sample
from an unknown distribution gets repeated a geometrically-distributed number
of times. We characterise the minimax rate of Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
estimating missing mass from such sticky sampling channels. An upper bound on
the minimax rate is obtained by bounding the risk of a modified Good-Turing

in the number of parameters and FLOPs, but there was little improvement to the

investigate whether parameter-free operations such as the max-pool are

heavily used as the main building block without sacrificing the model accuracy
as much. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the

regime that captures the asymptotic behavior of boundary vortices generated by

notion of ""global Jacobian"" detecting the topological defects that a priori

difficulty consists in estimating the nonlocal part of the micromagnetic energy

the renormalized energy that represents the interaction between the boundary

proposed to translate a given image into diverse outputs. Despite the

domains, so the multi-domain I2I translation still remains a challenge. To
address this problem, we propose a novel multi-domain unsupervised
image-to-image translation (MDUIT) framework that leverages the decomposed
content feature and appearance adaptive convolution to translate an image into
a target appearance while preserving the given geometric content. We also
exploit a contrast learning objective, which improves the disentanglement
ability and effectively utilizes multi-domain image data in the training
process by pairing the semantically similar images. This allows our method to
learn the diverse mappings between multiple visual domains with only a single
framework. We show that the proposed method produces visually diverse and
plausible results in multiple domains compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

only a minor degradation in accuracy w.r.t. the full-precision version of the

Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. We show that an agent, after being trained
exclusively on the SE, is able to solve the corresponding real environment.
While an SE acts as a full proxy to a real environment by learning about its
state dynamics and rewards, an RN is a partial proxy that learns to augment or
replace rewards. We use bi-level optimization to evolve SEs and RNs: the inner
loop trains the RL agent, and the outer loop trains the parameters of the SE /
RN via an evolution strategy. We evaluate our proposed new concept on a broad
range of RL algorithms and classic control environments. In a one-to-one
comparison, learning an SE proxy requires more interactions with the real
environment than training agents only on the real environment. However, once
such an SE has been learned, we do not need any interactions with the real
environment to train new agents. Moreover, the learned SE proxies allow us to
train agents with fewer interactions while maintaining the original task
performance. Our empirical results suggest that SEs achieve this result by
learning informed representations that bias the agents towards relevant states.
Moreover, we find that these proxies are robust against hyperparameter
variation and can also transfer to unseen agents.

strongly-interacting electrons in ultrapure conductors can display signatures
of hydrodynamic behavior including negative nonlocal resistance, Poiseuille
flow in narrow channels, and a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. Here we
provide the first visualization of whirlpools in an electron fluid. By
utilizing a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device on a
tip (SQUID-on-tip) we image the current distribution in a circular chamber
connected through a small aperture to an adjacent narrow current carrying strip
in high-purity type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2. In this geometry, the Gurzhi
momentum diffusion length and the size of the aperture determine the vortex
stability phase diagram. We find that the vortices are present only for small
apertures, whereas the flow is laminar (non-vortical) for larger apertures,
consistent with the theoretical analysis of the hydrodynamic regime and in
contrast to the expectations of ballistic transport in WTe2 at low
temperatures. Moreover, near the vortical-to-laminar transition, we observe a
single vortex in the chamber splitting into two vortices, a behavior that can
occur only in the hydrodynamic regime and cannot be sustained by ballistic
transport. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of hydrodynamic flow:
instead of the commonly considered electron-electron scattering at the bulk,
which becomes extremely weak at low temperatures, the spatial diffusion of

tasks in database systems, such as columnstore compression and data profiling.
In this work, we focus on how to derive accurate NDV estimations from random
(online/offline) samples. Such efficient estimation is critical for tasks where
it is prohibitive to scan the data even once. Existing sample-based estimators
typically rely on heuristics or assumptions and do not have robust performance
across different datasets as the assumptions on data can easily break. On the
other hand, deriving an estimator from a principled formulation such as maximum
likelihood estimation is very challenging due to the complex structure of the
formulation. We propose to formulate the NDV estimation task in a supervised
learning framework, and aim to learn a model as the estimator. To this end, we
need to answer several questions: i) how to make the learned model workload
agnostic; ii) how to obtain training data; iii) how to perform model training.
We derive conditions of the learning framework under which the learned model is
workload agnostic, in the sense that the model/estimator can be trained with
synthetically generated training data, and then deployed into any data
warehouse simply as, e.g., user-defined functions (UDFs), to offer efficient
(within microseconds on CPU) and accurate NDV estimations for unseen tables and
workloads. We compare the learned estimator with the state-of-the-art
sample-based estimators on nine real-world datasets to demonstrate its superior
estimation accuracy. We publish our code for training data generation, model
training, and the learned estimator online for reproducibility.

domain to a related but label-scarce target domain. The conventional DA
strategy is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. Recently,
increasing researches have focused on self-training or other semi-supervised
algorithms to explore the data structure of the target domain. However, the
bulk of them depend largely on confident samples in order to build reliable
pseudo labels, prototypes or cluster centers. Representing the target data
structure in such a way would overlook the huge low-confidence samples,
resulting in sub-optimal transferability that is biased towards the samples
similar to the source domain. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel
contrastive learning method by processing low-confidence samples, which
encourages the model to make use of the target data structure through the
instance discrimination process. To be specific, we create positive and
negative pairs only using low-confidence samples, and then re-represent the
original features with the classifier weights rather than directly utilizing
them, which can better encode the task-specific semantic information.
Furthermore, we combine cross-domain mixup to augment the proposed contrastive
loss. Consequently, the domain gap can be well bridged through contrastive
learning of intermediate representations across domains. We evaluate the
proposed method in both unsupervised and semi-supervised DA settings, and
extensive experimental results on benchmarks reveal that our method is
effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code can be found in

Einstein's cosmological constant; and it amounts to about 70% of the total mass
of the universe. It has been conjectured that the cosmological constant is a
form of vacuum energy, but its prediction from quantum field theory has failed
by many orders of magnitude, until recently. Informed by empirical evidence on
Casimir forces, Lifshitz theory has not only produced the correct order of

Moreover, the theory appears to resolve the tension between the measured and

physics explains dark energy. This article introduces cosmology for

However, no such extension has been formulated that consistently describes

We answer this question within the framework of general probabilistic theories,
which is the most general framework for physical theories. We construct the set
of states of a system that result from imposing PT-symmetry on the set of
observables, and show that the resulting theory allows only one trivial state.
We next consider the constraint of quasi-Hermiticity on observables, which
guarantees the unitarity of evolution under a Hamiltonian with unbroken
PT-symmetry. We show that such a system is equivalent to a standard quantum
system. Finally, we show that if all observables are quasi-Hermitian as well as
PT-symmetric, then the system is equivalent to a real quantum system. Thus our
results show that neither PT-symmetry nor quasi-Hermiticity constraints are
sufficient to extend standard quantum theory consistently.

time in training and validating the model. Thereafter Support Vector Machine
performed better among rest of the models but with increase in the size of data
set, Stochastic Gradient Descent performed better than Support Vector Machine.

determination of the mechanical properties of Fly ash composites.These
composites have attracted attention,especially in the form of reinforcements
owing to their excellent tensile and compressive properties coupled with impact
and hardness response.A number of techniques viz.in-situ deposition, hand-up
lay and compo-casting techniques have been reported to fabricate these
composites.However,in the context of these composites,a systematic
structure-property correlation has not been established till date.The present
review is aimed at highlighting the current state of research in the avenue of
Fly ash composites from two different viewpoints,viz.(i)fabrication technique
and (ii)mechanical properties of the fabricated composites.Moreover,the
necessity of establishing systematic structure-property correlation in these
materials has also been briefly discussed from the author viewpoint.

  internal interfaces",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Solute decoration at grain boundaries (GB) leads to a number of phenomenon
such as changes in interface structure,mobility,cohesion etc.Recent
experimental investigations on interfacial segregation in steels are based on
microstructural characterisation using two correlative methodologies,
namely,Transmission Electron Microscopy-Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and
Electron Backscatter Diffraction-APT.Considering the growing interest in this
avenue,the present review is aimed at addressing the common adsorption
isotherms used for quantifying interfacial segregation and providing an
overview of the present state of experimental research in the area of GB
segregation in steels.The areas where an understanding of GB segregation may be
utilised have also been highlighted with a focus on the experimental challenges
associated with understanding GB segregation in steels.

handle computation-intensive tasks locally, hence the cloud based computation
offloading is widely adopted. However, for the business which requires low
latency and high reliability, the cloud-based solution is not suitable, because
of the slow response time caused by long distance data transmission. Therefore,
to solve the problem mentioned above, in this paper, we introduce fog computing
into swarm of drones (FCSD). Focusing on the latency and reliability sensitive
business scenarios, the latency and reliability is constructed as the
constraints of the optimization problem. And in order to enhance the
practicality of the FCSD system, we formulate the energy consumption of FCSD as
the optimization target function, to decrease the energy consumption as far as
possible, under the premise of satisfying the latency and reliability
requirements of the task. Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm based on genetic
algorithm is designed to perform optimal task allocation in FCSD system. The
simulation results validate that the proposed fog based computation offloading
with the heuristic algorithm can complete the computing task effectively with
the minimal energy consumption under the requirements of latency and
reliability.

deflating the price of a security. Generally, manipulation is defined as a
series of transactions designed to raise or lower a price of a security or to
give the appearance of trading for the purpose of inducing others to buy or
sell. In essence, a manipulation is intentional interference with the free
forces of supply and demand. In this paper we have tried to study the reasons
behind drastic fall in share price of Nutek India Limited.
