investigation of dynamics of the Yang-Mills gauge fields and of the
gravitational systems, as well as its application in the Monte Carlo method and
fluid dynamics. In ergodic theory the maximally chaotic dynamical systems
(MCDS) can be defined as dynamical systems that have nonzero Kolmogorov
entropy. The hyperbolic dynamical systems that fulfil the Anosov C-condition
belong to the MCDS insofar as they have exponential instability of their phase
trajectories and positive Kolmogorov entropy. It follows that the C-condition
defines a rich class of MCDS that span over an open set in the space of all
dynamical systems. The large class of Anosov-Kolmogorov MCDS is realised on
Riemannian manifolds of negative sectional curvatures and on high-dimensional
tori. The interest in MCDS is rooted in the attempts to understand the
relaxation phenomena, the foundations of the statistical mechanics, the
appearance of turbulence in fluid dynamics, the non-linear dynamics of
Yang-Mills field and gravitating N-body systems as well as black hole
thermodynamics. Our aim is to investigate classical- and quantum-mechanical
properties of MCDS and their role in the theory of fundamental interactions.

or personalized, and this poses challenges to the convergence of standard FL
schemes that do not account for personalization. To address this, we present a
new approach for personalized FL that achieves exact stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) minimization. We start from the FedPer (Arivazhagan et al., 2019)
neural network (NN) architecture for personalization, whereby the NN has two
types of layers: the first ones are the common layers across clients, while the
few final ones are client-specific and are needed for personalization. We
propose a novel SGD-type scheme where, at each optimization round, randomly
selected clients perform gradient-descent updates over their client-specific
weights towards optimizing the loss function on their own datasets, without
updating the common weights. At the final update, each client computes the
joint gradient over both client-specific and common weights and returns the
gradient of common parameters to the server. This allows to perform an exact
and unbiased SGD step over the full set of parameters in a distributed manner,
i.e. the updates of the personalized parameters are performed by the clients
and those of the common ones by the server. Our method is superior to FedAvg
and FedPer baselines in multi-class classification benchmarks such as Omniglot,
CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST and has much lower computational
complexity per round.

non-Gaussian operations, viz., photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon
catalysis on a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. Since these non-Gaussian
operations are probabilistic, it is of utmost importance to take the success
probability into account. To this end, we consider the realistic model of
photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis and derive a single expression of
the Wigner function for photon subtracted, added, and catalyzed TMSV state. The
Wigner function is used to evaluate the lower bound on the phase sensitivity
via quantum Cramer-Rao bound and parity detection based phase sensitivity in
MZI. We identify the ranges of squeezing and transmissivity parameters where
the non-Gaussian states provide better phase sensitivity than the TMSV state.
On qualitatively taking the success probability into account, it turns out that
the photon addition is the most advantageous non-Gaussian operation. We hope
that the generalized Wigner function derived in this work will be useful in
various quantum information protocols and state characterization.

Recently, deep learning-based brain tumor detection techniques have gained
attention due to their higher performance. However, obtaining the expected
performance of such deep learning-based systems requires large amounts of
classified images to train the deep models. Obtaining such data is usually
boring, time-consuming, and can easily be exposed to human mistakes which
hinder the utilization of such deep learning approaches. This paper introduces
a novel framework for brain tumor detection and classification. The basic idea
is to generate a large synthetic MRI images dataset that reflects the typical
pattern of the brain MRI images from a small class-unbalanced collected
dataset. The resulted dataset is then used for training a deep model for
detection and classification. Specifically, we employ two types of deep models.
The first model is a generative model to capture the distribution of the
important features in a set of small class-unbalanced brain MRI images. Then by
using this distribution, the generative model can synthesize any number of
brain MRI images for each class. Hence, the system can automatically convert a
small unbalanced dataset to a larger balanced one. The second model is the
classifier that is trained using the large balanced dataset to detect brain
tumors in MRI images. The proposed framework acquires an overall detection
accuracy of 96.88% which highlights the promise of the proposed framework as an
accurate low-overhead brain tumor detection system.

wherein predicting each type of user feedback on items (e.g, click, purchase)
are treated as individual tasks and jointly trained with a unified model. Our
key observation is that the prediction results of each task may contain
task-specific knowledge about user's fine-grained preference towards items.
While such knowledge could be transferred to benefit other tasks, it is being
overlooked under the current MTL paradigm. This paper, instead, proposes a
Cross-Task Knowledge Distillation framework that attempts to leverage
prediction results of one task as supervised signals to teach another task.
However, integrating MTL and KD in a proper manner is non-trivial due to
several challenges including task conflicts, inconsistent magnitude and
requirement of synchronous optimization. As countermeasures, we 1) introduce
auxiliary tasks with quadruplet loss functions to capture cross-task
fine-grained ranking information and avoid task conflicts, 2) design a
calibrated distillation approach to align and distill knowledge from auxiliary
tasks, and 3) propose a novel error correction mechanism to enable and
facilitate synchronous training of teacher and student models. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world datasets.

weight. This represents a crucial difference with alternative specifications
proposed in the recent literature, with relevant implications for the
flexibility of the model.

how an external agent can promote cooperation between artificial learners by
distributing additional rewards and punishments based on observing the actions

right incentives by considering the anticipated parameter updates of each
agent. Using this learning rule leads to cooperation with high social welfare
in matrix games in which the agents would otherwise learn to defect with high
probability. We show that the resulting cooperative outcome is stable in
certain games even if the planning agent is turned off after a given number of
episodes, while other games require ongoing intervention to maintain mutual
cooperation. Finally, we reflect on what the goals of multi-agent reinforcement
learning should be in the first place, and discuss the necessary building

of building ever-more complex programs through (often informal) logical
reasoning in the programmers' mind, complex 'AI' systems are built by
optimising generic neural network models with big data. In this new paradigm,
AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch play a key role, which is as
essential as the compiler for traditional programs. It is known that the lack
of a proper semantics for programming languages (such as C), i.e., a
correctness specification for compilers, has contributed to many problematic
program behaviours and security issues. While it is in general hard to have a
correctness specification for compilers due to the high complexity of
programming languages and their rapid evolution, we have a unique opportunity
to do it right this time for neural networks (which have a limited set of
functions, and most of them have stable semantics). In this work, we report our
effort on providing a correctness specification of neural network frameworks
such as TensorFlow. We specify the semantics of almost all TensorFlow layers in
the logical programming language Prolog. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
semantics through two applications. One is a fuzzing engine for TensorFlow,
which features a strong oracle and a systematic way of generating valid neural
networks. The other is a model validation approach which enables consistent bug
reporting for TensorFlow models.

more versatile and flexible. This usually renders the system kinematically
redundant: the main manipulation or interaction task does not fully determine
its joint maneuvers. Additional constraints or objectives are required to solve
the under-determined control and planning problems. The state-of-the-art
approaches arrange tasks in a hierarchy and decouple lower from higher priority
tasks on velocity or torque level using projectors. We develop an approach to
redundancy resolution and decoupling on position level by determining subspaces
of the configurations space that are independent of the task. We call them
orthogonal foliations because they are, in a certain sense, orthogonal to the
task self-motion manifolds. The approach provides a better insight into the
topological properties of robot kinematics and control problems, allowing a
global view. A condition for the existence of orthogonal foliations is derived.
If the condition is not satisfied, we will still find approximate solutions by
numerical optimization. Coordinates can be defined on these orthogonal
foliations and can be used as additional task variables for control. We show in
simulations that we can control the system without the need for projectors
using these coordinates; and we validate the approach experimentally on a 7-DoF

numerical analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data. With the sampled
spectrum parametrized with delta-functions in continuous frequency space, a
calculation of the configurational entropy lends support to a simple
goodness-of-fit criterion for the optimal sampling temperature. To further
investigate entropic effects, we compare spectra sampled in continuous
frequency with results of amplitudes sampled on a fixed frequency grid. We
demonstrate equivalences between sampling and optimizing spectral functions
with the maximum-entropy approach with different forms of the entropy. These
insights revise prevailing notions of the maximum-entropy method and its
relationship to stochastic analytic continuation. We further explore various
adjustable (optimized) constraints that allow sharp spectral features to be
resolved, in particular at the lower frequency edge. The constraints, e.g., the
location of the edge or the spectral weight of a quasi-particle peak, are
optimized using a statistical criterion. We show that this method can correctly
reproduce both narrow and broad quasi-particle peaks. We next introduce a
parametrization for more intricate spectral functions with sharp edges, e.g.,
power-law singularities. Tests with synthetic data as well as with real
simulation data for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain demonstrate that constrained
sampling methods can reproduce spectral functions with sharp edge features at
unprecedented fidelity. We present new results for S=1/2 Heisenberg 2-leg and
3-leg ladders to illustrate the ability of the methods to resolve spectral
features arising from both elementary and composite excitations. Finally, we
also propose how the methods developed here could be used as ""pre processors""

collected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed
in different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as
we uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned
superficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) need
revisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the
mechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to
use ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal
that, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors

Therefore, we treat NID as a time-sensitive task and propose NetSentry, perhaps

  Explainability Techniques for Identifying Predictive Variables",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine Learning explainability techniques have been proposed as a means of
`explaining' or interrogating a model in order to understand why a particular
decision or prediction has been made. Such an ability is especially important
at a time when machine learning is being used to automate decision processes
which concern sensitive factors and legal outcomes. Indeed, it is even a
requirement according to EU law. Furthermore, researchers concerned with
imposing overly restrictive functional form (e.g., as would be the case in a
linear regression) may be motivated to use machine learning algorithms in
conjunction with explainability techniques, as part of exploratory research,
with the goal of identifying important variables which are associated with an
outcome of interest. For example, epidemiologists might be interested in
identifying `risk factors' - i.e. factors which affect recovery from disease -
by using random forests and assessing variable relevance using importance
measures. However, and as we demonstrate, machine learning algorithms are not
as flexible as they might seem, and are instead incredibly sensitive to the
underling causal structure in the data. The consequences of this are that
predictors which are, in fact, critical to a causal system and highly
correlated with the outcome, may nonetheless be deemed by explainability
techniques to be unrelated/unimportant/unpredictive of the outcome. Rather than
this being a limitation of explainability techniques per se, we show that it is
rather a consequence of the mathematical implications of regression, and the
interaction of these implications with the associated conditional
independencies of the underlying causal structure. We provide some alternative
recommendations for researchers wanting to explore the data for important
variables.

cylinder (which corresponds to the haloscope setup). If the axion amplitude
depends on time only, the axions give rise to an oscillating electric current
in the $z$ direction. We estimate the magnitudes of the azimuthal magnetic
fields and the accompanying Joule heating in the cylinder, taking the cylinder
to have ordinary dissipative properties. We evaluate and calculate the electric
current and the heat production separately, without using the effective
approximation, both when there is a strong magnetic field and when there is a
strong electric one, showing that with the magnetic field there is a heat
production, while with the electric field there is not.

present a nanostructure arising from local interactions. The influence of this
nanostructure on the macromolecular conformation of polymer chains is
investigated for the first time by means of an extensive use of small angle
neutron scattering on a series of poly(1-vinyl-3-alkylimidazolium)s with
varying alkyl side-chain length and counter-anion both in bulk and in dilute
solutions. Radii of gyration are found to increase with the side-chain length
in solution as a consequence of crowding interactions between neighboring
monomers. In bulk, however, a non monotonic evolution of the radius of gyration
reflects a change in chain flexibility and a potential screening of
electrostatic interactions. Additionally at smaller scale, SANS provides an
experimental estimation of both the chain diameter and the correlation length
between neighboring chains, comparison of which unveils clear evidence of
interdigitation of the alkyl side-chains. These structural features bring
precious insights in the understanding of the dynamic properties of PILs.

this characterization is that as the label noise variance $\sigma^2 \to 0$, any
estimator that incurs at least $\mathsf{c}\sigma^4$ training error for some
constant $\mathsf{c}$ is necessarily suboptimal and will suffer growth in
excess prediction error at least linear in the training error. Thus, optimal

ultra-reliable low-latency communications. Yet, when there are many devices
that tend to be active only intermittently, the fully orthogonal resource
allocation is largely inefficient. The solution is to employ a common, shared
pool of resources and account for the fact that some collisions and
interference will inevitably occur. In this contribution we study the
reliability aspects of such multi-user uplink communication scenario over a
shared pool of channel resources, where intermittently active devices utilize
multiple transmissions (K-repetition coding) to achieve diversity. We focus on
two access methods -- one where devices choose the K slots at random and one
where the access patterns are deterministic and follow a specific code design,
namely the Steiner System. We analyze the problem under two signal models that
involve different complexity for the receiver. Firstly, a model which treats
collisions as destructive, i.e. only those K' among K transmissions that do not
contain interference can be used and combined. Second, where receiver is
capable of utilizing all K replicas and applies maximum ratio combining (MRC)
treating interference as noise. Furthermore, in both cases we investigate the
receiver with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC)
capabilities. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop useful
approximations and bounds for the outage probabilities in the aforementioned
scenarios that match very closely the simulation results. We also show that
deterministic patterns have the potential to significantly outperform fully
random selection, both in terms of raw performance and by simplifying the
system design.

fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing

live in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased
levels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations and
beneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful
contagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these
contagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an
explicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed
by contagion remains elusive.
  We consider a model for the evolution of sociality strategies in the presence
of both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study the dynamics of this model
at three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model to
describe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a replicator equation
to study the changing fractions of two different levels of sociality, and an
adaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution of the population
level of sociality.
  For a wide range of assumptions about the benefits and costs of infection, we
identify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable sociality strategy (ESS)
is distinct from the collective optimum -- the level of sociality that would be
best for all individuals. In particular, the ESS level of social interaction is
greater (respectively less) than the social optimum when the good contagion
spreads more (respectively less) readily than the bad contagion.
  Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the evolution of social
interaction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily lead populations to
social structures that are good for any or all.

  Characterizing Statistical Evidence",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The conditionality principle $C$ plays a key role in attempts to characterize
the concept of statistical evidence. The standard version of $C$ considers a
model and a derived conditional model, formed by conditioning on an ancillary
statistic for the model, together with the data, to be equivalent with respect
to their statistical evidence content. This equivalence is considered to hold
for any ancillary statistic for the model but creates two problems. First,
there can be more than one maximal ancillary in a given context and this leads
to $C$ not being an equivalence relation and, as such, calls into question
whether $C$ is a proper characterization of statistical evidence. Second, a
statistic $A$ can change from ancillary to informative (in its marginal
distribution) when another ancillary $B$ changes, from having one known
distribution $P_{B},$ to having another known distribution $Q_{B}.$ This means
that the stability of ancillarity differs across ancillary statistics and
raises the issue of when a statistic can be said to be truly ancillary. It is
therefore natural, and practically important, to limit conditioning to the set
of ancillaries whose distribution is irrelevant to the ancillary status of any
other ancillary statistic. This results in a family of ancillaries for which
there is a unique maximal member. This also gives a new principle for
inference, the stable conditionality principle, that satisfies the criteria
required for any principle whose aim is to characterize statistical evidence.

  in diffusion-weighted imaging of the liver","Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"eess.IV physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: To develop an algorithm for the retrospective correction of signal
dropout artifacts in abdominal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) resulting from
cardiac motion.
  Methods: Given a set of image repetitions for a slice, a locally adaptive
weighted averaging is proposed which aims to suppress the contribution of image
regions affected by signal dropouts. Corresponding weight maps were estimated
by a sliding-window algorithm which analyzed signal deviations from a
patch-wise reference. In order to ensure the computation of a robust reference,
repetitions were filtered by a classifier that was trained to detect images
corrupted by signal dropouts. The proposed method, termed Deep Learning-guided
Adaptive Weighted Averaging (DLAWA), was evaluated in terms of dropout
suppression capability, bias reduction in the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient
(ADC) and noise characteristics.
  Results: In the case of uniform averaging, motion-related dropouts caused
signal attenuation and ADC overestimation in parts of the liver with the left
lobe being affected particularly. Both effects could be substantially mitigated
by DLAWA while preventing global penalties with respect to signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) due to local signal suppression. Performing evaluations on patient
data, the capability to recover lesions concealed by signal dropouts was
demonstrated as well. Further, DLAWA allowed for transparent control of the
trade-off between SNR and signal dropout suppression by means of a few
hyperparameters.
  Conclusion: This work presents an effective and flexible method for the local
compensation of signal dropouts resulting from motion and pulsation. Since
DLAWA follows a retrospective approach, no changes to the acquisition are
required.

interpreter for the target output variable over the input space. We introduce
an energy-based training process for the interpreter function, which

us to explore two other properties of SNRs that could serve as the basis of
future SNR searches. Specifically, most of the objects identified as SNRs on
the basis of [SII]:Halpha ratios exhibit more velocity broadening and lower
ratios of [SIII]:[SII] emission than HII regions. A search for nebulae with the
very broad emission lines expected from young, rapidly expanding remnants

non-colliding paths for agents in an environment, such that each agent reaches
its goal from its initial location. In safety-critical applications, a human
supervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free. To this
end, a recent work introduces a notion of explainability for MAPF based on a
visualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time
segments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are
disjoint. Then, the explainable MAPF problem asks for a set of non-colliding
paths that admits a short-enough explanation. Explainable MAPF adds a new
difficulty to MAPF, in that it is NP-hard with respect to the size of the
environment, and not just the number of agents. Thus, traditional MAPF
algorithms are not equipped to directly handle explainable-MAPF. In this work,
we adapt Conflict Based Search (CBS), a well-studied algorithm for MAPF, to
handle explainable MAPF. We show how to add explainability constraints on top
of the standard CBS tree and its underlying A* search. We examine the
usefulness of this approach and, in particular, the tradeoff between planning
time and explainability.

evaluated on a $\textit{single input point}$. Specifically, we study a point's
$\textit{profile}$: the relationship between models' average performance on the
test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We
find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and
data -- in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real
data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On
one hand, there are ""compatible"" points with strong correlation between the
pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with
weak and even $\textit{negative}$ correlation: cases where improving overall
model accuracy actually $\textit{hurts}$ performance on these inputs. We prove
that these experimental observations are inconsistent with the predictions of
several simplified models of learning proposed in prior work. As an
application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a

Instead of assuming cooperative and homogeneous robots using the same safe

models) to recursively localize objects within a search region. Several
strategies have been proposed in the literature to update a template based on
the tracker output, typically extracted from the target search region in the
current frame, and thereby mitigate the effects of target drift. However, this
may lead to corrupted templates, limiting the potential benefits of a template
update strategy.
  This paper proposes a model adaptation method for Siamese trackers that uses
a generative model to produce a synthetic template from the object search
regions of several previous frames, rather than directly using the tracker
output. Since the search region encompasses the target, attention from the
search region is used for robust model adaptation. In particular, our approach
relies on an auto-encoder trained through adversarial learning to detect
changes in a target object's appearance and predict a future target template,
using a set of target templates localized from tracker outputs at previous
frames. To prevent template corruption during the update, the proposed tracker
also performs change detection using the generative model to suspend updates
until the tracker stabilizes, and robust matching can resume through dynamic
template fusion.
  Extensive experiments conducted on VOT-16, VOT-17, OTB-50, and OTB-100
datasets highlight the effectiveness of our method, along with the impact of
its key components. Results indicate that our proposed approach can outperform
state-of-art trackers, and its overall robustness allows tracking for a longer

filling fractions, wall thicknesses, and aperture angles. In addition to
describing the first band we use our formulation to compute the first band gap

provides an agent-level likelihood function for a random sample of infection

quantum system scrambles information when the initial conditions of the
dynamics are changed. In sufficiently large quantum systems, one can extract
from the OTOC the quantum analog of the Lyapunov coefficient that describes the
time scale on which a classical chaotic system becomes scrambled. OTOCs have
been applied only to a very limited number of toy models, such as the SYK model
connected with black hole information scrambling, but they could find much
wider applicability for information scrambling in quantum systems that allow
comparison with experiments. The vibrations of polyatomic molecules are known
to undergo a transition from regular dynamics at low energy to facile energy
flow at sufficiently high energy. Molecules therefore represent ideal quantum
systems to study scrambling in many-body systems of moderate size (here 6 to 36
degrees of freedom). By computing quantum OTOCs and their classical
counterparts we quantify how information becomes 'scrambled' quantum
mechanically in molecular systems. Between early 'ballistic' dynamics, and late
'saturation' of the OTOC when the full density of states is explored, there is
indeed a regime where a quantum Lyapunov coefficient can be defined for all
molecules in this study. Comparison with experimental rate data shows that slow
scrambling as measured by the OTOC can reach the time scale of molecular
reaction dynamics. Even for the smallest molecules we discuss, the Maldacena
bound remains satisfied by regularized OTOCs, but not by unregularized OTOCs,
highlighting that the former are more useful for discussing information
scrambling in this type of moderate-size quantum system.

often sounds unnatural due to cut-copy-paste operation. In addition, it is not
obvious how to synthesize records according to a new word not appearing in the
transcript. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end text-based speech editing
method called context-aware mask prediction network (CampNet). The model can
simulate the text-based speech editing process by randomly masking part of
speech and then predicting the masked region by sensing the speech context. It
can solve unnatural prosody in the edited region and synthesize the speech
corresponding to the unseen words in the transcript. Secondly, for the possible
operation of text-based speech editing, we design three text-based operations
based on CampNet: deletion, insertion, and replacement. These operations can
cover various situations of speech editing. Thirdly, to synthesize the speech
corresponding to long text in insertion and replacement operations, a
word-level autoregressive generation method is proposed. Fourthly, we propose a
speaker adaptation method using only one sentence for CampNet and explore the
ability of few-shot learning based on CampNet, which provides a new idea for
speech forgery tasks. The subjective and objective experiments on VCTK and
LibriTTS datasets show that the speech editing results based on CampNet are
better than TTS technology, manual editing, and VoCo method. We also conduct
detailed ablation experiments to explore the effect of the CampNet structure on
its performance. Finally, the experiment shows that speaker adaptation with
only one sentence can further improve the naturalness of speech. Examples of

considers the spatial consistency represented by continuous disparity or depth

homogeneous pixels of each LiDAR projection point based on their color or

optimize the cost volume of the LiDAR projection points and their homogeneous

constraint scopes of sparse LiDAR projection points with the guidance of image
information to optimize the cost volume of pixels as much as possible. We
applied LGSM to semi-global matching and AD-Census on both simulated and real

0.16%, the matching accuracy of our method achieved a subpixel level, while
that of the original stereo matching algorithm was 3.4 pixels. The experimental
results show that LGSM is suitable for indoor, street, aerial, and satellite

dvPAS that flags DV-associated IVs by permuting the markers in the DV. P values

study of estimating photometric redshifts as a classification problem using

learning with multi-channel outputs, balancing the training data and leveraging
soft labels. The residuals can be viewed as a function of spectroscopic
redshifts or photometric redshifts, and the biases with respect to these two

that resolving biases in the spectroscopic space is a prerequisite for
resolving biases in the photometric space. Experiments show that our methods
possess a better capability in controlling biases compared to benchmark

(ARs) controls flare activity, i.e., whether a confined or eruptive flare
occurs, we analyze 106 flares of Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite (GOES) class $\geq$M1.0 during 2010$-$2019. We calculate mean
characteristic twist parameters $\alpha$$_{FPIL}$ within the ""flaring polarity
inversion line"" region and $\alpha$$_\mathrm{HFED}$ within the area of high
photospheric magnetic free energy density, which both provide measures of the
nonpotentiality of AR core region. Magnetic twist is thought to be related to
the driving force of electric current-driven instabilities, such as the helical
kink instability. We also calculate total unsigned magnetic flux
($\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$) of ARs producing the flare, which describes the strength
of the background field confinement. By considering both the constraining
effect of background magnetic fields and the magnetic non-potentiality of ARs,
we propose a new parameter $\alpha$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ to measure the
probability for a large flare to be associated with a coronal mass ejection
(CME). We find that in about 90\% of eruptive flares,
$\alpha$$_\mathrm{FPIL}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ and
$\alpha$$_\mathrm{HFED}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ are beyond critical values
(2.2$\times$$10^{-24}$ and 3.2$\times$$10^{-24}$ Mm$^{-1}$ Mx$^{-1}$), whereas
they are less than critical values in $\sim$ 80\% of confined flares. This
indicates that the new parameter $\alpha$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ is well able to
distinguish eruptive flares from confined flares. Our investigation suggests
that the relative measure of magnetic nonpotentiality within the AR core over
the restriction of the background field largely controls the capability of ARs
to produce eruptive flares.

Recently, the concept of perceptive network is proposed as a paradigm shift

Communications (ISAC). In this paper, we propose the concept of sensing quality
of service (QoS) in terms of diverse applications. Specifically, the

and the posterior CRB for moving target indication are employed to measure the
sensing QoS for detection, localization, and tracking, respectively. Then, we
establish a unified framework for ISAC resource allocation, where the fairness
and the comprehensiveness optimization criteria are considered for the
aforementioned sensing services. The proposed schemes can flexibly allocate the
limited power and bandwidth resources according to both S&C QoSs. Finally, we
study the performance trade-off between S&C services in different resource

persistence of extreme prices is more prevalent in more concentrated markets.
We also show significant extremal price dependence between different regions,
which is typically stronger between physically interconnected markets. The

of WSIs at different magnifications. With the help of this tool, one can apply
a transformation on the fly without the need to generate transformed source WSI

analyzing stellar spectra. FCA is adopted to categorize line indices measured
from LAMOST low-resolution spectra, and automatically remove the least
metallicity-sensitive indices. The FCA-processed indices are then transferred
to the artificial neural network (ANN) to derive metallicities for 147 very
metal-poor (VMP) stars that have been analyzed by high-resolution spectroscopy.
The FCA-ANN method could derive robust metallicities for VMP stars, with a
precision of 0.2 dex compared with high-resolution analysis. The recommended
FCA threshold value \lambda for this test is between 0.9965 and 0.9975. After
reducing the dimension of the line indices through FCA, the derived
metallicities are still robust, with no loss of accuracy, and the FCA-ANN
method performs stably for different spectral quality from [Fe/H] from -1.8
down to -3.5. Compared with traditional classification methods, FCA considers
ambiguity in groupings and noncontinuity of data, and is thus more suitable for
observational data analysis. Though this early test uses FCA to analyze
low-resolution spectra, and feeds the input to the ANN method to derive
metallicities, FCA should be able to, in the large data era, also analyze
slitless spectroscopy and multiband photometry, and prepare the input for
methods not limited to ANN, in the field of stellar physics for other studies,
e.g., stellar classification, identification of peculiar objects. The
literature-collected high-resolution sample can help improve pipelines to
derive stellar metallicities, and systematic offsets in metallicities for VMP
stars for three published LAMOST catalogs have been discussed.

common planning frameworks since they fail to meet the assumptions therein. In
this work, we propose a new stochastic traffic model, Recurrent Traffic Graph

the proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with existing motion planning
algorithms. RTGNN is a Markovian model and is able to infer future traffic
states conditioned on the motion of the ego vehicle. Specifically, RTGNN uses a
definition of the traffic state that includes the state of all players in a
local region and is therefore able to make joint predictions for all agents of
interest. Meanwhile, we explicitly model the hidden states of agents,
""intentions,"" as part of the traffic state to reflect the inherent partial
observability of traffic dynamics. The above mentioned properties are critical
for integrating RTGNN with motion planning algorithms coupling prediction and

correction term is greatly increased while the NNLO QCD correction term is
suppressed compared to the conventional results obtained at $\mu_r=m_t$. By

induces the channel $P_{l|\theta} = {\rm Tr}(\rho_\theta \Pi_l)$ to the
measurement outcome $l$, on which the aforesaid classical MMSE estimator is
employed. Personick found the optimum POVM $\Pi_l$ that minimizes the MMSE over
all possible measurements, and that MMSE. This result from 1971 is less-widely
known than the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which lower bounds the
variance of an unbiased estimator over all measurements, when $P_\theta$ is

in Fisher quantum estimation theory, the inverse of the QFI matrix provides an
operator lower bound to the covariance of an unbiased estimator. However, there

multi-parameter quantum estimation in the {\em Bayesian} setting. In this

  Visual Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key challenges in visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to learn
policies that can generalize to unseen environments. Recently, data
augmentation techniques aiming at enhancing data diversity have demonstrated
proven performance in improving the generalization ability of learned policies.
However, due to the sensitivity of RL training, naively applying data
augmentation, which transforms each pixel in a task-agnostic manner, may suffer
from instability and damage the sample efficiency, thus further exacerbating
the generalization performance. At the heart of this phenomenon is the diverged
action distribution and high-variance value estimation in the face of augmented
images. To alleviate this issue, we propose Task-aware Lipschitz Data
Augmentation (TLDA) for visual RL, which explicitly identifies the
task-correlated pixels with large Lipschitz constants, and only augments the
task-irrelevant pixels. To verify the effectiveness of TLDA, we conduct
extensive experiments on DeepMind Control suite, CARLA and DeepMind
Manipulation tasks, showing that TLDA improves both sample efficiency in
training time and generalization in test time. It outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods across the 3 different visual control benchmarks.

The eigenvalue gives the eigenstate energy while the eigenvector gives the

Here, through first-principles calculations, stable monolayer
$\mathrm{Fe_2Br_2}$ is predicted as a room-temperature large-gap
high-Chern-number QAHI by using generalized gradient approximation plus $U$
(GGA+$U$) approach. The large gap is due to correlation-enhanced spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) effect of Fe atoms, which equates with artificially increasing
the strength of SOC without electronic correlation. Out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy is very key to produce quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state because
in-plane magneitization will destroy nontrivial band topology. In the absence
of SOC, $\mathrm{Fe_2Br_2}$ is a half Dirac semimetal state protected by mirror
symmetry, and the electronic correlation along with SOC effect creates QAH
state with a sizable gap and two chiral edge modes. It is found that the QAH
state is robust against biaxial strain ($a/a_0$: 0.96 to 1.04) in monolayer
$\mathrm{Fe_2Br_2}$ with stable ferromagnetic (FM) ordering and out-of-plane

inference when the likelihood is intractable, enjoys an increasing number of
important scientific applications. However, many aspects of a Bayesian analysis
become more challenging in the likelihood-free setting. One example of this is
prior-data conflict checking, where the goal is to assess whether the
information in the data and the prior are inconsistent. Conflicts of this kind
are important to detect, since they may reveal problems in an investigator's
understanding of what are relevant values of the parameters, and can result in
sensitivity of Bayesian inferences to the prior. Here we consider methods for
prior-data conflict checking which are applicable regardless of whether the
likelihood is tractable or not. In constructing our checks, we consider
checking statistics based on prior-to-posterior Kullback-Leibler divergences.
The checks are implemented using mixture approximations to the posterior
distribution and closed-form approximations to Kullback-Leibler divergences for
mixtures, which make Monte Carlo approximation of reference distributions for
calibration computationally feasible. When prior-data conflicts occur, it is
useful to consider weakly informative prior specifications in alternative
analyses as part of a sensitivity analysis. As a main application of our
methodology, we develop a technique for searching for weakly informative priors
in likelihood-free inference, where the notion of a weakly informative prior is
formalized using prior-data conflict checks. The methods are demonstrated in

is challenging because real-world time-series data exhibit complex temporal

this study, we propose an unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly
detection model named RAE-MEPC which learns informative normal representations
based on multi-resolution ensemble and predictive coding. We introduce
multi-resolution ensemble encoding to capture the multi-scale dependency from

is difficult to track the global path accurately in practice because of
inaccurate localization data. If the drivable space is not accurately
recognized (i.e., noisy state), the vehicle may not smoothly drive or may
collide with obstacles. In this study, a method in which the vehicle drives
toward drivable space only using a vision-based occupancy grid map is proposed.
The proposed method uses imitation learning, where a deep neural network is
trained with expert driving data. The network can learn driving patterns suited
for various complex and noisy situations because these situations are contained
in the training data. Experiments with a vehicle in actual parking lots
demonstrated the limitations of general model-based methods and the
effectiveness of the proposed imitation learning method.

acted as a coaxial transmission line enabling electromagnetic measurements
based on spatial time domain reflectometry, from which the porosity profile was
obtained using an inversion technique. Quantitative characteristics of the
onset and progression of the mixing process were extracted from a porosity
field map. The limiting onset condition was influenced by geometric and
hydraulic factors, with the critical flow rate exhibiting a strong dependence
on the base particle size, while the critical hydraulic gradient exhibited a
stronger dependence on filter particle size. The progression of the mixing
process was characterised by both the transport of base particles into the
filter layer, as well as the settlement of the filter particles into the base
layer due to the reduction of the effective stress at the base-filter interface
leading to partial bearing failure. The rate of development of the mixture zone
was strongly dependent on the hydraulic loading condition and the base particle
size, but the final height of the sample after complete mixing was independent
of the hydraulic loading path.

attack (CMA) on a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) assisted
communication system between a transmitter and a receiver. An attacker has the
capability to manipulate the RIS controller and modify the phase shift induced
by the RIS elements. The goal of the attacker is to minimize the data rate at
the receiver, subject to a constraint on the attack detection probability at
the receiver. We consider a number of attack detection models: (i) composite
hypothesis testing based attack detection in a given fading block for known
channel gains, (ii) sequential quickest detection of CMA in a given fading
block for known channel gains, (iii) nonparametric hypothesis test to detect
CMA for unknown channel gains over a fading block, and (iv)
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) moment based detection over possibly multiple
fading blocks. In the first case, a simple energy detector turns out to be
uniformly most powerful (UMP). In the second case, simplification of the
standard CUSUM test and its performance bounds are obtained. In the third case,
non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is further simplified to a simple
per-sample double threshold test. The attack against these three detectors are
designed via novel optimization formulations and semidefinite relaxation based
solutions. In the fourth case, we consider threshold detection using moments of
SNR; various SNR moments under no attack are obtained analytically for large
RIS and then used to formulate the attack design problem as a linear program.
Finally, numerical results illustrate the performance and trade-offs associated
with the attack schemes, and also demonstrate their efficacy.

techniques and chose to opt out of participating. In this project, we designed
explanative illustrations of three DP models (Central DP, Local DP, Shuffler
DP) to help laypeople conceptualize how random noise is added to protect
individuals' privacy and preserve group utility. Following pilot surveys and
interview studies, we conducted two online experiments (N = 595) examining
participants' comprehension, privacy and utility perception, and data-sharing
decisions across the three DP models. Besides the comparisons across the three
models, we varied the noise levels of each model. We found that the
illustrations can be effective in communicating DP to the participants. Given
an adequate comprehension of DP, participants preferred strong privacy
protection for a certain type of data usage scenarios (i.e., commercial

empirical evidence showing participants' acceptance of the Shuffler DP model

cluster structure, and inversion doublet structure has been observed; however,
$\alpha$ cluster structure tends to be washed out when the breaking of the
$\alpha$ cluster is allowed due to the spin-orbit interaction. Nevertheless,
$\alpha$ clustering in medium-heavy nuclei is quite a hot subject recently.
  Purpose: The tensor interaction has been known to play an essential role in
the strong binding of the $^4$He nucleus, which induces the
two-particle-two-hole (2p2h) excitation. Since this excitation is blocked when
another nucleus approaches, it is worthwhile to show whether the tensor effect
works to keep the distance between $^4$He and $^{40}$Ca and becomes the
salvation of the clustering in $^{44}$Ti.
  Methods: The spin-orbit effect is included in the cluster model by using the
antisymmetrized quasi cluster model (AQCM) developed by the authors. We have
also developed an improved version of the simplified method to include the
tensor contribution ($i$SMT), which allows us to estimate the tensor effect
within the cluster model. The competition of these two is investigated in the
medium-heavy mass region for the first time.
  Results: According to AQCM, the spin-orbit interaction completely breaks the
$\alpha$ cluster and restores the symmetry of $jj$-coupling shell model when
the $\alpha$ cluster approaches the $^{40}$Ca core. On the other hand, $i$SMT
gives a large distance between $\alpha$ and $^{40}$Ca due to the tensor effect.
  Conclusions: In $^{44}$Ti, because of the strong spin-orbit and tensor
contributions, two completely different configurations ($jj$-coupling shell
model and cluster states) almost degenerate, and their mixing becomes
important.

changes in effective connectivity within two regions of the fronto-parietal

us to interpret changes in frontal connectivity in terms of increased

signal processing applications. Its characteristics are determined by its
coefficients, which are the intellectual property (IP) for its designer.
However, in a hardware efficient realization, its coefficients become
vulnerable to reverse engineering. This paper presents a filter design
technique that can protect this IP, taking into account hardware complexity and
ensuring that the filter behaves as specified only when a secret key is
provided. To do so, coefficients are hidden among decoys, which are selected
beyond possible values of coefficients using three alternative methods. As an
attack scenario, an adversary at an untrusted foundry is considered. A reverse
engineering technique is developed to find the chosen decoy selection method
and explore the potential leakage of coefficients through decoys. An
oracle-less attack is also used to find the secret key. Experimental results
show that the proposed technique can lead to filter designs with competitive
hardware complexity and higher resiliency to attacks with respect to previously
proposed methods.

stars in the whole HR diagram. This is the signature of strong transport of
angular momentum (AM) in stellar interiors. One of the plausible candidates to
efficiently carry AM is magnetic fields with various topologies that could be
present in stellar radiative zones. Among them, strong axisymmetric azimuthal
magnetic fields have received a lot of interest. Indeed, if they are subject to
the so-called Tayler instability, the accompanying triggered Maxwell stresses
can transport AM efficiently. In addition, the electromotive force induced by
the fluctuations of magnetic and velocity fields could potentially sustain a
dynamo action that leads to the regeneration of the initial strong axisymmetric
azimuthal magnetic field. The key question we aim to answer is: can we detect
signatures of these deep strong azimuthal magnetic fields? The only way to
answer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories of study are
intermediate-mass and massive stars. Most of these are rapid rotators during
their main-sequence. Therefore, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating
in stably stratified, rotating, and potentially strongly magnetised radiative
zones. We generalise the traditional approximation of rotation by
simultaneously taking general axisymmetric differential rotation and azimuthal
magnetic fields into account in a non-perturbative way. Using this new
formalism, we derive the asymptotic properties of magneto-gravito-inertial
(MGI) waves and their period spacings. We find that toroidal magnetic fields
induce a shift in the period spacings of MGI modes. An equatorial azimuthal
magnetic field with an amplitude of the order of $10^5\,\rm G$ leads to
signatures that can be detectable thanks to modern space photometry. More
complex hemispheric configurations are more difficult to observe.

optimization problems. Motivated by reallocation of governmental institutions
in Sweden, in 1995 J. Krarup posed the problem of finding $k$ edge-disjoint
Hamiltonian Circuits of minimum total weight, called the peripatetic salesman
problem (PSP). Since then researchers have investigated the complexity of
finding diverse solutions to spanning trees, paths, vertex covers, matchings,
and more. Unlike the PSP that has a constraint on the total weight of the
solutions, recent work has involved finding diverse solutions that are all
optimal.
  However, sometimes the space of exact solutions may be too small to achieve
sufficient diversity. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of obtaining
sufficiently-diverse, yet approximately-optimal solutions to optimization
problems. Formally, given an integer $k$, an approximation factor $c$, and an
instance $I$ of an optimization problem, we aim to obtain a set of $k$
solutions to $I$ that a) are all $c$ approximately-optimal for $I$ and b)
maximize the diversity of the $k$ solutions. Finding such solutions, therefore,
requires a better understanding of the global landscape of the optimization
function.
  We show that, given any metric on the space of solutions, and the diversity
measure as the sum of pairwise distances between solutions, this problem can be
solved by combining ideas from dispersion and multicriteria optimization. We
first provide a general reduction to an associated budget-constrained
optimization (BCO) problem, where one objective function is to be maximized
(minimized) subject to a bound on the second objective function. We then prove
that bi-approximations to the BCO can be used to give bi-approximations to the
diverse approximately optimal solutions problem with a little overhead.

trade off between the treatment benefit of an RDD and the statistical
efficiency gains of an RCT. We study a model where the expected response is one
multivariate regression for treated subjects and another one for control
subjects. For a given set of subject data we show how to use convex
optimization to choose treatment probabilities that optimize a prospective
$D$-optimality condition (expected information gain) adapted from Bayesian
optimal design. We can incorporate economically motivated linear constraints on
those treatment probabilities as well as monotonicity constraints that have a
strong ethical motivation. Our condition can be used in two scenarios: known
covariates with random treatments, and random covariates with random
treatments. We find that optimality for the treatment effect coincides with
optimality for the whole regression, and that the RCT satisfies moment
conditions for optimality. For Gaussian data we can find optimal linear
scorings of subjects, one for statistical efficiency and another for short term
treatment benefit.

detection pipeline for SiTian Survey that aims at time-domain astronomy with 72
1-meter optical telescopes. The pipeline includes the modules of light curve
deblending, transit timing obtaining, and TTV modeling. SiTian is capable to
detect more than 25,000 exoplanets among which we expect $\sim$50 sources
showing evidence of tidal dissipation. We present detection and analysis of
tidal dissipating targets, based on simulated SiTian light curves of XO-3b and
WASP-161b. The transit light curve modeling gives consistent results within
1$\sigma$ to input values of simulated light curves. Also, the parameter
uncertainties predicted by Monte-Carlo Markov Chain are consistent with the
distribution obtained from simulating and modeling the light curve 1000 times.
The timing precision of SiTian observations is $\sim$ 0.5 minutes with one
transit visit. We show that differences between TTV origins, e.g., tidal
dissipation, apsidal precession, multiple planets, would be significant,
considering the timing precision and baseline. The detection rate of tidal
dissipating hot Jupiters would answer a crucial question of whether the planet
migrates at an early formation stage or random stages due to perturbations,
e.g., planet scattering, secular interaction. SiTian identified targets would
be constructive given that the sample would extend tenfold.

methods only process sentences independently, without considering the

solutions to the problem of class-imbalance. From an intuitive point of view,
sentences in the same domain often have high-level semantic connections. The
interaction of their high-level semantic features can force the model to
produce better semantic representations, and find the similarities and nuances
between sentences better. Driven by this idea, we propose a plug-and-play
Pairwise Semantic Interaction (PSI) module, which takes pairwise sentences as

the two sentences. Subsequently, different gates are generated to effectively
highlight the key semantic features of each sentence. Finally, the adversarial
interaction between the vectors is used to make the semantic representation of
two sentences more distinguishable. Experimental results on four ABSC datasets
show that, in most cases, PSI is superior to many competitive state-of-the-art

BaFe$_2$Se$_3$, even at room temperature. The phonons assignment requires $Pm$
to be the BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ space group, not only in the magnetic phase, but also
in the paramagnetic phase at room temperature. This is due to a strong coupling
between a short range spin-order along the ladders, and the lattice degrees of
freedom associated with the Fe-Fe bond length. This coupling induces a change
in the bond-length pattern from an alternated trapezoidal one (as in $Pnma$) to
an alternated small/large rectangular one. Out of the two patterns, only the
latter is fully compatible with the observed block-type magnetic structure.
Finally, we propose a complete symmetry analysis of the BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ phase

Jupiter. As Juno transitioned to its extended mission, we review the major
findings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant to understanding Jupiter's
formation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's
interior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is
accordingly non-adiabatic, with a complex internal structure. These new results
imply that current models of Jupiter's formation and evolution require a
revision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths
that can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the
constraints they provide. We note that standard core accretion formation
models, including the heavy-element enrichment during planetary growth is
consistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition gradients in
its deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this
region, which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to
about 10% of Jupiter's total mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno
data imply that this region contains 30% of the mass or more. One way to
explain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long
(about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and
planetesimals delaying the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's
fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact or convection post-formation.
These novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions. Clarity
on the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution
observations of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed
and modeled architectures of extrasolar systems with giant planets, and future
Juno data obtained during its extended mission.

Nevertheless, the high computational complexity is an obstacle for its
practical applications. The Sinkhorn algorithm, one of the main methods in
computing the Wasserstein metric, solves an entropy regularized minimizing
problem, which allows arbitrary approximations to the Wasserstein metric with
O(N^2) computational cost. However, higher accuracy of its numerical
approximation requires more Sinkhorn iterations with repeated matrix-vector
multiplications, which is still unaffordable. In this work, we propose an
efficient implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm to calculate the
Wasserstein-1 metric with O(N) computational cost, which achieves the optimal
theoretical complexity. By utilizing the special structure of Sinkhorn's
kernel, the repeated matrix-vector multiplications can be implemented with O(N)
times multiplications and additions, using the Qin Jiushao or Horner's method
for efficient polynomial evaluation, leading to an efficient algorithm without
losing accuracy. In addition, the log-domain stabilization technique, used to
stabilize the iterative procedure, can also be applied in this algorithm. Our
numerical experiments show that the newly developed algorithm is one to three
orders of magnitude faster than the original Sinkhorn algorithm.

significant offset compared to dust luminosity based SFR, the SFR obtained by
the artificial neural network (Ellison et al. 2016) generally shows consistency

coherent processing with several pulses, the competition is hence in a
multiple-round way where each pulse can be modeled as one round interaction
between the radar and jammer. To capture such multiple-round property as well

  Out-of-Distribution","ICLR (Oral) 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task, two popular
methods are full fine-tuning (updating all the model parameters) and linear
probing (updating only the last linear layer -- the ""head""). It is well known
that fine-tuning leads to better accuracy in-distribution (ID). However, in
this paper, we find that fine-tuning can achieve worse accuracy than linear
probing out-of-distribution (OOD) when the pretrained features are good and the
distribution shift is large. On 10 distribution shift datasets
(Breeds-Living17, Breeds-Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR $\to$ STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW,
ImageNetV2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-Sketch), fine-tuning obtains on
average 2% higher accuracy ID but 7% lower accuracy OOD than linear probing. We
show theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even
in a simple setting: fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks.
We prove that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high when we initialize with a
fixed or random head -- this is because while fine-tuning learns the head, the
lower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the
pretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of
linear probing then full fine-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a fine-tuning
heuristic, combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing.
Empirically, LP-FT outperforms both fine-tuning and linear probing on the above
datasets (1% better ID, 10% better OOD than full fine-tuning).

transmission distance obtained by our analysis method will be increased from
420 km to 470 km. By increasing the loss-independent misalignment error to 12%,
the previous analysis method can not overcome the rate-distance bound. However,
our analysis method can still overcome the rate-distance bound when the
misalignment error is 16%. More surprisingly, we prove that twin-field quantum
key distribution can generate positive secure key even if the misalignment
error is close to 50%, thus our analysis method can significantly improve the
performance of a practical twin-field quantum key distribution system.

neglect of strong electronic correlation effects that are important in many

noncircular corrections (QC2PN), and (iii) the QC corrected by the noncircular

exact fluxes that are computed by solving the Teukolsky equation with a
test-mass source in geodesic motion. We find that the NCN prescription is the
most accurate for both eccentric and hyperbolic orbits and it is in robust
agreement also for large values of the eccentricity. This result carries over
to the comparable masses, as we discuss for a numerical-relativity (NR) case
study. We also demonstrate that, while the EOB/NR waveform unfaithfulness is a
necessary check for the precision of EOB models, the direct comparison of
EOB/NR fluxes is a more stringent and informative test to select the best

artificial intelligence applications and auction can be an effective way to
allocate work and determine reward in a crowdsourcing platform. In this paper,
we focus on the crowdsourcing of small tasks such as image labelling and voice
recording where we face a number of challenges. First, workers have different
limits on the amount of work they would be willing to do, and they may also
misreport these limits in their bid for work. Secondly, if the auction is
repeated over time, unsuccessful workers may drop out of the system, reducing
competition and diversity. To tackle these issues, we first extend the results
of the celebrated Myerson's optimal auction mechanism for a single-parameter
bid to the case where the bid consists of the unit cost of work, the maximum
amount of work one is willing to do, and the actual work completed. We show
that a simple payment mechanism is sufficient to ensure a dominant strategy
from the workers, and that this dominant strategy is robust to the true utility
function of the workers. Secondly, we propose a novel, flexible work allocation
mechanism, which allows the requester to balance between cost efficiency and
equality. While cost minimization is obviously important, encouraging equality
in the allocation of work increases the diversity of the workforce as well as
promotes long-term participation on the crowdsourcing platform. Our main
results are proved analytically and validated through simulations.

advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs). bAdvertisement is performed as a
supply chain attack via a compromised computer in a printing house, by
embedding a ""phantom"" object in a print advertisement. When the compromised
print advertisement is observed by an ADAS in a passing car, an undesired
reaction is triggered from the ADAS. We analyze state-of-the-art object
detectors and show that they do not take color or context into account in
object detection. Our validation of these findings on Mobileye 630 PRO shows
that this ADAS also fails to take color or context into account. Then, we show
how an attacker can take advantage of these findings to execute an attack on a
commercial ADAS, by embedding a phantom road sign in a print advertisement,
which causes a car equipped with Mobileye 630 PRO to trigger a false
notification to slow down. Finally, we discuss multiple countermeasures which
can be deployed in order to mitigate the effect of our proposed attack.

study the best asteroseismic targets. Amongst these, the 16Cyg binary system
holds a special place, being the brightest solar twins observed by Kepler. For
this system, modellers have access to high-quality asteroseismic, spectroscopic
and interferometric data, making it the perfect testbed for the limitations of
stellar models. We aim to further constrain the internal structure and
fundamental parameters of 16CygA&B using linear seismic inversion techniques of
both global indicators and localised corrections of the internal structure. We
start from the models defined by detailed modelling in our previous paper and
extend our analysis by applying variational inversions to these models. We
carried out inversions of so-called seismic indicators and provided local
corrections of the internal structure of the two stars. Our results indicate
that linear seismic inversions alone are not able to discriminate between
standard and non-standard models for 16CygA&B. We confirm the results of our
previous studies that used linear inversion techniques, but consider that the
differences could be linked to small fundamental parameters variations rather
than to a missing process in the models. We confirm the robustness and
reliability of the results of the modelling performed in our previous paper. We
conclude that non-linear inversions are likely required to further investigate
the properties of 16CygA&B from a seismic point of view, but that these
inversions should be coupled to analyses of the depletion of light elements
such as lithium and beryllium to constrain the macroscopic transport of
chemicals and potential non-standard evolutionary paths.

proposed and used to measure the pressure field of an underwater shock wave in
a microtube. The propagation of the shock wave subsequently reaches a concave
water-air interface set in the microtube resulting in the ejection of a focused
microjet. This high spatial-resolution BOS technique can measure the pressure
field of a shock front with a width as narrow as the order of only 101 {\mu}m
with a peak pressure as large as almost 3 MPa, which is significantly narrower
and larger, respectively, than a previous study [1]. This significant
breakthrough has enabled the simultaneous measurement of the pressure impulse
of the shock front and the velocity of the microjet tip. As a result, we have
experimentally observed the linear relation between the velocity of the
microjet tip and the pressure impulse of the shock front for the cases without
secondary cavitation in the liquid bulk. Such relation was
theorectically/numerically predicted by Peters [2]. This study demonstrated the
capability of the proposed high-resolution BOS technique as a microscale
contactless pressure measurement tool for underwater shock waves and

We relax the disjointedness requirement on the paths, allowing them to be
almost disjoint, meaning they may share up to one arc. The resulting almost

this work, we aim to develop a writhed analytical magnetic flux rope model

solely focus on a circular cross-section of constant size. We describe our flux
rope geometry in terms of a parametrized flux rope axis and a parallel

field components under the assumption that the total axial magnetic flux is
conserved. We find an entire class of possible solutions, which differ by the
choice of integration constants, and present the results for a specific
example. In general, we find that the twist of the magnetic field locally
changes when the geometry deviates from a cylinder or torus. This new approach
also allows us to generate completely new types of in situ magnetic field
profiles which strongly deviate from those generated by cylindrical or toroidal

applications. Most existing works have focused on reducing the computational
and resource overheads of running Deep Neural Networks (DNN) inference on
resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the other aspect of DNN
operations, i.e. training (forward and backward passes) on smartphone GPUs, has
received little attention thus far. To this end, we conduct an initial analysis
to examine the feasibility of on-device training on smartphones using mobile
GPUs. We first employ the open-source mobile DL framework (MNN) and its OpenCL
backend for running compute kernels on GPUs. Next, we observed that training on
CPUs is much faster than on GPUs and identified two possible bottlenecks
related to this observation: (i) computation and (ii) memory bottlenecks. To
solve the computation bottleneck, we optimize the OpenCL backend's kernels,
showing 2x improvements (40-70 GFLOPs) over CPUs (15-30 GFLOPs) on the
Snapdragon 8 series processors. However, we find that the full DNN training is
still much slower on GPUs than on CPUs, indicating that memory bottleneck plays
a significant role in the lower performance of GPU over CPU. The data movement
takes almost 91% of training time due to the low bandwidth. Lastly, based on
the findings and failures during our investigation, we present limitations and
practical guidelines for future directions.

high-quality, manually annotated training data. Especially in the biomedical
domain, it has been shown that one training corpus is not enough to learn
generic models that are able to efficiently predict on new data. Therefore,
state-of-the-art models need the ability of lifelong learning in order to
improve performance as soon as new data are available - without the need of
re-training the whole model from scratch. We present WEAVER, a simple, yet
efficient post-processing method that infuses old knowledge into the new model,
thereby reducing catastrophic forgetting. We show that applying WEAVER in a
sequential manner results in similar word embedding distributions as doing a
combined training on all data at once, while being computationally more

also easily applicable to federated learning settings and can for example be
beneficial for the mining of electronic health records from different clinics.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.03348",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision
tasks owing to their strong capability to model long-range dependency using the
self-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, they treat an image as a 1D sequence of
visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local
visual structures and dealing with scale variance, which is instead learned
implicitly from large-scale training data with longer training schedules. In
this paper, we propose a Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB
from convolutions, i.e., ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid
reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich
multi-scale context using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates.
In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and can learn robust
feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each
transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block parallel to the multi-head
self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward
network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn
local features and global dependencies collaboratively. The proposed two kinds
of cells are stacked in both isotropic and multi-stage manners to formulate two
families of ViTAE models, i.e., the vanilla ViTAE and ViTAEv2. Experiments on
the ImageNet dataset as well as downstream tasks on the MS COCO, ADE20K, and
AP10K datasets validate the superiority of our models over the baseline
transformer models and concurrent works. Besides, we scale up our ViTAE model
to 644M parameters and obtain the state-of-the-art classification performance,
i.e., 88.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet validation set and the
best 91.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet real validation set, without using extra

such as wearable electronics, low-invasive bioelectronic implants or soft
actuators for robotics. A critical issue for their development regards the
understanding of defect formation and fracture of conducting pathways during
stress-strain cycles. Here we present a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM)
method that provides multichannel images of surface morphology, conductivity,
and elastic modulus during sample deformation. To develop the method, we
investigate in detail the mechanical interactions between the AFM tip and a
stretched, free-standing thin film sample. Our findings reveal the conditions
to avoid artifacts related to sample bending modes or resonant excitations. As
an example, we analyze strain effects in thin gold films deposited on a soft
silicone substrate. Our technique allows to observe the details of microcrack
opening during tensile strain and their impact on local current transport and
surface mechanics. We find that although the film fractures into separate
fragments, at higher strain a current transport is sustained by a tunneling
mechanism. The microscopic observation of local defect formation and their
correlation to local conductivity will provide novel insight to design more
robust and fatigue resistant stretchable conductors.

interactions among humans, firms, and organizations, and the intersection
between mechanism design and machine learning has been heavily investigated in
recent years. However, mechanism design methods often make strong assumptions
on how participants behave (e.g. rationality), on the kind of knowledge
designers have access to a priori (e.g. access to strong baseline mechanisms),
or on what the goal of the mechanism should be (e.g. total welfare). Here we
introduce HCMD-zero, a general purpose method to construct mechanisms making
none of these three assumptions. HCMD-zero learns to mediate interactions among
participants and adjusts the mechanism parameters to make itself more likely to
be preferred by participants. It does so by remaining engaged in an electoral
contest with copies of itself, thereby accessing direct feedback from
participants. We test our method on a stylized resource allocation game that
highlights the tension between productivity, equality and the temptation to
free ride. HCMD-zero produces a mechanism that is preferred by human
participants over a strong baseline, it does so automatically, without
requiring prior knowledge, and using human behavioral trajectories sparingly
and effectively. Our analysis shows HCMD-zero consistently makes the mechanism
policy more and more likely to be preferred by human participants over the
course of training, and that it results in a mechanism with an interpretable

all such structures with the same local invariants encoded in their respective

indirectly through classifying the modified symbols of homogeneous

quantum advantage. In order to alleviate the problems, we propose and
extensively test a quantum annealing inspired heuristic that supplements VQE.
The improved VQE enables an efficient initial state preparation mechanism, in a
recursive manner, for a quasi-dynamical unitary evolution. We conduct an
in-depth scaling analysis of finding the ground state energies with increasing
lattice sizes of the Heisenberg model, employing simulations of up to $40$
qubits that manipulate the complete state vector. For the current devices, we
further propose a benchmarking toolkit using a mean-field model and test it on
IBM Q devices. The improved VQE avoids barren plateaus, exits local minima, and
works with low-depth circuits. Realistic gate execution times estimate a longer
computational time to complete the same computation on a fully functional
error-free quantum computer than on a quantum computer emulator implemented on
a classical computer. However, our proposal can be expected to help accurate
estimations of the ground state energies beyond $50$ qubits when the complete
state vector can no longer be stored on a classical computer, thus enabling
quantum advantage.

main task to subproblems, and allows to tackle it with mixed oracles. However
existing articles on this topic cover only zeroth and first order oracles, in
our work we consider high-order tensor methods to solve inner problem and fast
gradient method to solve outer problem. We assume, that outer problem is
constrained to some convex compact set, and for the inner problem we consider
both unconstrained case and being constrained to some convex compact set. By
definition, tensor methods use high-order derivatives, so the time per single
iteration of the method depends a lot on the dimensionality of the problem it
solves. Therefore, we suggest, that the dimension of the inner problem variable
is not greater than 1000. Additionally, we need some specific assumptions to be
able to use mixed oracles. Firstly, we assume, that the objective is convex in
both groups of variables and its gradient by both variables is Lipschitz
continuous. Secondly, we assume the inner problem is strongly convex and its
gradient is Lipschitz continuous. Also, since we are going to use tensor
methods for inner problem, we need it to be $p$-th order Lipschitz continuous
($p > 1$). Finally, we assume strong convexity of the outer problem to be able
to use fast gradient method for strongly convex functions. We need to
emphasize, that we use superfast tensor method to tackle inner subproblem in

environment by taking actions, receiving a team reward and observing the next
state. During the interactions, the uncertainty of environment and reward will
inevitably induce stochasticity in the long-term returns and the randomness can
be exacerbated with the increasing number of agents. However, such randomness
is ignored by most of the existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) methods, which only model the expectation of Q-value for both
individual agents and the team. Compared to using the expectations of the
long-term returns, it is preferable to directly model the stochasticity by
estimating the returns through distributions. With this motivation, this work
proposes a novel value-based MARL framework from a distributional perspective,
\emph{i.e.}, parameterizing value function via \underline{M}ixture of
\underline{C}ategorical distributions for MARL. Specifically, we model both
individual Q-values and global Q-value with categorical distribution. To
integrate categorical distributions, we define five basic operations on the
distribution, which allow the generalization of expected value function
factorization methods (\emph{e.g.}, VDN and QMIX) to their MCMARL variants. We
further prove that our MCMARL framework satisfies
\emph{Distributional-Individual-Global-Max} (DIGM) principle with respect to
the expectation of distribution, which guarantees the consistency between joint
and individual greedy action selections in the global Q-value and individual
Q-values. Empirically, we evaluate MCMARL on both a stochastic matrix game and
a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, showing the efficacy
of our framework.

ultrasound method that focuses sound through the skull to a small region
noninvasively under MRI guidance. It is clinically approved to thermally ablate
regions of the thalamus and is being explored for other therapies, such as
blood brain barrier opening and neuromodulation. To accurately target
ultrasound through the skull, the transmitted waves must constructively
interfere at the target region. However, heterogeneity of the sound speed,
density, and ultrasound attenuation in different individuals' skulls requires
patient-specific estimates of these parameters for optimal treatment planning.
CT imaging is currently the gold standard for estimating acoustic properties of
an individual skull during clinical procedures, but CT imaging exposes patients
to radiation and increases the overall number of imaging procedures required
for therapy. A method to estimate acoustic parameters in the skull without the
need for CT would be desirable. Here, we synthesized CT images from routinely
acquired T1-weighted MRI by using a 3D patch-based conditional generative
adversarial network and evaluated the performance of synthesized CT images for
treatment planning with transcranial focused ultrasound. We compared the
performance of synthetic CT to real CT images using Kranion and k-Wave acoustic

Swin Transformer for music classification, aiming to learn meaningful music
representations from massive easily accessible unlabeled music data. S3T
introduces a momentum-based paradigm, MoCo, with Swin Transformer as its
feature extractor to music time-frequency domain. For better music
representations learning, S3T contributes a music data augmentation pipeline
and two specially designed pre-processors. To our knowledge, S3T is the first
method combining the Swin Transformer with a self-supervised learning method
for music classification. We evaluate S3T on music genre classification and
music tagging tasks with linear classifiers trained on learned representations.
Experimental results show that S3T outperforms the previous self-supervised
method (CLMR) by 12.5 percents top-1 accuracy and 4.8 percents PR-AUC on two
tasks respectively, and also surpasses the task-specific state-of-the-art
supervised methods. Besides, S3T shows advances in label efficiency using only
10% labeled data exceeding CLMR on both tasks with 100% labeled data.

  Transfer in Excitonically Coupled Aggregates",,,"10.1063/5.0088855",,"physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We recently proposed effective normal modes for excitonically coupled
aggregates which exactly transform the energy transfer Hamiltonian into a sum
of one-dimensional Hamiltonians along the effective normal modes. Identifying
physically meaningful vibrational motions which maximally promote vibronic
mixing suggested an interesting possibility of leveraging
vibrational-electronic resonance for mediating selective energy transfer. Here
we expand on the effective mode approach elucidating its iterative nature for
successively larger aggregates, and extend the idea of mediated energy transfer
to larger aggregates. We show that energy transfer between electronically
uncoupled but vibronically resonant donor-acceptor sites does not depend on the
intermediate site energy or the number of intermediate sites. The intermediate
sites simply mediate electronic coupling such that vibronic coupling along
specific promoter modes leads to direct donor-acceptor energy transfer
bypassing any intermediate uphill energy transfer steps. We show that interplay
between the electronic Hamiltonian and the effective mode transformation
partitions the linear vibronic coupling along specific promoter modes to
dictate the selectivity of mediated energy transfer, with a vital role of
interference between vibronic couplings and multi-particle basis states. Our
results suggest a general design principle for enhancing energy transfer
through synergistic effects of vibronic resonance and weak mediated electronic
coupling, where both effects individually do not promote efficient energy
transfer. The effective mode approach proposed here paves a facile route
towards four-wavemixing spectroscopy simulations of larger aggregates without
severely approximating resonant vibronic coupling.

for knowledge graph enhancement (KGE), where KGE captures missing relations
from unstructured data and leads to noisy facts to the knowledge graph. With
the prosperity of unstructured data, an online approach is asked to clean the
new RDF tuples before adding them to the knowledge base. To clean the noisy RDF
tuples, graph constraint processing is a common but intractable approach. Plus,
when adding new tuples to the knowledge graph, new graph patterns would be
created, whereas the explicit discovery of graph constraints is also
intractable. Therefore, although the dynamic relation repair has an unfortunate
hardness, it is a necessary approach for enhancing knowledge graphs effectively
under the fast-growing unstructured data. Motivated by this, we establish a
dynamic repairing and enhancing structure to analyze its hardness on basic
operations. To ensure dynamic repair and validation, we introduce implicit
graph constraints, approximate graph matching, and linkage prediction based on
localized graph patterns. To validate and repair the RDF tuples efficiently, we
further study the cold start problems for graph constraint processing.
Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach
can capture and repair instances with wrong relation labels dynamically and
effectively.

using difference image analysis. The pipeline is run daily on all new public
UVOT data (which are available 6-8 hours after the observations are performed),
so we discover transients in near real-time. This allows for follow-up
observations to be performed. From October 1, 2020, to the time of submission,
we have processed 75,183 individual UVOT images and we currently detect an
average rate of ~100 transient candidates per day. Of these daily candidates,
on average ~30 are real transients, separated by human vetting from the
remaining `bogus' transients which were not discarded automatically within the
pipeline. Most of the real transients we detect are known variable stars,
though we also detect many known active galactic nuclei and accreting white
dwarfs. TUVOpipe can additionally run in archival mode, whereby all archival
UVOT data of a given field is scoured for `historical' transients; in this mode
we also mostly find variable stars. However, some of the transients we find (in
particular in the real-time mode) represent previously unreported new

biological systems. However, the observable nodes and connections in real cases
are often incomplete or unavailable due to measurement errors, private
protection issues, or other problems. Therefore, inferring the complete network
structure is useful for understanding human interactions and complex dynamics.
The existing studies have not fully solved the problem of inferring network
structure with partial information about connections or nodes. In this paper,
we tackle the problem by utilizing time-series data generated by network
dynamics. We regard the network inference problem based on dynamical time
series data as a problem of minimizing errors for predicting states of
observable nodes and proposed a novel data-driven deep learning model called
Gumbel-softmax Inference for Network (GIN) to solve the problem under
incomplete information. The GIN framework includes three modules: a dynamics
learner, a network generator, and an initial state generator to infer the
unobservable parts of the network. We implement experiments on artificial and
empirical social networks with discrete and continuous dynamics. The
experiments show that our method can infer the unknown parts of the structure
and the initial states of the observable nodes with up to 90\% accuracy. The
accuracy declines linearly with the increase of the fractions of unobservable
nodes. Our framework may have wide applications where the network structure is
hard to obtain and the time series data is rich.

a single reward function is not adequate to represent such preferences. This
paper proposes a method for inferring multi-objective reward-based

priorities over different objectives as entering lexicographically, so that
objectives with lower priorities matter only when the agent is indifferent with
respect to objectives with higher priorities. We offer two example applications

appear as collimated plasma ejections with a width of 1-2 Mm at some LB sites.
Most observed TBs are associated with IJs and show superpositions of some
chromosphere absorption lines on enhanced and broadened wings of C II and Si IV
lines, which could be driven by intermittent magnetic reconnection in the lower
atmosphere. LW-I and LW-II are wall-shaped structures with bright fronts above
the whole LB. An LW-I has a continuous oscillating front with a typical height
of several Mm and an almost stationary period of 4-5 minutes. On the contrary,
an LW-II has a indented front with a height of over 10 Mm, which has no stable
period and is accompanied by recurrent TBs in the entire LB. These results
support that LW-IIs are driven by frequent reconnection occurring along the
whole LB due to large-scale magnetic flux emergence or intrusion, rather than
the leakage of waves producing LW-Is. Our observations reveal a highly
dynamical scenario of activities above LBs driven by different basic physical
processes, including magneto-convection, magnetic reconnection, and wave
leakage.

To account for correlation within clusters, we propose a Poisson regression

latent random effect that follows the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution with a
parameter that controls the strength of dependence among the individuals. This
novel multivariate count model is called Clustered Poisson Birnbaum-Saunders

tractable, and its moment structure can be explicitly obtained. Estimation of

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is also developed. Simulation results
to evaluate the finite-sample performance of our proposed estimators are

Preuss. Akad., Berlin, 1918) Einstein claimed that a gravity model written in a
spacetime geometry with non-metricity suffers from a phenomenon, the so-called
second clock effect. We give a new prescription of parallel transport of a
vector tangent to a curve which is invariant under both of local general
coordinate and Weyl transformations in order to remove that effect. Thus since
the length of tangent vector does not change during parallel transport along a
closed curve in spacetimes with non-metricity, a second clock effect does not
appear in general, not only for the integrable Weyl spacetime. We have
specially motivated the problem from the point of view of symmetric
teleparallel (or Minkowski-Weyl) geometry. We also conclude that if nature
respects Lorentz symmetry and Weyl symmetry, then the simplest geometry in
which one can develop consistently alternative gravity models is the symmetric
teleparallel geometry; $Q_{\mu\nu}\neq 0, \; T^\mu=0, \; R^\mu{}_\nu=0$.
Accordingly we discuss the proper time, the orbit equation of a spinless test

effect of interventions for high-dimensional data with neural networks remains
an open challenge. Herein we propose Diff-SCM, a deep structural causal model
that builds on recent advances of generative energy-based models. In our
setting, inference is performed by iteratively sampling gradients of the

Counterfactual estimation is achieved by firstly inferring latent variables
with deterministic forward diffusion, then intervening on a reverse diffusion
process using the gradients of an anti-causal predictor w.r.t the input.
Furthermore, we propose a metric for evaluating the generated counterfactuals.
We find that Diff-SCM produces more realistic and minimal counterfactuals than
baselines on MNIST data and can also be applied to ImageNet data. Code is

features a spatially varying order parameter with a $120^\circ$ phase twist

This phase can be tuned by artificial gauge fields when the system is dressed

NGC5846-UDG1 is an excellent example, with a high-quality sample of dozens of
GC candidates. We show that the observed distribution of GCs in NGC5846-UDG1 is
suggestive of mass segregation induced by gravitational dynamical friction. We
present simple analytic calculations, backed by a series of numerical
simulations, that naturally explain the observed present-day pattern of GC
masses and radial positions. Subject to some assumptions on the GC population
at birth, the analysis supports the possibility that NGC5846-UDG1 resides in a
massive dark matter halo. This is an example for the use of GC-rich systems as
dynamical (in addition to kinematical) tracers of dark matter.

mid-market rate pricing. A mathematical model of the community is constructed
and the optimization problem of this model is transformed into an MILP problem
that can be solved in a short time. By solving this MILP problem, the
optimization of the overall energy cost of the community and satisfaction of
the thermal comfort at every home are achieved. For comparison, we also
establish two different scenarios for the same community: a prosumer-centric
CEMS and no CEMS. The simulation results demonstrate that the overall energy
cost of the community with the system-centric CEMS is the smallest among the
three scenarios and is only half that of the community with the
prosumer-centric CEMS. Moreover, by using linear transformation, the
computational time of the optimization problem of the proposed system-centric
CEMS is only 118.2 s for a 500-home community, which is a short time for
day-ahead scheduling of a community.

many different sequences of mutations to existing levels. In the generated

specific actions that repair the mutated tile in the middle of the
observations. Using this dataset, a convolutional network is trained to map
from observations to their respective appropriate repair actions. The trained
network is then used to iteratively produce levels from random starting maps.

may occur, causing material damage, and in the worst case, it can put human
lives in danger. The tip-over stability of wheeled mobile manipulators must not
be overlooked at any stage of a mobile manipulator's life, starting from the
design phase, continuing through the commissioning period and extending to the
operational phase. Many tip-over stability criteria formulated throughout the
years do not explicitly consider the normal wheel loads, with most of them
relying on prescribed stability margins in terms of overturning moments. In
these formulations, it is commonly argued that overturning will occur about one
of the axes connecting adjacent manipulator's contact points with the ground.
This claim may not always be valid and is certainly restrictive. Explicit
expressions for the manipulator supporting forces provide the best insight into
relevant affecting terms which contribute to the tip-over (in)stability. They
also remove the necessity for thinking about which axis the manipulator could
tip over and simultaneously enable the formulation of more intuitive stability
margins and on-line tip-over prevention techniques. The present study presents
a general dynamics modelling approach in the Newton--Euler framework using 6D
vectors and gives normal wheel load equations in a typical 4-wheeled mobile
manipulator negotiating a slope. The given expressions are expected to become
standard in wheeled mobile manipulators and to provide a basis for effective
tip-over stability criteria and tip-over avoidance techniques. Based on the
presented results, specific improvements of the state-of-the-art criteria are
discussed.

promising performance under intra-dataset testing, they suffer from poor
generalization under cross-dataset testing. The main reason is that they learn
the network with only binary supervision, which may learn arbitrary cues
overfitting on the training dataset. To make the learned feature explainable
and more generalizable, some researchers introduce facial depth and reflection
map as the auxiliary supervision. However, many other generalizable cues are
unexplored for face anti-spoofing, which limits their performance under
cross-dataset testing. To this end, we propose a novel framework to learn
multiple explainable and generalizable cues (MEGC) for face anti-spoofing.
Specifically, inspired by the process of human decision, four mainly used cues
by humans are introduced as auxiliary supervision including the boundary of
spoof medium, moir\'e pattern, reflection artifacts and facial depth in
addition to the binary supervision. To avoid extra labelling cost,
corresponding synthetic methods are proposed to generate these auxiliary
supervision maps. Extensive experiments on public datasets validate the
effectiveness of these cues, and state-of-the-art performances are achieved by
our proposed method.

We find that the frequency of reported cyber related events has substantially

losses depend on the business sector and type of cyber threat: the most
significant cyber loss event categories, by number of events, were related to
data breaches and the unauthorized disclosure of data, while cyber extortion,
phishing, spoofing and other social engineering practices showed substantial
growth rates. Interestingly, we do not find a distinct pattern between the
frequency of events, the loss severity, and the number of affected records as
often alluded to in the literature. We also analyse the severity distribution
of cyber related events across all risk categories and business sectors. This
analysis reveals that cyber risks are heavy-tailed, i.e., cyber risk events
have a higher probability to produce extreme losses than events whose severity
follows an exponential distribution. Furthermore, we find that the frequency

paradigm, as it allows for subhaloes with masses of $\sim10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ and

superposed in images of strongly lensed galaxies. For the lens we take a
simulated galaxy in a $\sim10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ halo grown in a high-resolution
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, which we view from two different
directions. Though the resolution is high, we note the simulated galaxy still
has an artificial core which adds additional complexity to the baryon dominated
region. To remove particle noise, we represent the projected galaxy mass
distribution by a series of Gaussian profiles which precisely capture the
features of the projected galaxy. We first model the lens mass as a (broken)
power-law density profile and then search for small haloes. Of the two
projections, one has a regular elliptical shape, while the other has distinct
deviations from an elliptical shape. For the former, the broken power-law model
gives no false positives and correctly recovers the mass of the superposed
small halo, but for the latter we find false positives and the inferred halo
mass is overestimated by $\sim4-5$ times. We then use a more complex model in
which the lens mass is decomposed into stellar and dark matter components. In
this case, we show that we can capture the simulated galaxy's complex projected
structures and correctly infer the input small halo.

designed and demonstrated. The method adapts the data intensive Machine Learned
Optimization of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK) algorithm for compact model
generation by the use of a Latin Square method for virtual reaction network
generation. A set of logical rules are defined which construct a minimally
sized virtual reaction network comprising three additional nodes (N, NO, NO2).
This NOX virtual reaction network is appended to a pre-existing compact model
for methane combustion comprising fifteen nodes.
  The resulting eighteen node virtual reaction network is processed by the
MLOCK coded algorithm to produce a plethora of compact model candidates for NOX
formation during methane combustion. MLOCK automatically; populates the terms
of the virtual reaction network with candidate inputs; measures the success of
the resulting compact model candidates (in reproducing a broad set of gas
turbine industry-defined performance targets); selects regions of input
parameters space showing models of best performance; refines the input
parameters to give better performance; and makes an ultimate selection of the
best performing model or models.
  By this method, it is shown that a number of compact model candidates exist
that show fidelities in excess of 75% in reproducing industry defined
performance targets, with one model valid to >75% across fuel/air equivalence
ratios of 0.5-1.0. However, to meet the full fuel/air equivalence ratio
performance envelope defined by industry, we show that with this minimal
virtual reaction network, two further compact models are required.

ordinary differential operators and complex dynamics which we discuss in
details in the simplest case of operators of order $1$. Namely, assuming that
such an operator $T$ has polynomial coefficients, we interpret it as a
continuous family of Hutchinson operators acting on the space of positive
powers of linear forms. Using this interpretation of $T$, we introduce its
continuously Hutchinson invariant subsets of the complex plane and investigate
a variety of their properties. In particular, we prove that for any $T$ with
non-constant coefficients, there exists a unique minimal under inclusion
invariant set $\mathrm{M}^T_{CH}$ and find explixitly when it equals
$\mathbb{C}$.

investigate when it is possible to embed a $G$-space $X$ into the
$m$-dimensional cubical shift $([0,1]^m)^G$. We focus our attention on systems
that arise as an extension of an almost finite $G$-action on a totally
disconnected space $Y$, in the sense of Matui and Kerr. We show that if such a
$G$-space $X$ has mean dimension less than $m/2$, then $X$ embeds into the
$(m+1)$-dimensional cubical shift. If the distinguished factor $G$-space $Y$ is
assumed to be a subshift of finite type, then this can be improved to an
embedding into the $m$-dimensional cubical shift. This result ought to be
viewed as the generalization of a theorem by Gutman-Tsukamoto for $G=\mathbb Z$
to actions of all amenable groups, and represents the first result supporting
the Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto conjecture for actions of groups other than

learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of those that have been
previously mastered. Existing CL approaches often keep a buffer of

techniques towards this goal. Despite their performance, they still suffer from
interference across tasks which leads to catastrophic forgetting. To ameliorate
this problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for
learning current and past tasks at any stage. More parameters space and model
capacity can thus be reserved for the future tasks. This minimizes the
interference between parameters for different tasks. To do so, we propose a
Sparse neural Network for Continual Learning (SNCL), which employs variational
Bayesian sparsity priors on the activations of the neurons in all layers. Full
Experience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse
activations of the neurons in different layers. A loss-aware reservoir-sampling
strategy is developed to maintain the memory buffer. The proposed method is
agnostic as to the network structures and the task boundaries. Experiments on
different datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance

crucial demand of blockchains, off-chain contract execution frameworks have
been promising. Some have recently expanded off-chain contracts to Multi-Party
Computation (MPC), which seek to transition the on-chain states by off-chain
MPC. The most general problem among these solutions is MPT, since its off-chain
MPC takes on- and off-chain inputs, delivers on- and off-chain outputs, and can
be publicly verified by the blockchain, thus capable of covering more
scenarios. However, existing Multi-Party Transaction (MPT) solutions lack at
least one of data availability, financial fairness, delivery fairness, and
delivery atomicity. These properties are crucially valued by communities, e.g.,
the Ethereum community, or users. Even worse, these solutions require high-cost
interactions between the blockchain and off-chain systems.
  This paper proposes a novel MPT-enabled off-chain contract execution
framework, DECLOAK. DECLOAK is the first to achieve data availability of MPT,
and our method can apply to other fields that seek to persist user data
on-chain. Moreover, DECLOAK solves all mentioned shortcomings with even lower
gas costs and weaker assumptions. Specifically, DECLOAK tolerates all but one
Byzantine party and TEE executors. Evaluating on 10 MPTs, DECLOAK reduces the
gas cost of the SOTA, Cloak, by 65.6%. Consequently, we are the first to not
only achieve such level secure MPT in practical assumption, but also
demonstrate that evaluating MPT in the comparable gas cost to normal Ethereum
transaction is possible. And the cost superiority of DECLOAK increases as the
number of MPT parties grows.

based on handwritten input word images of an individual. Our approach is
text-independent and does not place any restrictions on the size of the input
word images under consideration. To begin with, we employ the SIFT algorithm to
extract multiple key points at various levels of abstraction (comprising
allograph, character, or combination of characters). These key points are then
passed through a trained CNN network to generate feature maps corresponding to
a convolution layer. However, owing to the scale corresponding to the SIFT key
points, the size of a generated feature map may differ. As an alleviation to
this issue, the histogram of gradients is applied on the feature map to produce
a fixed representation. Typically, in a CNN, the number of filters of each
convolution block increase depending on the depth of the network. Thus,
extracting histogram features for each of the convolution feature map increase
the dimension as well as the computational load. To address this aspect, we use
an entropy-based method to learn the weights of the feature maps of a
particular CNN layer during the training phase of our algorithm. The efficacy
of our proposed system has been demonstrated on two publicly available
databases namely CVL and IAM. We empirically show that the results obtained are
promising when compared with previous works.

However, this algorithm does not protect edges (friendships) in a social graph

(Degree-Preserving Randomized Response) to provide LDP for edges in GNNs. Our
DPRR preserves each user's degree hence a graph structure while providing edge
LDP. Technically, we use Warner's RR (Randomized Response) and strategic edge
sampling, where each user's sampling probability is automatically tuned to
preserve the degree information. We prove that the DPRR approximately preserves
the degree information under edge LDP. We focus on graph classification as a
task of GNNs and evaluate the DPRR using four social graph datasets. Our
experimental results show that the DPRR significantly outperforms three
baselines and provides accuracy close to a non-private algorithm in all

of the couplings of the Higgs boson. In view of the large production cross
section at energies a little above the threshold, it seems feasible to make a
more detailed study of the process by measuring the cross sections for
polarized $Z$ in order to measure possible anomalous $ZZH$ couplings. We show
that certain combinations of cross sections in $e^+e^- \to ZH$ with different
$Z$ polarizations help to enhance or isolate the effect of one of the two kinds
of $ZZH$ couplings possible on general grounds of CP and Lorentz invariance.
These combinations can be useful to get information on the $ZZH$ coupling in
the specific contexts of an effective field theory, two-Higgs-doublet models,
and composite Higgs models, in a relatively model-independent fashion. We find
in particular that the longitudinal helicity fraction of the $Z$ is expected to
be insensitive to anomalous couplings, and would be close to its value in the
standard model in the scenarios we consider. We also discuss the sensitivity of
the proposed measurements to the anomalous couplings.

materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the
development of topological qubits. In this application, however, aluminum-based
devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, we
resolve this limitation by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g.
platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a
factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, we show that the increased field
resilience originates from spin-orbit scattering introduced by Pt. We exploit
this property in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in
semiconductor-superconductor hybrids, where we show that InSb nanowires
strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7T. The
two-electron charging effect, a fundamental requirement for topological quantum
computation, is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms.
Additionally, we use non-local spectroscopy in a three-terminal geometry to
probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub-gap
states. Finally, we demonstrate that semiconductor states which are
proximitized by Al/Pt films maintain their ability to Zeeman-split in an
applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well-known
fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to
Al-based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors,
whenever high-field resilience is required.

accumulations, possibly initiating dissection. In many cases, a dissection
results from pathological changes such as fragmentation or loss of elastic
fibers. But it has been shown that even the healthy aortic wall has an inherent
heterogeneous microstructure. Some parts of the aorta are particularly
susceptible to the development of inhomogeneities due to pathological changes,
however, the distribution in the aortic wall and the spatial extent, such as
size, shape, and type, are difficult to predict. Motivated by this observation,
we describe the heterogeneous distribution of elastic fiber degradation in the
dissected aortic wall using a stochastic constitutive model. For this purpose,
random field realizations, which model the stochastic distribution of degraded
elastic fibers, are generated over a non-equidistant grid. The random field
then serves as input for a uni-axial extension test of the pathological aortic
wall, solved with the finite-element (FE) method. To include the microstructure
of the dissected aortic wall, a constitutive model developed in a previous
study is applied, which also includes an approach to model the degradation of
inter-lamellar elastic fibers. Then to assess the uncertainty in the output
stress distribution due to this stochastic constitutive model, a convolutional
neural network, specifically a Bayesian encoder-decoder, was used as a
surrogate model that maps the random input fields to the output stress
distribution obtained from the FE analysis. The results show that the neural
network is able to predict the stress distribution of the FE analysis while
significantly reducing the computational time. In addition, it provides the
probability for exceeding critical stresses within the aortic wall, which could
allow for the prediction of delamination or fatal rupture.

the classical priority setting, we also consider priority algorithms with
advice. Originally conceived to study online algorithms from an
information-theoretic point of view, the concept of advice has recently been
extended to the priority framework. In this paper, we analyze the classical
variant of the DPA problem on the graph class of paths, the related problem of
Length-Weighted DPA, and finally, DPA on the graph class of trees. We show
asymptotically matching upper and lower bounds on the advice necessary for
optimality in LWDPA and generalize the known optimality result for DPA on paths
to trees with maximal degree at most 3. On trees with maximal degree greater
than 3, we prove matching upper and lower bounds on the approximation ratio in
the advice-free priority setting. Finally, we present upper and lower bounds on
the advice necessary to achieve optimality on such trees.

massive star evolution can potentially lead to gravitational wave sources such

thick stellar winds, their masses can only be determined with accurate
inclination angle estimates from binary systems which have spectroscopic $M

This strong converse bound implies that in the independent and identical

conditional entropy. The established one-shot bound has an application to
bounding the information leakage of classical-quantum wiretap channel coding
and private communication over quantum channels. That is, the trace distance
between Alice and Eavesdropper's joint state and its decoupled state vanishes
as the rate of randomness used in hashing exceeds the quantum mutual

rate is below the quantum mutual information, resulting in an exponential

entropy accumulation, which complements a recent result by Dupuis

is inherently non-conservative, and its evolution usually leads to unphysical
mass gain/loss. In this paper, a novel conservative level set method is
developed for incompressible multiphase flows simulations. A posterior mass
correction is performed by introducing a small perturbation to the level-set
field, which is solved via the Newton method. Unlike in previous researches,
the signed distance property of the level-set function is exactly preserved
after the present mass correction. Moreover, this method can be easily
generalized from 2D to 3D. The influence for the computational efficiency is
slight as the correction does not need to be applied at every time step.
Various benchmark cases involving pure interface-evolution problems and
multiphase flows problems are considered to validate the present method. For
all cases, the accuracy and efficiency of the original method and the present
method are quantitatively compared. It is observed that, with negligibly extra
cost, the conservation error is reduced to the order of machine accuracy by the
present method, which indicates its potential applications in complex

transportation systems such as for traffic monitoring and vehicle violation
detection. In real-world scenarios, license plate recognition still faces many
challenges and is impaired by unpredictable interference such as weather or
lighting conditions. Many machine learning based ALPR solutions have been
proposed to solve such challenges in recent years. However, most are not
convincing, either because their results are evaluated on small or simple
datasets that lack diverse surroundings, or because they require powerful
hardware to achieve a reasonable frames-per-second in real-world applications.
In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation-free framework for license plate
recognition and introduce NP-ALPR, a diverse and challenging dataset which
resembles real-world scenarios. The proposed network model consists of the
latest deep learning methods and state-of-the-art ideas, and benefits from a
novel network architecture. It achieves higher accuracy with lower
computational requirements than previous works. We evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on three different datasets and show a recognition
accuracy of over 99% and over 70 fps, demonstrating that our method is not only
robust but also computationally efficient.

preprocessing technique for encrypting data to protect against brute-force

security. Later the unconditionally secure AONT and their combinatorial
characterization were introduced by Stinson. Informally, a combinatorial AONT
is an array with the unbiased requirements and its security properties in
general depend on the prior probability distribution on the inputs $s$-tuples.
Recently, it was shown by Esfahani and Stinson that a combinatorial AONT has
perfect security provided that all the inputs $s$-tuples are equiprobable, and
has weak security provided that all the inputs $s$-tuples are with non-zero
probability.
  This paper aims to explore on the gap between perfect security and weak
security for combinatorial $(t,s,v)$-AONTs. Concretely, we consider the typical
scenario that all the $s$ inputs take values independently (but not necessarily
identically) and quantify the amount of information
$H(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{Y})$ about any $t$ inputs $\mathcal{X}$ that is not
revealed by any $s-t$ outputs $\mathcal{Y}$. In particular, we establish the
general lower and upper bounds on $H(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{Y})$ for
combinatorial AONTs using information-theoretic techniques, and also show that
the derived bounds can be attained in certain cases. Furthermore, the
discussions are extended for the security properties of combinatorial

Here, we use single-crystal x-ray diffraction to determine incommensurately
modulated crystal structure of EuAl4 in its CDW state. The CDW is shown to be
incommensurate with modulation wave vector q = (0, 0, 0.1781(3)) at 70 K. The
symmetry of the incommensurately modulated crystal structure is orthorhombic
with superspace group Fmmm(00{\sigma})s00, where Fmmm is a subgroup of I4/mmm
of index 2. Both the lattice and the atomic coordinates of the basic structure
remain tetragonal. Symmetry breaking is entirely due to the modulation wave,
where atoms Eu and Al1 have displacements exclusively along a, while the
fourfold rotation would require equal displacement amplitudes along a and b.
The calculated band structure of the basic structure and interatomic distances
in the modulated crystal structure both indicate the aluminum atoms as location
of the CDW. The temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals an anomaly
at TCDW = 145 K of a magnitude similar to canonical CDW systems. The present
discovery of orthorhombic symmetry for the CDW state of EuAl4 leads to the
suggestion of monoclinic instead of orthorhombic symmetry for the third AFM

undermining the wide-deployment of face recognition systems. Though
presentation attack detection (PAD) systems try to address this problem, the
lack of generalization and robustness continues to be a major concern. Several
works have shown that using multi-channel PAD systems could alleviate this
vulnerability and result in more robust systems. However, there is a wide
selection of channels available for a PAD system such as RGB, Near Infrared,
Shortwave Infrared, Depth, and Thermal sensors. Having a lot of sensors
increases the cost of the system, and therefore an understanding of the
performance of different sensors against a wide variety of attacks is necessary
while selecting the modalities. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study
to understand the effectiveness of various imaging modalities for PAD. The
studies are performed on a multi-channel PAD dataset, collected with 14
different sensing modalities considering a wide range of 2D, 3D, and partial
attacks. We used the multi-channel convolutional network-based architecture,
which uses pixel-wise binary supervision. The model has been evaluated with
different combinations of channels, and different image qualities on a variety
of challenging known and unknown attack protocols. The results reveal
interesting trends and can act as pointers for sensor selection for
safety-critical presentation attack detection systems. The source codes and
protocols to reproduce the results are made available publicly making it

environmental effects in discrete populations. We extend Price's framework to
the measurable and quantum cases, decomposing all evolutionary processes into
selective and environmental components. We also extend Fisher's fundamental
theorem, showing that selective change of relative fitness equals variance of
relative fitness.
  We introduce novel selective and environmental entropy functionals. Selective
entropy is non-positive, representing biological negentropy, and environmental
entropy is non-negative, representing physical entropy. Environmental entropy
further decomposes into dispersion and mixing entropies.
  We prove four novel Laws of Natural Selection, showing that selection
consistently acts to increase selection, but can be disrupted by environmental
change. We apply convex analysis to variance and entropy functionals and their
selective changes, and equilibrium processes arise to optimize these
inequalities. These laws are inspired by but distinct from the classical
Thermodynamic Laws.
  Our Zeroth Law is a refinement of Fisher's theorem, showing that variance of
relative fitness is bounded below by a quantity depending on the child-bearing
population. Our First Law shows that selective acceleration of relative fitness
is also bounded below, depending on the variance. This is a non-conservative,
selective version of the Thermodynamic First Law. Our Second Law shows that the
selective change of selective entropy and its selective acceleration are
similarly bounded by non-positive constants. This is a formal, rigorous version
of the Thermodynamic Second Law. Our Third Law shows that for a class of
equilibrium processes, selective change of environmental entropy vanishes, and
otherwise may vary in an open window around zero. This is a selective version
of the Third Law of Thermodynamics.

as seen along the Sun-Earth line. The first event was a typical slow Coronal
Mass Ejection (CME), followed $\sim 7$ hours later by a smaller and collimated
prominence eruption, originating Southward with respect to the CME, followed by
a plasma blob. These events were observed not only by SOHO and STEREO-A
missions, but also by the suite of remote sensing instruments on-board Solar
Orbiter (SolO). This work shows how data acquired by the Full Sun Imager (FSI),
Metis coronagraph, and Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI) from the SolO perspective
can be combined to study the eruptions and the different source regions.
Moreover, we show how Metis data can be analyzed to provide new information
about solar eruptions.
  Different 3D reconstruction methods were applied to the data acquired by
different spacecraft including remote sensing instruments on-board SolO. Images
acquired by both Metis channels in the Visible Light (VL) and H I
Lyman$-\alpha$ line (UV) were combined to derive physical information on the
expanding plasma. The polarization ratio technique was also applied for the
first time to the Metis images acquired in the VL channel. The two eruptions
were followed in 3D from their source region to their expansion in the
intermediate corona. Thanks to the combination of VL and UV Metis data, the
formation of a post-CME Current Sheet (CS) was followed for the first time in
the intermediate corona. The plasma temperature gradient across a post-CME blob
propagating along the CS was also measured for the first time. Application of
the polarization ratio technique to Metis data shows that, thanks to the
combination of four different polarization measurements, the errors are reduced
by $\sim 5-7$\%, thus better constraining the 3D distribution of plasma.

single query to the random oracle for each random challenge.
Proofs-of-sequential-work are protocols that facilitate a verifier to
efficiently verify if a prover has executed a specified number of computations
sequentially. Denoting this number of sequential computations with N , the
prover with poly(N) parallelism must take $\Omega(N)$-sequential time while the
verifier verifies the computation in O(log N)-sequential time using upto O(log
N) parallelism. We propose a PoSW that allows any verifier, even the one with
no parallelism, to verify using just a single sequential computation on a
single challenge. All the existing PoSWs [10, 5, 2, 6] mandate a prover to
compute a sequence of responses from a random oracle against N-rounds of
queries. Then the prover commits this sequence using a commitment scheme (e.g.,
Merkle root (like) commitment) predefined in the PoSWs. Now the verifier asks
the prover to provide a set of proofs against t randomly chosen checkpoints,
called challenges, in the computed sequence. The verifier finds out the
commitment from each of these proofs spending O(log N) rounds of queries to the
oracle. It can be reduced to a single round of queries only if the verifier
owns O(log N) parallelism [6]. The verifier in our PoSW demands no parallelism
but uses a single query to the random oracle in order to verify each of the t
challenges. The key observation is that the commitment schemes themselves in
the prior works demand O(log N ) oracle queries to verify.

redundant execution to bring into each new scope all program variables that may

observation that perfectly-nested scopes do not introduce re-execution, and
such perfect nests are produced by known compiler transformations, e.g.,
flattening. Our technique differentiates loops and bulk-parallel operators,
such as map, reduce, histogram, scan, scatter, by specific rewrite rules, and
aggressively optimizes the resulting nested-parallel code. We report an
experimental evaluation that compares with established AD solutions and

subtle, local image patterns (e.g., local image distortion, 3D mask edge and
cut photo edges). The representations of existing PAD works with simple global
pooling method, however, lose the local feature discriminability. In this
paper, the VLAD aggregation method is adopted to quantize local features with
visual vocabulary locally partitioning the feature space, and hence preserve
the local discriminability. We further propose the vocabulary separation and
adaptation method to modify VLAD for cross-domain PADtask. The proposed
vocabulary separation method divides vocabulary into domain-shared and
domain-specific visual words to cope with the diversity of live and attack
faces under the cross-domain scenario. The proposed vocabulary adaptation
method imitates the maximization step of the k-means algorithm in the
end-to-end training, which guarantees the visual words be close to the center
of assigned local features and thus brings robust similarity measurement. We
give illustrations and extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of VLAD with the proposed vocabulary separation and adaptation method on

in galaxies, allowing performing a complete abundance analysis using only the
red-to-near infrared spectral region. We have applied it to a compilation of
high-quality data split into two samples: HII regions (DHR) in spiral and
irregular galaxies, and dwarf galaxies dominated by a strong starburst
(HIIGal). Sulphur abundances have been derived by direct methods under the
assumption of an ionisation structure composed of two zones: an intermediate
one where S{++} is originated and a low ionisation one where S{+} is formed.
Ionisation correction factors (ICF) have been calculated from the Ar{2+}/Ar{3+}
ratio and are shown to correlate with the hardness of the radiation field. Only
about 10% of the objects show S{3+} contributions to the total abundance larger
than 30%. A good correlation exists between sulphur abundance and ionising
temperature with low metallicity objects being ionised by hotter stars. No
correlation is found between ionisation parameter and total S/H abundance. Most
of the HIIGal objects show S/O ratios below the solar value and a trend for
increasing S/O ratios with increasing sulphur abundances while DHR objects show
S/O ratios larger than solar and a tendency for lower S/O ratios for higher
metallicities. Finally, we present a calibration of the sulphur abundance
through the S{23} parameter that remains single valued up to sulphur abundances
well beyond the solar value. S{23} is independent of the ionisation parameter
and only weakly dependent on ionising temperature.

computational seismology. Two main factors drive this challenge. First, to
account for higher frequencies, we have to extend our numerical models, e.g.,
by considering anelasticity, or by including mountain topography. Second, even
if we were able to keep our models unchanged, simply doubling the frequency
content of a seismic wave propagation solver requires a sixteen-fold increase
in computational resources due to the used four-dimensional space-time domains.
  This work presents the Extreme Scale Discontinuous Galerkin Environment
(EDGE) in the context of high-frequency ground motion simulations. Our
presented enhancements cover the entire spectrum of the unstructured finite
element solver. This includes the incorporation of anelasticity, the
introduction of a next-generation clustered local time stepping scheme, and the
introduction of a completely revised communication scheme. We close the
modeling and simulation loop by presenting our new and rich preprocessing,
which drives the high problem-awareness and numerical efficiency of the core

  In summary, the presented work allows us to conduct large scale
high-frequency ground motion simulations efficiently, routinely and
conveniently. The soundness of our work is underlined by a set of
high-frequency verification runs using a realistic setting. We conclude the
presentation by studying EDGE's combined algorithmic and computational

attacks to get some non-negligible amount of information about the secret

check the authenticity of the other party and then exchange the secret message.
Then we extend this to an MDI quantum dialogue (QD) protocol, where both the

article, we first trim residuals - using a depth trimming scheme - and then
square the rest of residuals. The estimator that can minimize the sum of
squares of the trimmed residuals, is called an LST estimator.
  It turns out that LST is a robust alternative to the classic least sum of
squares (LS) estimator. Indeed, it has a very high finite sample breakdown
point, and can resist, asymptotically, up to $50\%$ contamination without
breakdown - in sharp contrast to the $0\%$ of the LS estimator.
  The population version of LST is Fisher consistent, and the sample version is
strong and root-$n$ consistent and asymptotically normal.
  Approximate algorithms for computing LST are proposed and tested in synthetic
and real data examples. These experiments indicate that one of the algorithms
can compute the LST estimator very fast and with relatively smaller variances
than the famous LTS estimator. All the evidence suggests that LST deserves to
be a robust alternative to the LS estimator and is feasible in practice for
high dimensional data sets (with possible contamination and outliers).

question and this has been widely discussed. Here we will examine a distinct
scenario that appears in dynamical tension theories and where string tension is
positive between two surfaces separated by a short distance and at the two
surfaces themselves the string tensions become infinite, therefore producing an
effective confinement of the strings and therefore of all matter and gravity to
the space between these to surfaces, which is in fact a new type of stringy
brane world scenario. The basic formulation for obtaining this scenario consist
of assuming two types of strings characterized by a different constant of
integration related to the spontaneous string tension generation. These string
tension multiplied by the embedding metric define conformally related metrics
that both satisfy Einsteins equation. The braneworlds appear very naturally
when these two metrics are both flat spaces related by a special conformal
transformation. The two types of string tensions are determined and they blow
up at two close expanding surfaces. A puzzling aspect appears then: the
construction is based on flat spaces, but then there are also strings with very
large tension near the boundaries of the braneworld,so can the back reaction
from the infinite tension strings destroy the flat space background?.
Fortunatelly that can be resolved using the mechanism Universe creation from

compression methods that efficiently reduce computation cost and model size. A
common problem in both pruning and distillation is to determine compressed
architecture, i.e., the exact number of filters per layer and layer
configuration, in order to preserve most of the original model capacity. In
spite of the great advances in existing works, the determination of an
excellent architecture still requires human interference or tremendous
experimentations. In this paper, we propose an architecture slimming method
that automates the layer configuration process. We start from the perspective
that the capacity of the over-parameterized model can be largely preserved by
finding the minimum number of filters preserving the maximum parameter variance
per layer, resulting in a thin architecture. We formulate the determination of
compressed architecture as a one-step orthogonal linear transformation, and
integrate principle component analysis (PCA), where the variances of filters in
the first several projections are maximized. We demonstrate the rationality of
our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive
experiments. In particular, we show that under the same overall compression
rate, the compressed architecture determined by our method shows significant
performance gain over baselines after pruning and distillation. Surprisingly,
we find that the resulting layer-wise compression rates correspond to the layer
sensitivities found by existing works through tremendous experimentations.

prognostic analysis and predictive maintenance that can significantly reduce
failure rate and maintenance costs. The degradation-related features extracted

the accuracy of the RUL prediction. The Temporal deep degradation network
(TDDN) model is proposed to make the RUL prediction with the
degradation-related features given by the one-dimensional convolutional neural
network (1D CNN) feature extraction and attention mechanism. 1D CNN is used to
extract the temporal features from the streaming sensor data. Temporal features
have monotonic degradation trends from the fluctuating raw sensor streaming
data. Attention mechanism can improve the RUL prediction performance by
capturing the fault characteristics and the degradation development with the
attention weights. The performance of the TDDN model is evaluated on the public
C-MAPSS dataset and compared with the existing methods. The results show that
the TDDN model can achieve the best RUL prediction accuracy in complex

collection of normal modes of vibration. When the resonator is used as a

optomechanical sensing platforms. We present a mechanical design strategy that
ensures that optomechanical measurements can retrieve information on a single
mechanical degree of freedom, and implement it in a sliced photonic crystal
nanobeam resonator. A spectral design approach is used to make mechanical
symmetries robust against practical disorder. The effectiveness of the method
is evaluated by deriving a relevant figure of merit for continuous and pulsed
measurement application scenarios. The method can be employed in any mechanical
design that presents unwanted spurious mechanical modes. In the nanobeam
platform, we experimentally show an increase of the signal to noise ratio of
the mode of interest over the first spurious mode by four orders of magnitudes.

measures in the financial risk management field. Both academia and financial
institutions are working to improve tail risk forecasts in order to meet the
requirements of the Basel Capital Accord; it states that one purpose of risk
management and measuring risk accuracy is, since extreme movements cannot
always be avoided, financial institutions can prepare for these extreme returns
by capital allocation, and putting aside the appropriate amount of capital so
as to avoid default in times of extreme price or index movements. Forecast
combination has drawn much attention, as a combined forecast can outperform the
individual forecasts under certain conditions. We propose two methodology, one
is a semiparametric combination framework that can jointly produce combined
value at risk and expected shortfall forecasts, another one is a parametric
regression framework named as Quantile-ES regression that can produce combined
expected shortfall forecasts. The favourability of the semiparametric
combination framework has been presented via an empirical study - application
in cryptocurrency markets with high-frequency data where the necessity of risk
management application increases as the cryptocurrency market becomes more
popular and mature. Additionally, the general framework of the parametric
Quantile-ES regression has been presented via a simulation study, whereas it
still need to be improved in the future. The contributions of this work include

gradients before and after iteration, and the other strategy is stratified
sampling by category. The statistic \ $\bar{G}_{mst}$\ designed under these two
strategies can be adaptively unbiased, and its variance decays at a geometric

number of iteration steps,$\lambda$ is a variable related to proportion

tackling this challenge. The CHS is supposed to appear as a third voice to
educate people and keep the social [red lines bold] without limiting the
principles of freedom of speech. In this paper, we review the most important
research in the past and present with a main focus on methodologies, collected
datasets and statistical analysis CHS's impact on social media. The CHS
generation is based on the optimistic assumption that any attempt to intervene
the hate speech in social media can play a positive role in this context.
Beyond that, previous works ignored the investigation of the sequence of
comments before and after the CHS. However, the positive impact is not
guaranteed, as shown in some previous works. To the best of our knowledge, no
attempt has been made to survey the related work to compare the past research
in terms of CHS's impact on social media. We take the first step in this
direction by providing a comprehensive review on related works and categorizing
them based on different factors including impact, methodology, data source,
etc.

estimating students' time-varying concept/skill mastery level from their past
responses to questions and predicting their future performance. One key
limitation of most existing knowledge tracing methods is that they treat
student responses to questions as binary-valued, i.e., whether they are correct
or incorrect. Response correctness analysis/prediction ignores important
information on student knowledge contained in the exact content of the
responses, especially for open-ended questions. In this paper, we conduct the
first exploration into open-ended knowledge tracing (OKT) by studying the new
task of predicting students' exact open-ended responses to questions. Our work
is grounded in the domain of computer science education with programming
questions. We develop an initial solution to the OKT problem, a student
knowledge-guided code generation approach, that combines program synthesis
methods using language models with student knowledge tracing methods. We also
conduct a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments on a real-world
student code dataset to validate OKT and demonstrate its promise in educational
applications.

and now, the Internet of Things (IoT) seems to be doing the same. The potential
of IoT has made it the center of attention for many people, but, where some see
an opportunity to contribute, others may see IoT networks as a target to be
exploited. The high number of IoT devices makes them the perfect setup for
staging denial-of-service attacks (DoS) that can have devastating consequences.
This renders the need for cybersecurity measures such as intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) evident. The aim of this paper is to build an IDS using the big
data platform, Apache Spark. Apache Spark was used along with its ML library
(MLlib) and the BoT-IoT dataset. The IDS was then tested and evaluated based on
F-Measure (f1), as was the standard when evaluating imbalanced data. Two rounds
of tests were performed, a partial dataset for minimizing bias, and the full
BoT-IoT dataset for exploring big data and ML capabilities in a security
setting. For the partial dataset, the Random Forest algorithm had the highest
performance for binary classification at an average f1 measure of 99.7%, as
well as 99.6% for main category classification, and an 88.5% f1 measure for sub
category classification. As for the complete dataset, the Decision Tree
algorithm scored the highest f1 measures for all conducted tests; 97.9% for
binary classification, 79% for main category classification, and 77% for sub
category classification.

  investigation and numerical study based on car-following models",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergence dynamics of traffic instability has always attracted particular
attention. For several decades, researchers have studied the stability of
traffic flow using deterministic traffic models, with less emphasis on the
presence of stochastic factors. However, recent empirical and theoretical
findings have demonstrated that the stochastic factors tend to destabilize
traffic flow and stimulate the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations.
In this paper, we derive a string stability condition of a general stochastic
continuous car-following model by the mean of the generalized Lyapunov
equation. We have found, indeed, that the presence of stochasticity
destabilizes the traffic flow. The impact of stochasticity depends on both the
sensitivity to the gap and the sensitivity to the velocity difference.
Numerical simulations of three typical car-following models have been carried
out to validate our theoretical analysis. Finally, we have calibrated and
validated the stochastic car-following models against empirical data. It is
found that the stochastic car-following models reproduce the observed traffic
instability and capture the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations. Our
results further highlight theoretically and numerically that the stochastic
factors have a significant impact on traffic dynamics.

virtual photons do not interact with the real particles. In this study, we
assume that the creation of high-energy virtual particles is suppressed by a
Boltzmann factor $e^{-\beta E}$ and apply this Boltzmann factor to the
effective potential of the $\phi^4$ theory. Consequently, the effective
potential is transformed into $V(\phi) = 1/4!\phi^4 + \beta^{-4} \left \{
\phi^3 K_3(\phi) -\phi^2 K_2 (\phi) \right\}$. $K_n(x)$ is the modified Bessel
function of the second kind of order $n$. We demonstrate that the minimum of
the effective potential occurs for $\phi \ne 0$.

  Allocation in Multi-Access Edge Computing",,,"10.1109/JIOT.2022.3205051",,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cloud computing is a reliable solution to provide distributed computation
power. However, real-time response is still challenging regarding the enormous
amount of data generated by the IoT devices in 5G and 6G networks. Thus,
multi-access edge computing (MEC), which consists of distributing the edge
servers in the proximity of end-users to have low latency besides the higher
processing power, is increasingly becoming a vital factor for the success of
modern applications. This paper addresses the problem of minimizing both, the
network delay, which is the main objective of MEC, and the number of edge
servers to provide a MEC design with minimum cost. This MEC design consists of
edge servers placement and base stations allocation, which makes it a joint
combinatorial optimization problem (COP). Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)
has shown promising results for COPs. However, modeling real-world problems
using RL when the state and action spaces are large still needs investigation.
We propose a novel RL framework with an efficient representation and modeling
of the state space, action space and the penalty function in the design of the
underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) for solving our problem.

an emerging trend is to combine Machine Learning techniques with the ones
proper of Data Structures. This new area goes under the name of Learned Data
Structures. The motivation for its study is a perceived change of paradigm in
Computer Architectures that would favour the use of Graphics Processing Units
and Tensor Processing Units over conventional Central Processing Units. In
turn, that would favour the use of Neural Networks as building blocks of
Classic Data Structures. Indeed, Learned Bloom Filters, which are one of the
main pillars of Learned Data Structures, make extensive use of Neural Networks
to improve the performance of classic Filters. However, no use of Neural
Networks is reported in the realm of Learned Indexes, which is another main
pillar of that new area. In this contribution, we provide the first, and much
needed, comparative experimental analysis regarding the use of Neural Networks
as building blocks of Learned Indexes. The results reported here highlight the
need for the design of very specialized Neural Networks tailored to Learned
Indexes and it establishes a solid ground for those developments. Our findings,
methodologically important, are of interest to both Scientists and Engineers
working in Neural Networks Design and Implementation, in view also of the
importance of the application areas involved, e.g., Computer Networks and Data
Bases.
