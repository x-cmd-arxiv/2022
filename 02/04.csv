  https://github.com/google-research/diffstride",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Convolutional neural networks typically contain several downsampling
operators, such as strided convolutions or pooling layers, that progressively
reduce the resolution of intermediate representations. This provides some
shift-invariance while reducing the computational complexity of the whole
architecture. A critical hyperparameter of such layers is their stride: the
integer factor of downsampling. As strides are not differentiable, finding the
best configuration either requires cross-validation or discrete optimization
(e.g. architecture search), which rapidly become prohibitive as the search
space grows exponentially with the number of downsampling layers. Hence,
exploring this search space by gradient descent would allow finding better
configurations at a lower computational cost. This work introduces DiffStride,
the first downsampling layer with learnable strides. Our layer learns the size
of a cropping mask in the Fourier domain, that effectively performs resizing in
a differentiable way. Experiments on audio and image classification show the
generality and effectiveness of our solution: we use DiffStride as a drop-in
replacement to standard downsampling layers and outperform them. In particular,
we show that introducing our layer into a ResNet-18 architecture allows keeping
consistent high performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet even when
training starts from poor random stride configurations. Moreover, formulating
strides as learnable variables allows us to introduce a regularization term
that controls the computational complexity of the architecture. We show how
this regularization allows trading off accuracy for efficiency on ImageNet.

neutron star (BNS) merger detected to date in gravitational waves (GWs), and
the local rates of BNS mergers and short gamma-ray bursts are of the same order
of magnitude. This suggests that jet formation is not a rare outcome for BNS
mergers, and we show that this intuition can be turned into a quantitative
constraint: at least about $1/3$ of GW-detected BNS mergers, and at least about
$1/5$ of all BNS mergers, should produce a successful jet (90\% credible
level). Whether a jet is launched depends on the properties of the merger
remnant and of the surrounding accretion disc, which in turn are a function of
the progenitor binary masses and equation of state (EoS). The incidence of jets
in the population therefore carries information about the binary component mass
distribution and EoS. Under the assumption that a jet can only be produced by a
black hole remnant surrounded by a non-negligible accretion disc, we show how
the jet incidence can be used to place a joint constraint on the space of BNS
component mass distributions and EoS. The result points to a broad mass
distribution, with particularly strong support for masses in the
$1.3-1.6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ range. The constraints on the EoS are shallow, but
we show how they will tighten as the knowledge on the jet incidence improves.
We also discuss how to extend the method to include future BNS mergers, with
possibly uncertain jet associations.

gradient boosting. Statistical boosting is a computational approach that
emerged from machine learning, which allows to fit regression models in the
presence of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the algorithm can lead to
data-driven variable selection. In practice, however, the final models
typically tend to include too many variables in some situations. This occurs
particularly for low-dimensional data (p<n), where we observe a slow
overfitting behavior of boosting. As a result, more variables get included into
the final model without altering the prediction accuracy. Many of these false
positives are incorporated with a small coefficient and therefore have a small
impact, but lead to a larger model. We try to overcome this issue by giving the
algorithm the chance to deselect base-learners with minor importance. We
analyze the impact of the new approach on variable selection and prediction
performance in comparison to alternative methods including boosting with
earlier stopping as well as twin boosting. We illustrate our approach with data
of an ongoing cohort study for chronic kidney disease patients, where the most
influential predictors for the health-related quality of life measure are

data received from a vast number of substations and power plants. Given their
large volume and variety, these data can be classified as big data. Managing
this massive amount of data is certainly challenging. Depending on the
application, parts of these data are more important for real-time network
operation. Computing a network's observability score without assigning weights
to different signals may not provide a complete picture of the received data's
validity and thus lead to incorrect assessments of the network status.
Consequently, signals critical to the network operation and functions of an
energy management system (EMS) should be assigned higher weights in
observability calculations. The weighted observability alongside the classic
non-weighted observability can serve as an indicator of each area's condition
in comparison to that of other areas and so greatly facilitate the monitoring
and verification of transmitted data. For calculating a weighted observability,
the current paper presents a method based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process

Minisum, where voters are also allowed to express dependencies between issues.
The price we have to pay when we move to this higher level of expressiveness is
that we end up with a computationally hard rule. Motivated by this, we focus on
the computational aspects of Conditional Minisum, where progress has been
rather scarce so far. We identify restrictions that concern the voters'
dependencies and the value of an optimal solution, under which we provide the
first multiplicative approximation algorithms for the problem. At the same
time, by additionally requiring certain structural properties for the union of
dependencies cast by the whole electorate, we obtain optimal efficient
algorithms for well-motivated special cases. Overall, our work provides a
better understanding on the complexity implications introduced by conditional
voting.

implicit bias toward socially-salient attributes such as race, gender, or
sexual orientation of candidates is known to produce persistent inequality and
reduce aggregate utility for the decision maker. Interventions such as the
Rooney Rule and its generalizations, which require the decision maker to select
at least a specified number of individuals from each affected group, have been
proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of implicit bias in selection. Recent
works have established that such lower-bound constraints can be very effective
in improving aggregate utility in the case when each individual belongs to at
most one affected group. However, in several settings, individuals may belong
to multiple affected groups and, consequently, face more extreme implicit bias
due to this intersectionality. We consider independently drawn utilities and
show that, in the intersectional case, the aforementioned non-intersectional
constraints can only recover part of the total utility achievable in the
absence of implicit bias. On the other hand, we show that if one includes
appropriate lower-bound constraints on the intersections, almost all the
utility achievable in the absence of implicit bias can be recovered. Thus,
intersectional constraints can offer a significant advantage over a
reductionist dimension-by-dimension non-intersectional approach to reducing
inequality.

with temperaturedependent time-resolved photoluminescence measurements (TRPL)
performed on a QD ensemble to further investigate the exciton recombination
dynamics of such polar zero-dimensional nanostructures. By comparing our
results to past reports, we emphasize the complexity of recombination processes
in this system. Instead of the more conventional mono-exponential decay typical
of exciton recombination, TRPL transients display a bi-exponential feature with
short- and long-lived components that persist in the low excitation regime.
From the temperature insensitivity of the long-lived excitonic component, we
first discard the interplay of dark-to-bright state refilling in the exciton
recombination process. Besides, this temperature-invariance also highlights the
absence of nonradiative exciton recombinations, a likely direct consequence of
the strong carrier confinement observed in GaN/AlN QDs up to 300K. Overall, our

challenging concern due to its effect on urban development, air quality, and
pollutant dispersion. In this study, state-of-the-art data-driven methods for
modal analysis of urban flows are used to understand better the dominant flow
processes that occur in this phenomenon. Higher-order dynamic mode
decomposition (HODMD), a highly-efficient method to analyze turbulent flows, is
used with traditional techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
to analyze high-fidelity simulation data of a simplified urban environment.
Furthermore, the spatio-temporal Koopman decomposition (STKD) will be applied
to the temporal modes obtained with HODMD to perform spatial analysis. The flow
interaction within the canopy influences the flow structures, particularly the
arch-vortex. The latter is a vortical structure generally found downstream
wall-mounted obstacles that appears due to flow separation. Therefore, the main
objective of the present study is to characterize the mechanisms that promote
these dynamics in urban areas with different geometries. Remarkably, among all
the vortical structures identified by the HODMD algorithm, low- and
high-frequency modes are classified according to their relation with the arch
vortex. They are referred to as vortex-generators and vortex-breakers,
respectively. This classification implies that one of the processes driving the
formation and destruction of major vortical structures in between the buildings
is the interaction between low- and high-frequency structures. The high energy
revealed by the POD-decomposition for the vortex-breaker modes points to this
destruction process as the mechanism driving the flow dynamics.

  for Cancer Type Classification",,,,,"cs.LG q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For personalized medicines, very crucial intrinsic information is present in
high dimensional omics data which is difficult to capture due to the large
number of molecular features and small number of available samples. Different
types of omics data show various aspects of samples. Integration and analysis
of multi-omics data give us a broad view of tumours, which can improve clinical
decision making. Omics data, mainly DNA methylation and gene expression
profiles are usually high dimensional data with a lot of molecular features. In
recent years, variational autoencoders (VAE) have been extensively used in
embedding image and text data into lower dimensional latent spaces. In our
project, we extend the idea of using a VAE model for low dimensional latent
space extraction with the self-supervised learning technique of feature
subsetting. With VAEs, the key idea is to make the model learn meaningful
representations from different types of omics data, which could then be used
for downstream tasks such as cancer type classification. The main goals are to
overcome the curse of dimensionality and integrate methylation and expression
data to combine information about different aspects of same tissue samples, and
hopefully extract biologically relevant features. Our extension involves
training encoder and decoder to reconstruct the data from just a subset of it.
By doing this, we force the model to encode most important information in the
latent representation. We also added an identity to the subsets so that the
model knows which subset is being fed into it during training and testing. We
experimented with our approach and found that SubOmiEmbed produces comparable
results to the baseline OmiEmbed with a much smaller network and by using just
a subset of the data. This work can be improved to integrate mutation-based
genomic data as well.

distribution drifts has recently attracted intensive interest under the

to solve complex optimization problems. As a result, the wider application of
these techniques is currently limited by its scalability and flexibility --
these techniques often do not scale to large-scale datasets with modern deep

the 0-1 loss. In this paper, we focus on the problem of certifying
distributional robustness for blackbox models and bounded loss functions, and
propose a novel certification framework based on the Hellinger distance. Our
certification technique scales to ImageNet-scale datasets, complex models, and
a diverse set of loss functions. We then focus on one specific application

level. For the first time, a multi-modal feedback control is automatically
learned for this configuration. The key enabler is automatic in-situ
optimization of control laws with machine learning augmented by a gradient
descent algorithm, named gradient-enriched machine learning control (Cornejo
Maceda et al. 2021, gMLC). gMLC is shown to learn one order of magnitude faster
than MLC (Duriez et al. 2017, MLC). The physical interpretation of the feedback
mechanism is assisted by a novel cluster-based control law visualization for
flow dynamics and corresponding actuation commands. Starting point of the
control experiment are two unforced open cavity benchmark configurations: a
narrow-bandwidth regime with a single dominant frequency and a mode-switching
regime where two frequencies compete. The feedback control commands the DBD
actuator located at the leading edge. The flow is monitored by a downstream
hot-wire sensor over the trailing edge. The feedback law is optimized with
respect to the monitored fluctuation level. As reference, the self-oscillations
of the mixing layer are mitigated with steady actuation. Then, a feedback
controller is optimized with gMLC. As expected, feedback control outperforms
steady actuation by achieving both, a better amplitude reduction and a
significantly smaller actuation power, about about 1% of the actuation energy
required for similarly effective steady forcing. Intriguingly, optimized laws
learned for one regime performs well for the other untested regime as well. The
proposed control strategy can be expected to be applicable for many other shear
flow experiments.

probed in neutrino experiments poses a great challenge. In neutrino
experiments, which operate under semi-inclusive conditions, cascade models are
commonly used for this task, while under exclusive conditions FSI can be
treated with relativistic optical potentials (ROP). We formulate conditions
under which the ROP approach and cascade model can be directly compared. We
feed the NEUT cascade with events from a relativistic distorted-wave impulse
approximation calculation that uses the real part of an optical potential. Cuts
on the missing energy of the resulting events are applied to define a set of
events that can be directly compared to RDWIA calculations with the full
optical potential. The NEUT cascade and ROP agree for proton kinetic energies
$T_p > 150$ MeV for carbon, oxygen and calcium nuclei when a realistic nuclear
density is used to introduce events in the cascade. For $T_p < 100$ MeV the ROP
and NEUT cross sections differ in shape and differences in magnitude are larger
than 50 \%. Single transverse variables allow to distinguish different
approaches to FSI, but due to a large non-QE contribution the comparison to T2K
data does not give an unambiguous view of FSI. We discuss electron scattering
and argue that with a cut in missing energy FSI can be studied with minimal
confounding factors in e.g. $e4\nu$. The agreement of the ROP and NEUT for T2K
conditions lends confidence to these models as a tool in oscillation analyses
for sufficiently large nucleon kinetic energies. These results urge for caution
when a cascade model is applied for small nucleon energies. The assessment of
model assumptions relevant to this region are strongly encouraged. This paper
provides novel constraints on cascade models from proton-nucleus scattering
that can be easily applied to other neutrino event generators.

started to be recognized as a powerful tool. However, due to the black-box
nature of machine learning, it is difficult to analyze what machine learns or
why it is powerful. Here, by applying one of the simplest neural networks, the
restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), to the ground-state representation of the
one-dimensional (1D) transverse-field Ising (TFI) model, we make an attempt to
directly analyze the optimized network parameters. In the RBM optimization, a
zero-temperature quantum state is mapped onto a finite-temperature classical
state of the extended Ising spins that constitute the RBM. We find that the
quantum phase transition from the ordered phase to the disordered phase in the
1D TFI model by increasing the transverse field is clearly reflected in the
behaviors of the optimized RBM parameters and hence in the finite-temperature
phase diagram of the classical RBM Ising system. The present finding of a
correspondence between the neural-network parameters and quantum phases
suggests that a careful investigation of the neural-network parameters may
provide a new route to extracting nontrivial physical insights from the

prior knowledge. Finally, we show that additional statistical knowledge can be
incorporated into the training to improve the prediction if available.

appropriately used only if adequately documented. Unfortunately, the
algorithmic fairness community suffers from a collective data documentation

of five important data curation topics: anonymization, consent, inclusivity,

levels of attention to these topics, making them tangible, and distill them

domains such as energy systems and economics. Creating a forecasting model for
a specific use case requires an iterative and complex design process. The
typical design process includes the five sections (1) data pre-processing, (2)
feature engineering, (3) hyperparameter optimization, (4) forecasting method
selection, and (5) forecast ensembling, which are commonly organized in a
pipeline structure. One promising approach to handle the ever-growing demand
for time series forecasts is automating this design process. The present paper,
thus, analyzes the existing literature on automated time series forecasting
pipelines to investigate how to automate the design process of forecasting
models. Thereby, we consider both Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and
automated statistical forecasting methods in a single forecasting pipeline. For
this purpose, we firstly present and compare the proposed automation methods
for each pipeline section. Secondly, we analyze the automation methods
regarding their interaction, combination, and coverage of the five pipeline
sections. For both, we discuss the literature, identify problems, give
recommendations, and suggest future research. This review reveals that the
majority of papers only cover two or three of the five pipeline sections. We
conclude that future research has to holistically consider the automation of
the forecasting pipeline to enable the large-scale application of time series
forecasting.

report. The duty of the bug triage team is to study the developers profiles
well in order to make an appropriate match between the developers and the
incoming bug reports. Thus, this process is a vital step in issue management
system. In fact, the number of bug reports submitted every day is gradually
increasing which affects the developer workload. Thus, the triage team should
consider this factor in distributing the bugs and because of the manual
approach, many developers are burden. In particular, triaging bug reports
without considering the workload does not only affect the developers workload
but also leads to an increase in the number of unaddressed bug reports. As a
result, the fixing time of the reported bugs will relatively increase. Unlike
other researchers who focus on automating the bug triage and ignoring the
developer workload, in this work, we handle the triaging process from a
different perspective. The proposed approach focuses on how to optimize the bug
fixing time by normalizing the developer load in an automating system. To
evaluate our work, we use 26,317 bug reports from different bug repositories.
Results shows that our work outperforms other systems in terms of optimizing
the bug total fixing time and normalizing developer load.

adoption in search and recommender systems, since they allow efficient reuse of
existing log data. However, there are fundamental limits to using existing log
data alone, since the counterfactual estimators that are commonly used in these
methods can have large bias and large variance when the logging policy is very
different from the target policy being evaluated. To overcome this limitation,
we explore the question of how to design data-gathering policies that most
effectively augment an existing dataset of bandit feedback with additional
observations for both learning and evaluation. To this effect, this paper
introduces Minimum Variance Augmentation Logging (MVAL), a method for
constructing logging policies that minimize the variance of the downstream
evaluation or learning problem. We explore multiple approaches to computing
MVAL policies efficiently, and find that they can be substantially more
effective in decreasing the variance of an estimator than na\""ive approaches.

interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) on many occasions. Although
various factors like interplanetary shocks, chromospheric evaporation and
""sludge removal"" have been separately invoked in the past to address the AHe
enhancements in ICMEs, none of these processes could explain the variability of
AHe in ICMEs comprehensively. Based on extensive analysis of 275 ICME events,
we show that there is a solar activity variation of ICME averaged AHe values.
The investigation also reveals that the first ionization potential effect as
well as coronal temperature are not the major contributing factors for AHe
enhancements in ICMEs. Investigation on concurrent solar flares and ICME events
for 63 cases reveals that chromospheric evaporation in tandem with
gravitational settling determine the AHe enhancements and variabilities beyond
8% in ICMEs. While chromospheric evaporation releases the helium from
chromosphere into the corona, the gravitationally settled helium is thrown out
during the ICMEs.We show that the intensity and timing of the preceding flares
from the same active region from where the CME erupts are important factors to
understand the AHe enhancements in ICMEs.

use in applications is often hindered by two major limitations: the
computational complexity required to compute such descriptors exactly, and
their sensitivity to even low-level proportions of outliers. In this work, we
propose to bypass these two burdens in a data-driven setting by entrusting the
estimation of (vectorization of) PDs built on top of point clouds to a neural
network architecture that we call RipsNet. Once trained on a given data set,
RipsNet can estimate topological descriptors on test data very efficiently with
generalization capacity. Furthermore, we prove that RipsNet is robust to input
perturbations in terms of the 1-Wasserstein distance, a major improvement over
the standard computation of PDs that only enjoys Hausdorff stability, yielding
RipsNet to substantially outperform exactly-computed PDs in noisy settings. We
showcase the use of RipsNet on both synthetic and real-world data. Our

a Fano-Anderson type of Hamiltonian to model the environment and solve the
quantum Langevin equation. From the solution of the quantum Langevin equation
we obtain the Green's functions which are used to calculate the expectation
value of the quadrature operators which are in turn used to construct the
covariance matrix. We use a relative entropy based measure to calculate the
quantum coherence of the mode. The single mode squeezed thermal state is
studied in the Ohmic, sub-Ohmic and the super-Ohmic limits for different values
of the mean photon number. In all these limits, we find that when the coupling
between the system and the environment is weak, the coherence decays
monotonically and exhibit a Markovian nature. When the system and the
environment are strongly coupled, we observe that the evolution is initially
Markovian and after some time it becomes non-Markovian. The non-Markovian
effect is due to the environmental back action on the system. Finally, we also
present the steady state dynamics of the coherence in the long time limit in
both low and high temperature regime. We find that the qualitative behavior
remains the same in both the low and high temperature limits. But quantitative
values differ because the coherence in the system is lower due to thermal
decoherence.

Motion capture is typically performed with optical or inertial measurement

segmentation approaches use multiple stages of temporal convolutions. The main
idea is to generate an initial prediction with several layers of temporal
convolutions and refine these predictions over multiple stages, also with
temporal convolutions. Although these approaches capture long-term temporal
patterns, the initial predictions do not adequately consider the spatial
hierarchy among the human joints. To address this limitation, we recently
introduced multi-stage spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural networks
(MS-GCN). Our framework replaces the initial stage of temporal convolutions
with spatial graph convolutions and dilated temporal convolutions, which better
exploit the spatial configuration of the joints and their long-term temporal

Experimental results demonstrate that our framework is a strong baseline for

queueing theory. To answer this question, we use a deep learning model to
predict the stationary queue-length distribution of an $M/G/1$ queue (Poisson
arrivals, general service times, one server). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time a machine learning model is applied to a general
queueing theory problem. We chose $M/G/1$ queue for this paper because it lies
""on the cusp"" of the analytical frontier: on the one hand exact solution for
this model is available, which is both computationally and mathematically
complex. On the other hand, the problem (specifically the service time
distribution) is general. This allows us to compare the accuracy and efficiency
of the deep learning approach to the analytical solutions.
  The two key challenges in applying machine learning to this problem are (1)
generating a diverse set of training examples that provide a good
representation of a ""generic"" positive-valued distribution, and (2)
representations of the continuous distribution of service times as an input. We
show how we overcome these challenges.
  Our results show that our model is indeed able to predict the stationary
behavior of the $M/G/1$ queue extremely accurately: the average value of our
metric over the entire test set is $0.0009$. Moreover, our machine learning
model is very efficient, computing very accurate stationary distributions in a
fraction of a second (an approach based on simulation modeling would take much
longer to converge). We also present a case-study that mimics a real-life
setting and shows that our approach is more robust and provides more accurate
solutions compared to the existing methods. This shows the promise of extending
our approach beyond the analytically solvable systems (e.g., $G/G/1$ or
$G/G/c$).

gas (DIG) and determined the fraction of Ha luminosity originating from the DIG
(f_DIG). We observe that both stars and gas trace the galactic disk rotation,
as well as a fast-rotating nuclear component, likely connected to secular
processes driven by the galactic bar. In the gas kinematics, we observe a
stream east of the nucleus, redshifted with respect to the disk. The stream is
surrounded by an extended ionised gas region with enhanced velocity dispersion
and a high ionisation state, which is largely consistent with being ionised by
slow shocks. We interpret this feature as either the superposition of the disk
and an extraplanar layer of DIG, or as a bar-driven inflow of shocked gas. A
double Gaussian component fit to the Ha line also reveals the presence of a
nuclear biconic structure whose axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the bar.
The two cones appear blue- and redshifted along the line of sight and stand out
for having an Ha emission separated by up to 200 km s-1 from that of the disk,
and a high velocity dispersion ~80-200 km s-1. At the far end of the cones, we
observe that the gas is consistent with being ionised by shocks. These features
had never been observed before in M83; we postulate that they are tracing a
starburst-driven outflow shocking into the surrounding ISM. Finally, we obtain
f_DIG ~ 13% in our field of view. We inspect the emission of the HII regions

generated by the strain of the graphene membrane. They work for ballistic

technological factors that are assumed to or even have been proven to
contribute to what has been coined as Zoom Fatigue (ZF) or more generally
Videoconferencing Fatigue (VCF). With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, the
usage of VC services has drastically increased, leading to more and more
reports about the ZF or VCF phenomenon. The paper is motivated by the fact that
some of the media outlets initially starting the debate on what Zoom fatigue is
and how it can be avoided, as well as some of the scientific papers addressing
the topic, contain assumptions that are rather hypothetical and insufficiently
underpinned by scientific evidence. Most of these works are acknowledge the
lacking evidence and partly suggest directions for future research. This paper
intends to deepen the survey of VC-technology-related literature and to provide
more existing evidence, where possible, while reviewing some of the already
provided support or evidence for certain causal hypotheses. The technological
factors dimension and its identified sub-dimensions presented in this paper are
embedded within a more holistic four-dimensional conceptual factors model
describing the causes for ZF or VCF. The paper describing this overall
conceptual model is written by the same group of authors and currently under
revision for an Open Access Journal publication. The present paper expands on
the technological factors dimension descriptions provided in the overall model
paper and provides more detailed analyzes and concepts associated with how VC
technology may affect users' perception, cognitive load, interaction and
communication, possibly leading to stress, exhaustion and fatigue. The paper
currently is a living document which will be expanded further with regard to
the evidence for or against the impact of certain technological factors.

datasets but, like standard RL methods, it requires reward annotations for
every transition. In many cases, labeling large datasets with rewards may be
costly, especially if those rewards must be provided by human labelers, while
collecting diverse unlabeled data might be comparatively inexpensive. How can
we best leverage such unlabeled data in offline RL? One natural solution is to
learn a reward function from the labeled data and use it to label the unlabeled
data. In this paper, we find that, perhaps surprisingly, a much simpler method
that simply applies zero rewards to unlabeled data leads to effective data
sharing both in theory and in practice, without learning any reward model at
all. While this approach might seem strange (and incorrect) at first, we
provide extensive theoretical and empirical analysis that illustrates how it
trades off reward bias, sample complexity and distributional shift, often
leading to good results. We characterize conditions under which this simple
strategy is effective, and further show that extending it with a simple
reweighting approach can further alleviate the bias introduced by using
incorrect reward labels. Our empirical evaluation confirms these findings in
simulated robotic locomotion, navigation, and manipulation settings.

coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more
dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals
and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model
myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. In this
paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of
co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary
networks, which receive feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the
networks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the
co-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto
networks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a
generalized Vlasov type equation. We treat the graph limits as graph measures,
motivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph
measures, arXiv:2107.08419, 2021]. Under a mild condition on the initial graph
measure, we show that the graph measures are positive over a finite time
interval. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled
on non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent
networks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work is the first to
rigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model. The approach is
based on our formulation of a generalization of the co-evolutionary network as
a hybrid system of ODEs and measure differential equations parametrized by a
vertex variable, together with an analogue of the variation of parameters
formula, as well as the generalized Neunzert's in-cell-particle method

greedy algorithm for exhaustively generating spanning trees using such a
minimal change operation. The resulting listing is then studied to find a
recursive algorithm that produces the same listing in $O(1)$-amortized time
using $O(n)$ space. Additionally, we present $O(n)$-time algorithms for ranking

been of strong scientific and theoretical interest as a starting point to
identify ""what causes what?"" Contingent on assumptions and a proper learning
algorithm, it is sometimes possible to identify and accurately estimate a
causal directed acyclic graph (DAG), as opposed to a Markov equivalence class
of graphs that gives ambiguity of causal directions. The focus of this paper is
in highlighting the identifiability and estimation of DAGs with general error
distributions through a general sequential sorting procedure that orders
variables one at a time, starting at root nodes, followed by children of the
root nodes, and so on until completion. We demonstrate a novel application of
this general approach to estimate the topological ordering of a DAG. At each
step of the procedure, only simple likelihood ratio scores are calculated on
regression residuals to decide the next node to append to the current partial
ordering. The computational complexity of our algorithm on a p-node problem is
O(pd), where d is the maximum neighborhood size. Under mild assumptions, the
population version of our procedure provably identifies a true ordering of the
underlying DAG. We provide extensive numerical evidence to demonstrate that
this sequential procedure scales to possibly thousands of nodes and works well
for high-dimensional data. We accompany these numerical experiments with an
application to a single-cell gene expression dataset.

state. In spherical geometry, the Hafnian PH-Pfaffian state has the same
magnetic flux number as the Pfaffian state, allowing a direct numerical
comparison between the two states. Results of exact diagonalization of finite
systems in the second Landau level show that the overlap of the exact ground
state with the Hafnian PH-Pfaffian state exceeds that with the Pfaffian state
when the short range component of the Coulomb interaction increases to a
certain level, lending a numerical support to the Hafnian PH-Pfaffian state. We

thermal Hall conductance measurement. Finally we present numerical results on
two new wavefunctions formed by increasing the relative angular momentum by two

Efficient implementation on many-core architectures is challenging as the
workload across the integration space cannot be predicted a priori. We propose
m-Cubes, a novel implementation of the well-known Vegas algorithm for execution
on GPUs. Vegas transforms integration variables followed by calculation of a
Monte Carlo integral estimate using adaptive partitioning of the resulting
space. m-Cubes improves performance on GPUs by maintaining relatively uniform
workload across the processors. As a result, our optimized Cuda implementation
for Nvidia GPUs outperforms parallelization approaches proposed in past
literature. We further demonstrate the efficiency of m-Cubes by evaluating a
six-dimensional integral from a cosmology application, achieving significant
speedup and greater precision than the CUBA library's CPU implementation of
VEGAS. We also evaluate m-Cubes on a standard integrand test suite. m-Cubes
outperforms the serial implementations of the Cuba and GSL libraries by orders
of magnitude speedup while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach yields
a speedup of at least 10 when compared against publicly available Monte Carlo
based GPU implementations. In summary, m-Cubes can solve integrals that are
prohibitively expensive using standard libraries and custom implementations. A
modern C++ interface header-only implementation makes m-Cubes portable,
allowing its utilization in complicated pipelines with easy to define stateful
integrals. Compatibility with non-Nvidia GPUs is achieved with our initial
implementation of m-Cubes using the Kokkos framework.

to the linear system. However, approximately solving the linear system at each
iteration of an IPM invalidates the theoretical guarantees of common IPM
analyses. To remedy this, we theoretically and empirically analyze (slightly
modified) predictor-corrector IPMs when using approximate linear solvers: our
approach guarantees that, when certain conditions are satisfied, the number of
IPM iterations does not increase and that the final solution remains feasible.
We also provide practical instantiations of approximate linear solvers that
satisfy these conditions for special classes of constraint matrices using
randomized linear algebra.

govern the physical world. The traditional process of turning observations into
physical understanding is slow. Imperfect models are constructed and tested to
explain relationships in data. Powerful new algorithms can enable computers to
learn physics by observing images and videos. Inspired by this idea, instead of
training machine learning models using physical quantities, we used images,
that is, pixel information. For this work, and as a proof of concept, the
physics of interest are wind-driven spatial patterns. These phenomena include
features in Aeolian dunes and volcanic ash deposition, wildfire smoke, and air
pollution plumes. We use computer model simulations of spatial deposition
patterns to approximate images from a hypothetical imaging device whose outputs
are red, green, and blue (RGB) color images with channel values ranging from 0
to 255. In this paper, we explore deep convolutional neural network-based
autoencoders to exploit relationships in wind-driven spatial patterns, which
commonly occur in geosciences, and reduce their dimensionality. Reducing the
data dimension size with an encoder enables training deep, fully connected
neural network models linking geographic and meteorological scalar input
quantities to the encoded space. Once this is achieved, full spatial patterns
are reconstructed using the decoder. We demonstrate this approach on images of
spatial deposition from a pollution source, where the encoder compresses the
dimensionality to 0.02% of the original size, and the full predictive model
performance on test data achieves a normalized root mean squared error of 8%, a
figure of merit in space of 94% and a precision-recall area under the curve of

mass-accreting star. We fitted the light and velocity data with the package
PHOEBE, and determined the best-fitting model adopting the configuration of a
semi-detached system. The orbital period has been improved using a recent (O-C)

2.6641496 $\pm$ 0.0000001 days. The absence of any cyclic variation in the
(O-C) residuals confirms the long-term stability of the orbital period.
Furthermore, we show that the models derived for each light curve separately
entail small differences, e.g. in the temperature parameter T$_{\rm eff,2}$.
The high quality of the new solutions is illustrated by the residuals. We
obtained the following absolute component parameters: L$_1$ =
14.125~L$_{\odot}$, M$_1$ = 2.014~M$_{\odot}$, R$_1$ = 1.733~R$_{\odot}$, log
g$_1$ = 4.264, L$_2$ = 4.345~L$_{\odot}$, M$_2$ = 0.211~M$_{\odot}$, R$_2$ =
2.19~R$_{\odot}$, log g$_2$ = 3.078~ with T$_{\rm eff,2}$/T$_{\rm eff,1}$ =
0.662 $\pm$ 0.002. Although the orbital period appears to be stable on the long
term, we show that the light-curve shape is affected by a years-long modulation
which is most probably due to the magnetic activity of the cool companion.

But can pre-trained LMs be further leveraged for more general machine learning
problems? We propose an approach for using LMs to scaffold learning and
generalization in general sequential decision-making problems. In this
approach, goals and observations are represented as a sequence of embeddings,
and a policy network initialized with a pre-trained LM predicts the next
action. We demonstrate that this framework enables effective combinatorial
generalization across different environments and supervisory modalities. We
begin by assuming access to a set of expert demonstrations, and show that
initializing policies with LMs and fine-tuning them via behavior cloning
improves task completion rates by 43.6% in the VirtualHome environment. Next,
we integrate an active data gathering procedure in which agents iteratively
interact with the environment, relabel past ""failed"" experiences with new
goals, and update their policies in a self-supervised loop. Active data
gathering further improves combinatorial generalization, outperforming the best
baseline by 25.1%. Finally, we explain these results by investigating three
possible factors underlying the effectiveness of the LM-based policy. We find
that sequential input representations (vs. fixed-dimensional feature vectors)
and LM-based weight initialization are both important for generalization.
Surprisingly, however, the format of the policy inputs encoding (e.g. as a
natural language string vs. an arbitrary sequential encoding) has little
influence. Together, these results suggest that language modeling induces
representations that are useful for modeling not just language, but also goals
and plans; these representations can aid learning and generalization even
outside of language processing.

superconducting electrodes separated by a nanometer thin oxide layer, provide a
precious source of nonlinearity for superconducting quantum circuits and are at
the heart of state-of-the-art qubits, such as the transmon and fluxonium. Here,
we show that in a fluxonium qubit the role of the JJ can also be played by a
lithographically defined, self-structured granular aluminum (grAl)
nano-junction: a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) JJ obtained in a
single layer, zero-angle evaporation. The measured spectrum of the resulting
qubit, which we nickname gralmonium, is indistinguishable from the one of a
standard fluxonium qubit. Remarkably, the lack of a mesoscopic parallel plate
capacitor gives rise to an intrinsically large grAl nano-junction charging
energy in the range of tens of $\mathrm{GHz}$, comparable to its Josephson
energy $E_\mathrm{J}$. We measure average energy relaxation times of
$T_1=10\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and Hahn echo coherence times of
$T_2^\text{echo}=9\,\mathrm{\mu s}$. The exponential sensitivity of the
gralmonium to the $E_\text{J}$ of the grAl nano-junction provides a highly
susceptible detector. Indeed, we observe spontaneous jumps of the value of
$E_\text{J}$ on timescales from milliseconds to days, which offer a powerful
diagnostics tool for microscopic defects in superconducting materials.

This hypothetical ultra-rare nuclear decay offers a privileged portal to
physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Its observation would
constitute the discovery of a matter-creating process, corroborating leading
theories of why the universe contains more matter than antimatter, and how
forces unify at high energy scales. It would also prove that neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos are not two distinct particles, but can transform into each
other, with their mass described by a unique mechanism conceived by Majorana.
The recognition that neutrinos are not massless necessitates an explanation and
has boosted interest in neutrinoless double-beta decay. The field stands now at
a turning point. A new round of experiments is currently being prepared for the
next decade to cover an important region of parameter space. In parallel,
advances in nuclear theory are laying the groundwork to connect the nuclear
decay with the underlying new physics. Meanwhile, the particle theory landscape
continues to find new motivations for neutrinos to be their own antiparticle.

gravitational wave emission from small mass-ratio compact binaries. This method
perturbatively expands the metric of the binary in powers of the mass ratio.
The source for the perturbations depends on the orbital configuration,
calculational approach, and the order of the perturbative expansion. These
sources fall into three broad classes: (i) distributional, (ii) worldtube, and
(iii) unbounded support. The latter, in particular, is important for emerging
second-order (in the mass ratio) calculations. Traditional frequency domain
approaches employ the variation of parameters method and compute the
perturbation on standard time slices with numerical boundary conditions
supplied at finite radius from series expansions of the asymptotic behavior.
This approach has been very successful, but the boundary conditions
calculations are tedious, and the approach is not well suited to unbounded
sources where homogeneous solutions must be computed at all radii. This work
develops an alternative approach where hyperboloidal slices foliate the
spacetime, and compactifying coordinates simplify the boundary treatment. We
implement this approach with a multi-domain spectral solver with analytic mesh
refinement and use the scalar-field self-force on circular orbits around a
Schwarzschild black hole as an example problem. The method works efficiently
for all three source classes encountered in self-force calculations and has
distinct advantages over the traditional approach. For example, our code
efficiently computes the perturbation for orbits with extremely large orbital
radii ($r_{p}>10^5M$) or modes with very high spherical harmonic mode index
($\ell \ge 100$). Our results indicate that hyperboloidal methods can play an
essential role in self-force calculations.

Millennium Run simulation, it has been proven very difficult to be detected
observationally, with only a few convincing claims of detection so far. The
main obstacle lies in finding an accurate proxy of the halo formation time. In
this study, by utilizing a constrained simulation that can faithfully reproduce
the observed structures larger than $2\,$Mpc in the local universe, for a
sample of 634 massive clusters at $z\le 0.12$, we find their counterpart halos
in the simulation and use the mass growth history of the matched halos to
estimate the formation time of the observed clusters. This allows us to
construct a pair of early- and late-forming clusters, with similar mass as
measured via weak gravitational lensing, and large-scale bias differing at
$\approx 3\sigma$ level, suggestive of the signature of assembly bias, which is
further corroborated by the properties of cluster galaxies, including the
brightest cluster galaxy, and the spatial distribution and number of member
galaxies. Our study paves a way to further detect assembly bias based on
cluster samples constructed purely on observed quantities.

of black hole formation. In order to source such objects, one often relies on
the presence of heavy seeds ($M \approx 10^{4-6} \, M_{\odot}$) in place at
early times. Unfortunately, the formation of these heavy seeds are difficult to
realize within the standard astrophysical context. Here, we investigate whether
superconducting cosmic string loops can source sufficiently strong
overdensities in the early universe to address this mystery. We review a set of
direct collapse conditions under which a primordial gas cloud will undergo
monolithic collapse into a massive black hole (forming with a mass of $M_{BH}

systematically show how superconducting cosmic string loops can satisfy such

impact on out-of-domain model performance, using a sample of 120 users who
shared both. We found that users use Facebook for sharing experiences (e.g.,
leisure) and SMS for task-oriented and conversational purposes (e.g., plan

downstream effects of these differences, we used pre-trained Facebook-based

the gluon, which encodes its entanglement with the sources. Our expressions
provide the dependence of the density matrix on the soft cutoff $x$ for the

investigate countries' development and forecast national economic growth.
Changing the subject from countries to companies, a significantly different
scenario emerges. Through the analysis of a unique dataset of Italian firms'
exports and a worldwide dataset comprising countries' exports, here we find
that, while a globally nested structure is observed at the country level, a
local, in-block nested structure emerges at the level of firms. Remarkably,
this in-block nestedness is statistically significant with respect to suitable
null models and the algorithmic partitions of products into blocks have a high
correspondence with exogenous product classifications. These findings lay a
solid foundation for developing a scientific approach based on the physics of
complex systems to the analysis of companies, which has been lacking until now.

perfect privacy (zero information leakage) of the sensitive genotypes at a
pre-specified set of secret locations. The sensitive genotypes could indicate
rare diseases and/or other health traits that one may want to keep private. We
present two local count-query mechanisms for the above problem that achieve
perfect privacy for sensitive genotypes while minimizing the expected absolute

lower bound of the per-user probability of error for an arbitrary query
answering mechanism that satisfies perfect privacy. We show that our mechanisms
achieve error that is close to the lower bound, and are match the lower bound
for some special cases. We numerically show that the performance of each

matrix elements, and then summed over quantum numbers of the heavy quark pair.
In principle, at short-distances, the heavy quark pair can be either in a

relative contributions to compare with data and to make predictions in
different experimental environments. From the explicit form of the lowest-order
perturbative matrix elements for color-singlet and color-octet production, we
show that the structure of the optimal observable for discrimination on phase
space, the likelihood ratio, has strong dependence on the angular momentum
state of the heavy quark pair. This presents an obstruction for construction of
a single, robust discrimination observable that can be applied to production of
an arbitrary quarkonium state.

identifying such novelties in real-time is nontrivial. To address this issue,
the SAFE-OCC framework leverages the convolutional blocks of the CNN to create
an effective feature space to conduct novelty detection using a desired

multiwavelength photon studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is entering an
exciting new phase. The first hint of a possible neutrino signal from the
blazar TXS 0506+056 leads to the anticipation that AGN could soon be identified
as point sources of high-energy neutrino radiation, representing another
messenger signature besides the well-established photon signature. To
understand the complex flaring behavior at multiwavelengths, a genuine
theoretical understanding needs to be developed. These observations of the
electromagnetic spectrum and neutrinos can only be interpreted fully when the
charged, relativistic particles responsible for the different emissions are
modeled properly. The description of the propagation of cosmic rays in a
magnetized plasma is a complex question that can only be answered when
analysing the transport regimes of cosmic rays in a quantitative way. In this
paper, we therefore present a quantitative analysis of the propagation regimes
of cosmic rays in the approach that is most commonly used to model non-thermal
emission signatures from blazars, i.e. the existence of a high-energy
cosmic-ray population in a relativistic plasmoid traveling along the jet axis.
In this paper, we show that in the considered energy range of high-energy
photon and neutrino emission, the transition between diffusive and ballistic
propagation takes place, significantly influencing not only the spectral energy

gravitational waves is one of the most promised tools to study the properties
of dense nuclear matter at high densities. It is worth claiming that, at the
moment, strong evidence that the temperature of the stars is zero during the
last orbits before coalescing, does not exist. Nevertheless, theoretical
studies suggest that the temperature concerning the inspiral phase, could reach
even a few MeV. According to the main theory, tides transfer mechanical energy
and angular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction
within the star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral,
these effects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used
to estimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal
friction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger
tidal effects. The present work is dedicated to the study of the effect of
temperature on the tidal deformability of neutron stars during the inspiral of
a neutron star system just before the merger. We applied a class of hot
equations of state, both isothermal and adiabatic, originated from various
nuclear models. We found that even for low values of temperature ($T<1$ MeV),
the effects on the basic ingredients of tidal deformability are not negligible.
On the other hand, in the case of the adiabatic star, the thermal effects on
tidal deformability remain imperceptible, up to the value $S=0.2 \ {\rm
k}_{B}$. According to the main finding, the effect of the temperature on the
tidal deformability is indistinguishable. The consequences of the above result
are discussed and analyzed.

simulations of the Hall and Ohmic effect in neutron stars crusts. While
simulations of these effects have explored a variety of geometries and wide
ranges of physical parameters, they are limited to relatively low values of the
Hall parameter, playing the role of the magnetic Reynolds number, which should
be not exceed a few hundred for numerical convergence.
  We study the evolution of the magnetic field in a plane-parallel Cartesian
geometry. We discretise the induction equation using a finite difference scheme
and then integrate it via the Euler forward method. Two different approaches
are used for the integration of the advective terms appearing in the equation:
a Forward Time and Central in Space (FTCS) and an Upwind scheme. We compare
them in terms of accuracy and performance. We explore the impact of the Upwind
method on convergence according to the ratio of planar to vertical field and
the Hall parameter. In the limit of a low strength planar field the use of an
Upwind scheme provides a vast improvement leading to the convergence of
simulations where the Hall parameter is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that
of the FTCS. Upwind is still better if the planar field is stronger, yet, the
difference of the maximum value of the Hall parameter reached is within a
factor of 10 or a few. Moreover, we notice if the schemes diverge their
behaviour is very different, with FTCS producing infinite energy, while the
Upwind scheme only temporarily increasing the overall magnetic field energy.
  Overall, the Upwind scheme enhances the efficiency of the simulations
allowing the exploration of environments with higher value of electric
conductivity getting us closer than before to realistic environmental
conditions of magnetars.

reduced order model (ROM) of the wave operator. The presentation is for the
acoustic wave equation, but the approach can be extended to elastic or
electromagnetic waves. The data are time resolved measurements of the pressure
wave gathered by an acquisition system which probes the unknown medium with
pulses and measures the generated waves. We propose to solve the inverse
problem of velocity estimation by minimizing the square misfit between the ROM
computed from the recorded data and the ROM computed from the modeled data, at
the current guess of the velocity. We give the step by step computation of the
ROM, which depends nonlinearly on the data and yet can be obtained from them in
a non-iterative fashion, using efficient methods from linear algebra. We also
explain how to make the ROM robust to data inaccuracy. The ROM computation
requires the full array response matrix gathered with collocated sources and
receivers. However, we show that the computation can deal with an approximation
of this matrix, obtained from towed-streamer data using interpolation and
reciprocity on-the-fly.
  While the full-waveform inversion approach of nonlinear least-squares data
fitting is challenging without low frequency information, due to multiple
minima of the data fit objective function, we show that the ROM misfit
objective function has a better behavior, even for a poor initial guess. We
also show by an explicit computation of the objective functions in a simple
setting that the ROM misfit objective function has convexity properties,
whereas the least squares data fit objective function displays multiple local
minima.

(ERG) models, which form a comprehensive family of models that include
independent and dyadic edge models, Markov random graphs, and many other graph
distributions, in addition to allow the inclusion of covariates that can lead
to a better fit of the model.
  Another increasingly popular class of models in statistical network analysis
are stochastic block models (SBMs). They can be used for the purpose of
grouping nodes into communities or discovering and analyzing a latent structure
of a network. The stochastic block model is a generative model for random
graphs that tends to produce graphs containing subsets of nodes characterized
by being connected to each other, called communities.
  Many researchers from various areas have been using computational tools to
adjust these models without, however, analyzing their suitability for the data
of the networks they are studying. The complexity involved in the estimation
process and in the goodness-of-fit verification methodologies for these models
can be factors that make the analysis of adequacy difficult and a possible
discard of one model in favor of another.
  And it is clear that the results obtained through an inappropriate model can
lead the researcher to very wrong conclusions about the phenomenon studied.
  The purpose of this work is to present a simple methodology, based on
Hypothesis Tests, to verify if there is a model specification error for these
two cases widely used in the literature to represent complex networks: the ERGM
and the SBM. We believe that this tool can be very useful for those who want to
use these models in a more careful way, verifying beforehand if the models are
suitable for the data under study.

research problem. Recent advances in RGB-D fusion have demonstrated the
potential of producing 3D models from consumer-level RGB-D cameras. However,
due to the discrete nature and limited resolution of their surface
representations (e.g., point- or voxel-based), existing approaches suffer from
the accumulation of errors in camera tracking and distortion in the
reconstruction, which leads to an unsatisfactory 3D reconstruction. In this
paper, we present a method using on-the-fly implicits of Hermite Radial Basis
Functions (HRBFs) as a continuous surface representation for camera tracking in
an existing RGB-D fusion framework. Furthermore, curvature estimation and
confidence evaluation are coherently derived from the inherent surface
properties of the on-the-fly HRBF implicits, which devote to a data fusion with
better quality. We argue that our continuous but on-the-fly surface
representation can effectively mitigate the impact of noise with its robustness
and constrain the reconstruction with inherent surface smoothness when being
compared with discrete representations. Experimental results on various
real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our HRBF-fusion outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of tracking robustness and
reconstruction accuracy.

with diameters larger than 10 micrometers. Here, we compare the reported event
rates to expected dust impact rates using dynamical meteoroid models for the
four most abundant meteoroid/dust populations in the inner solar system. We
find that the dust impact rates predicted by dynamical meteoroid models are not
compatible with either the Juno observations in terms of the number of star
tracker events per day, or with the variations of dust flux on Juno's solar
panels with time and position in the solar system. For example, the rate of
star tracker events on Juno's anti-sunward surfaces is the largest during a
period during which Juno is expected to experience the peak impact fluxes on
the opposite, sunward hemisphere. We also investigate the hypothesis of dust
leaving the Martian Hill sphere originating either from the surface of Mars
itself or from one of its moons. We do not find such a hypothetical source to
be able to reproduce the star tracker event rate variations observed by Juno.
We conclude that the star tracker events observed by Juno are unlikely to be
the result of instantaneous impacts from the Zodiacal Cloud.

correlated: they essentially concern data distribution shifts under adversarial

connections. In this paper, we explore the relationship between regularization
and domain transferability considering different factors such as norm
regularization and data augmentations (DA). We propose a general theoretical
framework proving that factors involving the model function class
regularization are sufficient conditions for relative domain transferability.
Our analysis implies that ``robustness"" is neither necessary nor sufficient for
transferability; rather, regularization is a more fundamental perspective for
understanding domain transferability. We then discuss popular DA protocols
(including adversarial training) and show when they can be viewed as the
function class regularization under certain conditions and therefore improve
generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to verify our theoretical
findings and show several counterexamples where robustness and generalization
are negatively correlated on different datasets.

anisotropic microgels have been hardly investigated. In this study, we compare
the interfacial deformation and assembly of anisotropic core-shell and hollow
microgels. The core-shell microgel consists of an elliptical core of hematite
covered with a thin silica layer and a thin shell made of PNiPAM. The hollow
microgels were obtained after a two step etching procedure of the inorganic
core. The behavior of these microgels at the oil-water interface was
investigated in a Langmuir Blodgett trough combined with ex-situ AFM. First,
the influence of the architecture of anisotropic microgels on their spreading
at the interface was investigated experimentally and by dissipative particle
dynamic simulations. Hereby, the importance of the local shell thickness on the
lateral and longitudinal interfacial deformation was highlighted as well as the
differences between the core-shell and hollow architectures. The shape of the
compression isotherms as well as the dimensions, ordering and orientation of
the microgels at the different compressions were analysed. Due to their
anisotropic shape and stiffness, both anisotropic microgels were found to
exhibit significant capillary interactions with a preferential side-to-side
assembly leading to stable microgel clusters at low interfacial coverage. Such
capillary interactions were found to decrease in the case of the more
deformable hollow anisotropic microgels. Consequently, anisotropic hollow
microgels were found to distribute more evenly at high surface pressure
compared to stiffer core-shell microgels. Our findings emphasize the complex
interplay between the colloid design, anisotropy and softness on the
interfacial assembly and the opportunities it thus offers to create more
complex ordered interfaces.

$\rho_0$ of the Beurling zeta function $\zeta_P$ for a given number system
generated by the primes $P$, the corresponding error term
$\Delta_P(x):=\psi_{P}(x)-x$, where $\psi_{P}(x)$ is the von Mangoldt summatory
function shows oscillation in any large enough interval, as large as
$(\pi/2-\varepsilon) x^{\Re \rho_0}/|\rho_0|$.
  The somewhat mysterious appearance of the constant $\pi/2$ is explained in
the study. Finally, we prove as the next main result of the paper the
following: given $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a Beurling number system with
primes $P$, such that $|\Delta_P(x)| \le (\pi/2+\varepsilon)x^{\Re
\rho_0}/|\rho_0|$.
  In this second part a nontrivial construction of a low norm sine polynomial
is coupled by the application of the wonderful recent prime random

theory, a variant called Random Reshuffling (RR) is more common in practice. RR
iterates through random permutations of the dataset and has been shown to
converge faster than SGD. When the order is chosen deterministically, a variant
called incremental gradient descent (IG), the existing convergence bounds show
improvement over SGD but are worse than RR. However, these bounds do not
differentiate between a good and a bad ordering and hold for the worst choice
of order. Meanwhile, in some cases, choosing the right order when using IG can
lead to convergence faster than RR. In this work, we quantify the effect of
order on convergence speed, obtaining convergence bounds based on the chosen
sequence of permutations while also recovering previous results for RR. In
addition, we show benefits of using structured shuffling when various levels of
abstractions (e.g. tasks, classes, augmentations, etc.) exists in the dataset
in theory and in practice. Finally, relying on our measure, we develop a greedy
algorithm for choosing good orders during training, achieving superior
performance (by more than 14 percent in accuracy) over RR.

predictions in many real-world settings. The predicted probability of possible
outcomes can inform high-stakes decision making, particularly when assessing
the expected value of alternative decisions or the risk of bad outcomes. These
decisions require well-calibrated probabilities, not just the correct
prediction of the most likely class. Black-box classifier calibration methods
can improve the reliability of a classifier's output without requiring
retraining. However, these methods are unable to detect subpopulations where
calibration could also improve prediction accuracy. Such subpopulations are
said to exhibit ""hidden heterogeneity"" (HH), because the original classifier
did not detect them. This paper proposes a quantitative measure for HH. It also
introduces two similarity-weighted calibration methods that can address HH by
adapting locally to each test item: SWC weights the calibration set by
similarity to the test item, and SWC-HH explicitly incorporates hidden
heterogeneity to filter the calibration set. Experiments show that the
improvements in calibration achieved by similarity-based calibration methods
correlate with the amount of HH present and, given sufficient calibration data,
generally exceed calibration achieved by global methods. HH can therefore serve
as a useful diagnostic tool for identifying when local calibration methods
would be beneficial.

transport map improves the trajectory of HMC by acting as a change of variable

and neck, nuclear medicine phantom and its characterization for the validation
of a Monte Carlo, SPECT image based, Iodine-131 RPT dosimetry workflow.
  Methods: 3D printing techniques were used to create the anthropomorphic
phantom from a patient CT dataset. Three Iodine-131 SPECT/CT imaging studies
were performed using a homogeneous, Jaszczak, and an anthropomorphic phantom to
quantify the SPECT images. The impact of collimator detector response (CDR)
modeling and volume-based partial volume corrections (PVC) upon the absorbed
dose was calculated using an image based, Geant4 Monte Carlo RPT dosimetry
workflow and compared against a ground truth scenario. Finally, uncertainties
were quantified in accordance with recent EANM guidelines.
  Results: The 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom was an accurate re-creation
of patient anatomy including bone. The extrapolated Jaszczak recovery
coefficients were greater than that of the 3D printed insert (~22.8 ml) for
both the CDR and non-CDR cases. Utilizing Jaszczak phantom PVCs, the absorbed
dose was underpredicted by 0.7% and 4.9% without and with CDR, respectively.
Utilizing anthropomorphic phantom RCs overpredicted the absorbed dose by 3%
both with and without CDR. All dosimetry scenarios that incorporated PVC were
within the calculated uncertainty of the activity. The uncertainties in the
cumulative activity ranged from 25.6% to 113% for Jaszczak spheres ranging in
volume from 0.5 ml to 16 ml.
  Conclusion: The accuracy of Monte Carlo-based dosimetry for Iodine-131 RPT in
head and neck cancer was validated with an anthropomorphic phantom. Future
applications of the phantom could involve 3D printing and characterizing
patient specific volumes for more personalized RPT dosimetry estimates.

uncertainty quantification for random quantities, like predicted treatment

the treatment is most interested in farm-level uncertainty quantification, for
example, the range of plausible treatment effects predicted at a new farm. The
two-stage linear mixed-effects model is often used to model this type of data.
However, standard techniques for linear mixed model-based prediction do not
produce calibrated uncertainty quantification. In general, the prediction
intervals used in practice are not valid -- they do not meet or exceed their
nominal coverage level over repeated sampling. We propose new methods for
constructing prediction intervals within the two-stage model framework based on
an inferential model (IM). The IM method generates prediction intervals that
are guaranteed valid for any sample size. Simulation experiments suggest
variations of the IM method that are both valid and efficient, a major
improvement over existing methods. We illustrate the use of the IM method using
two agricultural data sets, including an on-farm study where the IM-based
prediction intervals suggest a higher level of uncertainty in farm-specific

pair to obtain a Lie--Poisson dynamics for the shape dynamics. This
Lie--Poisson structure helps us find a family of Casimirs for the shape
dynamics. We further reduce the system by $\mathbb{T}^{N-1}$-symmetry to obtain
a Poisson structure for the shape dynamics involving fewer shape variables than
those of the previous work by Borisov and Pavlov. As an application of the
shape dynamics, we prove that the tetrahedron relative equilibria are stable
when all of their circulations have the same sign, generalizing some existing
results on tetrahedron relative equilibria of identical vortices.

sampling problems such as random circuit sampling and Gaussian boson sampling.
The obvious next step is to channel the potential quantum advantage to solving
practical applications rather than proof-of-principle experiments. Recently, a
quantum simulator, specifically a Gaussian boson sampler, has been proposed to
generate molecular vibronic spectra efficiently, which is an essential property
of molecules and an important tool for analyzing chemical components and
studying molecular structures. Computing molecular vibronic spectra has been a
challenging task, and its best-known classical algorithm scales combinatorially
in the system size. Thus, it is a candidate of tasks for which quantum devices
provide computational advantages. In this work, we propose a quantum-inspired
classical algorithm for molecular vibronic spectra for harmonic potential. We
first show that the molecular vibronic spectra problem corresponding to
Fock-state boson sampling can be efficiently solved using a classical algorithm
as accurately as running a boson sampler. In particular, we generalize
Gurvits's algorithm to approximate Fourier components of the spectra of
Fock-state boson sampling and prove using Parseval's relation that the error of
the spectra can be suppressed as long as that of the Fourier components are
small. We also show that the molecular vibronic spectra problems of Gaussian
boson sampling, which corresponds to the actual molecular vibronic spectra
problem in chemistry, can be exactly solved even without Gurvits-type
algorithms. Consequently, we demonstrate that those problems are not candidates
of quantum advantage. We then provide a more general molecular vibronic spectra
problem, which is also chemically well-motivated, for which we might be able to
take advantage of a boson sampler.

of imitation learning across a variety of tasks. Such approaches are expensive
both because they require large amounts of real world training demonstrations
and because identifying the best model to deploy in the real world requires
time-consuming real-world evaluations. These challenges can be mitigated by
simulation: by supplementing real world data with simulated demonstrations and
using simulated evaluations to identify high performing policies. However, this
introduces the well-known ""reality gap"" problem, where simulator inaccuracies
decorrelate performance in simulation from that of reality. In this paper, we
build on top of prior work in GAN-based domain adaptation and introduce the
notion of a Task Consistency Loss (TCL), a self-supervised loss that encourages
sim and real alignment both at the feature and action-prediction levels. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by teaching a mobile manipulator
to autonomously approach a door, turn the handle to open the door, and enter
the room. The policy performs control from RGB and depth images and generalizes
to doors not encountered in training data. We achieve 72% success across
sixteen seen and unseen scenes using only ~16.2 hours of teleoperated

work to tackle latched door opening from a purely end-to-end learning approach,

whether the flavor evolution is sufficiently described by a mean-field approach

in the neutrino Hamiltonian, as measured by nontrivial quantum entanglement.
Numerical computations of the time evolution of many-body quantum systems are
challenging because the size of the Hilbert space scales exponentially with the

Here we investigate the efficacy of tensor network methods to calculate the

use transformer-inspired architectures, which encode the history of events via
embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. These models deliver better
prediction and goodness-of-fit than their RNN-based counterparts. However, they
often require high computational and memory complexity requirements and
sometimes fail to adequately capture the triggering function of the underlying
process. So motivated, we introduce an efficient and general encoding of the
historical event sequence by replacing the complex (multilayered) attention
structures with triggering kernels of the observed data. Noting the similarity
between the triggering kernels of a point process and the attention scores, we
use a triggering kernel to replace the weights used to build history
representations. Our estimate for the triggering function is equipped with a
sigmoid gating mechanism that captures local-in-time triggering effects that
are otherwise challenging with standard decaying-over-time kernels. Further,
taking both event type representations and temporal embeddings as inputs, the
model learns the underlying triggering type-time kernel parameters given pairs
of event types. We present experiments on synthetic and real data sets widely
used by competing models, while further including a COVID-19 dataset to
illustrate a scenario where longitudinal covariates are available. Results show
the proposed model outperforms existing approaches while being more efficient
in terms of computational complexity and yielding interpretable results via
direct application of the newly introduced kernel.

domains such as health care, finance, and policy, it becomes vital to ensure
that domain experts function effectively alongside these models. Explainability
is one way to bridge the gap between human decision-makers and machine learning
models. However, most of the existing work on explainability focuses on
one-off, static explanations like feature importances or rule lists. These
sorts of explanations may not be sufficient for many use cases that require
dynamic, continuous discovery from stakeholders. In the literature, few works
ask decision-makers about the utility of existing explanations and other
desiderata they would like to see in an explanation going forward. In this
work, we address this gap and carry out a study where we interview doctors,
healthcare professionals, and policymakers about their needs and desires for
explanations. Our study indicates that decision-makers would strongly prefer
interactive explanations in the form of natural language dialogues. Domain
experts wish to treat machine learning models as ""another colleague"", i.e., one
who can be held accountable by asking why they made a particular decision
through expressive and accessible natural language interactions. Considering
these needs, we outline a set of five principles researchers should follow when
designing interactive explanations as a starting place for future work.
Further, we show why natural language dialogues satisfy these principles and
are a desirable way to build interactive explanations. Next, we provide a
design of a dialogue system for explainability and discuss the risks,
trade-offs, and research opportunities of building these systems. Overall, we
hope our work serves as a starting place for researchers and engineers to

Specifically, the benefit in MAC sum-rate, as a function of the cooperation
rate $C_{CF}$, sometimes has an infinite slope at $C_{CF}=0$. This work studies
the question of whether cooperation through a CF can yield similar
infinite-slope benefits when applied to internal network encoders in which
dependence among MAC transmitters can be established without the help of the
CF. Towards this end, this work studies the CF model when applied to relay
nodes of a single-source, single-terminal, diamond network consisting of a
broadcast channel followed by a MAC. In the relay channel with orthogonal
receiver components, careful generalization of the
partial-decode-forward/compress-forward lower bound to the CF model yields
sufficient conditions for an infinite-slope benefit. Additional results include
derivation of a family of diamond networks for which the infinite-slope
rate-benefit derives directly from the properties of the corresponding MAC
component when studied in isolation.

large item space, users have to gradually learn to estimate the utility of any
fresh recommendations from their experience about previously consumed items.
This in turn affects their interaction dynamics with the system and can
invalidate previous algorithms built on the omniscient user assumption. In this
paper, we formalize a model to capture such ""learning users"" and design an
efficient system-side learning solution, coined Noise-Robust Active Ellipsoid
Search (RAES), to confront the challenges brought by the non-stationary
feedback from such a learning user. Interestingly, we prove that the regret of
RAES deteriorates gracefully as the convergence rate of user learning becomes
worse, until reaching linear regret when the user's learning fails to converge.
Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the strength of RAES for such a
contemporaneous system-user learning problem. Our study provides a novel
perspective on modeling the feedback loop in recommendation problems.

enhances $\gamma$-ray emission around $0.7$ and $1.2$ MeV, but the only
directional alignment was observed for $E_\gamma \leq 0.7$ MeV and tended to be
parallel and antiparallel to neutrons emitted in the same event. The emission
of $\gamma$ rays at other energies was determined to be nearly isotropic. The
presence of the emission and alignment enhancements is explained by positive
correlations between neutron emission and quadrupole $\gamma$-ray emission
along rotational bands in the de-exciting fragments. This observation
corroborates the hypothesis of positive correlations between the angular
momentum of a fragment and its intrinsic excitation energy. The results of this
work are especially relevant in view of the recent theoretical and experimental
interest in the generation of angular momentum in fission. Specifically, we
have determined an alignment of the fragments angular momenta in a direction
perpendicular to the direction of motion. We interpret the lack of $n$-$\gamma$
angular correlations for fission fragments near closed shells as a weakening of
the alignment process for spherical nuclei. Lastly, we have observed that
statistical $\gamma$ rays are emitted isotropically, indicating that the
average angular momentum removed by this radiation is small. These results, and
the analysis tools presented in this work, represent a stepping stone for
future analysis of $n$-$\gamma$ emission correlations and their connection to
angular momentum properties.

when run on two related inputs. This notion, which plays a key role in areas
such as data privacy and optimization, has been the focus of several program
analysis techniques introduced in recent years. Among the most successful ones,
we can highlight type systems inspired by linear logic, as pioneered by Reed
and Pierce in the Fuzz programming language. In Fuzz, each type is equipped
with its own distance, and sensitivity analysis boils down to type checking. In
particular, Fuzz features two product types, corresponding to two different
notions of distance: the tensor product combines the distances of each
component by adding them, while the with product takes their maximum.
  In this work, we show that these products can be generalized to arbitrary
$L^p$ distances, metrics that are often used in privacy and optimization. The
original Fuzz products, tensor and with, correspond to the special cases $L^1$
and $L^\infty$. To ease the handling of such products, we extend the Fuzz type
system with bunches -- as in the logic of bunched implications -- where the
distances of different groups of variables can be combined using different
$L^p$ distances. We show that our extension can be used to reason about
quantitative properties of probabilistic programs.

a significant $>1$ mas coherent astrometric shift, little to no lens flux, and
has an inferred lens mass of 1.6 - 4.4 $M_\odot$. This makes OB110462 the first
definitive discovery of a compact object through astrometric microlensing and
it is most likely either a neutron star or a low-mass black hole. This compact
object lens is relatively nearby (0.70-1.92 kpc) and has a slow transverse
motion of $<$30 km/s. OB110462 shows significant tension between models
well-fit to photometry vs. astrometry, making it currently difficult to
distinguish between a neutron star and a black hole. Additional observations
and modeling with more complex system geometries, such as binary sources are
needed to resolve the puzzling nature of this object. For the remaining four
candidates, the lens masses are $<2 M_\odot$ and they are unlikely to be black
holes; two of the four are likely white dwarfs or neutron stars. We compare the

modelling densities on finite-dimensional spaces. Their ability to incorporate
domain-specific choices and constraints into the structure of the model through
composition make EBMs an appealing candidate for applications in physics,
biology and computer vision and various other fields. Recently, Energy-Based
Processes (EBP) for modelling stochastic processes was proposed for
\textit{unconditional} exchangeable data (e.g., point clouds). In this work, we
present a novel subclass of EBPs, called $\mathcal{F}$-EBM for
\textit{conditional} exchangeable data, which is able to learn distributions of
functions (such as curves or surfaces) from functional samples evaluated at
finitely many points. Two unique challenges arise in the functional context.
Firstly, training data is often not evaluated along a fixed set of points.
Secondly, steps must be taken to control the behaviour of the model between
evaluation points, to mitigate overfitting. The proposed model is an energy
based model on function space that is decomposed spectrally, where a Gaussian
Process path measure is used to reweight the distribution to capture smoothness
properties of the underlying process being modelled. The resulting model has
the ability to utilize irregularly sampled training data and can output
predictions at any resolution, providing an effective approach to up-scaling
functional data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach for
modelling a range of datasets, including data collected from Standard and
Poor's 500 (S\&P) and UK National grid.

accumulation and relaxation in neutron star interiors. Previous studies of
glitch rates have focused on individual pulsars with as many recorded glitches
as possible. In this work we analyze glitch rates using all available data
including objects that have glitched never or once. We assume the glitch rate
follows a homogeneous Poisson process, and therefore exclude pulsars which
exhibit quasiperiodic glitching behavior. Calculating relevant Bayes factors
shows that a model in which the glitch rate $\lambda$ scales as a power of the
characteristic age $\tau$ is preferred over models which depend arbitrarily on
powers of the spin frequency $\nu$ and/or its time derivative $\dot{\nu}$. For
$\lambda = A (\tau/\tau\vref)^{-\gamma}$, where $\tau_{\rm ref}=1\ {\rm yr}$ is
a reference time, the posterior distributions are unimodal with
$A=\ModelAAglitch\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$, and $\gamma=\ModelAgammaglitch$. Importantly,
the data exclude with 99\% confidence the possibility $\gamma=1$ canvassed in
the literature. When objects with zero recorded glitches are included, the
age-based rate law is still preferred and the posteriors change to give
$A=\ModelAAall\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$, and $\gamma=\ModelAgammaall$. The updated
estimates still support increased glitch activity for younger pulsars, while
demonstrating that the large number of objects with zero glitches contain
important statistical information about the rate, provided that they are part

approaches necessitate either an auxiliary reference source or an adequate
self-reference, neither of which is universally available. Regardless of the
reference, deciphering complex wavefronts of multiple co-propagating incoherent
fields remains particularly challenging. Here, we harness the principles of
quantum state tomography to circumvent these limitations. A full description of
an unknown beam is retrieved by measuring its temporally and spectrally
resolved density matrices for both polarisations, using a spatial light
modulator to display projective holograms and a single-mode fibre to guide the
collected signal to a high-speed photodiode and a spectrometer. Despite no
spatial resolution of the detector and the intensity-only character of the
collected signal, the method resolves multiple arbitrary spatial fields within
a single beam, including their phase and amplitude, as well as their spatial
coherence. Leveraging the coherence information unlocks unambiguous
determination of the spectral and temporal evolution of mutually incoherent
fields, even when these spectrally overlap or have an identical time delay. We
demonstrate these hallmark features by characterising the rich spatiotemporal

the sparsity of crashes, which makes it difficult to achieve a fine-grain

their relatively high prevalence and ease of detection with embedded vehicle

presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the
kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors. We train a Transformer-based
machine learning model for hard-braking event detection using concurrent sensor
readings from smartphones and vehicle sensors from drivers who connect their
phone to the vehicle while navigating in Google Maps. The detection model shows
superior performance with a $0.83$ Area under the Precision-Recall Curve

and $166.6\times$better than an accelerometer-based heuristic model. The
detected hard-braking events are strongly correlated with crashes from publicly
available datasets, supporting their use as a safety surrogate. In addition, we
conduct model fairness and selection bias evaluation to ensure that the safety

study 1) growth of finitely generated Lie algebras and groups and 2) the

sensitive to the components and symmetries of the engaged bands, which also
incorporates information of band topology. Therefore, we study the shift
current, one of the widely explored NLO responses in noncentrosymmetric

to the sign change of shift vectors around the momenta where the bandgap closes

inspiration from human communication focusing on the delivery of the meaning of
a message to the intended users. It has attracted significant interest recently
due to its potential to improve efficiency and reliability of communication,
enhance users' quality-of-experience (QoE), and achieve smoother
cross-protocol/domain communication. Most existing works in semantic
communication focus on identifying and transmitting explicit semantic meaning,
e.g., labels of objects, that can be directly identified from the source
signal. This paper investigates implicit semantic communication in which the
hidden information, e.g., implicit causality and reasoning mechanisms of users,
that cannot be directly observed from the source signal needs to be transported
and delivered to the intended users. We propose a novel implicit semantic
communication (iSC) architecture for representing, communicating, and
interpreting the implicit semantic meaning. In particular, we first propose a
graph-inspired structure to represent implicit meaning of message based on
three key components: entity, relation, and reasoning mechanism. We then
propose a generative adversarial imitation learning-based reasoning mechanism

reasoning process of the source user. We prove that, by applying GAML, the
destination user can accurately imitate the reasoning process of the users to
generate reasoning paths that follow the same probability distribution as the
expert paths. Numerical results suggest that our proposed architecture can
achieve accurate implicit meaning interpretation at the destination user.

by this, we propose a novel unified query framework that can be applied to any

queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings. The
queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting
the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce
the number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an

a fixed body centered tetragonal (BCT) lattice structure and fixed volume to
simultaneously predict the mixing enthalpy (a global feature of the system),
the atomic charge transfer, and the atomic magnetic moment across
configurations that span the entire compositional range. By taking advantage of
underlying physical correlations between material properties, multi-task
learning (MTL) with HydraGNN provides effective training even with modest
amounts of data. Moreover, this is achieved with just one architecture instead
of three, as required by single-task learning (STL). The first convolutional
layers of the HydraGNN architecture are shared by all learning tasks and
extract features common to all material properties. The following layers
discriminate the features of the different properties, the results of which are
fed to the separate heads of the final layer to produce predictions. Numerical
results show that HydraGNN effectively captures the relation between the
configurational entropy and the material properties over the entire

comparable to the accuracy of the STL predictions. In addition, the
computational cost of training HydraGNN for MTL is much lower than the original

the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two

computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio
can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a
BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC
curve is derived, and it is shown to converge to the true optimal ROC curve in
the \levy\ metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. A classical
empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities
from two separate sets of samples, is also considered. The maximum likelihood
estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more
accurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples
obtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum

computing evolutionary distances as an inherently combinatorial one. In
particular, attention was given to estimating distances using the minimum
number of events required to transform one genome into another. In hindsight,
this approach is analogous to early methods for inferring phylogenetic trees
from DNA sequences such as maximum parsimony -- both are motivated by the
principle that the true distance minimises evolutionary change, and both are
effective if this principle is a true reflection of reality. Recent literature
considers genome rearrangement under statistical models, continuing this
parallel with DNA-based methods; the goal here is to use model-based methods
(for example maximum likelihood techniques) to compute distance estimates that
incorporate the large number of rearrangement paths that can transform one
genome into another. Crucially, this approach requires one to decide upon a set
of feasible rearrangement events and, in this paper, we focus on characterising
well-motivated models for signed, uni-chromosomal circular genomes, where the
number of regions remains fixed. Since rearrangements are often mathematically
described using permutations, we isolate the sets of permutations representing
rearrangements that are biologically reasonable in this context, for example
inversions and translocations. We provide precise mathematical expressions for
these rearrangements, and then describe them in terms of the set of cuts made
in the genome when they are applied. We directly compare cuts to breakpoints,
and use this concept to count the distinct rearrangement actions which apply a
given number of cuts. Finally, we provide some examples of rearrangement
models, and include a discussion of some questions that arise when defining
plausible models.

characterization of the dealloying process and on the properties of the
dealloyed materials, leaving the theoretical study incomplete to fully
understand the fundamental mechanisms of LMD. In this paper, we use theoretical
models and phase-field simulations to clarify the kinetics and pattern
formation during LMD. Our study starts from a theoretical analysis of the 1D
dissolution of a binary precursor alloy, which reveals that the 1D dissolution
process involves two regimes. In the first regime, due to the low solubility of
one of the elements in the melt, it accumulates at the solid-liquid interface,
which reduces the dissolution kinetics. In the second regime, the interface
kinetics reaches a stationary regime where both elements of the precursor alloy
dissolve into the melt. Previous works revealed that in the early dealloying
stage, the dealloying front is destabilized by an interfacial spinodal
decomposition, which triggers the formation of interconnected ligaments. We
extend this line of work by proposing a linear stability analysis able to
predict the initial length-scale of the ligaments formed in the initial stage
of the dealloying. Combining this analysis with the 1D dissolution model
proposed here enables us to better understand the initial conditions
(composition of the precursor alloy and the melt) leading to a planar
dissolution without interface destabilization. Finally, we report a strong
influence of solid-state diffusion on dealloying that was overlooked in
previous studies. Although the solid-state diffusivity is four to five orders
of magnitude smaller than in the liquid phase, it is found to affect both
dissolution kinetics and ligament morphologies.

permittivity and decreases the differential capacitance. Next, for cases where

Projection-based Point Convolution (PPConv), a point convolutional module that

transforms point features into a 2D feature map and then apply 2D convolutions.
As PPConv does not use point-based or voxel-based convolutions, it has
advantages in fast point cloud processing. When combined with a learnable

data quality on the data scaling properties of Neural Machine Translation
(NMT). First, we establish that the test loss of encoder-decoder transformer
models scales as a power law in the number of training samples, with a
dependence on the model size. Then, we systematically vary aspects of the
training setup to understand how they impact the data scaling laws. In
particular, we change the following (1) Architecture and task setup: We compare
to a transformer-LSTM hybrid, and a decoder-only transformer with a language
modeling loss (2) Noise level in the training distribution: We experiment with
filtering, and adding iid synthetic noise. In all the above cases, we find that
the data scaling exponents are minimally impacted, suggesting that marginally
worse architectures or training data can be compensated for by adding more
data. Lastly, we find that using back-translated data instead of parallel data,
can significantly degrade the scaling exponent.

apriori becomes large. It is therefore important to identify bare, bias-free
semiconductor photocatalysts with small initial hydrogen production rates,
often in the range of tens of nano-mols per hour, as these can become highly

sensitive hydrogen detection system suitable for screening new photocatalysts.
The hydrogen evolution rate of the prototypical rutile TiO2 loaded with 0.3 %
wt Pt is detected to be 78.0+-0.8 {\mu}mol/h/0.04g, comparable with the rates
reported in the literature. In contrast, sensitivity to an ultralow evolution
rate of 11.4+-0.3 nmol/h/0.04g is demonstrated for bare polycrystalline TiO2
without electrical bias. Two candidate photocatalysts, ZnFe2O4 (18.1+-0.2

robot control policy remains challenging especially for real-time applications.
In this work, given a desired spatio-temporal specification expressed in the
Signal Temporal Logic (STL) language, we propose a semi-supervised controller
synthesis technique that is attuned to human-like behaviors while satisfying
desired STL specifications. Offline, we synthesize a trajectory-feedback neural
network controller via an adversarial training scheme that summarizes past
spatio-temporal behaviors when computing controls, and then online, we perform
gradient steps to improve specification satisfaction. Central to the offline
phase is an imitation-based regularization component that fosters better policy
exploration and helps induce naturalistic human behaviors. Our experiments
demonstrate that having imitation-based regularization leads to higher
qualitative and quantitative performance compared to optimizing an STL
objective only as done in prior work. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach with an illustrative case study and show that our proposed controller
outperforms a state-of-the-art shooting method in both performance and

segmentation. Generally, MAS methods register multiple atlases, i.e., medical
images with corresponding labels, to a target image; and the transformed atlas
labels can be combined to generate target segmentation via label fusion
schemes. Many conventional MAS methods employed the atlases from the same
modality as the target image. However, the number of atlases with the same
modality may be limited or even missing in many clinical applications. Besides,
conventional MAS methods suffer from the computational burden of registration
or label fusion procedures. In this work, we design a novel cross-modality MAS
framework, which uses available atlases from a certain modality to segment a
target image from another modality. To boost the computational efficiency of
the framework, both the image registration and label fusion are achieved by
well-designed deep neural networks. For the atlas-to-target image registration,
we propose a bi-directional registration network (BiRegNet), which can
efficiently align images from different modalities. For the label fusion, we
design a similarity estimation network (SimNet), which estimates the fusion
weight of each atlas by measuring its similarity to the target image. SimNet
can learn multi-scale information for similarity estimation to improve the
performance of label fusion. The proposed framework was evaluated by the left
ventricle and liver segmentation tasks on the MM-WHS and CHAOS datasets,

cross-modality MAS in both registration and label fusion.

potential BCI protocols, the resulting 'ToeplitzLDA' significantly increases
the binary classification performance compared to shrinkage regularized LDA (up
to 6 AUC points) and Riemannian classification approaches (up to 2 AUC points).
This translates to greatly improved application level performances, as
exemplified on data recorded during an unsupervised visual speller application,
where spelling errors could be reduced by 81% on average for 25 subjects. Aside
from lower memory and time complexity for LDA training, ToeplitzLDA proved to
be almost invariant even to a twenty-fold time dimensionality enlargement,
which reduces the need of expert knowledge regarding feature extraction.

this approach enables merging multiple datasets from different domains, each

segmentation dataset of over 2 Million images enables training a model that

learning models typically strongly depends on the amount and the quality of
data used for training. In manufacturing, the size of available datasets before
start of production is often limited. In contrast to data, expert knowledge
commonly is available in manufacturing. Therefore, this study introduces a
general methodology for building quality prediction models with machine
learning methods on small datasets by integrating shape expert knowledge, that
is, prior knowledge about the shape of the input-output relationship to be
learned. The proposed methodology is applied to a brushing process with $125$
data points for predicting the surface roughness as a function of five process
variables. As opposed to conventional machine learning methods for small
datasets, the proposed methodology produces prediction models that strictly
comply with all the expert knowledge specified by the involved process
specialists. In particular, the direct involvement of process experts in the
training of the models leads to a very clear interpretation and, by extension,
to a high acceptance of the models. Another merit of the proposed methodology
is that, in contrast to most conventional machine learning methods, it involves
no time-consuming and often heuristic hyperparameter tuning or model selection

readily change location dynamically to provide on-demand communications to

constant of the binary system is inferred: k2 = 0.00173+/-0.00052. For the
Cl\'es models to reproduce the k2-value of the primary star, a significant
enhanced mixing is required, notably through the turbulent mixing, but at the
cost that other stellar parameters cannot be reproduced simultaneously. The
difficulty to reproduce the k2-value simultaneously with the stellar parameters
as well as the incompatibility between the age estimates of the primary and
secondary stars are indications that some physics of the stellar interior are
still not completely understood.

formulation for modeling HTS coils in 2D with different coupling scenarios

superconducting tape. Then we consider a coil obtained by winding a cable
composed of different HTS tapes. In the latter case, the tape turns are either
electrically connected along their entire length or just at the two ends of the
coil: in the model, these two different types of electrical connection are
implemented with the help of the electrical circuit module. The current density

with noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a large number of existing

matrix without ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When
label noise transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the
instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more
challenging. Despite recent works proposing solutions for learning from
instance-dependent noisy labels, the field lacks a unified understanding of
when such a problem remains identifiable. The goal of this paper is to
characterize the identifiability of the label noise transition matrix. Building
on Kruskal's identifiability results, we are able to show the necessity of
multiple noisy labels in identifying the noise transition matrix for the
generic case at the instance level. We further instantiate the results to
explain the successes of the state-of-the-art solutions and how additional
assumptions alleviated the requirement of multiple noisy labels. Our result
also reveals that disentangled features are helpful in the above identification

retaining the relative positions of the image patches. This imposes an
inductive bias towards natural images which enables the image-to-image

achieve the same denoising performance than the U-Net and its parameters scale
linearly in the image resolution instead of quadratically as for the original

outperforms the vision transformer tailored for image reconstruction and

formation and storage of Cholesky vector derivatives. The new implementation is
shown to perform well, with less than 10% of the time spent calculating the

lower values, both varying with the doping conditions of the host. We find that
the substitution of sulfur with boron can activate the intrinsic NRR activity
of some TMs such as Ti and V which are otherwise inactive above pristine MoS2.
Importantly, among the various de-scriptors used in ML, the charged state of

N2 via the back-donation mechanism. Our work shows a feasible strategy for
rational design of NRR SACs and retrieval of the decisive feature of active

Aperiodic atomic clusters; v) Stabilization of 2D lattices by aromatic

coordinates. As a result, constrained TI subspace structural minimization may
artificially return a regular point at the potential energy surface as either a

to understand how controlled drug release can be achieved by tuning the initial
distribution of drug molecules in a hydrogel. A mathematical model is presented
for a spherical drug-loaded hydrogel. The model captures the nonlinear
elasticity of the polymer network and thermodynamics of swelling. By assuming
that the drug molecules are dilute, the equations for hydrogel swelling and
drug transport partially decouple. A fast optimisation method is developed to
accurately compute the optimal initial drug concentration by minimising the
error between the numerical drug-release profile and a target profile. By
taking the target drug efflux to be piecewise constant, the optimal initial
configuration consists of a central drug-loaded core with isolated drug packets
near the free boundary of the hydrogel. The optimal initial drug concentration
is highly effective at mitigating the burst effect, where a large amount of
drug is rapidly released into the environment. The hydrogel stiffness can be
used to further tune the rate of drug release. Although stiffer gels lead to
less swelling and hence reduce the drug diffusivity, the drug-release kinetics
are faster than for soft gels due to the decreased distance that drug molecules
must travel to reach the free surface.

calculated with the particle distance to the instantaneous interfacial line.
Our results provide a new insight in the origin of the MIPS from the local
rectification of the random active force on the particles near the interface.
As it had been pointed, that effect acts as an external potential [3] that
produces a pressure gradient across the interface, so that the mechanical
surface tension of the MIPS cannot be described as that of equilibrium
coexisting phases; but our analysis shows that most of that effect comes from
the tightly caged particles at the dense (inner) side of the MIPS interface,
rather than from the free moving particles at the outer side that collide with
the dense cluster. Moreover, a clear correlation appears between the decay of
the hexatic order parameter at the dense slab and the end of the MIPS as the
strength of the active force is lowered. We test that with the strong active
forces required for MIPS, the interfacial structure and properties are very
similar for ABP with purely repulsive (WCA-LJ model truncated at its minimum)
and when the interaction includes a range of the LJ attractive force.

wireless communications via RSs are exclusively based on traditional coherent

used for data communication. In this paper, we consider the uplink between a
single-antenna user and a multi-antenna BS and present a novel RS-empowered
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system based on
the differential phase shift keying, which is suitable for high noise and/or

basically believed to harbour oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. Recently, Gaia data
reveals an enhancement of UMWDs on Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), which
indicates that extra cooling delay mechanism such as crystallization and
elemental sedimentation may exist in the UMWDs. Further studies suggested that
a portion of UMWDs should have experienced pretty long cooling delays, implying
that they are carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs. However, the formation mechanism of these
UMCOWDs is still under debate. In this work, we investigated whether the merges
of massive CO WDs with helium WDs (He WDs) can evolve to UMCOWDs. By employing
stellar evolution code MESA, we construct double WD merger remnants to
investigate their final fates. We found that the post-merger evolution of the
remnants are similar to R CrB stars. The helium burning of the He shell leads
to the mass growing of the CO core at a rate from 2.0*10^-6 to 5.0*10^-6
Msun/yr . The final CO WD mass is influenced by the wind-mass-loss rate during
the post-merger evolution, and cannot exceed about 1.2Msun. The remnants with
core mass larger than 1.2Msun will experience surface carbon ignition, which
may finally end their lives as ONe WDs. Current results implies that at least a
portion of UMWDs which experience extra long cooling delay may stem from
merging of CO WDs and He WDs.

Jupiters result in significantly asymmetric atmospheres, with a large expansion
occurring over a small range of longitude around the terminator. Over the
course of a transit, WASP-76b rotates by about 30 degree, changing the
observable part of the atmosphere and invoking variations in the appearance of
its constituents. As recently reported, this results in time-variable effects
in the neutral iron signal, which are amplified by its possible condensation on
the nightside. Here, we study the presence of molecular signals during a
transit of WASP-76b observed with the CARMENES spectrograph and compare the
contributions from this planet's morning and evening terminators. The results
are somewhat puzzling, with formal detections of water vapor (5.5$\sigma$) and
hydrogen cyanide (5.2$\sigma$) but at significantly different positions in the
K$_p$-V$_{sys}$ diagram, with a blueshift of -14.3 $\pm$ 2.6 km/s and a
redshift of $+$20.8 $^{+7.8}_{-3.9}$ km/s respectively, and a higher K$_p$ than
expected. The H$_2$O signal also appears stronger later on in the transit, in
contrast to that of HCN, which seems stronger early on. We tentatively explain
this by silicate clouds forming and raining out on the nightside, partially
removing oxygen from the upper atmosphere. For C/O values between 0.7 and 1,
this leads to the formation of HCN at the morning limb. At the evening
terminator, with the sequestered oxygen being returned to the gas phase due to
evaporation, these C/O values lead to formation of H$_2$O instead of HCN. If
confirmed, these results indicate that individual molecules trace different
parts of the atmosphere, as well as nightside condensation, allowing spatial
characterization. As these results are based on a single transit, we advocate
that more data are needed to confirm them and further explore these scenarios.

performance overheads incompatible with mobile devices.
  We posit that resilience to traffic analysis must be directly supported by
major IM services themselves, and must be done in a low-cost manner without
breaking existing features. As a first step in this direction, we propose a
hybrid messaging model that combines regular and deniable messages. We present
a novel protocol for deniable instant messaging, which we call DenIM. DenIM is
built on the principle that deniable messages can be made indistinguishable
from regular messages with a little help from a user's friends. Deniable
messages' network traffic can then be explained by a plausible cover story.
DenIM achieves overhead proportional to the messages sent, as opposed to
scaling with time or number of users. To show the effectiveness of DenIM, we
implement a trace simulator, and show that DenIM's deniability guarantees hold
against strong adversaries such as internet service providers.

cooling in which the basic ingredients for predicting their evolution are well
identified, although not always well understood. There are two independent ways
to test the cooling rate. One is the luminosity function of the white dwarf
population, and another is the secular drift of the period of pulsation of
those individuals that experience variations. Both scenarios are sensitive to
the cooling or heating time scales, for which reason, the inclusion of any
additional source or sink of energy will modify these properties and will allow
to set bounds to these perturbations. These studies also require complete and
statistical significant samples for which current large data surveys are

detailed analysis of the light curves and modeling. Our photometry is primarily
taken by the ZTF in the $g,r,i$ bands, and with additional data from other

range of $z = 0.06 - 0.67$, with a median and $1\sigma$ error (16\% and 84\%

covers $-22.8\,{\rm mag} \leq M_{g,\rm peak} \leq -19.8$\,mag, with a median
value of $-21.48^{+1.13}_{-0.61}$\,mag. Their light curves evolve slowly with
the mean rest-frame rise time of $t_{\rm rise} = 41.9\pm17.8$\,days. The
luminosity and time scale distributions suggest that low luminosity SLSNe-I
with peak luminosity $\sim -20$\,mag or extremely fast rising events
($<10$\,days) exist but are rare. We confirm previous findings that slowly
rising SLSNe-I also tend to fade slowly. The rest-frame color and temperature
evolution show large scatters, suggesting that the SLSN-I population may have
diverse spectral energy distributions. The peak rest-frame color shows a
moderate correlation with the peak absolute magnitude, i.e. brighter SLSNe-I
tend to have bluer colors. With optical and ultraviolet photometry, we
construct bolometric luminosity and derive a bolometric correction relation
generally applicable for converting $g,r$-band photometry to bolometric
luminosity for SLSNe-I.

unambiguously constrain the physical power sources for a SLSN-I. However, 23\%
of the sample show inverted V-shape, steep declining LCs or features of long
rise and fast post-peak decay, which are better described by the CSM+Ni model.
The remaining 10\% of the sample favor the magnetar model. Moreover, our
analysis shows that the LC undulations are quite common, with a fraction of
$18-44\% $ in our gold sample. Among those strongly undulating events, about
62\% of them are found to be CSM-favored, implying that the undulations tend to
occur in the CSM-favored events. Undulations show a wide range in energy and
duration, with median values (and 1$\sigma$ errors) being as
$1.7\%^{+1.5\%}_{-0.7\%}\,\rm E_{\rm rad,total}$ and
$28.8^{+14.4}_{-9.1}$\,days, respectively. Our analysis of the undulation time
scales suggests that intrinsic temporal variations of the central engine can
explain half of the undulating events, while CSM interaction can account for
the majority of the sample. Finally, all of the well-observed He-rich SLSNe-Ib
have either strongly undulating LCs or the LCs are much better fit by the
CSM+Ni model. These observations imply that their progenitor stars have not had
enough time to lose all of the He-envelopes before supernova explosions, and
H-poor CSM are likely to present in these events.

polarization of the gauge field is amplified inducing large curvature
perturbation power spectrum. Taking into account the stochastic kicks arising
from the short modes at the time of horizon crossing we obtain the
corresponding Langevin equations for the long modes of the electromagnetic and
axion fields. It is shown that a mean-reverting process governs the dynamics of
the electromagnetic fields such that the tachyonic growth of the gauge fields
is balanced by the diffusion forces. As the instability parameter grows towards
the end of inflation, the large curvature perturbations induced from gauge
field perturbations lead to copious production of small mass primordial black
holes (PBHs). It is shown that the produced PBHs follow a Gaussian statistics.
Imposing the observational constraints on PBHs formation relaxes the previous
bounds on the instability parameter by about fifty percents.

were introduced by Carrillo and Pares in 2019. These methods, based on a
strategy that allows one to extend high-order Lax-Wendroff methods to nonlinear
systems without using the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure, have arbitrary even
order of accuracy 2p and use (2p + 1)-point stencils, where p is an arbitrary
positive integer. More recently in 2021 Carrillo, Macca, Pares, Russo and Zorio
introduced a strategy to get rid of the spurious oscillations close to
discontinuities produced by CAT methods. This strategy led to the so-called
Adaptive CAT (ACAT) methods, in which the order of accuracy, and thus the width
of the stencils, is adapted to the local smoothness of the solution. The goal
of this paper is to extend CAT and ACAT methods to systems of balance laws. To
do this, the source term is written as the derivative of its indefinite
integral that is formally treated as a flux function. The well-balanced
property of the methods is discussed and a variant that allows in principle to
preserve any stationary solution is presented. The resulting methods are then
applied to a number of systems going from a linear scalar conservation law to
the 2D Euler equations with gravity, passing by the Burgers equations with
source term and the 1D shallow water equations: the order and well-balanced

remove the assumptions of bounds on message delivery times, making them more
resilient to adverse network conditions. However, these protocols still fall
short of being practical across a broad range of scenarios due to their cubic
communication costs, use of expensive primitives, and overall protocol
complexity. In this paper, we present Alea-BFT, the first asynchronous BFT
protocol to achieve quadratic communication complexity, allowing it to scale to
large networks. Alea-BFT brings the key design insight from classical protocols
of concentrating part of the work on a single designated replica, and
incorporates this principle in a two stage pipelined design, with an efficient
broadcast led by the designated replica followed by an inexpensive binary

relativistic weakly magnetized shocks loaded with electron-positron pairs.
Various external magnetizations $\sigma\lesssim 10^{-4}$ and pair-loading
factors $Z_\pm \lesssim 10$ are studied, where $Z_\pm$ is the number of loaded
electrons and positrons per ion. We find the following. (1) The shock becomes
mediated by the ion Larmor gyration in the mean field when $\sigma$ exceeds a
critical value $\sigma_{\rm L}$ that decreases with $Z_\pm$. At
$\sigma\lesssim\sigma_{\rm L}$ the shock is mediated by particle scattering in
the self-generated microturbulent fields, the strength and scale of which
decrease with $Z_\pm$, leading to lower $\sigma_{\rm L}$. (2) The energy
fraction carried by the post-shock pairs is robustly in the range between 20%
and 50% of the upstream ion energy. The mean energy per post-shock electron
scales as $\overline{E}_{\rm e}\propto (Z_\pm+1)^{-1}$. (3) Pair loading
suppresses nonthermal ion acceleration at magnetizations as low as
$\sigma\approx 5\times 10^{-6}$. The ions then become essentially thermal with
mean energy $\overline{E}_{\rm i}$, while electrons form a nonthermal tail,
extending from $E\sim (Z_\pm + 1)^{-1}\overline{E}_{\rm i}$ to
$\overline{E}_{\rm i}$. When $\sigma = 0$, particle acceleration is enhanced by
the formation of intense magnetic cavities that populate the precursor during
the late stages of shock evolution. Here, the maximum energy of the nonthermal
ions and electrons keeps growing over the duration of the simulation. Alongside
the simulations, we develop theoretical estimates consistent with the numerical
results. Our findings have important implications for models of early gamma-ray
burst afterglows.

geographical contextual signals and intra-region information; (2) Most previous
works failed to develop an effective yet integrated fusion module which can
deeply fuse multi-graph correlations; (3) State-of-the-art methods do not
perform well in regions with high variance socioeconomic attributes. To address
these challenges, we propose a multi-graph representative learning framework,
called Region2Vec, for urban region profiling. Specifically, except that human
mobility is encoded for inter-region relations, geographic neighborhood is
introduced for capturing geographical contextual information while POI side
information is adopted for representing intra-region information by knowledge
graph. Then, graphs are used to capture accessibility, vicinity, and
functionality correlations among regions. To consider the discriminative
properties of multiple graphs, an encoder-decoder multi-graph fusion module is
further proposed to jointly learn comprehensive representations. Experiments on

better performance than previous studies in regions with high variance

interest. However, there is a potentially impactful issue within NAS that
remains largely unrecognized: noise. Due to stochastic factors in neural

split, the performance evaluation of a neural network architecture, which is
often based on a single learning run, is also stochastic. This may have a
particularly large impact if a dataset is small. We therefore propose to reduce
this noise by evaluating architectures based on average performance over
multiple network training runs using different random seeds and
cross-validation. We perform experiments for a combinatorial optimization
formulation of NAS in which we vary noise reduction levels. We use the same
computational budget for each noise level in terms of network training runs,
i.e., we allow less architecture evaluations when averaging over more training
runs. Multiple search algorithms are considered, including evolutionary
algorithms which generally perform well for NAS. We use two publicly available
datasets from the medical image segmentation domain where datasets are often
limited and variability among samples is often high. Our results show that
reducing noise in architecture evaluations enables finding better architectures

been previously analyzed under strong assumptions. Concretely, $\textbf{(i)}$
all previous works assume that the covariance matrix of the features is
positive definite; and $\textbf{(ii)}$ most of them assume that the features
are centered (i.e. zero mean). Additionally, all previous works make additional
restrictive assumption, e.g., assuming that the features are Gaussian or that
the corruptions are symmetrically distributed.
  In this work we go beyond these assumptions and investigate robust regression
under a more general set of assumptions: $\textbf{(i)}$ we allow the covariance
matrix to be either positive definite or positive semi definite,
$\textbf{(ii)}$ we do not necessarily assume that the features are centered,
$\textbf{(iii)}$ we make no further assumption beyond boundedness
(sub-Gaussianity) of features and measurement noise.
  Under these assumption we analyze a natural SGD variant for this problem and
show that it enjoys a fast convergence rate when the covariance matrix is
positive definite. In the positive semi definite case we show that there are
two regimes: if the features are centered we can obtain a standard convergence
rate; otherwise the adversary can cause any learner to fail arbitrarily.

allows more people to read and hence cite articles they otherwise would not.
However, causation is difficult to establish and there are many possible bias.
Several factors can affect the observed differences in citation rates. Funder
mandates can be one of them. Funders are likely to have OA requirement, and
well-funded studies are more likely to receive more citations than poorly
funded studies. In this paper this hypothesis is tested. Thus, we studied the
effect of funding on the publication modality and the citations received in
more than 128 thousand research articles, of which 31% were funded. These
research articles come from 40 randomly selected subject categories in the year
2016, and the citations received from the period 2016-2020 in the Scopus
database. We found open articles published in hybrid journals were considerably
more cited than those in open access journals. Thus, articles under the hybrid
gold modality are cite on average twice as those in the gold modality. This is
the case regardless of funding, so this evidence is strong. Moreover, within
the same publication modality, we found that funded articles generally obtain
50% more citations than unfunded ones. The most cited modality is the hybrid
gold and the least cited is the gold, well below even the paywalled.
Furthermore, the use of open access repositories considerably increases the
citations received, especially for those articles without funding. Thus, the
articles in open access repositories (green) are 50% more cited than the
paywalled ones. This evidence is remarkable and does not depend on funding.
Excluding the gold modality, there is a citation advantage in more than 75% of
the cases and it is considerably greater among unfunded articles. This result
is strong both across fields and over time.

and bias when estimating treatment effects. This makes treatment effect
estimation from data with missingness a particularly tricky endeavour. A key
reason for this is that standard assumptions on missingness are rendered
insufficient due to the presence of an additional variable, treatment, besides
the input (e.g. an individual) and the label (e.g. an outcome). The treatment
variable introduces additional complexity with respect to why some variables
are missing that is not fully explored by previous work. In our work we
introduce mixed confounded missingness (MCM), a new missingness mechanism where
some missingness determines treatment selection and other missingness is
determined by treatment selection. Given MCM, we show that naively imputing all
data leads to poor performing treatment effects models, as the act of
imputation effectively removes information necessary to provide unbiased
estimates. However, no imputation at all also leads to biased estimates, as
missingness determined by treatment introduces bias in covariates. Our solution
is selective imputation, where we use insights from MCM to inform precisely
which variables should be imputed and which should not. We empirically
demonstrate how various learners benefit from selective imputation compared to
other solutions for missing data. We highlight that our experiments encompass
both average treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects.

supervised contrastive pre-training in combination with source-aware sampling
significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance on several widely used

mass function (IMF), are poorly constrained by observations and have yet to
converge between simulations. The cosmological 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen
is predicted to be sensitive to Lyman-band photons produced by these stars,
thus providing a unique way to probe the first stellar population. In this
paper, we investigate the impacts of the Pop III IMF on the cosmic dawn 21-cm
signal via the Wouthuysen-Field effect, Lyman-Werner feedback, Ly-alpha
heating, and CMB heating. We calculate the emission spectra of star-forming
halos for different IMFs by integrating over individual metal-free stellar
spectra, computed from a set of stellar evolution histories and stellar
atmospheres, and taking into account variability of the spectra with stellar
age. Through this study, we therefore relax two common assumptions: that the
zero-age main sequence emission rate of a Pop III star is representative of its
lifetime mean emission rate, and that Pop III emission can be treated as
instantaneous. Exploring a bottom-heavy, a top-heavy, and intermediate IMFs, we
show that variations in the 21-cm signal are driven by stars lighter than 20
solar masses. For the explored models we find maximum relative differences of
59% in the cosmic dawn global 21-cm signal, and 131% between power spectra.
Although this impact is modest, precise modelling of the first stars and their
evolution is necessary for accurate prediction and interpretation of the 21-cm
signal.

work the effects on the primary beams due to modeling simplifications,
bandwidth averaging, gravitational loading and ambient temperature are
quantified within the half power region of the beam. A perspective is provided
on the level of significance of typical use case effects. It is shown that
antenna pointing is a leading cause of inaccuracy for telescope users in the
presumed beam shape, introducing errors exceeding 1% in power near the half
power point of beams, owing to a telescope pointing accuracy of $\sigma\approx
0.6$ arcminutes. Disregarding these pointing errors, variability in the Stokes
I beam shape relative to the array average is most commonly around 0.3% in
power; however, the impact above 1500 MHz is on average triple that of the
lower half of the band. This happens because the proportion of higher order
waveguide modes that are activated and propagate is sensitive to small
manufacturing differences in the orthomode transducer for each receiver.

up around 600 hours of telescope time. Results. We present the first
single-dish molecular survey of mm-wave lines in nebulae around binary post-AGB

around binary post-AGB stars, as their molecular lines and abundances are
especially weaker compared with AGB stars. This fact is very significant in
those sources where the Keplerian disk is the dominant component of the nebula.
The study of their chemistry allows us to classify nebulae around AC Her, the
Red Rectangle, AI CMi, R Sct, and IRAS 20056+1834 as O-rich, while that of 89
Her is probably C-rich. The calculated abundances of the detected species other
than CO are particularly low compared with AGB stars. The initial stellar mass
derived from the 17O/18O ratio for the Red Rectangle and 89 Her is compatible
with the central total stellar mass derived from previous mm-wave

curvature $-\kappa^2$ are flexible enough to approximate an arbitrary solution
of the Helmholtz equation $\Delta h+h=0$ on $\mathbf{R}^d$, over the natural
length scale $O(\lambda^{-1/2})$ determined by the eigenvalue $\lambda \gg 1$.
This problem is motivated by the fact that, by the asymptotics of the local
Weyl law, approximate Laplace eigenfunctions do have this approximation
property on any compact Riemannian manifold. In this paper we are specifically
interested in the Coulomb and harmonic oscillator operators on the hyperbolic
spaces $\mathbf{H}^d(\kappa)$. As the dimension of the space of bound states of
these operators tends to infinity as $\kappa$ tends to 0, one can hope to
approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation by eigenfunctions for some
$\kappa > 0$ that is not fixed a priori. Our main result shows that this is
indeed the case, under suitable hypotheses. We also prove a global
approximation theorem with decay for the Helmholtz equation on manifolds that
are isometric to the hyperbolic space outside a compact set, and consider an
application to the study of the heat equation on $\mathbf{H}^d(\kappa)$.
Although global approximation and inverse approximation results are
heuristically related in that both theorems explore flexibility properties of
solutions to elliptic equations on hyperbolic spaces, we will see that the
underlying ideas behind these theorems are very different.

the fate of such flat bands when part of the surface is subjected to an
exchange field induced by a ferromagnetic insulator. We use exact
diagonalization to find the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes Hamiltonian of a model system, for which an exchange field is applied
along a strip on the surface of a slab. We consider different orientations of
the strip and the applied field. If the spin polarization of the field-free
system along the field direction is sufficiently large perturbation theory
predicts that energies of states which are mostly localized on the
exchange-field strip are shifted away from zero energy by an amount
proportional to the field strength. On the other hand, energies corresponding
to states localized on the field-free strip are only weakly affected by the
field. Exact diagonalization confirms this. Moreover, we discuss a setup with a
small exchange field applied to the previously field-free strip with the goal
of introducing a linear dispersion. By switching this dispersion on and off, a
wave packet could be moved in a certain direction. We find that in our model
system, a linear dispersion can indeed be achieved. The qualitative features of
this dispersion can be predicted from the momentum-dependent spin polarization

antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice in magnetic field $\bf H$. We use the
recently proposed bond-operator theory which operates with quantum states of
the whole magnetic unit cell containing three spins. This technique describes
accurately short-range spin correlations and provides a quantitative
description of elementary excitations which appear in other approaches as bound
states of conventional low-energy quasiparticles (e.g., magnons). In
quantitative agreement with previous numerical and analytical findings, we
observe four phases with coplanar spin arrangements upon the field increasing:
the three-sublattice Y-phase, the collinear ""up-up-down"" (UUD) state, the
non-collinear V-phase, and the collinear fully polarized (FP) state. We
demonstrate that apart from magnons there are spin-0 elementary excitations in
the UUD state one of which is long lived and its spectrum lies below magnon
branches. This mode originates from a high-energy quasiparticle at $H=0$ and it
produces anomalies only in the longitudinal spin correlator. In the V-phase, we
obtain multiple short-wavelength spin excitations which have no counterparts in
the semiclassical spin-wave theory. We demonstrate a highly nontrivial field
evolution of quasiparticles spectra on the way from one collinear state (UUD)
to another one (FP) via the non-collinear V-phase (in which the longitudinal
and the transverse channels are mixed). In particular, some parts of the spin-0
branch in the UUD state become parts of the spin-1 (magnon) branch in the FP
phase whereas some parts of one magnon branch turn into parts of spin-2 branch.
Such evolution would be very difficult to find by any conventional analytical
approach. Our results are in good agreement with neutron experimental data
obtained recently in $\rm Ba_3CoSb_2O_9$, $\rm KYbSe_2$, and $\rm CsYbSe_2$.

demonstrate that a superconducting tunnel junction can develop a very large

$\pm300\; \mu$V/K is roughly $10^5$ times larger than the one expected for a

droplet formation in two-phase flow through cross-flow microfluidic device. The
two-dimensional mathematical model equations have been solved using the finite
element method under the squeezing regime ($Ca_c < 10^{-2}$) for wide range of
flow rates ($Qr = 0.1 - 10$) and fixed contact angle ($\theta=135^o$). The
droplet formation process has been classified into various instantaneous stages
as initial, filling, squeezing, pinch-off and stable droplet through
microscopic visualization of interface evolution in phase profiles. The
dynamics of interface, and point pressure in both phases is further gained and
discussed. Maximum pressure in the continuous phase varied linearly with Qr.
The droplet pinch-off mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated by determining
the local radius of the curvature ($R_{c,min}$) and neck width (2r) during the
squeezing and pinch-off stages. At the pinch-off point, both $R_{c,min}$ and 2r
are non-linearly related to Qr. Further, the topological dynamics of interface
has been explored by analyzing the Laplace pressure ($p_{\text{L}}$), acting on
the interface curvature, evaluated using (a) pressure sensors in both phases,
(b) local radius of curvature, and (c) minimum radius of curvature. The
insights obtained from the present work can reliably be used in designing the
model and prototypes of microfluidic devices for generating monodispersed
droplets in emulsions, and the droplet breakup mechanism would help accurate
prediction of the pinch-off moment. The proposed knowledge provides detailed
insights of the interface evolution and droplet pinch-off to a precision of 10
$\mu$s and resolution of 10 $\mu$m, equivalent to experimental flow
visualization with a high-speed ($10^{5}$ fps) and high-resolution (10 $\mu$m

subhalo population, as interactions with subhalos could produce substructure in
streams. However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well
understood. Here we studied the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the
stellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia
EDR3 astrometry, we characterized the morphology of Jhelum. We combined this
new data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit
integrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials. We also carried out
N-body simulations in the presence of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The new
data reveal a previously unreported tertiary component in the stream, as well
as several gaps and a kink-like feature in its narrow component. We find that
for a range of realistic Galactic potentials, no single orbit is able to
reproduce Jhelum's radial velocity data entirely. A generic property of the
orbital solutions is that they share a similar orbital plane to Sagittarius and
this leads to repeated encounters with the stream. Using N-body simulations
that include a massive Sagittarius, we explored its effect on Jhelum, and we
show that these encounters can qualitatively reproduce the narrow and broad
components in Jhelum, as well as create a tertiary component in some cases. We
also find evidence that such encounters can result in an apparent increase in
the velocity dispersion of the stream by a factor up to four due to overlapping
narrow and broad components. Our findings suggest that the Jhelum stream is
even more complex than once thought; however, its morphology and kinematics can
tentatively be explained via the interactions with Sagittarius. In this
scenario, the formation of Jhelum's narrow and broad components occurs
naturally, yet some of the smaller gap-like features remain to be explained.

representative features from each point via deep-learning-based algorithms. On
the other hand, the correspondence calculation between the extracted features
has not been examined in depth, and non-trainable algorithms (e.g. the Sinkhorn
algorithm) are frequently applied. As a result, the extracted features may be
forcibly fitted to a non-trainable algorithm. Furthermore, the extracted
features frequently contain stochastically unavoidable errors, which degrades
the matching accuracy. In this paper, instead of using a non-trainable
algorithm, we propose a differentiable matching network that can be jointly
optimized with the feature extraction procedure. Our network first constructs
graphs with edges connecting the points of each point cloud and then extracts
discriminative edge features by using two main components: a shared set-encoder
and an edge-selective cross-concatenation. These components enable us to
symmetrically consider two point clouds and to extract discriminative edge
features, respectively. By using the extracted discriminative edge features,
our network can accurately calculate the correspondence between points. Our

cold core catalogue that represent a diversity in terms of their environment to
explore their chemical complexity: 1390 (in the compressed shell of Lambda
Ori), 869 (in the MBM12 cloud), and 4149 (in the California nebula). We
obtained a spectral survey with the IRAM 30 m telescope in order to explore the
molecular complexity of the cores. We carried out a radiative transfer analysis
of the detected transitions in order to place some constraints on the physical
conditions of the cores and on the molecular column densities. We also used the
molecular ions in the survey to estimate the cosmic-ray ionisation rate and the
S/H initial elemental abundance using a gas-phase chemical model to reproduce
their abundances. We found large differences in the molecular complexity
(deuteration, complex organic molecules, sulphur, carbon chains, and ions) and
compared their chemical properties with a cold core and two prestellar cores.
The chemical diversity we found in the three cores seems to be correlated with
their chemical evolution: two of them are prestellar (1390 and 4149), and one
is in an earlier stage (869). The influence of the environment is likely
limited because cold cores are strongly shielded from their surroundings. The
high extinction prevents interstellar UV radiation from penetrating deeply into
the cores. Higher spatial resolution observations of the cores are therefore
needed to constrain the physical structure of the cores, as well as a
larger-scale distribution of molecular ions to understand the influence of the
environment on their molecular complexity.

thoroughly investigated via moment recurrence techniques in quantum statistical
mechanics. On that basis, we carry out numerical analyses for Ag, Cu, and Ni
with the Sutton-Chen many-body potential. Our results reveal that the
well-known Arrhenius law is insufficient to describe the proliferation of
vacancies. Specifically, anharmonic effects lead to a strong nonlinearity in
the Gibbs energy of vacancy formation. Our physical picture is well supported
by previous simulations and experiments.

While on spherical droplets $2n$ topological defects necessarily exist and can

analytically and with a lattice-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, we

alternatingly isotropic and ordered interfacial material. Furthermore
cylindrical systems can be divided into Type I, without defects, and Type II,

However, this model holds only for narrowband communications, and when wideband

that Facebook's policies reduced the number of anti-vaccine posts but also

engagement with remaining anti-vaccine content repeatedly recovered to

politically polarised, and more likely to be seen in users' newsfeeds. We
explain these results as an unintended consequence of Facebook's design goal:
promoting community formation. Members of communities dedicated to vaccine

a given graph that intersects all minor models of graphs from the family F. The
Vertex planarization problem is a special case of F-minor-free deletion for the
family F = {K_5, K_{3,3}}. Whenever the family F contains at least one planar
graph, then F-minor-free deletion is known to admit a constant-factor
approximation algorithm and a polynomial kernelization [Fomin, Lokshtanov,
Misra, and Saurabh, FOCS'12]. The Vertex planarization problem is arguably the
simplest setting for which F does not contain a planar graph and the existence
of a constant-factor approximation or a polynomial kernelization remains a
major open problem.
  In this work we show that Vertex planarization admits an algorithm which is a
combination of both approaches. Namely, we present a polynomial A-approximate
kernelization, for some constant A > 1, based on the framework of lossy
kernelization [Lokshtanov, Panolan, Ramanujan, and Saurabh, STOC'17]. Simply
speaking, when given a graph G and integer k, we show how to compute a graph G'
on poly(k) vertices so that any B-approximate solution to G' can be lifted to
an (A*B)-approximate solution to G, as long as A*B*OPT(G) <= k. In order to
achieve this, we develop a framework for sparsification of planar graphs which
approximately preserves all separators and near-separators between subsets of
the given terminal set.
  Our result yields an improvement over the state-of-art approximation
algorithms for Vertex planarization. The problem admits a polynomial-time
O(n^eps)-approximation algorithm, for any eps > 0, and a quasi-polynomial-time
(log n)^O(1) approximation algorithm, both randomized [Kawarabayashi and
Sidiropoulos, FOCS'17]. By pipelining these algorithms with our approximate
kernelization, we improve the approximation factors to respectively O(OPT^eps)

Here we propose a new design of a vision-based tactile sensor, DelTact. The
sensor uses a modular hardware architecture for compactness whilst maintaining
a contact measurement of full resolution (798*586) and large area (675mm2).
Moreover, it adopts an improved dense random color pattern based on the
previous version to achieve high accuracy of contact deformation tracking. In
particular, we optimize the color pattern generation process and select the
appropriate pattern for coordinating with a dense optical flow algorithm under
a real-world experimental sensory setting. The optical flow obtained from the
raw image is processed to determine shape and force distribution on the contact
surface. We also demonstrate the method to extract contact shape and force
distribution from the raw images. Experimental results demonstrate that the
sensor is capable of providing tactile measurements with low error and high

short-term benefits by sacrificing the long-term maintainability and
evolvability of software. A special type of technical debt is explicitly
admitted by software engineers (e.g. using a TODO comment); this is called
Self-Admitted Technical Debt or SATD. Most work on automatically identifying
SATD focuses on source code comments. In addition to source code comments,
issue tracking systems have shown to be another rich source of SATD, but there
are no approaches specifically for automatically identifying SATD in issues. In
this paper, we first create a training dataset by collecting and manually
analyzing 4,200 issues (that break down to 23,180 sections of issues) from
seven open-source projects (i.e., Camel, Chromium, Gerrit, Hadoop, HBase,
Impala, and Thrift) using two popular issue tracking systems (i.e., Jira and
Google Monorail). We then propose and optimize an approach for automatically
identifying SATD in issue tracking systems using machine learning. Our findings
indicate that: 1) our approach outperforms baseline approaches by a wide margin
with regard to the F1-score; 2) transferring knowledge from suitable datasets
can improve the predictive performance of our approach; 3) extracted SATD
keywords are intuitive and potentially indicating types and indicators of SATD;
4) projects using different issue tracking systems have less common SATD
keywords compared to projects using the same issue tracking system; 5) a small

their gravitational-wave (GW) emission. BHNS mergers could also produce
electromagnetic (EM) emission as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), and/or an sGRB
afterglow upon interaction with the circummerger medium. Here, we make
predictions for the expected detection rates with the Square Kilometre Array
Phase 1 (SKA1) of sGRB radio afterglows associated with BHNS mergers. We also
investigate the benefits of a multimessenger analysis in inferring the
properties of the merging binary. We simulate a population of BHNS mergers and
estimate their sGRB afterglow flux to obtain the detection rates with SKA1. We
investigate how this rate depends on the GW detector sensitivity, the primary
black hole (BH) spin, and the neutron star equation of state. We then perform a
multimessenger Bayesian inference study on a fiducial BHNS merger. We simulate
its sGRB afterglow and GW emission and take systematic errors into account. The
expected rates of a combined GW and radio detection with the current generation
GW detectors are likely low. Due to the much increased sensitivity of future GW
detectors like the Einstein Telescope, the chances of an sGRB localisation and
radio detection increase substantially. The unknown distribution of the BH spin
has a big influence on the detection rates, however, and it is a large source
of uncertainty. Furthermore, for our fiducial BHNS merger we are able to infer
both the binary source parameters as well as the parameters of the sGRB
afterglow simultaneously when combining the GW and radio data. The radio data
provides useful extra information on the binary parameters such as the mass
ratio but this is limited by the systematic errors involved. A better
understanding of the systematics will further increase the amount of
information on the binary parameters that can be extracted from this radio

intersections between unstable and stable manifolds, which (despite being
infinite dimensional objects) turn out to have finite dimensional intersection
with good compactness properties. This follows from the existence of an
additional structure, namely a strongly integrable (0)-essential subbundle,

and which is needed to make comparisons. Transversality is achieved by
generically perturbing the negative gradient vector field $-\nabla \mathbb A_H$

preserving all good compactness properties of $-\nabla \mathbb A_H$. This
follows from an abstract transversality result of independent interest for

rest points are infinite dimensional. The resulting Morse homology is
independent of the choice of the Hamiltonian (and of all other choices but the
choice of the (0)-essential subbundle, which however only changes the
Morse-complex by a shift of the indices) and is isomorphic to the Floer

Generally, LPV control synthesis is performed in the continuous-time (CT)
domain due to significantly more intuitive performance shaping methods in CT.
However, the main complication of CT synthesis approaches is the successive
implementation of the resulting CT control solutions on physical hardware. In
the literature, several discretization methods have been developed for LPV
systems. However, most of these approaches necessitate heavy nonlinear
operations introduced by the discretization of these time-varying matrices or

preservation of the CT control. Based on these observations, this paper aims at
extending the $w'$ discretization approach to LPV systems, such that
implementation of CT LPV control solutions on physical hardware is simplified.

suitable parameters depending explicitly on the measure of the level sets of
$h$. In the simplest, common case, in which $h$ is positive, bounded and
decreasing, our result implies that any bounded open set or any bounded
measurable set with finite perimeter which has constant nonlocal $h$-mean

tries to keep a safe distance between itself and the lead vehicle (LV) by
adjusting its acceleration in response to the actions of the vehicle ahead. The
corresponding car-following models, which describe how one vehicle follows
another vehicle in the traffic flow, form the cornerstone for microscopic
traffic simulation and intelligent vehicle development. One major motivation of
car-following models is to replicate human drivers' longitudinal driving
trajectories. To model the long-term dependency of future actions on historical
driving situations, we developed a long-sequence car-following trajectory
prediction model based on the attention-based Transformer model. The model
follows a general format of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder takes
historical speed and spacing data as inputs and forms a mixed representation of
historical driving context using multi-head self-attention. The decoder takes
the future LV speed profile as input and outputs the predicted future FV speed
profile in a generative way (instead of an auto-regressive way, avoiding
compounding errors). Through cross-attention between encoder and decoder, the
decoder learns to build a connection between historical driving and future LV
speed, based on which a prediction of future FV speed can be obtained. We train
and test our model with 112,597 real-world car-following events extracted from
the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS). Results show that the model
outperforms the traditional intelligent driver model (IDM), a fully connected
neural network model, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model in terms
of long-sequence trajectory prediction accuracy. We also visualized the
self-attention and cross-attention heatmaps to explain how the model derives
its predictions.

to cause undesired effects. AI techniques are numerous with many approaches and
variants, but they can be classified simply based on the degree of knowledge
they capture and how much data they require; two broad categories emerge as
prominent across AI to date: (1) techniques that are primarily, and often
solely, data-driven while leveraging little to no knowledge and (2) techniques
that primarily leverage knowledge and depend less on data. Now, a third
category is starting to emerge that leverages both data and knowledge, that
some refer to as ""informed AI."" This third category can be a game changer
within the national security domain where there is ample scientific and
domain-specific knowledge that stands ready to be leveraged, and where purely
data-driven AI can lead to serious unwanted consequences.
  This report shares findings from a thorough exploration of AI approaches that

the capability to search for exotic particles that leave track-like signatures

often sets the spatial resolution and makes the problem of reconstructing
track-like paths non-trivial. In this paper, we present an algorithm that
improves reconstruction of track-like events in segmented detectors using
multi-objective optimization - a computational technique that optimizes more
than one cost function at a time without specifying a quantitative weighting
between them. Such a technique allows the reconstruction of tracks through a
detector and the determination of path-lengths through individual elements.
When combined with the reconstructed energy depositions in each element this
allows for a calculation of the stopping power of track-like particles and
opens the door to searches for particles with abnormal stopping power like
monopoles or lightly-ionizing particles (LIPs). Results are presented which
evaluate the precision of the reconstruction tools as they currently stand

program benefit parameters on labor supply has allowed only restrictive forms
of heterogeneity in preferences. Yet preference heterogeneity implies that the
marginal effects on labor supply of welfare expansions and contractions may
differ in different time periods with different populations and which sweep out
different portions of the distribution of preferences. A new examination of the
heavily studied AFDC program uses variation in state-level administrative
barriers to entering the program in the late 1980s and early 1990s to estimate
the marginal labor supply effects of changes in program participation induced
by that variation. The estimates are obtained from a theory-consistent reduced
form model which allows for a nonparametric specification of how changes in
welfare program participation affect labor supply on the margin. Estimates
using a form of local instrumental variables show that the marginal treatment
effects are quadratic, rising and then falling as participation rates rise
(i.e., becoming more negative then less negative on hours of work). The average
work disincentive is not large but that masks some margins where effects are
close to zero and some which are sizable. Traditional IV which estimates a
weighted average of marginal effects gives a misleading picture of marginal
responses. A counterfactual exercise which applies the estimates to three
historical reform periods in 1967, 1981, and 1996 when the program tax rate was
significantly altered shows that marginal labor supply responses differed in
each period because of differences in the level of participation in the period
and the composition of who was on the program.

of deep learning benefits incredibly from the vastly enhanced access to data
available in various digital formats. However, in certain scenarios, people may
not want their data being used for training commercial models and thus studied
how to attack the learnability of deep learning models. Previous works on
learnability attack only consider the goal of preventing unauthorized
exploitation on the specific dataset but not the process of restoring the
learnability for authorized cases. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces
and investigates a new concept called ""learnability lock"" for controlling the
model's learnability on a specific dataset with a special key. In particular,
we propose adversarial invertible transformation, that can be viewed as a
mapping from image to image, to slightly modify data samples so that they
become ""unlearnable"" by machine learning models with negligible loss of visual
features. Meanwhile, one can unlock the learnability of the dataset and train
models normally using the corresponding key. The proposed learnability lock
leverages class-wise perturbation that applies a universal transformation
function on data samples of the same label. This ensures that the learnability
can be easily restored with a simple inverse transformation while remaining
difficult to be detected or reverse-engineered. We empirically demonstrate the
success and practicability of our method on visual classification tasks.

is a concern. That is, models trained on fictitious data may fail spectacularly
when put to real-world problems. The fundamental difficulty with oversampling
approaches is that, given a real-life population, the synthesized samples may
not truly belong to the minority class. As a result, training a classifier on
these samples while pretending they represent minority may result in incorrect
predictions when the model is used in the real world. We analyzed a large
number of oversampling methods in this paper and devised a new oversampling
evaluation system based on hiding a number of majority examples and comparing
them to those generated by the oversampling process. Based on our evaluation
system, we ranked all these methods based on their incorrectly generated
examples for comparison. Our experiments using more than 70 oversampling
methods and three imbalanced real-world datasets reveal that all oversampling
methods studied generate minority samples that are most likely to be majority.
Given data and methods in hand, we argue that oversampling in its current forms

Bernstein bases also outperform the Chebyshev basis in terms of learning the
spectral graph convolutions. Such conclusions are counter-intuitive in the
field of approximation theory, where it is established that the Chebyshev

  In this paper, we revisit the problem of approximating the spectral graph
convolutions with Chebyshev polynomials. We show that ChebNet's inferior
performance is primarily due to illegal coefficients learnt by ChebNet
approximating analytic filter functions, which leads to over-fitting. We then
propose ChebNetII, a new GNN model based on Chebyshev interpolation, which

approaches to governance and responsible development and use of AI. Then, I
reflect over what should be the bases of a social paradigm for AI and how this
should be embedded in relational, feminist and non-Western philosophies, in

economy and society worldwide. Emerging strains are making pandemic management
increasingly challenging. There is an urge to collect epidemiological,
clinical, and physiological data to make an informed decision on mitigation
measures. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing provide
solutions for pandemic management through data collection and intelligent
computation. While existing data-driven architectures attempt to automate
decision-making, they do not capture the multifaceted interaction among
computational models, communication infrastructure, and the generated data. In
this paper, we perform a survey of the existing approaches for pandemic
management, including online data repositories and contact-tracing
applications. We then envision a unified pandemic management architecture that
leverages the IoT and edge computing to automate recommendations on vaccine
distribution, dynamic lockdown, mobility scheduling and pandemic prediction. We
elucidate the flow of data among the layers of the architecture, namely, cloud,
edge and end device layers. Moreover, we address the privacy implications,
threats, regulations, and existing solutions that may be adapted to optimize
the utility of health data with security guarantees. The paper ends with a
lowdown on the limitations of the architecture and research directions to
enhance its practicality.

  Vehicles",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Learned path planners have attracted research interest due to their ability
to model human driving behavior and rapid inference. Recent works on behavioral
cloning show that simple imitation of expert observations is not sufficient to
handle complex driving scenarios. Besides, predictions that land outside
drivable areas can lead to potentially dangerous situations. This paper
proposes a set of loss functions, namely Social loss and Road loss, which
account for modelling risky social interactions in path planning. These losses
act as a repulsive scalar field that surrounds non-drivable areas. Predictions
that land near these regions incur in a higher training cost, which is
minimized using backpropagation. This methodology provides additional
environment feedback to the traditional supervised learning set up. We
validated this approach on a large-scale urban driving dataset. The results
show the agent learns to imitate human driving while exhibiting better safety
metrics. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has positive effects on
inference without the need to artificially generate unsafe driving examples.
The explanability study suggests that the benefits obtained are associated with
a higher relevance of non-drivable areas in the agent's decisions compared to
classical behavioral cloning.

relevance in many signal- and information-theoretic applications. In this paper
we study questions related to the computability of the bandwidth of computable
bandlimited signals. To this end we employ the concept of Turing computability,
which exactly describes what is theoretically feasible and can be computed on a
digital computer. Recently, it has been shown that there exist computable
bandlimited signals with finite energy, the actual bandwidth of which is not a
computable number, and hence cannot be computed on a digital computer. In this
work, we consider the most general class of band-limited signals, together with
different computable representations thereof. Among other things, our analysis
includes a characterization of the arithmetic complexity of the bandwidth of
such signals and yields a negative answer to the question of whether it is at
least possible to compute non-trivial upper or lower bounds for the bandwidth
of a bandlimited signal. Furthermore, we relate the problem of bandwidth
computation to the theory of oracle machines. In particular, we consider
halting and totality oracles, which belong to the most frequently investigated
oracle machines in the theory of computation.

  implemented with finite element exterior calculus",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A four-field mixed variational principle is proposed for large deformation
analysis of Kirchhoff rods with a $C^0$ mixed FE approximations. The core idea
behind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter family of points (the
centerline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the
Cartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and
torsion of the curve are related to the relative rotation of neighboring
frames. The relationship between the frame and the centerline is then enforced
at the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the role of
section force). Well known frames like the Frenet-Serret are defined only using
the centerline, which demands higher-order smoothness for the centerline
approximation. Decoupling the frame from the position vector of the base curve
leads to a description of torsion and curvature that is independent of the
position information, thus allowing for simpler interpolations. This approach
is then cast in the language of exterior calculus. In this framework, the
strain energy may be interpreted as a differential form leading to the natural
force-displacement (velocity) pairing. The four-field mixed variational
principle we propose has frame, differential forms, and position vector as
input arguments. While the position vector is interpolated linearly, the frames
are interpolated as piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Similarly,
consistent interpolation schemes are also adopted to obtain finite dimensional
approximations for other differential forms aswell. Using these discrete
approximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is
then numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to
benchmark problems, our numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of
the proposed method without numerical instabilities or locking.

and mortality worldwide: breast, lung, colorectal and prostate. Data of the Web
of Science (WOS) core collection database are used to retrieve articles related
to sensor technologies and cancer research over 1991-2021 period. We utilized
Gephi software version 0.9.2 to visualize the co-word networks of the
interaction between sensor technologies and cancers under study. Results show
main clusters of interaction per typology of cancer. Biosensor is the only type
of sensor that plays an essential role in all types of cancer: breast cancer,
lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Electrochemical sensor is
applied in all types of cancer under study except lung cancer. Electrochemical
biosensor is used in breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer research
but not colorectal cancer. Optical sensor can also be considered one of the
sensor technologies that significantly is used in breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and colorectal cancer. This study shows that this type of sensor is
applied in more diversified approaches. Moreover, the oxygen sensor is mostly
studied in lung cancer and breast cancer due to the usage in breath analysis
for the treatment process. Finally, Cmos sensor is a technology used mainly in
lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Results here suggest new directions for the
evolution of science and technology of sensors in cancer research to support
innovation and research policy directed to new technological trajectories
having a potential of accelerated growth and positive social impact for

  Augmentation Methods",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Counterfactual fairness methods address the question: How would the
prediction change if the sensitive identity attributes referenced in the text
instance were different? These methods are entirely based on generating
counterfactuals for the given training and test set instances. Counterfactual
instances are commonly prepared by replacing sensitive identity terms, i.e.,
the identity terms present in the instance are replaced with other identity
terms that fall under the same sensitive category. Therefore, the efficacy of
these methods depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of identity
pairs. In this paper, we offer a two-step data augmentation process where (1)
the former stage consists of a novel method for preparing a comprehensive list
of identity pairs with word embeddings, and (2) the latter consists of
leveraging prepared identity pairs list to enhance the training instances by
applying three simple operations (namely identity pair replacement, identity
term blindness, and identity pair swap). We empirically show that the two-stage
augmentation process leads to diverse identity pairs and an enhanced training
set, with an improved counterfactual token-based fairness metric score on two
well-known text classification tasks.
