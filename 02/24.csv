both tasks, we use trace distance to measure the closeness between the

We find that a spatial distancing policy is mainly beneficial at the early

  Our results demonstrate that given the same transmission level, there is a
decrease in the disease's infection rate and overall prevalence under timeline
dilation conditions. We further show that slow-spreading pathogens (i.e.,
require more prolonged exposure to infect) spread roughly at the same rate as
fast-spreading ones in highly active communities. This is surprising since
slower pathogens follow paths that include longer meetings, while faster
pathogens can potentially follow paths that include shorter meetings, which are
more common. Our results demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of a community

fluid density below the brane, which has the same equation of state as the

has been recognized as an effective way to improve scientific output in terms

series of problems that may have negative influence on team performance. To
address this challenge, we first detect the tendency of the member who may
potentially leave. Here the outlierness is defined with respect to familiarity,
which is quantified by using collaboration intensity. It is assumed that if a
team member has a higher familiarity with scholars outside the team, then this
member might probably leave the team. To minimize the influence caused by the
leaving of such an outlier member, we propose an optimization solution to find
a proper candidate who can replace the outlier member. Based on random walk

when the items are arriving online. A central solution concept in fair
allocation is competitive equilibrium: every individual is endowed with a
budget of faux currency, and the resulting competitive equilibrium is used to
allocate. For the online fair allocation context, the PACE algorithm of Gao et
al. [2021] leverages the dual averaging algorithm to approximate competitive
equilibria. The authors show that, when items arrive i.i.d, the algorithm
asymptotically achieves the fairness and efficiency guarantees of the offline
competitive equilibrium allocation. However, real-world data is typically not
stationary. One could instead model the data as adversarial, but this is often
too pessimistic in practice. Motivated by this consideration, we study an
online fair allocation setting with nonstationary item arrivals. To address
this setting, we first develop new online learning results for the dual
averaging algorithm under nonstationary input models. We show that the dual
averaging iterates converge in mean square to both the underlying optimal
solution of the ""true"" stochastic optimization problem as well as the
""hindsight"" optimal solution of the finite-sum problem given by the sample
path. Our results apply to several nonstationary input models: adversarial
corruption, ergodic input, and block-independent (including periodic) input.
Here, the bound on the mean square error depends on a nonstationarity measure
of the input. We recover the classical bound when the input data is i.i.d. We
then show that our dual averaging results imply that the PACE algorithm for
online fair allocation simultaneously achieves ""best of both worlds"" guarantees
against any of these input models. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments
which show strong empirical performance against nonstationary inputs.

placement $p : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ of the vertices, the edge lengths
$||p(u) - p(v)||, uv \in E$ uniquely determine $p$, up to congruence. In this
paper we consider minimally globally rigid graphs, in which the deletion of an
arbitrary edge destroys global rigidity. We prove that if $G=(V,E)$ is
minimally globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ on at least $d+2$ vertices, then
$|E|\leq (d+1)|V|-\binom{d+2}{2}$. This implies that the minimum degree of $G$
is at most $2d+1$. We also show that the only graph in which the upper bound on
the number of edges is attained is the complete graph $K_{d+2}$. It follows
that every minimally globally rigid graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$ on at least $d+3$
vertices is flexible in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. As a counterpart to our main result
on the sparsity of minimally globally rigid graphs, we show that in two
dimensions, dense graphs always contain nontrivial globally rigid subgraphs.
More precisely, if some graph $G=(V,E)$ satisfies $|E|\geq 5|V|$, then $G$
contains a subgraph on at least seven vertices that is globally rigid in

globally linked in $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove this conjecture in the

measures conditional on covariates, such as risk ratios and mean ratios, are
``transportable'' across populations. Here, we examine the identification of
causal effects in a target population using an assumption that conditional
relative effect measures (e.g., conditional risk ratios or mean ratios) are
transportable from a trial to the target population. We show that
transportability for relative effect measures is largely incompatible with
transportability for difference effect measures, unless the treatment has no
effect on average or one is willing to make even stronger transportability
assumptions, which imply the transportability of both relative and difference
effect measures. We then describe how marginal causal estimands in a target
population can be identified under the assumption of transportability of
relative effect measures, when we are interested in the effectiveness of a new
experimental treatment in a target population where the only treatment in use
is the control treatment evaluated in the trial. We extend these results to
consider cases where the control treatment evaluated in the trial is only one
of the treatments in use in the target population, under an additional partial
exchangeability assumption in the target population (i.e., a partial assumption
of no unmeasured confounding in the target population). We also develop
identification results that allow for the covariates needed for
transportability of relative effect measures to be only a small subset of the
covariates needed to control confounding in the target population. Last, we

temporally varying environments if the time scale of environmental changes

process alone can produce the actual earthquake energy released by the
mainshock has long been questioned. Therefore, exploring the true source of
energy that causes earthquakes after the first motion is necessary. Based on
analyses of the waveforms and ray paths at seismic stations close to the
epicenter, it is considered that strong earthquake vibrations may not be caused
by S-waves. It is also proposed that the reservoirs in sedimentary strata
contain large amounts of high-pressure fluids, whose pressures can be released
under certain conditions; this release of pressure may be an important
component of the main earthquake energy. When a natural fault ruptures and
penetrates a reservoir with a large area, the elastic energy produced by the
release of pressure can reach the energy released by an earthquake of magnitude
8.0. Artificial engineering activities can lead to small-scale fluid pressure
release phenomena, such as blowouts during drilling and earthquakes induced by
hydraulic fracturing. Much direct and indirect evidence, such as the
characteristics of seismic waves in the time and frequency domains recorded
during the Wenchuan earthquake, explosion phenomena observed on the ground and
cores obtained by scientific drilling, indicates the possibility of such energy
release. We propose that seismicity can be divided into three stages: the
microfracturing stage, in which there is fluid activity and can produce an
electrokinetic effect; the significant fracturing stage after the initial
movement; and the strong earthquake stage caused by fluid pressure release.

cross section and $\rho$-parameter at asymptotic energies in proton-proton
($pp$) and antiproton-proton ($\bar{p}p$) collisions. For this intent, we
consider three of the main theoretical results in high energy physics: the
crossing property, the derivative dispersion relation, and the optical theorem.
The use of such machinery allows the analytic formulas for wide set of the
measured global scattering parameters and some important relations between
them. The suggested parameterizations approximate simultaneously the energy
dependence for total cross section and $\rho$-parameter for $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$
with statistically acceptable quality in multi-TeV region. Also the qualitative
description is obtained for important interrelations, namely difference, sum
and ratio of the antiparticle-particle and particle-particle total cross
sections. Despite the reduced number of experimental data for the total cross
section and $\rho$-parameter in TeV-scale, which turns any prediction for the
beginning of the asymptotic domain a hard task, the fitting procedures
indicates that asymptotia lies in the energy range 25.5-130 TeV. Moreover, in
the asymptotic regime, one obtains $\alpha_{\mathbb{P}}=1$. Detailed
quantitative study of energy behavior of measured scattering parameters and
their combinations in ultra-high energy domain indicates that the scenario with
the generalized formulation of the Pomeranchuk theorem is more favorable with
respect to the original formulation of this theorem.

  Preserving Time Integration Schemes","22 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Higher-order time integration methods that unconditionally preserve the
positivity and linear invariants of the underlying differential equation system
cannot belong to the class of general linear methods. This poses a major
challenge for the stability analysis of such methods since the new iterate
depends nonlinearly on the current iterate. Moreover, for linear systems, the
existence of linear invariants is always associated with zero eigenvalues, so
that steady states of the continuous problem become non-hyperbolic fixed points
of the numerical time integration scheme. Altogether, the stability analysis of
such methods requires the investigation of non-hyperbolic fixed points for
general nonlinear iterations. Based on the center manifold theory for maps we
present a theorem for the analysis of the stability of non-hyperbolic fixed
points of time integration schemes applied to problems whose steady states form
a subspace. This theorem provides sufficient conditions for both the stability
of the method and the local convergence of the iterates to the steady state of
the underlying initial value problem. This theorem is then used to prove the
unconditional stability of the MPRK22($\alpha$)-family of modified
Patankar-Runge-Kutta schemes when applied to arbitrary positive and
conservative linear systems of differential equations. The theoretical results
are confirmed by numerical experiments.

equipped with a metric tensor, $(\mathcal{M}_4,\text{g})$, and the connection
on $\mathcal{M}_4$ identified with the Levi-Civita one. Even though there are
valid reasons to assume a torsionless manifold that preserves the metric, it
was shown that dealing away with these assumptions the Levi-Civita condition
can be reproduced at the level of equations of motion of GR. It was not long
before the equivalence of General Relativity between the two descriptions,
known as the Palatini or first-order formalism in which the connection is
independent of the metric, and the conventional metric or second-order
formalism, was broken for more complicated actions involving higher-order
curvature invariants and/or nonminimal couplings between the gravitational and
matter sector. Nowadays these types of theories are prominent in modeling
inflation where they have found major success. Since the paradigm of inflation
is fused with the gravitational degrees of freedom and thus their
parametrisation, it is interesting to understand how the predictions of these
models differ between the two formulations. One of the outstanding models of
inflation is the Starobinsky or quadratic gravity model. However in the
Palatini formalism the scalar degree of freedom sourced by the $R^2$ term is
nondynamical and is unable to drive an inflationary phase. In order for
inflation to be realised in the first-order formalism the Starobinsky model has
to be coupled with a fundamental scalar field that will assume the role of the
inflaton. In this thesis we investigate different inflationary scenarios,
starting with previously ruled-out models, where we find that the $R^2$ term
has a significant role in flattening the Einstein-frame inflaton potential and
thus giving the opportunity for these models to come in contact with
observations.

mass-metallicity relation, MZR), while other physical parameters could play a
potential role in shaping this abundance, but with a lower significant impact.
We find that the functional form that best describes the MZR is a third-order
polynomial function. From the residuals between this best functional form and
the MZR, we find that once considered the impact of the mass in the oxygen

role in shaping the oxygen abundance in these galaxies (including the gas

central issue in physics. In this regard, the relationship between
unconventional superconductivity and the quantum critical point (QCP)
associated with the suppression of some form of symmetry-breaking order to zero
temperature has received particular attention. The key question is how the
strength of the electron pairs changes near the QCP, and this can be verified
by high-field experiments. However, such studies are limited mainly to
superconductors with magnetic QCPs, and the possibility of unconventional
mechanisms by which nonmagnetic QCP promotes strong pairing remains a
nontrivial issue. Here, we report systematic measurements of the upper critical
field $H_{{\rm c2}}$ in nonmagnetic FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ superconductors, which
exhibit a QCP of electronic nematicity characterized by spontaneous
rotational-symmetry breaking. As the magnetic field increases, the
superconducting phase of FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ shrinks to a narrower dome
surrounding the nematic QCP. The analysis of $H_{{\rm c2}}$ reveals that the
Pauli-limiting field is enhanced toward the QCP, implying that the pairing
interaction is significantly strengthened via nematic fluctuations emanated
from the QCP. Remarkably, this nonmagnetic nematic QCP is not accompanied by a
divergent effective mass, distinct from the magnetically mediated pairing. Our

on the notion of $\textit{informativity}$, which intuitively requires that all
components of a filter's internal state are representative of the true state of
the underlying dynamical system. We show that informativity overcomes the
aforementioned degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a $\textit{regularizer}$
which explicitly enforces informativity, and establish that gradient descent on
this regularized objective - combined with a ``reconditioning step'' -
converges to the globally optimal cost a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ rate. Our analysis

multidimensional projection techniques, has recently been introduced to tackle
the challenges in the exploratory and visual analysis of high-dimensional data.
SDR has been applied to various real-world datasets, such as human activity
sensory data and astronomical datasets. However, manually labeling the samples
from the generated projection are expensive. To address this problem, we
propose here to use clustering methods such as k-means, Hierarchical
Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN), and Spectral Clustering to easily label the 2D projections of
high-dimensional data. We test our pipeline of SDR and the clustering methods
on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including two different public
human activity datasets extracted from smartphone accelerometer or gyroscope
recordings of various movements. We apply clustering to assess the visual
cluster separation of SDR, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conclude
that clustering SDR results yields better labeling results than clustering
plain DR, and that k-means is the recommended clustering method for SDR in
terms of clustering accuracy, ease-of-use, and computational scalability.

with the advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years, the analysis of
wide, deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and
posteriors. However, we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under
approximate inference. In this work, we show that mean-field variational
inference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and
the activation function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd
activation functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the
optimal mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space)
distribution converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends
to infinity. We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our
theoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously
observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and
constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be
applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we show that the optimal
approximate posterior need not tend to the prior if the activation function is
not odd, showing that our statements cannot be generalized arbitrarily.

methodology to recover the counterfactual distribution when there is a single
(or a few) treated unit and possibly a high-dimensional number of potential
controls observed in a panel structure. The methodology accommodates, albeit
does not require, the number of units to be larger than the number of time
periods (high-dimensional setup). As opposed to model only the conditional
mean, we propose to model the entire conditional quantile function (CQF) in the
absence of intervention and estimate it using the pre-intervention period using
a penalized regression. We derive non-asymptotic bounds for the estimated CQF
valid uniformly over the quantiles, allowing the practitioner to re-construct
the entire contractual distribution. Moreover, we bound the probability
coverage of this estimated CQF which can be used to construct valid confidence
intervals for the (possibly random) treatment effect for every
post-intervention period or simultaneously. We also propose a new hypothesis
test for the sharp null of no-effect based on the $\mathcal{L}^p$ norm of
deviation of the estimated CQF to the population one. Interestingly, the null
distribution is quasi-pivotal in the sense that it only depends on the
estimated CQF, $\mathcal{L}^p$ norm, and the number of post-intervention
periods, but not on the size of the post-intervention period. For that reason,
critical values can then be easily simulated. We illustrate the methodology is
by revisiting the empirical study in Acemoglu et al (2016).

environments is critical for online time series forecasting. Successful
solutions require handling changes to new and recurring patterns. However,
training deep neural forecaster on the fly is notoriously challenging because
of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and the
catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. In this work, inspired by the
Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning
Networks (FSNet), a holistic framework for online time-series forecasting to
simultaneously deal with abrupt changing and repeating patterns. Particularly,
FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast
adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet
achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two complementary components
of an adapter to monitor each layer's contribution to the lost, and an
associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating
events. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate FSNet's
efficacy and robustness to both new and recurring patterns. Our code is

quantify implicit assumptions on the extremes of this class of models. In
particular, these tools allow us to approximate the distribution of the tail of

apply these methods to a widely used conditional model for wave height and wave

However, it remains unclear whether this superconductivity mechanism holds for
QCPs of the electronic nematic phase, characterized by rotational symmetry
breaking. Here, we demonstrate from systematic elastoresistivity measurements
that nonmagnetic FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ exhibits an electronic nematic QCP
showing diverging nematic susceptibility. This finding establishes two nematic
QCPs in FeSe-based superconductors with contrasting accompanying phase
diagrams. In FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$, a superconducting dome is centered at the
QCP, whereas FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ shows no QCP-associated enhancement of
superconductivity. We find that this difference is related to the relative
strength of nematic and spin fluctuations. Our results in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$
present the first case in support of the superconducting dome being associated
with the pure nematic QCP.

predicted by many theories which try to complete the standard model of
elementary particles. ALPs interact primarily with two photons and can generate
photon-ALP oscillations in the presence of an external magnetic field. They are
attracting increasing interest since photon-ALP oscillations produce deep
consequences in very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. Two hints for the
existence of an ALP have recently been proposed. In this paper, we study
another effect of the photon-ALP interaction: the change of the polarization
state of photons. In particular, we study the propagation of the photon-ALP
beam starting where photons are produced - we consider photons generated in a
galaxy cluster or in the jet of a blazar - crossing several magnetized media
(blazar jet, host galaxy, galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way) up to
their arrival at the Earth. In the presence of photon-ALP interaction, we
analyze the final photon survival probability $P_{\gamma \to \gamma}$ and the
corresponding photon degree of linear polarization $\Pi_L$ for energies in the
range $(1-10^{15}) \, \rm eV$. We observe that photons, which are expected as
unpolarized in the absence of ALPs, are made partially polarized by photon-ALP
interaction. Our findings can be tested by observatories like IXPE (already
operative), and by the proposed missions eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP and XPP in the
X-ray band and by COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the
high-energy range. We also discover a peculiar feature in the VHE band, where
photons at energies above $ \sim (1-10) \, \rm TeV$ are fully polarized because
of photon-ALP interaction. A possible detection of this feature would represent
a proof for the existence of an ALP, but, unfortunately, current technologies
do not allow yet to detect photon polarization up to so high energies.

assertion does not hold if: (1) $\dim(R)=2$; or (2) $d\geq 3$ but $R$ is not
smooth. We first prove that an affirmative answer can be given for $\dim(R)=2$
when $R$ is an $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$-algebra. Next, for $d\geq 3$ we find the
precise obstruction for the failure in the singular case. Further, we improve a
result of Mandal (related to Nori's question) in the case when the ring $A$ is
an affine $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$-algebra of dimension $d$. We apply this
improvement to define the $n$-th Euler class group $E^n(A)$, where $2n\ge d+2.$
Moreover, if $A$ is smooth, we associate to a unimodular row $v$ of length
$n+1$ its Euler class $e(v)\in E^n(A)$ and show that the corresponding stably
free module, say, $P(v)$ has a unimodular element if and only if $e(v)$
vanishes in $E^n(A)$.

overfit and is sensitive to prior assumptions, its limitations for
hyperparameter learning and discrete model comparison have not been thoroughly
investigated. We first revisit the appealing properties of the marginal
likelihood for learning constraints and hypothesis testing. We then highlight
the conceptual and practical issues in using the marginal likelihood as a proxy
for generalization. Namely, we show how marginal likelihood can be negatively
correlated with generalization, with implications for neural architecture
search, and can lead to both underfitting and overfitting in hyperparameter
learning. We also re-examine the connection between the marginal likelihood and
PAC-Bayes bounds and use this connection to further elucidate the shortcomings
of the marginal likelihood for model selection. We provide a partial remedy
through a conditional marginal likelihood, which we show is more aligned with
generalization, and practically valuable for large-scale hyperparameter

upper chromosphere recorded with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS)
mounted at the GREGOR solar telescope. We retrieve the line-of-sight velocities
and the magnetic field vector using the HeLIx+ inversion code that assumes
Milne-Eddington atmospheres. We find magnetized supersonic downflows in all the
ARs, with larger area coverage by such flows in ARs observed during their
emerging phase. The fact that supersonic downflows were detected in all scans,
though they cover only a small fraction, 0.2--6.4%, of the observed
field-of-view, suggests that they are a common phenomenon in the upper
chromospheres of ARs. The supersonic downflows are found to be associated with
many AR features such as pores, sunspot umbrae, sunspot penumbrae, light
bridges, plages, He I loops as part of arch filament systems characteristic of
emerging fields, and filaments. Although several mechanisms are identified to
be causing the supersonic downflows, by far the most common one appears to be
the draining of plasma along the legs of rising magnetic loops. The loops
mainly drain into forming pores. The line-of-sight velocities of the supersonic
downflows reach up to 49 kms-1 and the velocity distribution shows multiple
populations. Almost 92% of these supersonic downflows coexist with a subsonic
flow component. The weaker, more horizontal fields associated with the
supersonic component suggests that it is formed above the subsonic component.

bounds on several capacities, including the quantum capacity and private
capacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and
private key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of
capacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to
obtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states,
such as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further
understand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational
limitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms
of the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state.
They can also be used as a new approach towards numerically bounding
capacities, as discussed with some examples.

studies mainly focused on the local instability induced by the fluid--structure
interactions (FSIs) in the system, we derive a one-dimensional (1D) model to
study the FSI's effect on the global instability. The proposed 1D FSI model is
tailored to long, shallow rectangular microchannels with a deformable top wall,
similar to the experiments. Going beyond the usual lubrication flows analyzed
in these geometries, we include finite fluid inertia and couple the reduced
flow equations to a novel reduced 1D wall deformation equation. Although a
quantitative comparison to previous experiments is difficult, the behaviors of
the proposed model show qualitative agreement with the experimental
observations, and capture several key effects. Specifically, we find the
critical conditions under which the inflated base state of the 1D FSI model is
linearly unstable to infinitesimal perturbations. The critical Reynolds numbers
predicted are in agreement with experimental observations. The unstable modes
are highly oscillatory, with frequencies close to the natural frequency of the
wall, suggesting that the observed instabilities are resonance phenomena.
Furthermore, during the start-up from an undeformed initial state,
self-sustained oscillations can be triggered by FSI. Our modeling framework can
be applied to other microfluidic systems with similar geometric scale

multi-label classification in every disease category in terms of AUC. However,
this performance was heavily influenced by co-occurring diseases in the binary

in an AUC of < 0.65 when there were no other co-occurring diseases, but when
lung nodules co-occurred with emphysema, the performance reached AUC > 0.80. We
hope this paper revealed the complexity of interpreting disease classification
performance in weakly supervised models and will encourage researchers to

corresponds to a loop integral in the bulk. Through this loop integral,
non-factorization becomes apparent in the dual entangled CFTs. Furthermore, we
classify Berry phases in holographic CFTs based on the type of dual bulk

migration. The planets subsequently migrate together as a resonant pair. In the
context of circumbinary planets, the disc is truncated internally by the
binary. If there were only a single planet, then this inner disc edge would
provide a natural parking location. However, for two planets migrating together
in resonance there will be a tension between the inner planet stopping at the
disc edge, and the outer planet continuing to be torqued inwards. In this paper
we study this effect, showing that the outcome is a function of the
planet-planet mass ratio. Smaller outer planets tend to be parked in a stable
exterior 2:1 or 3:2 resonance with the inner planet, which itself remains near
the disc edge. Equal or larger mass outer planets tend to push the inner planet
past the disc edge and too close to the binary, causing it to be ejected or
sometimes flipped to an exterior orbit. Our simulations show that this process
may explain an observed dearth of small (< 3 Earth radii) circumbinary planets,
since small planets are frequently ejected or left on long-period orbits, for
which transit detection is less likely. This may also be an efficient mechanism
for producing free-floating planets and interstellar interlopers like
`Oumuamua.

(ICM) and manifest themselves as diffuse sources of synchrotron emission
observable at radio wavelengths, namely radio halos and radio relics. Although
there is broad consensus that the formation of these sources is connected to
turbulence and shocks in the ICM, the details of the required particle
acceleration, the strength and morphology of the magnetic field in the cluster
volume, and the influence of other sources of high-energy particles are poorly
known. Sufficiently large samples of radio halos and relics, which would allow
us to examine the variation among the source population and pinpoint their
commonalities and differences, are still missing. At present, large numbers of
these sources are easiest to detect at low radio frequencies, where they shine
brightly. We examined the low-frequency radio emission from all 309 clusters in
the second catalog of Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich detected sources that lie
within the 5634 deg$^2$ covered by the Second Data Release of the LOFAR
Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). We produced LOFAR images at different
resolutions, with and without discrete sources subtracted, and created overlays
with optical and X-ray images before classifying the diffuse sources in the
ICM, guided by a decision tree. Overall, we found 83 clusters that host a radio
halo and 26 that host one or more radio relics (including candidates). About
half of them are new discoveries. The detection rate of clusters hosting a
radio halo and one or more relics in our sample is $30\pm11$% and $10\pm6$%,
respectively. Extrapolating these numbers, we anticipate that once LoTSS covers
the entire northern sky it will provide the detection of $251\pm92$ clusters
hosting a halo and $83\pm50$ clusters hosting at least one relic from Planck
clusters alone.

from high- and low-mass X-ray binaries conducted by IceCube. Galactic X-ray
binaries are long-standing candidates for the source of Galactic hadronic
cosmic rays and neutrinos. The compact object in these systems can be the site
of cosmic-ray acceleration, and neutrinos can be produced by interactions of
cosmic rays with radiation or gas, in the jet of a microquasar, in the stellar
wind, or in the atmosphere of the companion star. We study X-ray binaries using
7.5 years of IceCube data with three separate analyses. In the first, we search
for periodic neutrino emission from 55 binaries in the Northern Sky with known
orbital periods. In the second, the X-ray light curves of 102 binaries across
the entire sky are used as templates to search for time-dependent neutrino
emission. Finally, we search for time-integrated emission of neutrinos for a
list of 4 notable binaries identified as microquasars. In the absence of a
significant excess, we place upper limits on the neutrino flux for each
hypothesis and compare our results with theoretical predictions for several
binaries. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of the next generation
neutrino telescope at the South Pole, IceCube-Gen2, and demonstrate its power
to identify potential neutrino emission from these binary sources in the
Galaxy.

z. However, given the faintness of distant galaxies in the optical and the NIR,
datasets are still limited and how the dust affects the emerging radiation of
galaxies at very high redshift is not yet fully understood. Using the ALPINE
survey, our objective is to quantify the dust attenuation properties in
galaxies at z=4.4-5.5, and in particular the shape of their attenuation curve.
Using the CIGALE code, we model the stellar populations and their interaction
with the dust in order to measure some of the physical properties of a
subsample of 23 main-sequence ALPINE galaxies. We find that the attenuation
curves span a broad range of properties, from curves that are much steeper than
the SMC extinction curve, to shallower than the starburst attenuation curve.
The shape of the attenuation curves strongly depends on the V-band attenuation.
Galaxies with the lowest attenuation also present the steepest curves. The
steepness of such curves is probably the consequence of the combination of the
intrinsic physical properties of the dust, the relative distribution of stars
and dust in the interstellar medium, and the differential reddening. The broad
range of attenuation curves found at z~5 shows that no single attenuation curve
is appropriate for main sequence galaxies and that assuming a fixed curve can
lead to large errors, for instance in the interpretation and use of the
IRX-beta diagram, if SED modeling is not feasible. Great caution should be
exercised when correcting high redshift galaxies for the presence of dust using
the UV slope beta as it can affect the estimation of both SFR and stellar mass
even at low V-band attenuation due to the steepness of the attenuation curve.
However, when SED modeling can be used, the impact of the choice of the
attenuation curve on the SFR and the stellar mass is limited.

as a means to extract non-Gaussian information on both bias and cosmological

while gaining significantly on speed. Our results show that for the combination
of the Planck satellite and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI),
the difference in the constraints on bias and cosmological parameters from the

agreement between our theoretical skew-spectra and those estimated from N-body
simulations, for which it is important to include gravitational non-linearities
beyond perturbation theory and the post-Born effect for CMB lensing. We define
an algorithm to apply the skew-spectrum estimator to the data and, as a
preliminary step, we use the skew-spectra to constrain bias parameters and the
amplitude of shot noise from the simulations through a Markov chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, finding that it may be possible to reach percent-level

encoding the loss function as an Ising model Hamiltonian. The quantum annealer
then trains the network by finding the ground state. We implement this for an
elementary network and illustrate the advantages of quantum training: its
consistency in finding the global minimum of the loss function and the fact
that the network training converges in a single annealing step, which leads to
short training times while maintaining a high classification performance. Our
approach opens a novel avenue for the quantum training of general machine

we present a rigorous lattice-based derivation of its scaling properties using
the theory of Toeplitz determinants. We consider a class of critical quantum
chains with a microscopic U(1) symmetry; each chain has a low energy
description given by $N$ massless Dirac fermions. For the density matrix,
$\rho_A$, of subsystems of $L$ neighbouring sites we calculate the leading
terms in the large $L$ asymptotic expansion of the symmetry-resolved R\'enyi

accidental near degeneracy of two superconducting components belonging to 1D

been argued that the chiral $B_{2u}+iB_{3u}$ combination is selected by

the near-degeneracy as a result of an accidental $C_4$ symmetry of the band

from our total intensity (Stokes I) maps, where the majority of these have
never been detected at radio wavelengths before. At 6"" resolution, our full

median rms sensitivity of 83$\mu$Jy/beam; a flux density scale accuracy of
approximately 10%; an astrometric accuracy of 0.2""; and we estimate the

Hierarchy Survey (SSH) and archival Hubble Space Telescope data, we reveal the
presence of two elongated stellar features contiguous to a bar-like stellar
structure in the inner regions of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 3741. These
structures are dominated by stars younger than a few hundred Myr and
collectively are about twice as extended as the old stellar component. These
properties are very unusual for dwarf galaxies in the nearby Universe and
difficult to explain by hydro-dynamical simulations. From the analysis of
archival 21-cm observations, we find that the young stellar ""bar"" coincides
with an HI high-density region proposed by previous studies to be a purely
gaseous bar; we furthermore confirm radial motions of a few km/s, compatible
with an inflow/outflow, and derive a steeply-rising rotation curve and high HI
surface density at the center, indicating a very concentrated mass
distribution. We propose that the peculiar properties of the stellar and
gaseous components of NGC 3741 may be explained by a recent merger or ongoing
gas accretion from the intergalactic medium, which caused gas inflows towards
the galaxy center and triggered star formation a few hundred Myr ago. This
event may explain the young and extended stellar features, the bar-like
structure, the very extended HI disc and the central HI spiral arms. The high
central HI density and the steeply rising rotation curve suggest that NGC 3741
may be the progenitor or the descendant of a starburst dwarf.

broken symmetry of homochirality, the logic of Nature's regularities has
fascinated scientists for centuries. Some of Nature's symmetries are clearly
visible in morphology and physical structure, whereas others are hidden in the
network of interactions among system components. Just as visible symmetries and
asymmetries contribute to the system's beauty, might hidden symmetries
contribute to the system's functional harmony? And if so, how? Here we
demonstrate that the interaction networks of biological systems from cell
signaling to cancer display a form of dynamical reflection symmetry that serves
to expand their dynamical complexity. The expansion proceeds according to
precise rules regarding the lengths of dynamical cycles, made possible by a
peculiar imbalance between excitation and inhibition. To probe the conditions
under which this reflection symmetry evolves, we use a multi-objective genetic
algorithm to produce networks with long dynamical cycles. We find that local
structural motifs that break the reflection symmetry are deleted in the
evolutionary process, providing evidence for symmetry's causal role in
dynamical complexity. Finally, we identify symmetries in real continuous-valued
scRNA-seq data of gene expression in drug-resistant cancer cells. Broadly, our
work reveals a class of hidden symmetries in biology, present in the network of
interactions among system components, and it underscores their functional
importance. Mathematically simple and computational inexpensive, our approach
is applicable to the types of biological data commonly acquired in modern
experiments.

important constraints on the formation channels of merging sBHs. Here, we study
the role of secular spin-orbit resonance in the evolution of a sBH binary
component around a supermassive BH (SMBH) in an AGN disk. We consider the sBH's
spin-precession due to the $J_2$ moment introduced by a circum-sBH disk within
the warping/breaking radius of the disk. We find that the sBH's spin-orbit
misalignment (obliquity) can be excited via spin-orbit resonance between the
sBH binary's orbital nodal precession and the sBH spin-precession driven by a
massive circum-sBH disk. Using an $\alpha$-disk model with
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, the resonances typically occur for sBH
binaries with semi-major axis of $1$AU, and at a distance of $\sim 1000$AU
around a $10^7$\msun SMBH. The spin-orbit resonances can lead to high sBH
obliquities, and a broad distribution of sBH binary spin-spin misalignments.
However, we note that the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion is much higher than
that of Eddington accretion, which typically results in spin precession being
too low to trigger spin-orbit resonances. Thus, the secular spin-orbit
resonances can be quite rare for sBHs in AGN disks.

Coulomb interactions are taken into account. Perturbative studies on
phenomenological models have shown that the smectic fixed point is unstable
towards a variety of phases such as superconductivity, stripe, smectic and
Fermi liquid phases. Here, we show that the considered microscopic model leads
to a phase diagram with only smectic metal and Fermi liquid phases. The smectic
metal phase is stable in the ideal quantum wire limit $\ell\to0$. For finite
$\ell$, we find a critical Coulomb coupling $\alpha_{c}$ separating the strong

the conditional quantile of a scalar response is assumed to be a linear
functional of a functional covariate. In contrast to conventional approaches,
we employ kernel convolution to smooth the original loss function. The
coefficient function is estimated under a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
framework. A gradient descent algorithm is designed to minimize the smoothed
loss function with a roughness penalty. With the aid of the Banach fixed-point
theorem, we show the existence and uniqueness of our proposed estimator as the
minimizer of the regularized loss function in an appropriate Hilbert space.
Furthermore, we establish the convergence rate as well as the weak convergence
of our estimator. As far as we know, this is the first weak convergence result
for a functional quantile regression model. Pointwise confidence intervals and
a simultaneous confidence band for the true coefficient function are then
developed based on these theoretical properties. Numerical studies including
both simulations and a data application are conducted to investigate the
performance of our estimator and inference tools in finite sample.

the term ""interpretable feature"" is not specific nor detailed enough to capture
the full extent to which features impact the usefulness of ML explanations. In
this paper, we motivate and discuss three key lessons: 1) more attention should
be given to what we refer to as the interpretable feature space, or the state
of features that are useful to domain experts taking real-world actions, 2) a
formal taxonomy is needed of the feature properties that may be required by
these domain experts (we propose a partial taxonomy in this paper), and 3)
transforms that take data from the model-ready state to an interpretable form
are just as essential as traditional ML transforms that prepare features for
the model.

imbalance following a nonmonotonic trend with a jump discontinuity at density
balance, identified with the interlayer IX molecule gap. This behavior
discriminates between the superfluidity of interlayer bound pairs and
independent dipole condensation in distinct layers. Considering finite

Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transitions, initially into a pair
superfluid and only then, at lower temperatures, into complete superfluidity of
both layers. Our results may provide a theoretical interpretation of existing
experimental observations in GaAs double quantum well (DQW) bilayer structures.
Furthermore, to optimize the visibility of pairing dynamics in future studies,
we present an analysis suggesting realistic experimental settings in GaAs and

can be mapped to a non-central extension of the direct sum of two
Heisenberg-Weyl algebras whose noncommutative parameter is just the Planck
scale parameter $\kappa^{-1}$. Moreover, it is shown that the usual time-like
$\kappa$-deformation of the Poincar\'e group does not allow the construction of
the Poisson homogeneous space of light-like worldlines. Therefore, the most
natural choice in order to model the propagation of massless particles on a
quantum Minkowski spacetime seems to be provided by the light-like
$\kappa$-deformation.

interactions in the world. In everyday or academic language, we may express
interactions between quantities (e.g., sleep decreases stress), between
discrete events or entities (e.g., a protein inhibits another protein's
transcription), or between intentional or functional factors (e.g., hospital
patients pray to relieve their pain). Extracting and representing these diverse
causal relations are critical for cognitive systems that operate in domains
spanning from scientific discovery to social science. This paper presents a
transformer-based NLP architecture that jointly extracts knowledge graphs
including (1) variables or factors described in language, (2) qualitative
causal relationships over these variables, (3) qualifiers and magnitudes that
constrain these causal relationships, and (4) word senses to localize each
extracted node within a large ontology. We do not claim that our
transformer-based architecture is itself a cognitive system; however, we
provide evidence of its accurate knowledge graph extraction in real-world
domains and the practicality of its resulting knowledge graphs for cognitive
systems that perform graph-based reasoning. We demonstrate this approach and

increases the critical Re to approximately 500, permitting the appearance of a
hitherto unknown puff-like instability (PFI). The instability is identified in
the self-similar region of the jet through clean flow visualizations (FV) and
further corroborated by particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. For 400<
Re <700, the flow exhibits PFI embedded in a puff-train encapsulated by a
laminar flow analogous to 'puffs' in pipe-flow transition; the latter being
symbolic of the finite-amplitude disturbance transition scenario. The
observation that PFI convects close to the average local velocity with an
inflectional velocity profile further strengthens the analogy. LST predicts
that PFI is effectively a superposition of the helical mode (HM) pair with
azimuthal wavenumbers n=+-1. Hence, PFI can also appear in the
infinitesimal-amplitude supercritical route to transition of linearly unstable

operation is determined by the constructive interference of electromagnetic
waves at specific frequencies, giving rise to the resonance spectrum. This
mechanism causes the limitations and trade-offs of resonator design, such as
the difficulty of confining waves larger than the resonator and the fixed
relationship between free spectral range, modal linewidth, and the resonator's
refractive index and size. Here, we introduce a new class of optical
resonators, generating resonances by designing the optical path through
transverse mode coupling in a cascaded process created by mode-converting
mirrors. The generalized round-trip phase condition leads to resonator
characteristics that are markedly different from Fabry-Perot resonators and can
be tailored over a wide range, such as the largest resonant wavelength, the
free spectral range, the linewidth, and the quality factor. We confirm the
existence of these modes experimentally in an integrated waveguide cavity with
mode converters coupling two transverse modes into one supermode. The resonance
signature of the cascaded-mode resonator is a spectrum resulting from the
coherent superposition of the coupled transverse modes. We also demonstrate a
transverse mode-independent transmission through the resonator and show that
its engineered spectral properties agree with theoretical predictions.
Cascaded-mode resonators introduce properties not found in traditional
resonators and provide a mechanism to overcome the existing trade-offs in the
design of resonators in various application areas.

industrial-scale algorithms to optimize user experience. Despite this, many
users seem to regret the time they spend on these platforms. One possible
explanation is misaligned incentives: platforms are not optimizing for user
happiness. We suggest the problem runs deeper, transcending the specific
incentives of any particular platform, and instead stems from a mistaken
revealed-preference assumption: To understand what users want, platforms look
at what users do. Yet research has demonstrated, and personal experience
affirms, that we often make choices in the moment that are inconsistent with
what we actually want. In this work, we develop a model of media consumption
where users have inconsistent preferences. We consider an altruistic platform
which simply wants to maximize user utility, but only observes user engagement.
We show how our model of users' preference inconsistencies produces phenomena
that are familiar from everyday experience, but difficult to capture in
traditional user interaction models. A key ingredient in our model is a
formulation for how platforms determine what to show users: they optimize over
a large set of potential content (the content manifold) parametrized by
underlying features of the content. Whether improving engagement improves user
welfare depends on the direction of movement in the content manifold: for
certain directions of change, increasing engagement makes users less happy,
while in other directions, increasing engagement makes users happier. We
characterize the structure of content manifolds for which increasing engagement
fails to increase user utility. By linking these effects to abstractions of
platform design choices, our model thus creates a theoretical framework and
vocabulary in which to explore interactions between design, behavioral science,

primarily due to the significant, barely predictable and dynamically changing
drag caused by the residual atmosphere, which leads to a rapid deterioration of
any spacecraft's orbit unless mitigated by a combination of active and passive
techniques. This article addresses one passive method by optimising satellite
shapes in order to achieve a minimisation of the atmospheric drag force and
thus extension of operational lifetime. Contrary to previous investigations in
the field, a constant internal volume is maintained to account for the
placement of satellite instruments and payload inside the structure. Moreover,
the satellite geometry is not varied heuristically but optimised via a
numerical 2D profile optimisation specifically developed for this purpose. From
the resulting optimal satellite profiles, 3D satellite bodies are derived,
which are then verified via the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method within the
open-source particle code PICLas. In addition, rather unconventional designs,
i.e. ring geometries, which are based on the assumption of fully specular
particle reflections, are proposed and assessed. The optimised satellite
geometries offer pure passive lifetime extensions of up to 46 $\%$ compared to
a GOCE like reference body, while the above-mentioned ring geometries achieve
passive lifetime extensions of more than 3000 $\%$. Finally, the article
presents design recommendations for VLEO satellites in dependence of different

couples the transverse-traceless (TT) and pure-trace modes that are
traditionally used to describe fluctuations about Euclidean Schwarzschild black
holes in infinite-volume asymptotically flat and asymototically AdS spacetimes.
This coupling obstructs the familiar Gibbons-Hawking-Perry treatment of the
conformal factor problem, as Wick rotation of the pure-trace modes would
require that the TT modes be rotated as well. The coupling also leads to
complex eigenvalues for the \L operator. We nevertheless find that the \L
operator can be diagonalized in the space of coupled modes. This observation
allows the eigenmodes to define a natural generalization of the pure-trace
Wick-rotation recipe used in infinite volume, with the result that a mode with
eigenvalue $\lambda$ is stable when ${\rm Re}\,\lambda > 0$. In any cavity, and
with any cosmological constant $\Lambda \le 0$, we show this recipe to
reproduce the expectation from black hole thermodynamics that large Euclidean

compatibility with industrial fabrication, and prospect to integrate classical
control electronics. To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent
mid-range link that moves the electrons between qubit registers has been
suggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here, we present a blueprint of
such a $\approx 10\,\mu$m long link, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is
based on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. To control
these sets, only a few voltage control lines are needed and the number of these
sets and thus the number of required control signals is independent of the
length of this link. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin
qubit shuttle: A qubit conveyor, i.e. a potential minimum that smoothly moves
laterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a
series of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former
approach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device including
potential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO$_2$ layer, as well as
typical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity in the conveyor
shuttling mode, we discuss in detail motional narrowing, the interplay between
orbital and valley excitation and relaxation in presence of $g$-factors that
depend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from
spin-hotspots. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9 \% is feasible in
Si/SiGe at a speed of $\sim$10 m/s, if the average valley splitting and its
inhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic
field $\approx 20$ mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting is
favourable for reaching high fidelities of transfer.

utility-based choice models (RUMs), where the goal is to identify the best item
from a given pool of $n$ items through online subsetwise preference feedback.
We investigate whether models with a simple correlation structure, e.g. low
rank, can result in faster learning rates. While we show that the problem can
be impossible to solve for the general `low rank' choice models, faster
learning rates can be attained assuming more structured item correlations. In
particular, we introduce a new class of \emph{Block-Rank} based RUM model,
where the best item is shown to be $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC learnable with only
$O(r \epsilon^{-2} \log(n/\delta))$ samples. This improves on the standard
sample complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-2} \log(1/\delta))$ known for
the usual learning algorithms which might not exploit the item-correlations ($r
\ll n$). We complement the above sample complexity with a matching lower bound
(up to logarithmic factors), justifying the tightness of our analysis.
Surprisingly, we also show a lower bound of
$\Omega(n\epsilon^{-2}\log(1/\delta))$ when the learner is forced to play just
duels instead of larger subsetwise queries. Further, we extend the results to a
more general `\emph{noisy Block-Rank}' model, which ensures robustness of our
techniques. Overall, our results justify the advantage of playing subsetwise
queries over pairwise preferences $(k=2)$, we show the latter provably fails to
exploit correlation.

counterfactual inputs that generally lie off-manifold. This makes them hard to
evaluate and easy to manipulate.
  We propose a setup to directly train characteristic functions in the form of
neural networks to play simple two-player games. We apply this to the game of
Connect Four by randomly hiding colour information from our agents during
training. This has three advantages for comparing XAI-methods: It alleviates
the ambiguity about how to realise partial input, makes off-manifold evaluation
unnecessary and allows us to compare the methods by letting them play against

$^{253}$Rf: the ground state and a low-lying isomeric state, most likely
involving the same neutron single-particle configurations as in the lighter
isotone $^{251}$No. The ratio of fission half-lives measured in $^{253}$Rf was
used to predict the fission properties of the 1/2$^{+}$ isomeric state in
$^{251}$No and draw conclusions as to the stability against fission of even
lighter Rf systems. This paper focusses again on the fission properties of
$^{253}$Rf and their impact on the stability of other neutron deficient
isotopes, using new and improved data collected from two experiments performed
at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia. Two fission
activities with half-lives of 52.8(4.4)$~\mu$s and 9.9(1.2) ms were measured in
the case of $^{253}$Rf, confirming the results of J. Kkuyagbaatar et al. A
third state, at much higher excitation energy, was also observed through the
detection of its electromagnetic decay to the 52.8$~\mu$s state. This
observation leads to the opposite quantum-configuration assignments for the
fissioning states as compared to the ones established by J. Khuyagbaatar et
al., namely that the higher-spin state has the shortest fission half-life. This
inversion of the ratio of fission hindrances between the low and high-spin
states is corroborated in the isotone $^{251}$No by the non observation of any
substantial fission branch from the low-spin isomer.

star association Cyg OB2. Despite its bright infrared magnitude (K$_{s}$=5.82)
it has remained largely ignored because of its dim optical magnitude (B=16.63,
V=13.68). In a previous paper we classified it as a highly reddened,
potentially extremely luminous, early B-type supergiant. We obtained its
spectrum in the U, B and R spectral bands during commissioning observations
with the instrument MEGARA@GTC. It displays a particularly strong H$\alpha$
emission for its spectral type, B1 Ia. The star seems to be in an intermediate
phase between super- and hypergiant, a group that it will probably join in the
near (astronomical) future. We observe a radial velocity difference between
individual observations and determine the stellar parameters, obtaining
T$_{eff}$ = 24000 K, logg$_{c}$= 2.88 $\pm$ 0.15. The rotational velocity found
is large for a B-supergiant, vsini= 110 $\pm$ 25 km s$^{-1}$. The abundance
pattern is consistent with solar, with a mild C underabundance (based on a
single line). Assuming that J20395358+4222505 is at the distance of Cyg OB2 we
derive the radius from infrared photometry, finding R= 41.2 $\pm$ 4.0
R$_{\odot}$, log(L/L$_{\odot}$)= 5.71 $\pm$ 0.04 and a spectroscopic mass of
46.5 $\pm$ 15.0 M$_{\odot}$. The clumped mass-loss rate (clumping factor 10) is
very high for the spectral type, $\dot{M}$ = 2.4x10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$
a$^{-1}$. The high rotational velocity and mass-loss rate place the star at the
hot side of the bi-stability jump. Together with the nearly solar CNO abundance
pattern, they may also point to evolution in a binary system, J20395358+4222505
being the initial secondary.

sequential data such as time-series or video. Interpretability is defined as
the ability to be understood by a person and is different from explainability,
which is the ability to be explained in a mathematical formulation. A key
interpretability issue with RNNs is that it is not clear how each hidden state
per time step contributes to the decision-making process in a quantitative
manner. We propose NeuroView-RNN as a family of new RNN architectures that
explains how all the time steps are used for the decision-making process. Each
member of the family is derived from a standard RNN architecture by
concatenation of the hidden steps into a global linear classifier. The global
linear classifier has all the hidden states as the input, so the weights of the
classifier have a linear mapping to the hidden states. Hence, from the weights,
NeuroView-RNN can quantify how important each time step is to a particular
decision. As a bonus, NeuroView-RNN also offers higher accuracy in many cases
compared to the RNNs and their variants. We showcase the benefits of
NeuroView-RNN by evaluating on a multitude of diverse time-series datasets.

voice-based services. However, it also raises privacy risks as speech contains
a wealth of personal data. Speaker anonymization aims to remove speaker
information from a speech utterance while leaving its linguistic and prosodic
attributes intact. State-of-the-art techniques operate by disentangling the
speaker information (represented via a speaker embedding) from these attributes
and re-synthesizing speech based on the speaker embedding of another speaker.
Prior research in the privacy community has shown that anonymization often
provides brittle privacy protection, even less so any provable guarantee. In
this work, we show that disentanglement is indeed not perfect: linguistic and
prosodic attributes still contain speaker information. We remove speaker
information from these attributes by introducing differentially private feature
extractors based on an autoencoder and an automatic speech recognizer,
respectively, trained using noise layers. We plug these extractors in the
state-of-the-art anonymization pipeline and generate, for the first time,
private speech utterances with a provable upper bound on the speaker
information they contain. We evaluate empirically the privacy and utility
resulting from our differentially private speaker anonymization approach on the
LibriSpeech data set. Experimental results show that the generated utterances
retain very high utility for automatic speech recognition training and
inference, while being much better protected against strong adversaries who
leverage the full knowledge of the anonymization process to try to infer the
speaker identity.

perpetrators submitting synthetically engineered DNA samples that contain

by the software trojan malware to activate and trigger a remote connection.
This approach can open up to multiple perpetrators to create connections to
hijack the DNA sequencing pipeline. As a way of hiding the data, the
perpetrators can avoid detection by encoding the address to maximise similarity
with genuine DNAs, which we showed previously. However, in this paper we show
how Deep Learning can be used to successfully detect and identify the trigger
encoded data, in order to protect a DNA sequencing pipeline from trojan

designing and synthesizing encoded DNA for such Trojan payloads is validated by

tweaking the learned mapping $G(\cdot)$ s.t. $\| {\bf x} - G({\bf z})

together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble, the FluSight Network
ensemble. Uniting theoretical results from the forecasting literature with
domain-specific forecasts from influenza outbreaks, we applied parametric
forecast combination methods that simultaneously optimize individual model
weights and calibrate the ensemble via a beta transformation. We used the
beta-transformed linear pool and the finite beta mixture model to produce
ensemble forecasts retrospectively for the 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 influenza

shown to outperform those from the equally weighted linear pool and the linear

from shapes of galaxies, open up a window to directly access 2-scalar, 2-vector

the standard density field that is traced by distribution of galaxies. Here we
develop an estimator of the multipole moments of power spectra for the
three-dimensional tensor field, taking into account the projection onto plane
perpendicular to the line-of-sight direction. To do this, we find that a
convenient representation of the power spectrum multipoles can be obtained by
the use of the associated Legendre polynomials in the form which allows for the
fast Fourier transform estimations under the local plane-parallel (LPP)
approximation. The formulation also allows us to obtain the Hankel transforms
to connect the two-point statistics in Fourier and configuration space, which
are needed to derive theoretical templates of the power spectrum including
convolution of a survey window. To validate our estimators, we use the
simulation data of the projected tidal field assuming a survey window that
mimics the BOSS-like survey footprint. We show that the LPP estimators fairly
well recover the multipole moments that are inferred from the global
plane-parallel approximation. We find that the survey window causes a more
significant change in the multipole moments of projected tensor power spectrum
at $k\lesssim 0.1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ from the input power spectrum, than in the
density power spectrum. Nevertheless, our method to compute the theory template

of deep learning models with a modular architecture constructed of multiple
subnetworks. As complex networks with multiple subnetworks become more
frequently applied in machine learning, hyperparameter optimization methods are
required to efficiently optimize their hyperparameters. Existing hyperparameter
searches are general, and can be used to optimize such networks, however, by
exploiting the multi-subnetwork architecture, these searches can be sped up
substantially. The proposed methods offer faster convergence to a
better-performing final model. To demonstrate this, we propose 2 independent
approaches to enhance these prior algorithms: 1) a divide-and-conquer approach,
in which the best subnetworks of top-performing models are combined, allowing
for more rapid sampling of the hyperparameter search space. 2) A subnetwork
adaptive approach that distributes computational resources based on the
importance of each subnetwork, allowing more intelligent resource allocation.
These approaches can be flexibily applied to many hyperparameter optimization
algorithms. To illustrate this, we combine our approaches with the
commonly-used Bayesian optimization method. Our approaches are then tested
against both synthetic examples and real-world examples and applied to multiple
network types including convolutional neural networks and dense feed forward
neural networks. Our approaches show an increased optimization efficiency of up
to 23.62x, and a final performance boost of up to 3.5% accuracy for
classification and 4.4 MSE for regression, when compared to comparable BO

training data and explain model behavior. Existing techniques to do so are
based on the flow of training data influence through the model parameters. For
large models in NLP applications, it is often computationally infeasible to
study this flow through all model parameters, therefore techniques usually pick
the last layer of weights. However, we observe that since the activation
connected to the last layer of weights contains ""shared logic"", the data
influenced calculated via the last layer weights prone to a ``cancellation
effect'', where the data influence of different examples have large magnitude
that contradicts each other. The cancellation effect lowers the discriminative
power of the influence score, and deleting influential examples according to
this measure often does not change the model's behavior by much. To mitigate
this, we propose a technique called TracIn-WE that modifies a method called
TracIn to operate on the word embedding layer instead of the last layer, where
the cancellation effect is less severe. One potential concern is that influence
based on the word embedding layer may not encode sufficient high level
information. However, we find that gradients (unlike embeddings) do not suffer
from this, possibly because they chain through higher layers. We show that
TracIn-WE significantly outperforms other data influence methods applied on the
last layer significantly on the case deletion evaluation on three language
classification tasks for different models. In addition, TracIn-WE can produce
scores not just at the level of the overall training input, but also at the
level of words within the training input, a further aid in debugging.

scale. For that reason, an automated assistant system for image editing is
desirable. Additionally, users want more image sources for diverse image
editing works, and integrating an image search functionality into the editing

automated Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing (CAISE). To our
knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides conversational image search
and editing annotations, where the agent holds a grounded conversation with
users and helps them to search and edit images according to their requests. To
build such a system, we first collect image search and editing conversations
between pairs of annotators. The assistant-annotators are equipped with a
customized image search and editing tool to address the requests from the
user-annotators. The functions that the assistant-annotators conduct with the
tool are recorded as executable commands, allowing the trained system to be
useful for real-world application execution. We also introduce a

peculiar ever observed, in particular due to its extremely high CO/H2O and
N2+/H2O ratios}, and unusual trace volatile abundances. However, the complex
shape of its CO emission lines, as well as uncertainties in the coma structure
and excitation, has lead to ambiguities in the total CO production rate. We
performed high resolution, spatially, spectrally and temporally resolved CO
observations using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and Submillimeter
Array (SMA) to elucidate the outgassing behaviour of C/2016 R2. Results are
analyzed using a new, time-dependent, three dimensional radiative transfer code
(SUBLIME), incorporating for the first time, accurate state-to-state
collisional rate coefficients for the CO--CO system. The total CO production
rate was found to be in the range $(3.8-7.6)\times10^{28}$ s$^{-1}$ between
2018-01-13 and 2018-02-01, with a mean value of $(5.3\pm0.6)\times10^{28}$
s$^{-1}$ at r_H = 2.8-2.9 au. The emission is concentrated in a near-sunward
jet, with an outflow velocity $0.51\pm0.01$ km/s, compared to $0.25\pm0.01$
km/s in the ambient (and night-side) coma. Evidence was also found for an
extended source of CO emission, possibly due to icy grain sublimation around
$1.2\times10^5$ km from the nucleus. Based on the coma molecular abundances, we
propose that the nucleus ices of C/2016 R2 can be divided into a rapidly
sublimating apolar phase, rich in CO, CO2, N2 and CH3OH, and a predominantly
frozen (or less abundant), polar phase containing more H2O, CH4, H2CO and HCN.

  Semi-Decentralized Framework with Collaborative Relaying",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intermittent connectivity of clients to the parameter server (PS) is a major
bottleneck in federated edge learning frameworks. The lack of constant
connectivity induces a large generalization gap, especially when the local data
distribution amongst clients exhibits heterogeneity. To overcome intermittent
communication outages between clients and the central PS, we introduce the
concept of collaborative relaying wherein the participating clients relay their
neighbors' local updates to the PS in order to boost the participation of
clients with poor connectivity to the PS. We propose a semi-decentralized
federated learning framework in which at every communication round, each client
initially computes a local consensus of a subset of its neighboring clients'
updates, and eventually transmits to the PS a weighted average of its own
update and those of its neighbors'. We appropriately optimize these local
consensus weights to ensure that the global update at the PS is unbiased with
minimal variance - consequently improving the convergence rate. Numerical
evaluations on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our collaborative relaying
approach outperforms federated averaging-based benchmarks for learning over
intermittently-connected networks such as when the clients communicate over
millimeter wave channels with intermittent blockages.

materials usually suffer from large dark currents and slow response, which
means increased power consumption and reduced performance. Here we report a
systematic study of the optoelectronic properties of well-characterized
rhombohedral ZnIn2S4 (R-ZIS) nanosheets which exhibit an extremely low dark
current (7 pA at 5 V bias). The superior performance represented by a series of
parameters surpasses most 2D counterparts. The ultrahigh specific detectivity
(1.8 x 10^14 Jones), comparably short response time ({\tau}_rise = 222 {\mu}s,
{\tau}_decay = 158 {\mu}s) and compatibility with high-frequency operation
(1000 Hz) are particularly prominent. Moreover, a gate-tunable characteristic
is observed, which is attributed to photogating and improves the photoresponse
by two orders of magnitude. Gating technique can effectively modulate the
photocurrent-generation mechanism from photoconductive effect to dominant
photogating. The combination of ultrahigh sensitivity, ultrafast response and
high gate tunability makes the R-ZIS phototransistor an ideal device for
low-energy-consumption and high-frequency optoelectronic applications, which is
further demonstrated by its excellent performance in optical neural networks
and promising potential in optical deep learning and computing.

the small scale value $H_0^R$, obtained from low redshift supernovae (SNe). The
value of the absolute magnitude $M^{Hom}$ used as prior in analyzing
observational data is obtained from low-redshift SNe, assuming a homogeneous
Universe, but the distance of the anchors used to calibrate the SNe to obtain
$M$ would be affected by a local inhomogeneity, making it inconsistent to test
the Copernican principle using $M^{Hom}$, since $M$ estimation itself is
affected by local inhomogeneities.
  We perform an analysis of the luminosity distance of low redshift SNe, using
different values of $M$, $\{M^P,M^R\}$, corresponding to different values of
$H_0$, $\{H_0^P,H_0^R\}$, obtained from the model independent consistency
relation between $H_0$ and $M$ which can be derived from the definition of the

finding no significant statistical evidence of a local inhomogeneity using the

$\{M^P,H_0^P\}$ we find evidence of a small local void, which causes an
overestimation of $M^R$ with respect to $M^P$.
  An inhomogeneous model with the parameters $\{M^P,H_0^P\}$ fits the data
better than a homogeneous model with $\{M^R,H_0^R\}$, resolving the apparent
$H_0$ tension. Using $\{M^P,H_0^P\}$, we obtain evidence of a local
inhomogeneity with a density contrast $-0.140 \pm 0.042 $, extending up to a

In
order to suppress or eliminate discrimination in prediction, various notions as
well as approaches have been proposed to impose fairness. Given a notion of
fairness, an essential problem is then whether or not it can always be
attained, even if with an unlimited amount of data. This issue is, however, not
well addressed yet. In this paper, focusing on the Equalized Odds notion of
fairness, we consider the attainability of this criterion and, furthermore, if
it is attainable, the optimality of the prediction performance under various
settings. In particular, for prediction performed by a deterministic function
of input features, we give conditions under which Equalized Odds can hold true;
if the stochastic prediction is acceptable, we show that under mild
assumptions, fair predictors can always be derived. For classification, we
further prove that compared to enforcing fairness by post-processing, one can
always benefit from exploiting all available features during training and get
potentially better prediction performance while remaining fair. Moreover, while
stochastic prediction can attain Equalized Odds with theoretical guarantees, we
also discuss its limitation and potential negative social impacts.

representing scenes due to their strong 3D prior. However, most NeRF approaches
are trained on a single scene, representing the whole scene with a global
model, making generalization to novel scenes, containing different numbers of
objects, challenging. Instead, we present a compositional, object-centric
auto-encoder framework that maps multiple views of the scene to a set of latent
vectors representing each object separately. The latent vectors parameterize
individual NeRFs from which the scene can be reconstructed. Based on those
latent vectors, we train a graph neural network dynamics model in the latent
space to achieve compositionality for dynamics prediction. A key feature of our
approach is that the latent vectors are forced to encode 3D information through
the NeRF decoder, which enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning
the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable compared to
several baselines. Simulated and real world experiments show that our method
can model and learn the dynamics of compositional scenes including rigid and

Thomass\'e and Watrigant [J. ACM 2022] defined the twin-width of a graph $G$ to
be the minimum integer $k$ such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in
which every red graph has maximum degree at most $k$. For any graph parameter
$f$, we define the reduced $f$ of a graph $G$ to be the minimum integer $k$
such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in which every red graph has $f$
at most $k$. Our focus is on graph classes with bounded reduced bandwidth,
which implies and is stronger than bounded twin-width (reduced maximum degree).
We show that every proper minor-closed class has bounded reduced bandwidth,
which is qualitatively stronger than an analogous result of Bonnet et al.\ for
bounded twin-width. In many instances, we also make quantitative improvements.
For example, all previous upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs were
at least $2^{1000}$. We show that planar graphs have reduced bandwidth at most
$466$ and twin-width at most $583$. Our bounds for graphs of Euler genus
$\gamma$ are $O(\gamma)$. Lastly, we show that fixed powers of graphs in a
proper minor-closed class have bounded reduced bandwidth (irrespective of the
degree of the vertices). In particular, we show that map graphs of Euler genus
$\gamma$ have reduced bandwidth $O(\gamma^4)$. Lastly, we separate twin-width
and reduced bandwidth by showing that any infinite class of expanders excluding
a fixed complete bipartite subgraph has unbounded reduced bandwidth, while
there are bounded-degree expanders with twin-width at most 6.

debated, is the authenticity of the 'Double Heroides', placed by those who

domain of computational stylometry to consider the poetics and the
lexico-grammatical features of these elegiac poems in the broader context of a
corpus of 'shorter' (from 20 to 546 lines) elegiac works from five authors (266
poems in all) comprising more or less all of the non-fragmentary classical

that the poetic style of the Heroides is Ovidian, but distinctive; they can be
accurately isolated from Ovid more broadly. The Single and Double Heroides
split into two clear groups, with the ES grouped consistently with the single
letters. Furthermore, by comparing the style of the letters with the 'early'
(although there are complications in this label) works of the Amores and the
late works of the Ex Ponto, the evidence supports sequential composition --
meaning that the ES is correctly placed -- and, further, supports the growing

edge server does not pre-install the program required to perform user offloaded
computing tasks. A partial program offloading (PPO) scheme is proposed, which
can divide a user program into two parts, where the first part is executed by
the user itself and the second part is transferred to an edge server for remote
execution. However, the execution of the latter part requires the results of
the previous part (called intermediate result) as the input. We aim to minimize
the overall time consumption of a multi-server MEC system to complete all user
offloaded tasks. It is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
problem which considers user-and-server association, program partitioning, and
communication resource allocation in a joint manner. An effective algorithm is
developed to solve the problem by exploiting its structural features. First,
the task completion time of a single server is minimized given the computing
workload and available resource. Then, the working time of the edge servers are
balanced by updating user-and-server association and communication resource
allocation. Numerical results show that significant performance improvement can
be achieved by the proposed scheme.

  Cloud","27 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At present, the anchor-based or anchor-free models that use LiDAR point
clouds for 3D object detection use the center assigner strategy to infer the 3D
bounding boxes. However, in a real world scene, the LiDAR can only acquire a
limited object surface point clouds, but the center point of the object does
not exist. Obtaining the object by aggregating the incomplete surface point
clouds will bring a loss of accuracy in direction and dimension estimation. To
address this problem, we propose a corner-guided anchor-free single-stage 3D
object detection model (CG-SSD ).Firstly, 3D sparse convolution backbone
network composed of residual layers and sub-manifold sparse convolutional
layers are used to construct bird's eye view (BEV) features for further deeper
feature mining by a lite U-shaped network; Secondly, a novel corner-guided
auxiliary module (CGAM) is proposed to incorporate corner supervision signals
into the neural network. CGAM is explicitly designed and trained to detect
partially visible and invisible corners to obtains a more accurate object
feature representation, especially for small or partial occluded objects;
Finally, the deep features from both the backbone networks and CGAM module are
concatenated and fed into the head module to predict the classification and 3D
bounding boxes of the objects in the scene. The experiments demonstrate CG-SSD
achieves the state-of-art performance on the ONCE benchmark for supervised 3D
object detection using single frame point cloud data, with 62.77%mAP.
Additionally, the experiments on ONCE and Waymo Open Dataset show that CGAM can
be extended to most anchor-based models which use the BEV feature to detect
objects, as a plug-in and bring +1.17%-+14.27%AP improvement.

curve by using the Druyvesteyn equation. We propose to include two new
parameters, $q$ and $r$, to the usual plasma parameters: plasma potential
($V_p$), floating potential ($V_f$), electron density ($n$), and electron
temperature ($T$). These new parameters can be particularly useful to represent
non-Maxwellian distributions. The procedure is based on the fit of the I-V
Langmuir curve with the $q$-Weibull distribution function, and is motivated by
recent works which use the $q$-exponential distribution function derived from
Tsallis statistics. We obtain the usual plasma parameters employing three
techniques: the numerical differentiation using Savitzky Golay (SG) filters,
the $q$-exponential distribution function, and the $q$-Weibull distribution
function. We explain the limitations of the $q$-exponential function, where the
experimental data $V>V_p$ needs to be trimmed beforehand, and this results in a
lower accuracy compared to the numerical differentiation with SG. To overcome
this difficulty, the $q$-Weibull function is introduced as a natural
generalization to the $q$-exponential distribution, and it has greater
flexibility in order to represent the concavity change around $V_p$. We apply
this procedure to analyze the measurements corresponding to a nitrogen $N_2$
cold plasma obtained by using a single Langmuir probe located at different
heights from the cathode. We show that the $q$ parameter has a very stable
numerical value with the height. This work may contribute to clarify some
advantages and limitations of the use of non-extensive statistics in plasma
diagnostics, but the physical interpretation of the non-extensive parameters in
plasma physics remains not fully clarified, and requires further research.

labour and budget for feedback adjustments. In this paper, we aim to forecast
key performance indicators for new campaigns given any certain criteria.
Interpretable and accurate results could enable advertisers to manage and
optimize their campaign criteria. There are several challenges for this very
task. First, platforms usually offer advertisers various criteria when they
plan an advertising campaign, it is difficult to estimate campaign performance
unifiedly because of the great difference among bidding types. Furthermore,
complex strategies applied in bidding system bring great fluctuation on
campaign performance, making estimation accuracy an extremely tough problem. To
address above challenges, we propose a novel Campaign Performance Forecasting
framework, which firstly reproduces campaign performance on historical logs
under various bidding types with a unified replay algorithm, in which essential
auction processes like match and rank are replayed, ensuring the
interpretability on forecast results. Then, we innovatively introduce a
multi-task learning method to calibrate the deviation of estimation brought by
hard-to-reproduce bidding strategies in replay. The method captures mixture
calibration patterns among related forecast indicators to map the estimated
results to the true ones, improving both accuracy and efficiency significantly.
Experiment results on a dataset from Taobao.com demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms other baselines by a large margin, and an

differences to distinguish similar materials, thereby providing unique
advantage for anomaly detection. Hence fine spectra of anomalous pixels can be
effectively screened out from heterogeneous background pixels. Since the same
materials have similar characteristics in spatial and spectral dimension,
detection performance can be significantly enhanced by jointing spatial and
spectral information. In this paper, a spectralspatial fusion anomaly detection
(SSFAD) method is proposed for hyperspectral imagery. First, original spectral
signals are mapped to a local linear background space composed of median and
mean with high confidence, where saliency weight and feature enhancement
strategies are implemented to obtain an initial detection map in spectral
domain. Futhermore, to make full use of similarity information of local
background around testing pixel, a new detector is designed to extract the
local similarity spatial features of patch images in spatial domain. Finally,
anomalies are detected by adaptively combining the spectral and spatial
detection maps. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
has superior detection performance than traditional methods.

intended to be remembered, mainly due to survival and personal relevance.
However, all these faces do not have the equal opportunity to stick in our
minds. It has been shown that memorability is an intrinsic feature of an image
but yet, it is largely unknown what attributes make an image more memorable. In
this work, we aimed to address this question by proposing a fast approach to
modify and control the memorability of face images. In our proposed method, we
first found a hyperplane in the latent space of StyleGAN to separate high and
low memorable images. We then modified the image memorability (while
maintaining the identity and other facial features such as age, emotion, etc.)
by moving in the positive or negative direction of this hyperplane normal
vector. We further analyzed how different layers of the StyleGAN augmented
latent space contribute to face memorability. These analyses showed how each
individual face attribute makes an image more or less memorable. Most
importantly, we evaluated our proposed method for both real and synthesized
face images. The proposed method successfully modifies and controls the
memorability of real human faces as well as unreal synthesized faces. Our
proposed method can be employed in photograph editing applications for social

tremendous research interest because many topological semimetals are excellent
thermoelectric materials and thermoelectricity serves as one of their most
important potential applications. In this work, we reveal the transient
photothermoelectric response of Dirac semimetallic Cd3As2, namely the
photo-Seebeck effect and photo-Nernst effect, by studying the terahertz (THz)
emission from the transient photocurrent induced by these effects. Our
excitation polarization and power dependence confirm that the observed THz
emission is due to photothermoelectric effect instead of other nonlinear
optical effect. Furthermore, when a weak magnetic field (~0.4 T) is applied,
the response clearly indicates an order of magnitude enhancement on transient
photothermoelectric current generation compared to the photo-Seebeck effect.
Such enhancement supports an ambipolar transport nature of the photo-Nernst
current generation in Cd3As2. These results highlight the enhancement of
thermoelectric performance can be achieved in topological Dirac semimetals
based on the Nernst effect, and our transient studies pave the way for
thermoelectric devices applicable for high field circumstance when
nonequilibrium state matters. The large THz emission due to highly efficient
photothermoelectric conversion is comparable to conventional semiconductors
through optical rectification and photo-Dember effect.

for robotic grasp detection. The developed TF-Grasp framework has two elaborate
designs making it well suitable for visual grasping tasks. The first key design
is that we adopt the local window attention to capture local contextual
information and detailed features of graspable objects. Then, we apply the
cross window attention to model the long-term dependencies between distant
pixels. Object knowledge, environmental configuration, and relationships
between different visual entities are aggregated for subsequent grasp
detection. The second key design is that we build a hierarchical
encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections, delivering shallow features
from encoder to decoder to enable a multi-scale feature fusion. Due to the
powerful attention mechanism, the TF-Grasp can simultaneously obtain the local
information (i.e., the contours of objects), and model long-term connections
such as the relationships between distinct visual concepts in clutter.
Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the TF-Grasp achieves
superior results versus state-of-art grasping convolutional models and attain a
higher accuracy of 97.99% and 94.6% on Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets,

problematize previous claims of IG uniqueness. We show that with the
introduction of an additional axiom, \textit{non-decreasing positivity}, the

analogous properties for methods with probability distribution baselines. 4) We
introduce a computationally efficient method of identifying internal neurons

possible choices for such value functions, which broadly fall into two
categories: on-manifold and off-manifold value functions, which take an
observational and an interventional viewpoint respectively. Both these classes
however have their respective flaws, where on-manifold value functions violate
key axiomatic properties and are computationally expensive, while off-manifold
value functions pay less heed to the data manifold and evaluate the model on
regions for which it wasn't trained. Thus, there is no consensus on which class
of value functions to use. In this paper, we show that in addition to these
existing issues, both classes of value functions are prone to adversarial
manipulations on low density regions. We formalize the desiderata of value
functions that respect both the model and the data manifold in a set of axioms
and are robust to perturbation on off-manifold regions, and show that there
exists a unique value function that satisfies these axioms, which we term the
Joint Baseline value function, and the resulting Shapley value the Joint
Baseline Shapley (JBshap), and validate the effectiveness of JBshap in

framework for ViTs without training, which automatically discovers and scales
up ViTs in an efficient and principled manner. Specifically, we first design a

a series of architectures with different numbers of parameters in a single run.
Finally, based on the observation that ViTs can tolerate coarse tokenization in
early training stages, we propose a progressive tokenization strategy to train
ViTs faster and cheaper. As a unified framework, As-ViT achieves strong
performance on classification (83.5% top1 on ImageNet-1k) and detection (52.7%

fractions are roughly independent of redshift and stellar mass up to

field. Large-scale structures in the universe emerge and grow like cosmic
rhizomes as the underlying matter density fluctuations grow and form
associations of galaxies in rare overdense regions and the realm of the
galactic world is stretched into relatively lower-density regions along
evolving filaments. The cosmic web of galaxies forms at lower redshifts when
most rhizomes globally percolate. The primordial angular momentum produced by
the induced tidal torques on protogalactic regions is correlated with the

paper instead revisits an older approach to word segmentation: bottom-up
phone-like unit discovery is performed first, and symbolic word segmentation is
then performed on top of the discovered units (without influencing the lower
level). To do this, I propose a new unit discovery model, a new symbolic word
segmentation model, and then chain the two models to segment speech. Both
models use dynamic programming to minimize segment costs from a self-supervised
network with an additional duration penalty that encourages longer units.
Concretely, for acoustic unit discovery, duration-penalized dynamic programming
(DPDP) is used with a contrastive predictive coding model as the scoring
network. For word segmentation, DPDP is applied with an autoencoding recurrent
neural as the scoring network. The two models are chained in order to segment
speech. This approach gives comparable word segmentation results to
state-of-the-art joint self-supervised segmentation models on an English

payoffs that not only depend on the strategies used in the group but also
fluctuate at random over time. An individual can adopt either cooperation or
defection as strategy and the population is updated from one-time step to the
next by a birth-death event according to a Moran model. Assuming recurrent
symmetric mutation and payoffs with expected values, variances, and covariances
of the same small order, we derive a first-order approximation of the average
abundance of cooperation in the selection-mutation equilibrium. We show that
increasing the variance of any payoff for defection or decreasing the variance
of any payoff for cooperation increases the average abundance of cooperation.
As for the effect of the covariance between any payoff for cooperation and any
payoff for defection, we show that it depends on the number of cooperators in
the group associated with these payoffs. We study in particular the public
goods game, the stag hunt game, and the snowdrift game, all social dilemmas
based on random benefit $b$ and cost $c$ for cooperation. We show that a
decrease in the scaled variance of $b$ or $c$, or an increase in their scaled
covariance, makes it easier for weak selection to favor the abundance of
cooperation in the stag hunt game and the snowdrift game. The same conclusion
holds for the public goods game except that the covariance of $b$ has no effect
on the average abundance of $C$. On the other hand, increasing the scaled
mutation rate or the group size can enhance or lessen the condition for weak
selection to favor the abundance of $C$.

Explore-Bench is extremely useful as, recently, deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) has been widely used for robot exploration tasks and achieved promising
results. However, training DRL-based approaches requires large data sets, and
additionally, current benchmarks rely on realistic simulators with a slow
simulation speed, which is not appropriate for training exploration strategies.
Hence, to support efficient DRL training and comprehensive evaluation, the
suggested Explore-Bench designs a 3-level platform with a unified data flow and
$12 \times$ speed-up that includes a grid-based simulator for fast evaluation
and efficient training, a realistic Gazebo simulator, and a remotely accessible
robot testbed for high-accuracy tests in physical environments. The
practicality of the proposed benchmark is highlighted with the application of

unobserved obstacles, moving vehicles, and extreme weather. Animal groups such
as bee colonies initiate collective emergency reaction behaviors such as
bypassing obstacles and avoiding predators, similar to muscle-conditioned
reflex which organizes local muscles to avoid hazards in the first response
without delaying passage through the brain. Inspired by this, we develop a
similar collective conditioned reflex mechanism for multi-robot systems to
respond to emergencies. In this study, Collective Conditioned Reflex (CCR), a
bio-inspired emergency reaction mechanism, is developed based on animal
collective behavior analysis and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The
algorithm uses a physical model to determine if the robots are experiencing an
emergency; then, rewards for robots involved in the emergency are augmented
with corresponding heuristic rewards, which evaluate emergency magnitudes and
consequences and decide local robots' participation. CCR is validated on three
typical emergency scenarios: \textit{turbulence, strong wind, and hidden

undergo background heating, disc truncation-driven by stellar encounter, and
photo-evaporation. Disc truncation leads to reduced characteristic sizes and
disc masses that eventually halts gas giant planet formation. We investigate
how disc truncation impacts planet formation via pebble-based core accretion
paradigm, where pebble sizes were derived from the full grain-size distribution
within the disc lifetimes. We make the best-case assumption of one embryo and
one stellar encounter per disc. Using planet population syntheses techniques,
we find that disc truncation shifts the disc mass distributions to the lower
margins. This consequently lowered the gas giant occurrence rates. Despite the
reduced gas giant formation rates in clustered discs, the encounter models
mostly show as in the isolated field; the cold Jupiters are more frequent than
the hot Jupiters, consistent with observation. Moreover, the ratio of hot to
cold Jupiters depend on the periastron distribution of the perturbers with
linear distribution in periastron ratio showing enhanced hot to cold Jupiters
ratio in comparison to the remaining models. Our results are valid in the
best-case scenario corresponding to our assumptions of: only one disc encounter
with a perturber, ambient background heating and less rampant
photo-evaporation. It is not known exactly of how much gas giant planet
formation would be affected should disc encounter, background heating and
photo-evaporation act in a concert. Thus, our study will hopefully serve as
motivation for quantitative investigations of the detailed impact of stellar
cluster environments on planet formations.

addressing the memory bottleneck in energy-constrained applications. However,
the high integration density and reliability under process variations demand an
accurate estimation of extremely small failure probabilities. To capture such a
rare event in memory circuits, the time and storage overhead of conventional
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations cannot be tolerated. On the other hand, classic
analytical methods predicting failure probabilities from a physical expression
become inaccurate in the sub/near-threshold region due to the assumed
distribution or the oversimplified drain current model for nanoscale devices.
This work first proposes a simple but efficient drain current model to describe
the drain-induced barrier lowering effect at low voltages. Based on that, the
probability density functions of the interest metrics in SRAM are derived. Two
analytical models are then put forward to evaluate SRAM dynamic stabilities
including access and write-time failures. The proposed models can be extended
easily to different types of SRAM with different read/write assist circuits.
The models are validated against MC simulations across different operating
voltages and temperatures. The average relative errors at 0.5V VDD are only
8.8% and 10.4% for the access-time and write failure models respectively. The
size of required data samples is 43.6X smaller than that of the

individual, local sources, we include the diffuse flux emitted by the bulk of
non-local radio galaxies based on their radio luminosity distribution.
Analyzing the source parameters within a range around their expected
properties, we finally determine the configurations of local sources describing
well the UHECR spectrum, composition and large-scale anisotropies. We obtain a
good description of all data even in the case that we include only a small

in the atmosphere is severely ill-posed, hence, limits the achievable
reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the reconstruction has to be performed in
real-time at a few hundred to one thousand Hertz frame rates. Huge amounts of
data have to be processed and thousands of actuators of the deformable mirrors
have to be controlled by elaborated algorithms. Even with extensive
parallelization and pipelining, direct solvers, such as the Matrix Vector
Multiplication (MVM) method, are extremely demanding. Thus, research in the
last years shifted into the direction of iterative methods. In this paper we
focus on the iterative Finite Element Wavelet Hybrid Algorithm (FEWHA). The key
feature of FEWHA is a matrix-free representation of all operators involved,
which makes the algorithm fast and enables on the fly system updates whenever
parameters at the telescope or in the atmosphere change. We provide a
performance analysis of the method regarding quality and run-time for the MAORY

  Re-weighting","Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted
widespread research interest because of their event-driven and energy-efficient
characteristics. Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to
the non-differentiability of its activation function, which disables the
typically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural
networks (ANNs). Although the adoption of surrogate gradient (SG) formally
allows for the back-propagation of losses, the discrete spiking mechanism
actually differentiates the loss landscape of SNNs from that of ANNs, failing
the surrogate gradient methods to achieve comparable accuracy as for ANNs. In
this paper, we first analyze why the current direct training approach with
surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability. Then we
introduce the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the
loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process
can converge into flatter minima with better generalizability. Meanwhile, we
demonstrate that TET improves the temporal scalability of SNN and induces a
temporal inheritable training for acceleration. Our method consistently
outperforms the SOTA on all reported mainstream datasets, including
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Remarkably on DVS-CIFAR10, we obtained 83$\%$ top-1
accuracy, over 10$\%$ improvement compared to existing state of the art. Codes

insight into this issue, we measured the thermal Hall conductivity
$\kappa_{xy}$ of various samples grown by the Bridgman method. The results show
that the half-integer quantum thermal Hall effect is intimately related to the
magnitude of longitudinal thermal conductivity and the N\'{e}el temperature at
zero field, both of which are sample dependent. Samples exhibiting the
half-integer quantum thermal Hall effect have larger zero-field thermal
conductivity values than a threshold value, implying that a long mean free path
of heat carriers is an important prerequisite. In addition, we find that
samples with a higher N\'{e}el temperature exhibit a higher magnetic field at

quantization phenomenon is significantly affected by the impurity scatterings

novel domain disentangled generative adversarial network (DD-GAN) for zero-shot
sketch-based 3D retrieval, which can retrieve the unseen categories that are
not accessed during training. Specifically, we first generate domain-invariant
features and domain-specific features by disentangling the learned features of
sketches and 3D shapes, where the domain-invariant features are used to align
with the corresponding word embeddings. Then, we develop a generative
adversarial network that combines the domain-specific features of the seen

where the synthesized samples of the unseen categories are generated by using
the corresponding word embeddings. Finally, we use the synthesized samples of
the unseen categories combined with the real samples of the seen categories to
train the network for retrieval, so that the unseen categories can be
recognized. In order to reduce the domain shift problem, we utilized unlabeled
unseen samples to enhance the discrimination ability of the discriminator. With
the discriminator distinguishing the generated samples from the unlabeled
unseen samples, the generator can generate more realistic unseen samples.
Extensive experiments on the SHREC'13 and SHREC'14 datasets show that our

characterizing the simultaneous dependence of dark matter and gas clustering on
the scale and the density environment, and these are the environment-dependent
wavelet power spectrum (env-WPS), the environment-dependent bias function
(env-bias), and the environment-dependent wavelet cross-correlation function
(env-WCC). These statistics are applied to the dark matter and baryonic gas
density fields of the \texttt{TNG100-1} simulation at redshifts of
$z=3.0$-$0.0$, and to \texttt{Illustris-1} and \texttt{SIMBA} at $z=0$. The
measurements of the env-WPSs suggest that the clustering strengths of both the
dark matter and the gas increase with increasing density, while that of a
Gaussian field shows no density dependence. By measuring the env-bias and
env-WCC, we find that they vary significantly with the environment, scale, and
redshift. A noteworthy feature is that at $z=0.0$, the gas is less biased in
denser environments of $\Delta \gtrsim 10$ around $3 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, due
to the gas reaccretion caused by the decreased AGN feedback strength at lower
redshifts. We also find that the gas correlates more tightly with the dark
matter in both the most dense and underdense environments than in other
environments at all epochs. Even at $z=0$, the env-WCC is greater than $0.9$ in
$\Delta \gtrsim 200$ and $\Delta \lesssim 0.1$ at scales of $k \lesssim 10 \
h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In summary, our results support the local density
environment having a non-negligible impact on the deviations between dark
matter and gas distributions up to large scales.

through field-particle interaction in collisionless plasmas. However, the key
evidence for ion cyclotron resonance (i.e., the coherence between
electromagnetic fields and the ion phase space density) and the resulting
damping of ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) has not yet been directly observed.
Investigating the high-quality measurements of space plasmas by the
Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites, we find that both the wave
electromagnetic field vectors and the bulk velocity of the disturbed ion
velocity distribution rotate around the background magnetic field. Moreover, we
find that the absolute gyro-phase angle difference between the center of the
fluctuations in the ion velocity distribution functions and the wave electric
field vectors falls in the range of (0, 90) degrees, consistent with the
ongoing energy conversion from wave-fields to particles. By invoking plasma
kinetic theory, we demonstrate that the field-particle correlation for the
damping ion cyclotron waves in our theoretical model matches well with our
observations. Furthermore, the wave electric field vectors ($\delta
\mathbf{E'}_{\mathrm {wave,\perp}}$), the ion current density ($\delta
\mathbf{J}_\mathrm {i,\perp}$) and the energy transfer rate ($\delta
\mathbf{J}_\mathrm {i,\perp}\cdot \delta \mathbf{E'}_{\mathrm {wave,\perp}}$)
exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations, and the integrated work done by the
electromagnetic field on the ions are positive, indicates that ions are mainly
energized by the perpendicular component of the electric field via cyclotron
resonance. Therefore, our combined analysis of MMS observations and kinetic
theory provides direct, thorough, and comprehensive evidence for ICW damping in
space plasmas.

characterized by small-scale stochastic interior thermal perturbations, using a

poorly-measured modes by the $\mathit{WMAP}$ team. In the Cosmoglobe
processing, this pattern arises from temperature-to-polarization leakage from
the coupling between the CMB Solar dipole, transmission imbalance, and
sidelobes. No traces of this pattern are found in either the frequency map or

we proposed 1) a pyramid-global-guided (PGG) training strategy to supervise the
learning with pyramid image/patch-level pseudo labels, which are generated by
grouping the unsupervised features. The stable global and pyramid semantic
pseudo labels can prevent the segmentation from learning too many clutter
regions or degrading to one background region; 2) in addition, we proposed
context-aware embedding (CAE) module to generate global feature embedding in

Especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory nets

generalizes several important algorithmic problems such as perfect matching and

polynomial time algorithm for EM, which puts EM in $\textbf{RP}$. Given that to
decide whether or not $\textbf{RP}=\textbf{P}$ represents a big open challenge
in complexity theory, this makes it unlikely for EM to be

deterministic polynomial time algorithm. EM remains one of the few natural
combinatorial problems in $\textbf{RP}$ which are not known to be contained in

$\textbf{RP}=\textbf{P}$. Despite EM being quite well-known, attempts to devise

require contrasts up to 10^6-10^10 at angular separations of a few dozen
milliarcseconds. To achieve this goal, one of the most promising approaches
consists of using large segmented primary mirror telescopes with coronagraphic
instruments. However, coronagraphs are highly sensitive to wavefront errors.
The segmentation itself is responsible for phasing errors and segment
vibrations to be controlled at a subnanometric accuracy. We propose an
innovative method for a coronagraph design that allows a consequent relaxation
of the segment phasing constraints for low segment-count mirrors and generates
an instrument that is more robust to segment-level wavefront errors. It is
based on an optimization of the coronagraph that includes a segment-level
apodization. This is repeated over the pupil to match the segmentation
redundancy and improves the contrast stability beyond the minimum separation
set by the single-segment diffraction limit. We validate this method on a
GMT-like pupil for two coronagraph types: apodized pupil Lyot coronagraphs
(APLC) and apodizing phase plate coronagraphs (APP). For the APLC, redundant
apodization enables releasing the piston phasing constraints by a factor of 5
to 20 compared to classical designs. For the APP, the contrast remains almost
constant up to 1 radian RMS of the phasing errors. We also show that redundant
apodizations increase the robustness of the coronagraph to segment tip-tilt
errors, as well as to missing segments. This method cannot be applied to
higher-segment count mirrors such as the ELT or the TMT, but it is particularly
suitable for low segment-count mirrors (fewer than 20 segments) such as the GMT
aperture. These mirrors aim for high-contrast imaging of debris disks or
exoplanets down to 100 mas.

advances in recent, it still remains challenging due to complex interactions
with multiple humans and objects occurring in images, which would inevitably
lead to ambiguities. Most existing methods either generate all human-object
pair candidates and infer their relationships by cropped local features
successively in a two-stage manner, or directly predict interaction points in a
one-stage procedure. However, the lack of spatial configurations or reasoning
steps of two- or one- stage methods respectively limits their performance in
such complex scenes. To avoid this ambiguity, we propose a novel actor-centric
framework. The main ideas are that when inferring interactions: 1) the
non-local features of the entire image guided by actor position are obtained to
model the relationship between the actor and context, and then 2) we use an
object branch to generate pixel-wise interaction area prediction, where the
interaction area denotes the object central area. Moreover, we also use an
actor branch to get interaction prediction of the actor and propose a novel
composition strategy based on center-point indexing to generate the final HOI
prediction. Thanks to the usage of the non-local features and the
partly-coupled property of the human-objects composition strategy, our proposed
framework can detect HOI more accurately especially for complex images.
Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art on the challenging V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and is more

  operations on Clique Trees",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Exact inference in Bayesian networks is intractable and has an exponential
dependence on the size of the largest clique in the corresponding clique tree
(CT), necessitating approximations. Factor based methods to bound clique sizes
are more accurate than structure based methods, but expensive since they
involve inference of beliefs in a large number of candidate structure or region
graphs. We propose an alternative approach for approximate inference based on
an incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) paradigm, which converts the
Bayesian network into a data structure containing a sequence of linked clique
tree forests (SLCTF), with clique sizes bounded by a user-specified value. In
the incremental build stage of this approach, CTFs are constructed
incrementally by adding variables to the CTFs as long as clique sizes are
within the specified bound. Once the clique size constraint is reached, the CTs
in the CTF are calibrated in the infer stage of IBIA. The resulting clique
beliefs are used in the approximate phase to get an approximate CTF with
reduced clique sizes. The approximate CTF forms the starting point for the next
CTF in the sequence. These steps are repeated until all variables are added to
a CTF in the sequence. We prove that our algorithm for incremental construction
of clique trees always generates a valid CT and our approximation technique
preserves the joint beliefs of the variables within a clique. Based on this, we
show that the SLCTF data structure can be used for efficient approximate
inference of partition function and prior and posterior marginals. More than
500 benchmarks were used to test the method and the results show a significant
reduction in error when compared to other approximate methods, with competitive
runtimes.

non-risky insureds, actuarial fairness meaning that risky insureds should
contribute more and pay a higher premium than non-risky or less-risky ones.
Actuaries, therefore, use econometric or machine learning techniques to
classify, but the distinction between a fair actuarial classification and
""discrimination"" is subtle. For this reason, there is a growing interest about
fairness and discrimination in the actuarial community Lindholm, Richman,
Tsanakas, and Wuthrich (2022). Presumably, non-sensitive characteristics can
serve as substitutes or proxies for protected attributes. For example, the
color and model of a car, combined with the driver's occupation, may lead to an
undesirable gender bias in the prediction of car insurance prices.
Surprisingly, we will show that debiasing the predictor alone may be
insufficient to maintain adequate accuracy (1). Indeed, the traditional pricing
model is currently built in a two-stage structure that considers many
potentially biased components such as car or geographic risks. We will show
that this traditional structure has significant limitations in achieving
fairness. For this reason, we have developed a novel pricing model approach.
Recently some approaches have Blier-Wong, Cossette, Lamontagne, and Marceau
(2021); Wuthrich and Merz (2021) shown the value of autoencoders in pricing. In
this paper, we will show that (2) this can be generalized to multiple pricing
factors (geographic, car type), (3) it perfectly adapted for a fairness context
(since it allows to debias the set of pricing components): We extend this main
idea to a general framework in which a single whole pricing model is trained by
generating the geographic and car pricing components needed to predict the pure
premium while mitigating the unwanted bias according to the desired metric.

workflow was developed based on a CT-integrated linear accelerator. It
incorporates routine radiotherapy procedures from simulation, autosegmentation,
autoplanning, image guidance, beam delivery, and in vivo quality assurance (QA)
into one scheme, with critical decision points involved, while the patient is
on the treatment couch during the whole process. For the enrolled ten patients
with rectal cancer, minor modifications of the autosegmented target volumes
were required, and the Dice similarity coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance
before and after modifications were 0.892{\pm}0.061 and 18.2{\pm}13.0 mm,
respectively. The autosegmented normal tissues and automatic plans were
clinically acceptable without any modifications or reoptimization. The
pretreatment IGRT corrections were within 2 mm in all directions, and the
EPID-based in vivo QA showed a {\gamma} passing rate better than 97{\%}
(3{\%}/3 mm/10{\%} threshold). The duration of the whole process was
23.2{\pm}3.5 minutes, depending mostly on the time required for manual
modification and plan evaluation. The All-in-One workflow enables full
automation of the entire radiotherapy process by seamlessly integrating
multiple routine procedures. The one-stop solution shortens the time scale it
takes to ready the first treatment from days to minutes, significantly
improving the patient experience and the efficiency of the workflow, and shows
potential to facilitate the clinical application of online adaptive replanning.

approximations, we recover vertical convective flows and measure the velocity
of the rising plasma at different heights in the photosphere. In several cases,
we find this velocity to be constant with height, indicating the presence of
forces other than gravity acting on the plasma and counteracting it. In some
cases, these forces are sufficient to maintain plasma rising at 60\,\kms to
heights where this velocity is comparable to the escape velocity. Forces are
present in the photosphere of Betelgeuse that allow plasma to reach velocities
close to the escape velocity. These mechanisms may suffice to trigger mass loss

the context of algebraic set theory that similar constructions continue to
apply even in weaker metatheories. Unfortunately, sheafification seems not to
preserve an important realignment property enjoyed by the presheaf universes
that plays a critical role in models of univalent type theory as well as
synthetic Tait computability, a recent technique to establish syntactic
properties of type theories and programming languages. In the context of
multiple universes, the realignment property also implies a coherent choice of
codes for connectives at each universe level, thereby interpreting the
cumulativity laws present in popular formulations of Martin-L\""of type theory.
  We observe that a slight adjustment to an argument of Shulman constructs a
cumulative universe hierarchy satisfying the realignment property at every
level in any Grothendieck topos. Hence one has direct-style interpretations of
Martin-L\""of type theory with cumulative universes into all Grothendieck topoi.
A further implication is to extend the reach of recent synthetic methods in the
semantics of cubical type theory and the syntactic metatheory of type theory
and programming languages to all Grothendieck topoi.

interest in explainable predictive business process monitoring, which aims to
increase the interpretability of prediction models. Existing solutions focus on
giving factual explanations.While factual explanations can be helpful, humans
typically do not ask why a particular prediction was made, but rather why it
was made instead of another prediction, i.e., humans are interested in
counterfactual explanations. While research in explainable AI produced several
promising techniques to generate counterfactual explanations, directly applying
them to predictive process monitoring may deliver unrealistic explanations,
because they ignore the underlying process constraints. We propose LORELEY, a
counterfactual explanation technique for predictive process monitoring, which
extends LORE, a recent explainable AI technique. We impose control flow
constraints to the explanation generation process to ensure realistic
counterfactual explanations. Moreover, we extend LORE to enable explaining

average fidelity of 97.69\% and generate realistic counterfactual explanations.

advantage of being straightforward to build, unlike expert-built features.
Results show improvement when combining functional features with scalar

  Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated
Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving
technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs. One candidate is
scenario-based assessment, in which test cases are derived from real-world road
traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Because of the high variety of
the possible scenarios, using only observed scenarios for the assessment is not
sufficient. Therefore, methods for generating additional scenarios are
necessary.
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a method to determine the
parameters that describe the scenarios to a sufficient degree without relying
on strong assumptions on the parameters that characterize the scenarios. By
estimating the probability density function (pdf) of these parameters,
realistic parameter values can be generated. Second, we present the Scenario
Representativeness (SR) metric based on the Wasserstein distance, which
quantifies to what extent the scenarios with the generated parameter values are
representative of real-world scenarios while covering the actual variety found
in the real-world scenarios.
  A comparison of our proposed method with methods relying on assumptions of
the scenario parametrization and pdf estimation shows that the proposed method
can automatically determine the optimal scenario parametrization and pdf
estimation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our SR metric can be used to
choose the (number of) parameters that best describe a scenario. The presented
method is promising, because the parameterization and pdf estimation can
directly be applied to already available importance sampling strategies for
accelerating the evaluation of AVs.

analytically, showing -- as for the folded nodes -- that they are determined by
the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model
undergoes a (symmetric) saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced

  Control and Task Offloading in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the trajectory control and task offloading (TCTO) problem
in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing system,
where a UAV flies along a planned trajectory to collect computation tasks from
smart devices (SDs). We consider a scenario that SDs are not directly connected
by the base station (BS) and the UAV has two roles to play: MEC server or
wireless relay. The UAV makes task offloading decisions online, in which the
collected tasks can be executed locally on the UAV or offloaded to the BS for
remote processing. The TCTO problem involves multi-objective optimization as
its objectives are to minimize the task delay and the UAV's energy consumption,
and maximize the number of tasks collected by the UAV, simultaneously. This
problem is challenging because the three objectives conflict with each other.
The existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, either single-objective
RLs or single-policy multi-objective RLs, cannot well address the problem since
they cannot output multiple policies for various preferences (i.e. weights)
across objectives in a single run. This paper adapts the evolutionary
multi-objective RL (EMORL), a multi-policy multi-objective RL, to the TCTO
problem. This algorithm can output multiple optimal policies in just one run,
each optimizing a certain preference. The simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can obtain more excellent nondominated policies by
striking a balance between the three objectives regarding policy quality,
compared with two evolutionary and two multi-policy RL algorithms.

variability in their size, location, and surface largely affect identification,
localisation, and characterisation. Moreover, colonoscopic surveillance and
removal of polyps (referred to as polypectomy ) are highly operator-dependent
procedures. There exist a high missed detection rate and incomplete removal of
colonic polyps due to their variable nature, the difficulties to delineate the
abnormality, the high recurrence rates, and the anatomical topography of the
colon. There have been several developments in realising automated methods for
both detection and segmentation of these polyps using machine learning.
However, the major drawback in most of these methods is their ability to
generalise to out-of-sample unseen datasets that come from different centres,
modalities and acquisition systems. To test this hypothesis rigorously we
curated a multi-centre and multi-population dataset acquired from multiple
colonoscopy systems and challenged teams comprising machine learning experts to
develop robust automated detection and segmentation methods as part of our
crowd-sourcing Endoscopic computer vision challenge (EndoCV) 2021. In this
paper, we analyse the detection results of the four top (among seven) teams and
the segmentation results of the five top teams (among 16). Our analyses
demonstrate that the top-ranking teams concentrated on accuracy (i.e., accuracy
> 80% on overall Dice score on different validation sets) over real-time
performance required for clinical applicability. We further dissect the methods
and provide an experiment-based hypothesis that reveals the need for improved
generalisability to tackle diversity present in multi-centre datasets.

propose a novel class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms for bipedal control

of labeled observations and a large set of unlabeled observations. Because this
framework is relevant in many applications, they have received a lot of
interest in both academia and industry. Among the existing techniques,
self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent
years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density
regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and
use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an
indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is
to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of
unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The
pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and
to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set. In this
paper, we present self-training methods for binary and multi-class
classification; as well as their variants and two related approaches, namely
consistency-based approaches and transductive learning. We examine the impact
of significant self-training features on various methods, using different
general and image classification benchmarks, and we discuss our ideas for
future research in self-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first thorough and complete survey on this subject.

Further, photocurrent imaging of the channel using near-field
excitation-scanning microscopy reveals dominant recombination and

potentially be engineered to enable sub-thermionic transistor operation coupled

to harness this will necessitate delving into the physics of the quantum field
effect transition between the dissipationless topological phase and the band
insulator phase. Investigating workable device structures, we uncover
fundamental sub-threshold limits posed by the gating mechanism that effectuates
such a transition, thereby emphasizing the need for innovations on materials

to the quantum spin Hall effect phase transition, it is shown that a gating
strategy to beat the thermionic limit can be engineered at the cost of
sacrificing the dissipationless ON-state conduction. It is then demonstrated
that an out-of-plane antiferromagnetic exchange introduced in the material via
proximity coupling can incite transitions between the quantum spin-valley Hall

topological robustness of the ON state while surpassing the thermionic limit.
Our work thus underlines the operational criteria for building topological

versatility, but they also pose security and privacy threats. Therefore,
reliable detection for low-altitude UAVs is an important issue. The strong
ground clutter makes the radar echoes from small UAVs submerged in noise,
resulting in low radar detection reliability. A low-altitude UAV detection
method based on deep contrastive learning is proposed to address the above
problems: Concretely, a low-altitude UAV radar echo model under low-altitude
clutter interference is first established. Based on the echo components and the
UAV Doppler domain identifiable mechanism, a time-frequency transformation
method combining ZAM transform and morphological operations is used to suppress
the ambiguity problem under clutter. Then feature extraction and fusion method
introducing contrast learning is utilized to suppress non-target ground clutter
interference. Finally, a detector relying on semantic features is designed for
the reliable identification of low-altitude UAVs. The experiments carried out
on both real and simulated data confirm that the proposed method can
effectively suppress ground clutter and reliably extract recognizable semantic
features of UAVs. The proposed method achieves lower false and missing alarms
compared with recent state-of-art solutions and improves the detection accuracy
by more than 5% for the same signal-to-noise ratio, which effectively improves

the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Mediation models allow to study
how an independent variable affects a dependent variable indirectly through one
or more intervening variables, which are called mediators. The analysis is
often carried out via a series of linear regressions, in which case the
indirect effects can be computed as products of coefficients from those
regressions. Statistical significance of the indirect effects is typically
assessed via a bootstrap test based on ordinary least-squares estimates.
However, this test is sensitive to outliers or other deviations from normality
assumptions, which poses a serious threat to empirical testing of theory about
mediation mechanisms. The R package robmed implements a robust procedure for
mediation analysis based on the fast-and-robust bootstrap methodology for
robust regression estimators, which yields reliable results even when the data
deviate from the usual normality assumptions. Various other procedures for
mediation analysis are included in package robmed as well. Moreover, robmed
introduces a new formula interface that allows to specify mediation models with
a single formula, and provides various plots for diagnostics or visual
representation of the results.

  Preliminary results obtained in prior work show that One-Class Support Vector

artificial atom strongly coupled to a single-mode cavity field. The effect was
theoretically predicted thirty years ago by Savage [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 1376
(1989)]. The system consists of a superconducting qubit circuit and a
one-dimensional transmission line resonator. In addition, a one-dimensional
transmission line strongly coupled to the atom serves as an open space. The
effect takes place, when a microwave field is applied to the cavity, which in
turn is resonantly coupled to the atom. The fluorescence spectrum is measured
via the emission into the transmission line. We find that the central peak is
determined by the atom spontaneous emission to the open space and the widths of
side peaks are largely determined by the coherent interaction between the atom
and the cavity, that is, the fluorescence spectrum here is very different from
that of the Mollow triplet. We also derive analytical form for the spectrum.
Our experimental results agree well with theoretical calculations.

prepare more differentiated products to meet the diversified demands, and
e-commerce platforms need to capture the market trend with a prophetic vision.
For the trend prediction, the attribute tags, as the essential description of
items, can genuinely reflect the decision basis of consumers. However, few
existing works explore the attribute trend in the specific community for
e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the community trend prediction on the
item attribute and propose a unified framework that combines the dynamic
evolution of two graph patterns to predict the attribute trend in a specific
community. Specifically, we first design a communityattribute bipartite graph
at each time step to learn the collaboration of different communities. Next, we
transform the bipartite graph into a hypergraph to exploit the associations of
different attribute tags in one community. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic
evolution component based on the recurrent neural networks to capture the
fashion trend of attribute tags. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets in a large e-commerce platform show the superiority of the proposed
approach over several strong alternatives and demonstrate the ability to
discover the community trend in advance.

  Formalized Approach To Strongly Interacting Systems","14 pages, 0 figure",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Non-commutative algebras and entanglement are two of the most important
hallmarks of many-body quantum systems. Dynamical perturbation methods are the
most widely used approaches for quantum many-body systems. While study of
entanglement-based numerical methods are booming recently, the traditional
dynamical perturbation methods have not benefited from study of quantum
entanglement. In this work, we formulate an algebraic-dynamical theory (ADT) by
combining the power of quantum algebras and dynamical methods in which quantum
entanglement naturally emerges as the organizing principle. We start by
introducing a complete operator basis set (COBS), with which an arbitrary
state, either pure or mixed, can be represented by the expectation values of
COBS. Then we establish a complete mapping from a given state to a complete set
of dynamical correlation functions of the state through the Heisenberg- and
Schwinger-Dyson-equations-of-motion (SDEOM). The completeness of COBS and the
mapping ensures ADT to be a mathematically complete framework in principle.
Applying ADT to many-body systems on lattices, we find that the quantum
entanglement is represented by the cumulant structure of expectation values of
the many-body COBS. The cumulant structure of the state forms a hierarchy in
correlations. More importantly, such static correlational hierarchy is
inherited by the dynamical correlations and their SDEOM. We propose that the
dynamical hierarchy is also carried into any perturbative calculation on that
state. We demonstrate the validity of such perturbation hierarchy with an
explicit example, in which we show that a single-particle-type perturbative
calculation fails while a many-body perturbation following the hierarchy
succeeds. We also discuss the computation and approximation schemes of ADT and
its implications to other strong coupling theories like parton and slave
particle methods.

$\Delta$-resonance admixed hypernuclear matter is studied under conditions that
are characteristic of neutron star binary merger remnants and supernovas. The
cold, neutrino free regime is also considered as a reference for the
astrophysical constraints on the EoS of dense matter. Our formalism uses the
covariant density functional (CDF) theory successfully adapted to include the
full $J^P=1/2^+$ baryon octet and non-strange members of $J^P=3/2^+$ decouplet
with density-dependent couplings that have been suitably adjusted to the
existing laboratory and astrophysical data. The effect of $\Delta$-resonances
at finite temperatures is to soften the EoS of hypernuclear matter at
intermediate densities and stiffen it at high densities. At low temperatures,
the heavy baryons $\Lambda$, $\Delta^-$,$\Xi^-$, $\Xi^0$ and $\Delta^0$ appear
in the given order if the $\Delta$-meson couplings are close to those for the
nucleon-meson couplings. As is the case for hyperons, the thresholds of
$\Delta$-resonances move to lower densities with the increase of temperature
indicating a significant fraction of $\Delta$'s in the low-density subnuclear
regime. We find that the $\Delta$-resonances comprise a significant fraction of
baryonic matter, of the order of $10\%$ at temperatures of the order of several
tens of MeV in the neutrino-trapped regime and, thus, may affect the supernova
and binary neutron star dynamics by providing, for example, a new source for
neutrino opacity or a new channel for bulk viscosity via the direct Urca
processes. The mass-radius relation of isentropic static, spherically symmetric
hot compact stars is discussed.

of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and polyacrylic acid (PAAc), have been
investigated through rheological measurements at four different amounts of
polyacrylic acid. Both PAAc content and crosslinking degree modify particle
dimensions, mass and softness, thereby strongly affecting the volume fraction
and the system viscosity. Here the volume fraction is derived from the flow
curves at low concentrations by fitting the zero-shear viscosity with the
Einstein-Batchelor equation which provides a parameter k to shift weight
concentration to volume fraction. We find that particles with higher PAAc
content and crosslinker are characterized by a greater value of k and therefore
by larger volume fractions when compared to softer particles. The packing
fractions obtained from rheological measurements are compared with those from
static light scattering for two PAAc contents revealing a good agreement.
Moreover, the behaviour of the viscosity as a function of packing fraction, at
room temperature, has highlighted an Arrhenius dependence for microgels
synthesized with low PAAc content and a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann dependence for
the highest investigated PAAc concentration. A comparison with the hard spheres
behaviour indicates a steepest increase of the viscosity with decreasing
particles softness. Finally, the volume fraction dependence of the viscosity at
a fixed PAAc and at two different temperatures, below and above the volume
phase transition, shows a quantitative agreement with the structural relaxation
time measured through dynamic light scattering indicating that IPN microgels
softness can be tuned with PAAc and temperature and that, depending on particle
softness, two different routes are followed.

more sophisticated bio-based analog keys for securing next-generation

medical imaging data. In most works, the variability and heterogeneity of real
clinical data is acknowledged to still be a problem. One way to automatically
overcome this is to capture and exploit this variation explicitly. Here, we
propose an approach that improves on our previous work in this area and explain
how it potentially can improve clinical acceptance of (semi-)automatic
segmentation methods. In contrast to a standard neural network that produces
one segmentation, we propose to use a multi-pathUnet network that produces
multiple segmentation variants, presumably corresponding to the variations that
reside in the dataset. Different paths of the network are trained on disjoint
data subsets. Because a priori it may be unclear what variations exist in the
data, the subsets should be automatically determined. This is achieved by
searching for the best data partitioning with an evolutionary optimization
algorithm. Because each network path can become more specialized when trained
on a more homogeneous data subset, better segmentation quality can be achieved.
In practical usage, various automatically produced segmentations can be
presented to a medical expert, from which the preferred segmentation can be
selected. In experiments with a real clinical dataset of CT scans with prostate
segmentations, our approach provides an improvement of several percentage
points in terms of Dice and surface Dice coefficients compared to when all
network paths are trained on all training data. Noticeably, the largest
improvement occurs in the upper part of the prostate that is known to be most
prone to inter-observer segmentation variation.

robust and fast camera-LiDAR fusion-based MOT method that achieves a good
trade-off between accuracy and speed. Relying on the characteristics of camera
and LiDAR sensors, an effective deep association mechanism is designed and
embedded in the proposed MOT method. This association mechanism realizes
tracking of an object in a 2D domain when the object is far away and only
detected by the camera, and updating of the 2D trajectory with 3D information
obtained when the object appears in the LiDAR field of view to achieve a smooth
fusion of 2D and 3D trajectories. Extensive experiments based on the typical

idempotent natural transformation, which controls when the functor is separable
and yields a characterization of separable functors in terms of (dual) Maschke
and conservative functors. We prove that any semiseparable functor admits a
canonical factorization as a naturally full functor followed by a separable
functor. Here the main tool is the construction of the coidentifier category
attached to the associated idempotent natural transformation. Then we move our
attention to the semiseparability of functors that have an adjoint. First we
obtain a Rafael-type Theorem. Next we characterize the semiseparability of
adjoint functors in terms of the (co)separability of the associated (co)monads
and the natural fullness of the corresponding (co)comparison functor. We also
focus on functors that are part of an adjoint triple. In particular, we
describe bireflections as semiseparable (co)reflections, or equivalently, as
either Frobenius or naturally full (co)reflections. As an application of our
results, we study the semiseparability of functors traditionally attached to
ring homomorphisms, coalgebra maps, corings and bimodules, introducing the

A crucial step in the numerical investigation of small-scale dynamos
in the solar atmosphere consists of an accurate determination of the magnetic
Prandtl number, Prm, stemming from radiative magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. Aims. The aims are to provide a reliable methodology for
estimating the effective Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers, Re and Rem,
and their ratio Prm=Rem/Re (the magnetic Prandlt number), that characterise MHD
simulations and to categorise small-scale dynamo simulations in terms of these
dimensionless parameters. Methods. The methodology proposed for computing Re
and Rem is based on the method of projection on proper elements and it relies
on a post-processing step carried out using higher order accurate numerical
operators than the ones in the simulation code. A number of radiative MHD
simulations with different effective viscosities and plasma resistivities were
carried out with the CO5BOLD code, and the resulting growth rate of the
magnetic energy and saturated magnetic field strengths were characterised in
terms of Re and Rem. Results. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a
solid estimate of the dissipation coefficients affecting the momentum and
induction equations of MHD simulation codes, and consequently also a reliable
evaluation of the magnetic Prandtl number characterising the numerical results.
Additionally, it is found that small-scale dynamos are active and can amplify a
small seed magnetic field up to significant values in CO5BOLD simulations with
a grid spacing smaller than h=12 km, even at Prm=0.65. However, it is also
evident that it is difficult to categorise dynamo simulations in terms of Prm
alone, because it is not only important to estimate the amplitude of the
dissipation coefficients, but also at which scales energy dissipation takes
place.

visual tempo either by sampling raw videos with multiple rates, which require a
costly multi-layer network to handle each rate, or by hierarchically sampling
backbone features, which rely heavily on high-level features that miss
fine-grained temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a Temporal Correlation
Module (TCM), which can be easily embedded into the current action recognition
backbones in a plug-in-and-play manner, to extract action visual tempo from
low-level backbone features at single-layer remarkably. Specifically, our TCM
contains two main components: a Multi-scale Temporal Dynamics Module (MTDM) and
a Temporal Attention Module (TAM). MTDM applies a correlation operation to
learn pixel-wise fine-grained temporal dynamics for both fast-tempo and
slow-tempo. TAM adaptively emphasizes expressive features and suppresses
inessential ones via analyzing the global information across various tempos.
Extensive experiments conducted on several action recognition benchmarks, e.g.

the position distribution generically satisfies the diffusion equation at the

contributions to the Gaussian position distribution. As a part of our
framework, we also prescribe a way to find the position moments recursively and

to its adverse health effects. PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations typically exhibit
complex spatio-temporal variations. Both the mean and the spatio-temporal
dependence evolve with time due to seasonality, which makes the statistical
analysis of PM$_{2.5}$ challenging. In geostatistics, Gaussian process is a
powerful tool for characterizing and predicting such spatio-temporal dynamics,
for which the specification of a spatio-temporal covariance function is the
key. While the extant literature offers a wide range of choices for flexible
stationary spatio-temporal covariance models, the temporally evolving
spatio-temporal dependence has received scant attention only. To this end, we
propose a time-varying spatio-temporal covariance model for describing the
time-evolving spatio-temporal dependence in PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations. For
estimation, we develop a composite likelihood-based procedure to handle large
spatio-temporal datasets.The proposed model is shown to outperform
traditionally used models through simulation studies in terms of predictions.
We apply our model to analyze the PM$_{2.5}$ data in the state of Oregon, US.
Therein, we show that the spatial scale and smoothness exhibit periodicity. The
proposed model is also shown to be beneficial over traditionally used models on
this dataset for predictions.

may require upgrades during the lifetime of the asset. In practice, the asset
owner and system supplier can make the upgrade decisions together, requiring a
decision support model that can be jointly used to optimize the total benefit
for both parties. Motivated by a real-life use case including an asset owner
and a system supplier, we build a continuous-time model to optimize the upgrade
decisions of a system during the fixed lifetime of the asset. In our model, we
capture the key critical factors that drive the upgrade decisions: increasing
functionality requirements due to evolving technology, age-dependent
maintenance costs, a predetermined overhaul plan of the asset, and the lifetime
of the asset. A system upgrade is less costly if it is executed jointly with an
asset overhaul. We first analyze the case with no additional cost of upgrading
outside an overhaul. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal
upgrade policy under various realistic assumptions that lead to different types
of cost functions. We then use these results as a building block to
characterize the optimal policy for a generalized cost function. When there is
a penalty for upgrading outside an overhaul moment, we propose a dynamic
programming approach that efficiently determines the optimal upgrade policy by
using our analytical results. We also prove that as this penalty increases, the
optimal policy can only change to one where the number of upgrades not jointly
executed with overhauls is reduced. However, the optimal number of upgrades is
a non-increasing function of this penalty. Also surprisingly, more overhauls
may lead to a smaller number of upgrades under the optimal policy.

morphological and phonological patterns. We approach this question with an
annotation-based analysis leveraging nonsense words. Specifically, we conduct a
best-worst scaling crowdsourcing study in which participants assign intensity
scores for joy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise to 272 non-sense
words and, for comparison of the results to previous work, to 68 real words.
Based on this resource, we develop character-level and phonology-based
intensity regressors. We evaluate them on both nonsense words and real words
(making use of the NRC emotion intensity lexicon of 7493 words), across six
emotion categories. The analysis of our data reveals that some phonetic
patterns show clear differences between emotion intensities. For instance, s as
a first phoneme contributes to joy, sh to surprise, p as last phoneme more to
disgust than to anger and fear. In the modelling experiments, a regressor
trained on real words from the NRC emotion intensity lexicon shows a higher
performance (r = 0.17) than regressors that aim at learning the emotion
connotation purely from nonsense words. We conclude that humans do associate
affective meaning to words based on surface patterns, but also based on
similarities to existing words (""juy"" to ""joy"", or ""flike"" to ""like"").

that are highly charged or rapidly spinning (90 and 80 percent of the extremal
values, respectively, for this initial test, though the code should be able to
produce data with even higher values of these parameters using higher

out exploratory evolutions with the finite difference, moving punctures codes

presence of microstructure noise, which leads to biased measures. Alternative
estimators have been developed and tested either on specific structures of the
noise or by the speed of convergence to their asymptotic distributions.
Gatheral and Oomen (2010) proposed to use the Zero-Intelligence model of the
limit order book to test the finite-sample performance of several estimators of
the integrated variance. Building on this approach, in this paper we introduce
three main innovations: (i) we use as data-generating process the
Queue-Reactive model of the limit order book (Huang et al. (2015)), which -
compared to the Zero-Intelligence model - generates more realistic
microstructure dynamics, as shown here by using an Hausman test; (ii) we
consider not only estimators of the integrated volatility but also of the spot
volatility; (iii) we show the relevance of the estimator in the prediction of
the variance of the cost of a simulated VWAP execution. Overall we find that,
for the integrated volatility, the pre-averaging estimator optimizes the

adopting various approaches to privacy-preserving methods. One of the favorite
privacy frameworks, differential privacy (DP), is perhaps the most compelling
thanks to its fundamental theoretical guarantees. Despite the apparent
simplicity of the general concept of differential privacy, it seems non-trivial
to get it right when applying it to NLP. In this short paper, we formally
analyze several recent NLP papers proposing text representation learning using
DPText (Beigi et al., 2019a,b; Alnasser et al., 2021; Beigi et al., 2021) and
reveal their false claims of being differentially private. Furthermore, we also
show a simple yet general empirical sanity check to determine whether a given
implementation of a DP mechanism almost certainly violates the privacy loss
guarantees. Our main goal is to raise awareness and help the community
understand potential pitfalls of applying differential privacy to text
representation learning.

universe in the context of primordial black hole (PBH) physics. Firstly, we
review the fundamentals of the early universe cosmology and we recap the basics
of the PBHs physics. In particular, we propose a refinement in the
determination of the PBH formation threshold, a fundamental quantity in PBH
physics, in the context of a time-dependent equation-of-state parameter.
Afterwards, we briefly present the theory of inflationary perturbations, which
is the theoretical framework within which PBHs are studied in this thesis.
Then, in the second part of the thesis, we review the core of the research
conducted within my PhD, in which aspects of the early universe and the
gravitational wave physics are combined with the physics of PBHs. Moreover,
aspects of the PBH gravitational collapse process are studied in the presence
of anisotropies. Specifically, we study PBHs produced from the preheating
instability in the context of single-field inflation. Interestingly, we find
that PBHs produced during preheating can potentially dominate the universe's
content and drive reheating through their evaporation. Then, we focus on the
scalar induced second-order stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)
induced from Poisson energy density fluctuations of ultralight PBHs. By taking
then into account gravitational wave backreaction effects we set
model-independent constraints on the initial abundance of ultralight PBHs as a
function of their mass. Afterwards, we study in a covariant way the anisotropic
spherical gravitational collapse of PBHs during a radiation-dominated era in
which one can compute the PBH formation threshold as a function of the
anisotropy. Finally, we summarize our research results by discussing future
prospects opened up as a result of the research work conducted within this

This will bring inconvenience in following situations: (1) what is the best way
to obtain the contextual vector of a word that is divided into multiple
wordpieces? (2) how to predict a word via cloze test without knowing the number
of wordpieces in advance? In this work, we explore the possibility of
developing BERT-style pretrained model over a vocabulary of words instead of
wordpieces. We call such word-level BERT model as WordBERT. We train models
with different vocabulary sizes, initialization configurations and languages.
Results show that, compared to standard wordpiece-based BERT, WordBERT makes
significant improvements on cloze test and machine reading comprehension. On
many other natural language understanding tasks, including POS tagging,
chunking and NER, WordBERT consistently performs better than BERT. Model
analysis indicates that the major advantage of WordBERT over BERT lies in the
understanding for low-frequency words and rare words. Furthermore, since the
pipeline is language-independent, we train WordBERT for Chinese language and
obtain significant gains on five natural language understanding datasets.
Lastly, the analyse on inference speed illustrates WordBERT has comparable time

been investigated for at least six decades but has still not been resolved
[1-5]. The size of single aperture cavities, bounded by the existence of
higher-order transverse modes, fundamentally limits the power emitted by
single-mode lasers or the brightness of quantum light sources. The
free-spectral range of existing electromagnetic apertures goes to zero when the
size of the aperture increases, and the demonstration of scale-invariant
apertures or lasers has remained elusive. Here, we report open-Dirac
electromagnetic apertures that exploit a subtle cavity-mode-dependent scaling
of losses in reciprocal space. For cavities with a quadratic dispersion, the
complex frequencies of modes converge towards each other with the size of
cavities, making cavities invariably multimode. Surprisingly, for a class of
cavities with linear dispersion, we discover that, while the convergence of the
real parts of cavity modes towards each other is delayed (it still quickly goes
to zero), the normalized complex free-spectral range converge towards a
constant governed by the loss rate of distinct Bloch bands. We show that this
unconventional scaling of the complex frequency of cavity modes in open-Dirac
electromagnetic apertures guarantees single-mode operation of large cavities.
We experimentally demonstrate that single-mode lasing of such cavities is
maintained when the cavity is scale up in size. We name such sources Berkeley
Surface Emitting Lasers (BerkSELs). We further show that the far-field emitted
by the proposed single-mode BerkSELs corresponds to a topological singularity
of charge two, in full agreement with our theory. Open-Dirac apertures open new

leading to 11.90 % or 11.63 % of hydrogen uptake, respectively, which is
significantly higher than the DOE-US demands of 6.5 %. The average adsorption
energy of H$_2$ for K and Ca decorated BPS is -0.24 eV and -0.33 eV,
respectively, in the suitable range for reversible H$_2$ storage. Hydrogen
molecules get polarized in the vicinity of ionized metal atoms hence get
attached to the metal atoms through electrostatic and van der Waals

that the adsorbed H$_2$ can be utilized for reversible use. We have found that
a sufficient energy barrier of 2.52 eV exists for the movement of Ca atoms,
calculated using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. This

learning-based framework for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT
images of Covid patients. In the first step, two residual networks were
independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients
in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm
for Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise
probability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the
CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models
to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar
with Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower
probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of
the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung
probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion
segmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the
unsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and
0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in
the external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of
infection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice
coefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative
evaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesion

thermal conductivity in Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, which is a metallic analogue of spin
ice. Despite the presence of mobile charge carriers, we find that both
$\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xy}$ are dominated by phonons. A $T/H$ scaling of
$\kappa_{xx}$ unambiguously reveals that longitudinal heat current is
substantially impeded by resonant scattering of phonons on paramagnetic spins.
Upon cooling, the resonant scattering is strongly affected by a development of
spin ice correlation and $\kappa_{xx}$ deviates from the scaling in an
anisotropic way with respect to field directions. Strikingly, a set of the
$\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xy}$ data clearly shows that $\kappa_{xy}$
correlates with $\kappa_{xx}$ in its response to magnetic field including a
success of the $T/H$ scaling and its failure at low temperature. This
remarkable correlation provides solid evidence that an indispensable role is
played by spin-phonon scattering not only for hindering the longitudinal heat
conduction, but also for generating the transverse response.

Over the past few years, Trojan attacks have advanced from using only a single
input-agnostic trigger and targeting only one class to using multiple,
input-specific triggers and targeting multiple classes. However, Trojan
defenses have not caught up with this development. Most defense methods still
make inadequate assumptions about Trojan triggers and target classes, thus, can
be easily circumvented by modern Trojan attacks. To deal with this problem, we
propose two novel ""filtering"" defenses called Variational Input Filtering (VIF)
and Adversarial Input Filtering (AIF) which leverage lossy data compression and
adversarial learning respectively to effectively purify potential Trojan
triggers in the input at run time without making assumptions about the number
of triggers/target classes or the input dependence property of triggers. In
addition, we introduce a new defense mechanism called
""Filtering-then-Contrasting"" (FtC) which helps avoid the drop in classification
accuracy on clean data caused by ""filtering"", and combine it with VIF/AIF to
derive new defenses of this kind. Extensive experimental results and ablation
studies show that our proposed defenses significantly outperform well-known
baseline defenses in mitigating five advanced Trojan attacks including two
recent state-of-the-art while being quite robust to small amounts of training

recognition methods is affected by fatigue. Goal: In this paper we assess the
impact of fatigue on intra-user variability and on the performance of
signature-based and text-based writer recognition approaches encompassing both
identification and verification. Methods: Several signature and text
recognition methods are considered and applied to samples gathered after
different levels of induced fatigue, measured by metabolic and mechanical
assessment and, also by subjective perception. The recognition methods are
Dynamic Time Warping and Multi Section Vector Quantization, for signatures, and
Allographic Text-Dependent Recognition for text in capital letters. For each
fatigue level, the identification and verification performance of these methods
is measured. Results: Signature shows no statistically significant intra-user
impact, but text does. On the other hand, performance of signature-based
recognition approaches is negatively impacted by fatigue whereas the impact is
not noticeable in text-based recognition, provided long enough sequences are
considered.

Alternatively, when calibrated using SN Ia standard candle, xA quasar

improvement in the multi-model mean of CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 for most of the
variables we examined including surface nutrients, temperature, and salinity.
We find that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 ocean models underestimate anthropogenic
carbon dioxide uptake after the 1970s. For the period of 1994 to 2007, the
multi-model mean from CMIP6 yields a mean cumulative carbon uptake of 27.2
+-2.2 Pg C, which is about 15% lower than the 32.0+-5.7 Pg C estimate derived
from two sets of observations. Negative biases in the change in anthropogenic
carbon inventory exist in the northern North Atlantic and at mid-latitudes in
the southern hemisphere (30-60{\deg}S). For the few models that provided
simulations of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), we demonstrate that regions with
negative anthropogenic DIC biases coincide with regions that have a negative
bias in CFC concentrations. This relationship suggests that underestimates of
anthropogenic carbon storage in some models originates, in part, from weak
transport between the surface and interior ocean. To examine the robustness of
this attribution across the full suite of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, we examined
the vertical temperature gradient between 200 and 1000m as a metric for
stratification and exchange between the surface and deeper waters. On a global
scale across different models and different MIPs we find a linear relationship
between the bias of vertical temperature gradients and the bias in
anthropogenic carbon uptake, consistent with the hypothesis that model biases
in the ocean carbon sink are related to biases in surface-to-interior
transport.

the thermal management of electronic devices, especially when completely
considering the heat conduction process from the nanoscale heat source to the

on convectional Fourier's law or limited to small system sizes, making it
difficult to accurately and efficiently study the cross-scale heat transfer. In
this paper, a hybrid phonon Monte Carlo-diffusion method that couples phonon
Monte Carlo (MC) method with Fourier's law by dividing the computational domain
is adopted to analyze thermal spreading resistance in ballistic-diffusive
regime. Compared with phonon MC simulation, the junction temperature of the
hybrid method has the same precision, while the time costs could be reduced up
to 2 orders of magnitude at most. Furthermore, the simulation results indicate
that the heating scheme has a remarkable impact on phonon transport. The
thermal resistance of the heat source (HS) scheme can be larger than that of
the heat flux (HF) scheme, which is opposite from the prediction of Fourier's
law. In the HS scheme, the enhanced phonon-boundary scattering counteracts the
broadening of the heat source, leading to a stronger ballistic effect as the
heat source thickness decreases. The conclusion is verified by a
one-dimensional thermal resistance model. This work has opened up an
opportunity for the fast and extensive thermal modeling of cross-scale heat
transfer in electronic devices and highlighted the influence of heating

elements. The optimal model can be obtained by ""learning"" from the data
generated via finite element calculation over the corresponding building block
of the continuum metamaterial. Then, we deploy the optimal model to the network
so that the dynamics of the metamaterial at the structural scale can be
studied. We verify the accuracy of our machine learning approach against
several representative numerical examples. In these examples, the proposed
approach can significantly reduce the computational cost when compared to
direct numerical simulation while reaching comparable accuracy. Moreover,
defects and spatial inhomogeneities can be easily incorporated into our
approach, which can be useful for the rational design of soft mechanical
metamaterials.

Domain Adaptation (UDA) studies how to transfer an effective feature learner
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Plenty of methods
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results
in the past decades. Inspired by the success of Transformers, some methods
attempt to tackle UDA problem by adopting pure transformer architectures, and
interpret the models by applying the long-range dependency strategy at image
patch-level. However, the algorithmic complexity is high and the
interpretability seems weak. In this paper, we propose the Domain-Transformer
(DoT) for UDA, which integrates the CNN-backbones and the core attention
mechanism of Transformers from a new perspective. Specifically, a plug-and-play
domain-level attention mechanism is proposed to learn the sample correspondence
between domains. This is significantly different from existing methods which
only capture the local interactions among image patches. Instead of explicitly
modeling the distribution discrepancy from either domain-level or class-level,
DoT learns transferable features by achieving the local semantic consistency
across domains, where the domain-level attention and manifold regularization
are explored. Then, DoT is free of pseudo-labels and explicit domain
discrepancy optimization. Theoretically, DoT is connected with the optimal
transportation algorithm and statistical learning theory. The connection
provides a new insight to understand the core component of Transformers.
Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness
of DoT.

it is very interesting to explore the interplay between topology and

single-magnon excitations, we discover topological edge states and defect edge
states of magnon excitations in a dimerized Heisenberg XXZ chain and their
topological properties can be distinguished via adiabatic quantum transport. We
uncover topological phase transitions induced by longitudinal spin-spin
interactions whose boundary is analytically obtained via the transfer matrix
method. For multi-magnon excitations, even-magnon bound states are found to be
always topologically trivial, but odd-magnon bound states may be topologically
nontrivial due to the interplay between the transverse dimerization and the
longitudinal spin-spin interaction. For two-dimensional spin systems, the
longitudinal spin-spin interaction contributes to the coexistence of defect
corner states, second-order topological corner states and first-order
topological edge states. Our work opens an avenue for exploring topological
magnon excitations and has potential applications in topological magnon

two-dimensional single crystal magnesium and boron carbide under simple shear
deformation; (ii) crack-induced twinning for magnesium under pure mode I and

class of toroidal multipoles. Since then, it was observed that toroidal
multipoles are present in the electromagnetic structure of systems at all
scales, from elementary particles, to solid state systems and metamaterials.
The toroidal dipole ${\bf T}$ (the lowest order multipole) is the most common.
In quantum systems, this corresponds to the toroidal dipole operator $\hat{\bf
T}$, with the projections $\hat{T}_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) on the coordinate axes. Here
we analyze a quantum particle in a system with cylindrical symmetry, which is a
typical system in which toroidal moments appear. We find the expressions for
the Hamiltonian, momenta, and toroidal dipole operators in adequate curvilinear
coordinates, which allow us to find analytical expressions for the
eigenfunctions of the momentum operators. While the toroidal dipole is
hermitian, it is not self-adjoint, but in the new set of coordinates the
operator $\hat{T}_3$ splits into two components, one of which is (only)
hermitian, whereas the other one is self-adjoint. The self-adjoint component is
the one that is physically significant and represents an observable.
Furthermore, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian and the toroidal dipole
operator and find their eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We write the partition
function and calculate the thermodynamic quantities for a system of ideal
particles on a torus. Besides proving that the toroidal dipole is self-adjoint
and therefore an observable (a finding of fundamental relevance) such systems
open up the possibility of making metamaterials that exploit the quantization

multi-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managing

proposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,
optimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to
substantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirect
unavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.
The proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical
model that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure
networks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and
infrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types of
intervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types
of interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a
proposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions
of different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally planned
independently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for central
interventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time
moment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of a
multi-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results show
a substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition, the
optimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable
patterns, which indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.

particular, audio and visual front-ends are trained on large-scale unimodal
datasets, then we integrate components of both front-ends into a larger
multimodal framework which learns to recognize parallel audio-visual data into
characters through a combination of CTC and seq2seq decoding. We show that both
components inherited from unimodal self-supervised learning cooperate well,
resulting in that the multimodal framework yields competitive results through
fine-tuning. Our model is experimentally validated on both word-level and
sentence-level tasks. Especially, even without an external language model, our
proposed model raises the state-of-the-art performances on the widely accepted
Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) dataset by a large margin, with a relative
improvement of 30%.

  Forests",,,,,"q-fin.ST stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the prediction of Value at Risk (VaR) for cryptocurrencies. In
contrast to classic assets, returns of cryptocurrencies are often highly
volatile and characterized by large fluctuations around single events.
Analyzing a comprehensive set of 105 major cryptocurrencies, we show that
Generalized Random Forests (GRF) (Athey et al., 2019) adapted to quantile
prediction have superior performance over other established methods such as
quantile regression, GARCH-type and CAViaR models. This advantage is especially
pronounced in unstable times and for classes of highly-volatile
cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we identify important predictors during such
times and show their influence on forecasting over time. Moreover, a
comprehensive simulation study also indicates that the GRF methodology is at
least on par with existing methods in VaR predictions for standard types of
financial returns and clearly superior in the cryptocurrency setup.

topological proof of the Luttinger theorem. The Green function of the ideal
Fermi gas has a pole in the (E,|p|) plane (where E and p are energy and
momentum). This pole is considered to be analogous to a vortex in liquid
helium. Since a vortex is topologically stable against restricted
perturbations, one can include interaction adiabatically (as a succession of
small perturbations), and observe transformation of the Fermi gas pole to the
Fermi liquid pole. In this argument, the topological stability arises already
on the level of the ideal Fermi gas, which is in conflict with its Cooper
instability. We discuss the origin of this controversy.

  the role for energy storage",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Global energy sector decarbonization efforts are contingent on technology
choices for energy production and end-use in emerging markets such as India,
where air conditioning is expected to be a major driver for electricity demand
growth. Here, we use an integrated demand-supply framework to quantify the
impacts of demand growth and temporal patterns on long-term electricity system
evolution. Under projected renewables and Li-ion storage cost declines, our
supply-demand modeling points to renewables contributing substantially (46-67%)
to meet annual electricity demand in India by 2030. However, without
appropriate policy measures to phase out existing coal generation, even such
rapid adoption of renewable energy coupled with one or more technological
levers such as low-cost energy storage and demand-side measures such as setting
aggressive AC efficiency standards and deploying distribution level storage,
are insufficient to reduce annual CO2 emissions in 2050 vs. 2020 because of the
relatively higher growth rate of projected electricity demand over this period.

  difficulty in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Estimation of distribution algorithms are evolutionary algorithms that use
extracted information from the population instead of traditional genetic
operators to generate new solutions. This information is represented as a
probabilistic model and the effectiveness of these algorithms is dependent on
the quality of these models. However, some studies have shown that even
multivariate EDAs fail to build a proper model in some problems. Usually, in
these problems, there is intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. In
the literature, there are few studies that investigate the difficulty and the
nature of problems that can not be solved by EDAs easily. This paper proposes a
new metric for measuring problem difficulty by examining the properties of
model-building mechanisms in EDAs. For this purpose, we use the estimated Walsh
coefficients of dependent and independent variables. The proposed metric is
used to evaluate the difficulty of some well-known benchmark problems in EDAs.
Different metrics like Fitness Distance Correlation (FDC) are used to compare
how well the proposed metric measures problem difficulty for EDAs. Results
indicate that the proposed metric can accurately predict the EDA's performance
in different problems.
