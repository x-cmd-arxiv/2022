(PS) by aggregating model updates obtained from multiple remote learners.
Generally, the communication between the remote users and the PS is
rate-limited, while the transmission from the PS to the remote users are
unconstrained. The FL setting gives rise to the distributed learning scenario
in which the updates from the remote learners have to be compressed so as to
meet communication rate constraints in the uplink transmission toward the PS.
For this problem, one wishes to compress the model updates so as to minimize
the loss in accuracy resulting from the compression error. In this paper, we
take a rate-distortion approach to address the compressor design problem for
the distributed training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we
define a measure of the compression performance under communication-rate
constraints -- the \emph{per-bit accuracy} -- which addresses the ultimate
improvement of accuracy that a bit of communication brings to the centralized
model. In order to maximize the per-bit accuracy, we consider modeling the DNN
gradient updates at remote learners as a generalized normal distribution. Under
this assumption on the DNN gradient distribution, we propose a class of
distortion measures to aid the design of quantizers for the compression of the
model updates. We argue that this family of distortion measures, which we refer
to as ""$M$-magnitude weighted $L_2$"" norm, captures the practitioner's
intuition in the choice of gradient compressor. Numerical simulations are
provided to validate the proposed approach for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

strategy for highly accelerated 3D imaging and joint multi-contrast image
reconstruction, and further extend this to enable rapid quantitative imaging
using an interleaved look-locker acquisition sequence with T2 preparation pulse
(3D-QALAS).
  Method: Recently introduced MoDL technique successfully incorporates
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regularizers into physics-based
parallel imaging reconstruction using a small number of network parameters.
Wave-CAIPI is an emerging parallel imaging method that accelerates the imaging
speed by employing sinusoidal gradients in the phase- and slice-encoding
directions during the readout to take better advantage of 3D coil sensitivity
profiles. In wave-MoDL, we propose to combine the wave-encoding strategy with
unrolled network constraints to accelerate the acquisition speed while
enforcing wave-encoded data consistency. We further extend wave-MoDL to
reconstruct multi-contrast data with controlled aliasing in parallel imaging
(CAIPI) sampling patterns to leverage similarity between multiple images to
improve the reconstruction quality.
  Result: Wave-MoDL enables a 47-second MPRAGE acquisition at 1 mm resolution
at 16-fold acceleration. For quantitative imaging, wave-MoDL permits a 2-minute
acquisition for T1, T2, and proton density mapping at 1 mm resolution at
12-fold acceleration, from which contrast weighted images can be synthesized as
well.
  Conclusion: Wave-MoDL allows rapid MR acquisition and high-fidelity image

Specifically, we divide the images into blocks and then introduce the random
shuffling to intra-block and inter-block. Intra-block shuffling increases the
robustness of the detector and we also propose an adversarial loss algorithm to
overcome the over-fitting problem brought by the noise introduced by shuffling.
Moreover, we encourage the detector to focus on finding differences among the
local features through inter-block shuffling, and reconstruct the spatial
layout of the blocks to model the semantic associations between them.
Especially, our method can be easily integrated with various CNN models.

modification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped
by allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time

displays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic
localization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes --
localization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced

non-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum

require solution of a Poisson equation for pressure with all Neumann boundary
conditions. Discretization of such a Poisson equation results in a
rank-deficient matrix of coefficients. When a non-conservative discretization
method such as finite difference, finite element, or spectral scheme is used,
such a matrix also generates an inconsistency which makes the residuals in the
iterative solution to saturate at a threshold level that depends on the spatial
resolution and order of the discretization scheme. In this paper, we examine
inconsistency for a high-order meshless discretization scheme suitable for
solving the equations on a complex domain. The high order meshless method uses
polyharmonic spline radial basis functions (PHS-RBF) with appended polynomials
to interpolate scattered data and constructs the discrete equations by
collocation. The PHS-RBF provides the flexibility to vary the order of
discretization by increasing the degree of the appended polynomial. In this
study, we examine the convergence of the inconsistency for different spatial
resolutions and for different degrees of the appended polynomials by solving
the Poisson equation for a manufactured solution as well as the Navier-Stokes
equations for several fluid flows. We observe that the inconsistency decreases
faster than the error in the final solution, and eventually becomes vanishing
small at sufficient spatial resolution. The rate of convergence of the
inconsistency is observed to be similar or better than the rate of convergence
of the discretization errors. This beneficial observation makes it unnecessary
to regularize the Poisson equation by fixing either the mean pressure or
pressure at an arbitrary point. A simple point solver such as the SOR is seen
to be well-convergent, although it can be further accelerated using multilevel
methods.

trees (SFT) can best be analysed using binary decision diagrams (BDD).
State-based techniques are favorable for the more expressive dynamic fault
trees (DFT). This paper combines the best of both worlds by following Dugan's
approach: dynamic sub-trees are analysed via model checking Markov models and
replaced by basic events capturing the obtained failure probabilities. The
resulting SFT is then analysed via BDDs. We implemented this approach in the
Storm model checker. Extensive experiments (a) compare our pure BDD-based
analysis of SFTs to various existing SFT analysis tools, (b) indicate the
benefits of our efficient calculations for multiple time points and the
assessment of the mean-time-to-failure, and (c) show that our implementation of
Dugan's approach significantly outperforms pure Markovian analysis of DFTs. Our
implementation Storm-dft is currently the only tool supporting efficient
analysis for both SFTs and DFTs.

overcome the limitations of the primitive user feedback used by traditional
recommender systems (e.g., clicks, item consumption, ratings). They allow users
to express intent, preferences, constraints, and contexts in a richer fashion,
often using natural language (including faceted search and dialogue). Yet more
research is needed to find the most effective ways to use this feedback. One
challenge is inferring a user's semantic intent from the open-ended terms or
attributes often used to describe a desired item, and using it to refine
recommendation results. Leveraging concept activation vectors (CAVs) [26], a
recently developed approach for model interpretability in machine learning, we
develop a framework to learn a representation that captures the semantics of
such attributes and connects them to user preferences and behaviors in
recommender systems. One novel feature of our approach is its ability to
distinguish objective and subjective attributes (both subjectivity of degree
and of sense), and associate different senses of subjective attributes with
different users. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real-world data sets that
our CAV representation not only accurately interprets users' subjective
semantics, but can also be used to improve recommendations through interactive
item critiquing.

improve the performance of machine learning models. Usually, uncorrelated noise
is used in such perturbed gradient descent (PGD) methods. It is, however, not
known if this is optimal or whether other types of noise could provide better
generalization performance. In this paper, we zoom in on the problem of
correlating the perturbations of consecutive PGD steps. We consider a variety
of objective functions for which we find that GD with anticorrelated
perturbations (""Anti-PGD"") generalizes significantly better than GD and
standard (uncorrelated) PGD. To support these experimental findings, we also
derive a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that Anti-PGD moves to wider
minima, while GD and PGD remain stuck in suboptimal regions or even diverge.
This new connection between anticorrelated noise and generalization opens the
field to novel ways to exploit noise for training machine learning models.

such that $\{u, v\}\subseteq e$, $\{v, w\}\subseteq f$, $\{w, u\}\subseteq g$
and $\{u, v, w\}\cap e\cap f\cap g=\emptyset$. Johansson proved in 1996 that
$\chi(G)=\mathcal{O}(\Delta/\log\Delta)$ for any triangle-free graph $G$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$. Cooper and Mubayi later generalized the Johansson's
theorem to all rank $3$ hypergraphs. In this paper we provide a common
generalization of both these results for all hypergraphs, showing that if
$\mathcal{H}$ is a rank $k$, triangle-free hypergraph, then the list chromatic

hypergraphs, while its proof is based on a different approach than prior works
in hypergraphs (and therefore provides alternative proofs to them). In
particular, as an application, we establish a bound on chromatic number of
sparse hypergraphs in which each vertex is contained in few triangles, and thus
extend results of Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov, and Cooper and Mubayi from

metrics that directly predict \emph{test error} instead of the
\emph{generalization gap}; (iii) exploring metrics that do not need access to

Euler equations in $\mathbb R^3$ such that each vector field $X\in \mathscr G$
is universal in the sense that any area preserving diffeomorphism of the disk
can be approximated (with arbitrary precision) by the Poincar\'e map of $X$ at
some transverse section. We remark that this universality is approximate but
occurs at all scales. In particular, our results establish that a steady Euler
flow may exhibit any conservative finite codimensional dynamical phenomenon;
this includes the existence of horseshoes accumulated by elliptic islands,
increasing union of horseshoes of Hausdorff dimension $3$ or homoclinic
tangencies of arbitrarily high multiplicity. The steady solutions we construct
are Beltrami fields with sharp decay at infinity. To prove these results we
introduce new perturbation methods in the context of Beltrami fields that allow
us to import deep techniques from bifurcation theory: the
Gonchenko-Shilnikov-Turaev universality theory and the Newhouse and Duarte
theorems on the geometry of wild hyperbolic sets. These perturbation methods
rely on two tools from linear PDEs: global approximation and
Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorems. These results imply a strong version of V.I.
Arnold's vision on the complexity of Beltrami fields in Euclidean space.

presents a first mobility management solution that concurrently optimizes
inter-frequency related A5 parameters and intra-frequency related A3

three critical key performance indicators (KPIs): edge user reference signal
received power (RSRP), handover success rate (HOSR) and load between frequency
bands. In the absence of tractable analytical models due to system level
complexity, we leverage machine learning to quantify the KPIs as a function of
the mobility parameters. An XGBoost based model has the best performance for
edge RSRP and HOSR while random forest outperforms others for load prediction.
An analysis of the mobility parameters provides several insights: 1) there
exists a strong coupling between A3 and A5 parameters; 2) an optimal set of
parameters exists for each KPI; and 3) the optimal parameters vary for
different KPIs. We also perform a SHAP based sensitivity to help resolve the
parametric conflict between the KPIs. Finally, we formulate a maximization
problem, show it is non-convex, and solve it utilizing simulated annealing

telescope observed the GJ 65 system, composed of the active, flaring M stars BL
Cet and UV Cet, for 15900 seconds (~4.4 hours) in two ultraviolet bands. The
contrast in flux between flares and the photospheres of cool stars is maximized
at ultraviolet wavelengths, and GJ 65 is the brightest and nearest flaring M
dwarf system with significant GALEX coverage. It therefore represents the best
opportunity to measure low energy flares with GALEX. We construct high cadence
light curves from calibrated photon events and find 13 new flare events with
NUV energies ranging from 10^28.5 - 10^29.5 ergs and recover one previously
reported flare with an energy of 10^31 ergs. The newly reported flares are
among the smallest M dwarf flares observed in the ultraviolet with sufficient
time resolution to discern light curve morphology. The estimated flare
frequency at these low energies is consistent with extrapolation from the
distributions of higher-energy flares on active M dwarfs measured by other
surveys. The largest flare in our sample is bright enough to exceed the local
non-linearity threshold of the GALEX detectors, which precludes color analysis.
However, we detect quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) during this flare in both
the FUV and NUV bands at a period of ~50 seconds, which we interpret as a
modulation of the flare's chromospheric thermal emission through periodic
triggering of reconnection by external MHD oscillations in the corona.

(two-step) versus simultaneous (all at once) fitting methods with linear and
weakly-nonlinear rheological data. Using an example of a combined dataset on
small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and medium-amplitude oscillatory shear
(MAOS) for a linear entangled polymer melt (cis-1,4-polyisoprene), we
demonstrate with a multi-mode Giesekus model how the fit parameter
uncertainties are significantly under-estimated with the sequential fit because
of the neglect of model parameter correlations. These results are surprising
because weakly-nonlinear data is only an asymptotic step away from the linear
data, yet it has significant impact on calibrating the linear model parameters.
Similarly, the nonlinear parameter estimates and uncertainties are impacted by
considering the linear data in a simultaneous fit. To compare multi-mode
spectra of nonlinear parameters (mobility parameters {\alpha_i} from the
Giesekus model), we derive new average measures based on moments of the spectra
related to the high-frequency MAOS limit. The spectral averages are also
sensitive to sequential versus simultaneous fitting. Our results reveal the
importance of using simultaneous fitting for honest uncertainty quantification,

effect of the convective nest was a unifying feature. In each case, the action
of longitudinally modulated convection led to localized (and in one case,
global) reversals of the toroidal magnetic field, as well as the formation of
an active longitude, with enhanced poloidal field amplitudes and flux
emergence.

using a zero-forcing (ZF) detector and then uses a neural network consisting of
a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a fully-connected neural

be adapted to yield a trade-off between complexity and bit error rate (BER)

has been demonstrated that the proposed deep convolutional neural network-based

freshness in real-time monitoring applications. However, this metric falls
short in many scenarios, especially when quantifying the mismatch between the
current and the estimated states. To circumvent this issue, in this paper, we
adopt the age of incorrect information metric (AoII) that considers the
quantified mismatch between the source and the knowledge at the destination
while tracking the impact of freshness. We consider for that a problem where a
central entity pulls the information from remote sources that evolve according
to a Markovian Process. It selects at each time slot which sources should send
their updates. As the scheduler does not know the actual state of the remote
sources, it estimates at each time the value of AoII based on the Markovian
sources' parameters. Its goal is to keep the time average of the AoII function
as small as possible. For that purpose, We develop a scheduling scheme based on
Whittle's index policy. To that extent, we use the Lagrangian Relaxation
Approach and establish that the dual problem has an optimal threshold policy.
Building on that, we compute the expressions of Whittle's indices. Finally, we
provide some numerical results to highlight the performance of our derived
policy compared to the classical AoI metric.

design an API($\alpha$) procedure that employs conservative policy updates and
enjoys better performance bounds than the naive API approach. We discuss how

  Modulation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The idea of Media-based Modulation (MBM) is to embed information in the
variations of the transmission media (channel states). Using an RF closure with
$w$ RF walls, MBM creates a set of $2^w$ select-able states for the end-to-end
channel. Each state represents an index of an MBM constellation point. In each
state, the wave (tone) emanating from the transmit antenna experiences many
pseudo-random back-and-forth reflections within the RF closure. The RF signal,
upon finally leaving the RF closure, further propagates in the rich scattering
environment to reach the receiver. This results in an independent complex
channel gain to each receive antenna. As a result, coordinates of different MBM
constellation points (vectors of channel gains formed over received antennas)
will be independent of each other. This is unlike legacy transmission schemes
where a fixed constellation structure used at the transmitter will be
multiplied by a fixed, but random, channel gain. Due to this independence
property, MBM offers several advantages vs. legacy systems, including
""additivity of information over multiple receive antennas (regardless of the
number of transmit antennas)"", and ""inherent diversity over a static fading
channel"". This work studies the Diversity-Multiplexing Trade-off of an MBM
constellation. Analytical expressions are provided that demonstrate the
advantages of MBM vs. legacy systems. In particular, it is shown that a

NuSTAR observations reveal that the source transitioned from a bright soft
state with unabsorbed, bolometric ($0.1$-$100$ keV) flux $F=6.9 \pm 0.1 \times
10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, to a low hard state with flux $F=2.85
\pm 0.04 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. Given a distance of
$3.3$ kpc, inferred via association of the source with the GLIMPSE-C01 cluster,
these fluxes correspond to an Eddington fraction of order $10^{-3}$ for an
accreting neutron star of mass $M=1.4M_\odot$, or even lower for a more massive
accretor. However, the source spectra exhibit strong relativistic reflection
features, indicating the presence of an accretion disk which extends close to
the accretor, for which we measure a high spin, $a=0.967\pm0.013$. In addition
to a change in flux and spectral shape, we find evidence for other changes
between the soft and hard states, including moderate disk truncation with the
inner disk radius increasing from $R_\mathrm{in}\approx3\,R_\mathrm{g}$ to
$R_\mathrm{in}\approx8\,R_\mathrm{g}$, narrow Fe emission whose centroid
decreases from $6.8\pm0.1$ keV to $6.3 \pm 0.1$ keV, and an increase in
low-frequency ($10^{-3}$-$10^{-1}$ Hz) variability. Due to the high spin we
conclude that the source is likely to be a black hole rather than a neutron
star, and we discuss physical interpretations of the low apparent luminosity as
well as the narrow Fe emission.

probabilistic inference in the presence of (unknown) causal mechanisms can be
tractable for models that have traditionally been viewed as intractable. This
result was reported recently to facilitate model-based supervised learning but
it can be interpreted in a causality context as follows. One can compile a
non-parametric causal graph into an arithmetic circuit that supports inference
in time linear in the circuit size. The circuit is also non-parametric so it
can be used to estimate parameters from data and to further reason (in linear
time) about the causal graph parametrized by these estimates. Moreover, the
circuit size can sometimes be bounded even when the treewidth of the causal
graph is not, leading to tractable inference on models that have been deemed
intractable previously. This has been enabled by a new technique that can
exploit causal mechanisms computationally but without needing to know their
identities (the classical setup in causal inference). Our goal is to provide a
causality-oriented exposure to these new results and to speculate on how they
may potentially contribute to more scalable and versatile causal inference.

the distribution of the added noise, the compressed examples converge, in

training data (or the dimension of the training data) increases. In this sense,
the utility of the data for learning is essentially maintained, while reducing
storage and privacy leakage by quantifiable amounts. We present experimental
results on the CelebA dataset for gender classification and find that our
suggested pipeline delivers in practice on the promise of the theory: the
individuals in the images are unrecognizable (or less recognizable, depending
on the noise level), overall storage of the data is substantially reduced, with
no essential loss (and in some cases a slight boost) to the classification
accuracy. As an added bonus, our experiments suggest that our method yields a
substantial boost to robustness in the face of adversarial test data.

causality-aware machine learning tasks. Limitations of current evaluation

first main contribution is to point out a number of weaknesses of commonly used

related to multiple periods and variation in treatment timing that have been
emphasized in the literature, we show that, even in the case with only two time
periods, TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) paths of untreated
potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates (as
opposed to only the change in the covariates over time), (ii) paths of
untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, and (iii)
violations of linearity conditions for outcomes over time and/or the propensity
score. Even in cases where none of the previous three issues hold, we show that
TWFE regressions can suffer from negative weighting and weight-reversal issues.
Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect
parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases. Second, we extend these
arguments to the case of multiple periods and variation in treatment timing.
Third, we provide simple diagnostics for assessing the extent of
misspecification bias arising due to TWFE regressions. Finally, we propose
alternative (and simple) estimation strategies that can circumvent these issues

knowing in advance the positions of the UAVs and their traffic demand to
determine the FGW position and the queue size of the UAVs, in order to maximize
the aggregate throughput and provide stochastic delay guarantees. GPQM is
evaluated by means of ns-3 simulations, considering a realistic wireless

goal-oriented conversational systems. Whether the user is satisfied with the
system largely depends on the fulfillment of the user's needs, which can be
implicitly reflected by users' dialogue acts. However, existing studies often
neglect the sequential transitions of dialogue act or rely heavily on annotated
dialogue act labels when utilizing dialogue acts to facilitate USE. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework, namely USDA, to incorporate the sequential
dynamics of dialogue acts for predicting user satisfaction, by jointly learning
User Satisfaction Estimation and Dialogue Act Recognition tasks. In specific,
we first employ a Hierarchical Transformer to encode the whole dialogue
context, with two task-adaptive pre-training strategies to be a second-phase
in-domain pre-training for enhancing the dialogue modeling ability. In terms of
the availability of dialogue act labels, we further develop two variants of
USDA to capture the dialogue act information in either supervised or
unsupervised manners. Finally, USDA leverages the sequential transitions of
both content and act features in the dialogue to predict the user satisfaction.
Experimental results on four benchmark goal-oriented dialogue datasets across
different applications show that the proposed method substantially and
consistently outperforms existing methods on USE, and validate the important
role of dialogue act sequences in USE.

Therefore, this paper considers the throughput and trajectory optimization of

provide on-demand terabits per second (TB/s) services to an urban area along

Thus, a framework is proposed to address these challenges, where a joint
UAVs-GUs association, transmit power, and the trajectory optimization problem
is studied. The formulated problem is mixed-integer non-linear programming
(MINLP), which is NP-hard to solve. Consequently, an iterative algorithm is
proposed to solve three sub-problems iteratively, i.e., UAVs-GUs association,
transmit power, and trajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm increased the throughput by up to 10%, 68.9%, and

controllers may track the desired complicated trajectories, the tilting angles
are required to change relatively fast or in large scale during the flight,
which turns to be a challenge in application. The recent gait plan for a
tilt-rotor may solve this problem; the tilting angles are fixed or vary in a
predetermined pattern without being maneuvered by the control algorithm.
Carefully avoiding the singular decoupling matrix, several attitudes can be
tracked without changing the tilting angles frequently. While the position was
not directly regulated in that research, which left the position-tracking still
an open question. In this research, we elucidate the coupling relationship
between the position and the attitude. Based on this, we design the
position-tracking controller, adopting feedback linearization. A cat-trot gait
is further designed for a tilt-rotor to track the reference; three types of
references are designed for our tracking experiments: setpoint, uniform
rectilinear motion, and uniform circular motion. The significant improvement

data privately. To address the issue of privacy-preserving in collaborative
learning, secure outsourced computation and federated learning are two typical
methods. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks for these two methods when they
are leveraged in cooperative learning. For secure outsourced computation,
semi-honest servers need to be introduced. Once the outsourced servers collude
or perform other active attacks, the privacy of data will be disclosed. For
federated learning, it is difficult to apply to the scenarios where vertically
partitioned data are distributed over multiple parties. In this work, we
propose a multi-party mixed protocol framework, ABG$^n$, which effectively
implements arbitrary conversion between Arithmetic sharing (A), Boolean sharing

following the meta-policy and ""exploiting"" the offline dataset by staying close
to the behavior policy. Motivated by such empirical analysis, we explore
model-based offline Meta-RL with regularized Policy Optimization (MerPO), which
learns a meta-model for efficient task structure inference and an informative
meta-policy for safe exploration of out-of-distribution state-actions. In
particular, we devise a new meta-Regularized model-based Actor-Critic (RAC)
method for within-task policy optimization, as a key building block of MerPO,
using conservative policy evaluation and regularized policy improvement; and
the intrinsic tradeoff therein is achieved via striking the right balance
between two regularizers, one based on the behavior policy and the other on the
meta-policy. We theoretically show that the learnt policy offers guaranteed
improvement over both the behavior policy and the meta-policy, thus ensuring
the performance improvement on new tasks via offline Meta-RL. Experiments
corroborate the superior performance of MerPO over existing offline Meta-RL
methods.

  Visual-semantic Embedding Model",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The thumbnail, as the first sight of a micro-video, plays a pivotal role in
attracting users to click and watch. While in the real scenario, the more the
thumbnails satisfy the users, the more likely the micro-videos will be clicked.
In this paper, we aim to select the thumbnail of a given micro-video that meets
most users` interests. Towards this end, we present a multi-label
visual-semantic embedding model to estimate the similarity between the pair of
each frame and the popular topics that users are interested in. In this model,
the visual and textual information is embedded into a shared semantic space,
whereby the similarity can be measured directly, even the unseen words.
Moreover, to compare the frame to all words from the popular topics, we devise
an attention embedding space associated with the semantic-attention projection.
With the help of these two embedding spaces, the popularity score of a frame,
which is defined by the sum of similarity scores over the corresponding visual
information and popular topic pairs, is achieved. Ultimately, we fuse the
visual representation score and the popularity score of each frame to select
the attractive thumbnail for the given micro-video. Extensive experiments
conducted on a real-world dataset have well-verified that our model
significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.

To address this issue, some existing methods put restrictive constraints on the
optimization space of the new task for minimizing the interference to old
tasks. However, this may lead to unsatisfactory performance for the new task,
especially when the new task is strongly correlated with old tasks. To tackle
this challenge, we propose Trust Region Gradient Projection (TRGP) for
continual learning to facilitate the forward knowledge transfer based on an
efficient characterization of task correlation. Particularly, we introduce a
notion of `trust region' to select the most related old tasks for the new task
in a layer-wise and single-shot manner, using the norm of gradient projection
onto the subspace spanned by task inputs. Then, a scaled weight projection is
proposed to cleverly reuse the frozen weights of the selected old tasks in the
trust region through a layer-wise scaling matrix. By jointly optimizing the
scaling matrices and the model, where the model is updated along the directions
orthogonal to the subspaces of old tasks, TRGP can effectively prompt knowledge
transfer without forgetting. Extensive experiments show that our approach
achieves significant improvement over related state-of-the-art methods.

intimately related to the separation between the spikes to recover. A novel
notion of stability of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the

constrained to use low resolution quantizers --digital to analog and analog to

to reduced data rate and increased out-of-band emission noise. In this paper, a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with linear transceivers using low
resolution DACs and ADCs is considered. An information-theoretic analysis of
the system to model the effect of quantization on spectrospatial power
distribution and capacity of the system is provided. More precisely, it is
shown that the impact of quantization can be accurately described via a linear
model with additive independent Gaussian noise. This model in turn leads to
simple and intuitive expressions for spectrospatial power distribution of the
transmitter and a lower bound on the achievable rate of the system.
Furthermore, the derived model is validated through simulations and numerical
evaluations, where it is shown to accurately predict both spectral and spatial
power distributions.

attention. For LFR, the adversarial training scheme is popularly employed as is
done in the generative adversarial network type algorithms. The choice of a

this regard, prior PTPM optimization with the masked language modeling task can
be interpreted as learning a sequence prompt (Seq prompt) that enables PTPMs to
capture the sequential dependency between amino acids. To incorporate
conformational knowledge to PTPMs, we propose an interaction-conformation
prompt (IC prompt) that is learned through back-propagation with the
protein-protein interaction task. As an instantiation, we present a
conformation-aware pre-trained protein model that learns both sequence and
interaction-conformation prompts in a multi-task setting. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on nine protein datasets. Results confirm our
expectation that using the sequence prompt does not hurt PTPMs' performance on
sequence-related tasks while incorporating the interaction-conformation prompt
significantly improves PTPMs' performance on tasks where conformational
knowledge counts. We also show the learned prompts can be combined and extended
to deal with new complex tasks.

defining which people or groups, in what proportion, determine the classifier's

centrally feature women and Black jurors, who are commonly targets of online

voxel-level label accuracy are scarce due to the cost of acquiring them. This
problem is exacerbated further in domains like medical imaging, where there is
no single ground truth label, resulting in large amounts of repeat variability
in the labels. Therefore, training reconstruction networks to generalize better

traditional semi-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction often
necessitate handcrafting a differentiable regularizer specific to some given

supervise reconstruction models using their own denoised output as soft labels.
SUD unifies stochastic averaging and spatial denoising techniques under a
spatio-temporal denoising framework and alternates denoising and model weight
update steps in an optimization framework for semi-supervision. As example
applications, we apply SUD to two problems arising from biomedical imaging --

stellar models with varying initial mass as they evolve past the main sequence,
and we examine the red supergiant (RSG) properties in detail. For each mass, we
vary the initial rotation up to $\sim$ 300 $km\:s^{-1}$, and test two different
overshoot parameters. Overall, the acceptable initial mass range is 12 to 25
$M_\odot$, but for non-rotating models only, the range is decreased to 15 to 24
$M_\odot$. Also for rotating models, we find that $v/v_{\rm K} = 0.3$ is the
upper limit for initial rotation, as more rapidly rotating models are unable to
fit to Betelgeuse's surface abundances as an RSG. In addition, we report two
possibilities for the current stage of evolution, core helium burning or core
carbon burning and beyond. We find that certain 17 $M_\odot$ models could fit

dark fermion $(\bar{\chi}, \chi)$ interacting with the Standard Model only
through a complex messenger scalar $S$ which is an electroweak singlet. New
sources of CP violation reside in the most general scalar potential involving
the doublet $H$ and the singlet $S$, as well as in the dark Yukawa coupling
between $S$ and $(\bar{\chi}, \chi)$. We study current experimental constraints
from Higgs measurements, searches for new scalars at the LHC, precision
electroweak measurements, EDM measurements, dark matter relic density, as well
as direct and indirect detections of dark matter. A smoking-gun signature of CP
violation could come from the Higgs-to-Higgs decays, $h_3\to h_2h_1$, where
$h_3/h_2/h_1$ are the heaviest scalar, second heaviest scalar and the SM-like
125-GeV Higgs, respectively. Taking into account other Higgs-to-Higgs decays,
such as $h_3\to 2h_2$ and $h_3/h_2\to 2h_1$, then gives rise to novel $3h_1$

present four benchmarks and show the event rates for $3h_1$ and $4h_1$ final

Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, I studied 53 WZ Sge stars to examine this suggestion. The
analysis indicated that the absolute magnitudes when ordinary superhumps appear
are strongly dependent on orbital inclinations, which is consistent with what
is expected for the projected area for optical thick accretion disks. I showed
that there is a linear relation between these absolute magnitudes and
logarithmic amplitudes of early superhumps, which are also dependent on the
inclinations. I confirmed that the magnitude when ordinary superhumps appear
can be used as the standard candle for WZ Sge stars particularly when the
amplitude of early superhumps is observationally known. The resultant median
absolute magnitude when ordinary superhumps appear was $+$5.4 (for an average
inclination of 1 radian). A few objects with multiple rebrightenings, which are
good candidates for period bouncers, showed slightly fainter absolute
magnitudes, although the majority of the same class of objects follows the
relation. Using the relation, I derived an empirical relation between the
inclination and the amplitude of early superhumps. I applied the relation to
MASTER OT J030227.28$+$191754.5, which was initially considered as a possible

we conduct multi-object spectroscopic observations with Hectospec on the MMT,
covering an area out to 5 virial radii from the cluster center, and get
improved completeness and membership. Using this new data, we calculate
multiple dynamical indicators including gaussianity, distance offset, and
velocity offset. These indicators suggest that A2261 is moderately relaxed.
However, Dressler-Shectman test reveals a group candidate to the south, at a
projected distance that is near the virial radius, and that overlaps with an
X-ray tail-like feature. One of the galaxies associated with that group would
be sufficiently bright to reduce the fossil magnitude gap. This raises the
possibility that A2261 could have recently transit in fossil status, if the
group had previously crossed the cluster and is only now found outside. In the
cluster outskirts, we see an extended feature of galaxies located on the
opposite side of the cluster to the group candidate. On even larger scales, we
find this feature connects, both on the sky and in velocity space, with a long
(~4.4Mpc) filamentary structure in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. This
could support the idea that a group was fed into the cluster through the
filament, temporarily breaking the fossil status, and resulting in a minor
merger that weakly disturbed the intracluster medium of the cluster.

essential step in mining, both during exploration (before mining) and in the
mining process. During exploration, sparse but high-quality data are gathered
to assess the overall orebody. During the mining process, boundary positions
and material properties are refined as the mine progresses. This refinement is
facilitated through drilling, material logging, and chemical assaying. Material
type logging suffers from a high degree of variability due to factors such as
the diversity in mineralization and geology, the subjective nature of human
measurement even by experts, and human error in manually recording results.
While laboratory-based chemical assaying is much more precise, it is
time-consuming and costly and does not always capture or correlate boundary
positions between all material types. This leads to significant challenges and
financial implications for the industry, as the accuracy of production
blasthole logging and assaying processes is essential for resource evaluation,
planning, and execution of mine plans. To overcome these challenges, this work
reports on a pilot study to automate the process of material logging and
chemical assaying. A machine learning approach has been trained on features
extracted from measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data, logged from autonomous
drilling systems (ADS). MWD data facilitate the construction of profiles of
physical drilling parameters as a function of hole depth. A hypothesis is
formed to link these drilling parameters to the underlying mineral composition.
The results of the pilot study discussed in this paper demonstrate the
feasibility of this process, with correlation coefficients of up to 0.92 for
chemical assays and 93% accuracy for material detection, depending on the
material or assay type and their generalization across the different spatial
regions.

Finally, a simple formula is given that the assisted distillable coherence

makes the experimental research of assisted coherence distillation possible and
convenient, especially for the case that the system and its auxiliary are in

prepare two types of tripartite correlated states, i.e., the $W$-type and
GHZ-type states in a linear optical setup, and experimentally explore the
assisted coherence distillation. Theoretical and experimental results agree
well to verify the distribution inequalities given by us. Three measures of

the critical problems which could reduce the array gain and degrade the data
rate substantially. However, the traditional phase-shifters-based hybrid
beamforming architectures cannot tackle this issue due to the frequency-flat
property of the phase shifters. In this paper, to combat the beam squint while
keeping high energy efficiency, a novel dynamic-subarray with fixed

studies which use the complicated adjustable TTDs, the DS-FTTD architecture has
lower power consumption and hardware complexity, thanks to the low-cost FTTDs.
Furthermore, a low-complexity row-decomposition (RD) algorithm is proposed to
design hybrid beamforming matrices for the DS-FTTD architecture. Extensive
simulation results show that, by using the RD algorithm, the DS-FTTD
architecture achieves near-optimal array gain and significantly higher energy
efficiency than the existing architectures. Moreover, the spectral efficiency
of DS-FTTD architecture with the RD algorithm is robust to the imperfect

developers. One modality of communication is a commit message, in which
developers describe the changes they make in a repository. As such, commit
messages serve as an ""audit trail"" by which developers can understand how the
source code of a project has changed-and why. Hence, the quality of commit
messages affects the effectiveness of communication among developers. Commit
messages are often of poor quality as developers lack time and motivation to
craft a good message. Several automatic approaches have been proposed to
generate commit messages. However, these are based on uncurated datasets
including considerable proportions of poorly phrased commit messages. In this
multi-method study, we first define what constitutes a ""good"" commit message,
and then establish what proportion of commit messages lack information using a
sample of almost 1,600 messages from five highly active open source projects.
We find that an average of circa 44% of messages could be improved, suggesting
the use of uncurated datasets may be a major threat when commit message
generators are trained with such data. We also observe that prior work has not
considered semantics of commit messages, and there is surprisingly little
guidance available for writing good commit messages. To that end, we develop a
taxonomy based on recurring patterns in commit messages' expressions. Finally,
we investigate whether ""good"" commit messages can be automatically identified;
such automation could prompt developers to write better commit messages.

In the problem, an online decision maker seeks to optimize the allocation of
multiple capacity-limited inventories over a slotted horizon, while the
allocation constraints and revenue function come online at each slot. The
problem is challenging as we need to allocate limited inventories under
adversarial revenue functions and allocation constraints, while our decisions
are coupled among multiple inventories and different slots. We propose a
divide-and-conquer approach that allows us to decompose the problem into
several single inventory problems and solve it in a two-step manner with almost
no optimality loss in terms of competitive ratio (CR). Our approach provides
new angles, insights and results to the problem, which differs from the
widely-adopted primal-and-dual framework. Specifically, when the gradients of
the revenue functions are bounded in a positive range, we show that our
approach can achieve a tight CR that is optimal when the number of inventories
is small, which is better than all existing ones. For an arbitrary number of
inventories, the CR we achieve is within an additive constant of one to a lower
bound of the best possible CR among all online algorithms for the problem. We
further characterize a general condition for generalizing our approach to
different applications. For example, for a generalized one-way trading problem
with price elasticity, where no previous results are available, our approach
obtains an online algorithm that achieves the optimal CR up to a constant
factor.

multiband topological characterization of the degeneracy nodes through

However, these frame charges are not integers, and non-Abelian signatures
emerge when braiding between adjacent band nodal lines occurs, which flips the

{\Gamma} point serves as the source or sink of such frame charge flow due to a
hidden braiding induced by the often-ignored electrostatic mode at
zero-frequency. We use biaxial photonic crystals as examples and show how

with our study. Our active measurements show a slowly but steadily increasing
adoption of DoQ and reveal a high week-over-week fluctuation, which reflects
the ongoing development process: As DoQ is still in standardization,
implementations and services undergo rapid changes. Analyzing the response
times of DoQ, we find that roughly 40% of measurements show considerably higher
handshake times than expected, which traces back to the enforcement of the
traffic amplification limit despite successful validation of the client's
address. However, DoQ already outperforms DoT as well as DoH, which makes it
the best choice for encrypted DNS to date.

accurate representation of the graphs in an unsupervised manner, to obtain
transferable representations of them for diverse downstream tasks. Predictive
learning and contrastive learning are the two most prevalent approaches for
graph self-supervised learning. However, they have their own drawbacks. While
the predictive learning methods can learn the contextual relationships between
neighboring nodes and edges, they cannot learn global graph-level similarities.
Contrastive learning, while it can learn global graph-level similarities, its
objective to maximize the similarity between two differently perturbed graphs
may result in representations that cannot discriminate two similar graphs with
different properties. To tackle such limitations, we propose a framework that
aims to learn the exact discrepancy between the original and the perturbed
graphs, coined as Discrepancy-based Self-supervised LeArning (D-SLA).
Specifically, we create multiple perturbations of the given graph with varying
degrees of similarity, and train the model to predict whether each graph is the
original graph or the perturbed one. Moreover, we further aim to accurately
capture the amount of discrepancy for each perturbed graph using the graph edit
distance. We validate our D-SLA on various graph-related downstream tasks,
including molecular property prediction, protein function prediction, and link
prediction tasks, on which ours largely outperforms relevant baselines.

fully developed because of 1) intrinsic complexity involving constant
divergence flow on small scale and irrotational flow on large scale; 2) lack of
self-closed description for peculiar velocity; and 3) mathematically
challenging. To better understand dark matter flow, kinematic and dynamic
relations must be developed for different types of flow. In this paper, a
compact derivation is presented to formulate general kinematic relations of any
order for incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. Results
are validated by N-body simulation. Dynamic relations can only be determined
from self-closed description of velocity evolution. On large scale, we found i)
third order velocity correlation can be related to density correlation or
pairwise velocity; ii) effective viscosity in adhesion model originates from
velocity fluctuations; iii) negative viscosity is due to inverse energy
cascade; iv) $q$th order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(q+2)/2}$ for
odd $q$ and $\propto a^{q/2}$ for even $q$; v) overdensity is proportional to
density correlation on the same scale,
$\langle\delta\rangle\propto\langle\delta\delta'\rangle$; vi) (reduced)
velocity dispersion is proportional to density correlation on the same scale.
On small scale, self-closed description for velocity evolution is developed by
decomposing velocity into motion in halo and motion of halos. Vorticity,
enstrophy, and energy evolution can all be derived subsequently. Dynamic
relation is derived to relate second and third order correlations. Third moment
of pairwise velocity is determined by energy cascade rate $\epsilon_u$ or
$\langle(\Delta u_L)^3\rangle\propto\epsilon_uar$. Combined kinematic and
dynamic relations determines the exponential and one-fourth power law velocity
correlations on large and small scales, respectively.

Our aim is to probe the inner shape of dark matter haloes, in particular the
existence of a core. We adopt the following working hypothesis: any
group/cluster scale dark matter clump introduced in the modelling should be
associated with a luminous counterpart. We also adopt some additional well
motivated priors in the analysis, even if this degrades the quality of the fit,
quantified using the RMS between the observed and model generated images. In
particular, in order to alleviate the degeneracy between the smooth underlying
component and the galaxy scale perturbers, we use the results from
spectroscopic campaigns by Bergamini et al. (2019) allowing to fix the mass of
the galaxy scale component. In the unimodal galaxy cluster AS1063, a cored mass
model is favored with respect to a non cored mass model, and this is also the
case in the multimodal cluster MACSJ0416. In the unimodal cluster MACSJ1206, we
fail to reproduce the strong lensing constraints using a parametric approach
within the adopted working hypothesis. We then successfully add a mild
perturbation in the form of a superposition of B-spline potentials which allows
to get a decent fit (RMS=0.5""), finally finding that a cored mass model is
favored. Overall, our analysis suggest evidence for cored cluster scale dark
matter haloes. These findings may be useful to interpret within alternative
dark matter scenario, as self interacting dark matter. We propose a working
hypothesis for parametric strong lensing modelling where the quest for the best
fit model will be balanced by the quest for presenting a physically motivated
mass model, in particular by imposing priors.

flows onto each other under FIFO is already a challenging task. Yet, the
fastest available NC FIFO analysis suffers from limitations resulting in
unnecessarily loose bounds. A feature called Flow Prolongation (FP) has been
shown to improve delay bound accuracy significantly. Unfortunately, FP needs to
be executed within the NC FIFO analysis very often and each time it creates an
exponentially growing set of alternative networks with prolongations. FP
therefore does not scale and has been out of reach for the exhaustive analysis

contain semantically matched audio-visual information. Thus, these semantically
correlated pairs, ""hard positives"", are mistakenly grouped as negatives. Our
key contribution is showing that hard positives can give similar response maps
to the corresponding pairs. Our approach incorporates these hard positives by
adding their response maps into a contrastive learning objective directly. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on VGG-SS and SoundNet-Flickr
test sets, showing favorable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

salesperson starts in city 1, then visits some cities in ascending order,
reaches city $n$, and returns to city 1 visiting the remaining cities in
descending order. However, in the ascending and descending direction, the order
of neighboring cities can be inverted (a step-back). It is known that on

However, applying it to microcontroller firmware incurs many challenges. For
example, rehosting-based solutions cannot accurately model peripheral behaviors
and thus cannot be used to fuzz the corresponding driver code. In this work, we
present $\mu$AFL, a hardware-in-the-loop approach to fuzzing microcontroller
firmware. It leverages debugging tools in existing embedded system development
to construct an AFL-compatible fuzzing framework. Specifically, we use the
debug dongle to bridge the fuzzing environment on the PC and the target
firmware on the microcontroller device. To collect code coverage information
without costly code instrumentation, $\mu$AFL relies on the ARM ETM hardware
debugging feature, which transparently collects the instruction trace and
streams the results to the PC. However, the raw ETM data is obscure and needs
enormous computing resources to recover the actual instruction flow. We
therefore propose an alternative representation of code coverage, which retains
the same path sensitivity as the original AFL algorithm, but can directly work
on the raw ETM data without matching them with disassembled instructions. To
further reduce the workload, we use the DWT hardware feature to selectively
collect runtime information of interest. We evaluated $\mu$AFL on two real
evaluation boards from two major vendors: NXP and STMicroelectronics. With our
prototype, we discovered ten zero-day bugs in the driver code shipped with the
SDK of STMicroelectronics and three zero-day bugs in the SDK of NXP. Eight CVEs
have been allocated for them. Considering the wide adoption of vendor SDKs in
real products, our results are alarming.

velocimetry, in participants with aortoiliac stenosis. In this prospective
study, participants with a recently diagnosed aortoiliac stenosis underwent
HFR-CEUS measurements of the pre- and poststenotic vessel segments.
Two-dimensional quantification of blood flow was achieved by performing PIV
analysis, which was based on pairwise cross-correlation of the HFR-CEUS images.
Visual inspection of the entire data set was performed by five observers to
evaluate the ability of the technique to enable adequate visualization of blood
flow. The contrast-to-background ratio and average vector correlation were
calculated. In two participants who showed flow disturbances, the flow
complexity and vorticity were calculated. Results: 35 participants were
included. Visual scoring showed that flow quantification was achieved in 41 of
42 locations. In 25 locations, one or multiple issues occurred that limited
optimal flow quantification, including loss of correlation during systole,
shadow regions, a short vessel segment in the image plane, and loss of contrast
during diastole. In the remaining 16 locations, optimal quantification was
achieved. The contrast-to-background ratio was higher during systole than
during diastole, whereas the vector correlation was lower. Flow complexity and
vorticity were high in regions with disturbed flow. Blood flow quantification
with US velocimetry is feasible in patients with an aortoiliac stenosis, but
several challenges must be overcome before implementation into clinical
practice.

e.g., machine learning. It is demonstrated that data preprocessing, most
important normalization by means of biomarkers and equal temporal spacing of
the scattered data, is crucial. In terms of the latter, downsampling to a
weekly spaced series is sufficient. Also, data smoothing turned out to be
essential, not only for communication of the signal dynamics but likewise for
regressions, nowcasting and forecasting. Correlation of the signal with
epidemic indicators require multivariate regression as the signal alone cannot
explain the dynamics but simple linear regression proofed to be a suitable tool
for compensation. It was also demonstrated that short term prediction (7 days)
is accurate with simple models (exponential smoothing or autoregressive models)
but forecast accuracy deteriorates fast for longer periods.

the gap between high data rates and low delay. This work considers the problem
of data streaming under mixed delay constraints over a single communication

random linear network coding (LAC-RLNC) approach with forward error correction.
LAC-RLNC is a variable-to-variable coding scheme, i.e., variable recovered
information data at the receiver over variable short block length and rate is
proposed. Specifically, for data streaming with base and enhancement layers of
content, we characterize a high dimensional throughput-delay trade-off managed
by the adaptive causal layering coding scheme. The base layer is designed to
satisfy the strict delay constraints, as it contains the data needed to allow
the streaming service. Then, the sender can manage the throughput-delay
trade-off of the second layer by adjusting the retransmission rate a priori and
posterior as the enhancement layer, that contains the remaining data to augment
the streaming service's quality, is with the relax delay constraints. We
numerically show that the layered network coding approach can dramatically
increase performance. We demonstrate that LAC-RLNC compared with the
non-layered approach gains a factor of three in mean and maximum delay for the
base layer, close to the lower bound, and factor two for the enhancement layer.

The wide usage of wearable accelerometer-based activity trackers in recent

tracker data relies heavily on aggregating minute-level PA records into
day-level summary statistics, in which important information of PA
temporal/diurnal patterns is lost. In this paper we propose a novel functional
data analysis approach based on Riemann manifolds for modeling PA and its
longitudinal changes. We model smoothed minute-level PA of a day as
one-dimensional Riemann manifolds and longitudinal changes in PA in different
visits as deformations between manifolds. The variability in changes of PA
among a cohort of subjects is characterized via variability in the deformation.
Functional principal component analysis is further adopted to model the
deformations and PC scores are used as a proxy in modeling the relation between
changes in PA and health outcomes and/or interventions. We conduct
comprehensive analyses on data from two clinical trials: Reach for Health (RfH)
and Metabolism, Exercise and Nutrition at UCSD (MENU), focusing on the effect
of interventions on longitudinal changes in PA patterns and how different modes
of changes in PA influence weight loss, respectively. The proposed approach
reveals unique modes of changes including overall enhanced PA, boosted morning
PA, and shifts of active hours specific to each study cohort. The results bring
new insights into the study of longitudinal changes in PA and health and have
the potential to facilitate designing of effective health interventions and
guidelines.

compensated 4D (3D+respiration) $T_2$-weighted turbo spin echo sequence with
application to radiology and MR-guided radiotherapy.
  Methods: k-space data are continuously acquired using a rewound Cartesian
acquisition with spiral profile ordering (rCASPR) to provide matching contrast
to the conventional linear phase encode ordering and to sort data into multiple
respiratory phases. Low-resolution respiratory-correlated 4D images were
reconstructed with compressed sensing and used to estimate non-rigid
deformation vector fields, which were subsequently used for a motion
compensated image reconstruction. rCASPR sampling was compared to linear and
CASPR sampling in terms of point-spread-function (PSF) and image contrast with
in silico, phantom and in vivo experiments. Reconstruction parameters for
low-resolution 4D-MRI (spatial resolution and temporal regularization) were
determined using a grid search. The proposed motion compensated rCASPR was
evaluated in eight healthy volunteers and compared to free-breathing scans with
linear sampling. Image quality was compared based on visual inspection and
quantitatively by means of the gradient entropy.
  Results: rCASPR provided a superior PSF (similar in ky and narrower in kz)
and showed no considerable differences in images contrast compared to linear
sampling. The optimal 4D-MRI reconstruction parameters were spatial
resolution=$4.5 mm^3$ and $\lambda_t=10^{-4}$. The groupwise average gradient
entropy was 22.31 for linear, 22.20 for rCASPR, 22.14 for soft-gated rCASPR and
22.02 for motion compensated rCASPR.
  Conclusion: The proposed motion compensated rCASPR enables high quality
free-breathing T2-TSE with minimal changes in image contrast and scan time. The
proposed method therefore enables direct transfer of clinically used 3D TSE
sequences to free-breathing.

computation framework, CECILIA, offering PP building blocks to enable complex
operations privately. In addition to the adapted and common operations like
addition and multiplication, it offers multiplexer, most significant bit and
modulus conversion. The first two are novel in terms of methodology and the
last one is novel in terms of both functionality and methodology. CECILIA also
has two complex novel methods, which are the exact exponential of a public base
raised to the power of a secret value and the inverse square root of a secret
Gram matrix. We use CECILIA to realize the private inference on pre-trained
RKNs, which require more complex operations than most other DNNs, on the
structural classification of proteins as the first study ever accomplishing the
PP inference on RKNs. In addition to the successful private computation of
basic building blocks, the results demonstrate that we perform the exact and
fully private exponential computation, which is done by approximation in the

square root of a secret Gram matrix up to a certain privacy level, which has
not been addressed in the literature at all. We also analyze the scalability of
CECILIA to various settings on a synthetic dataset. The framework shows a great

  waveguides",,,"10.1103/PhysRevB.105.224314",,"physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The recent progress in the context of elastic metamaterials and modulated
waveguides with digitally controllable properties has opened new pathways to
overcome the limitations dictated by Hermitian Hamiltonians in mechanics. Among
the possible implementations, non-Hermitian, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems
with balanced gain and loss have emerged as an elegant mechanism to access
novel functionalities by lifting the non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional
points). Motivated by this, the paper deals with a non-Hermitian and
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric elastic waveguide with complex stiffness-modulation.
The strength of the stiffness-modulations, tailored in the form of a balanced
gain/loss, delineates a transition from unbroken to broken
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phases, where distinct Bloch-wave modes coalesce into
exceptional points. It is shown that, in the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
regime, and due to the interplay between real and imaginary components of the
elasticity, the waveguide operates as a phononic filter. When the strength of
the gain/loss interactions increases, the frequency gap closes and the bulk
bands degenerate into an exceptional point, where the system operates as a
waveguide with asymmetric scattering capabilities. The paper provides a
connection between the distinct wave modes that populate the non-Hermitian
degeneracies and the directional reflection/transmission capabilities. The
asymmetric behavior is herein explained by combining the dispersion properties
of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric rod, obtained through the plane wave expansion
method (PWEM), and the scattering matrix method (SMM) for a modulated slab
series-connected to semi-infinite media.

(CAE), for self-supervised representation pretraining. The goal is to pretrain
an encoder by solving the pretext task: estimate the masked patches from the
visible patches in an image. Our approach first feeds the visible patches into
the encoder, extracting the representations. Then, we make predictions from
visible patches to masked patches in the encoded representation space. We
introduce an alignment constraint, encouraging that the representations for
masked patches, predicted from the encoded representations of visible patches,
are aligned with the masked patch presentations computed from the encoder. In
other words, the predicted representations are expected to lie in the encoded
representation space, which empirically shows the benefit to representation
learning. Last, the predicted masked patch representations are mapped to the
targets of the pretext task through a decoder. In comparison to previous MIM
methods (e.g., BEiT) that couple the encoding and pretext task completion
roles, our approach benefits the separation of the representation learning
(encoding) role and the pretext task completion role, improving the
representation learning capacity and accordingly helping more on downstream
tasks. In addition, we present the explanations about why contrastive
pretraining and supervised pretraining perform similarly and why MIM
potentially performs better. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CAE
through superior transfer performance in downstream tasks: semantic
segmentation, and object detection and instance segmentation.

semiconducting chain. The number of nodal points (two) is robust under

efficiently. This work initiates and indicates possible topological phases of

wearable sensor-based methods commonly use data from electroencephalography,

individually and in multimodal fusion strategies. Whereas, methods based on
non-wearable sensors include strategies such as analyzing pupil dilation and

Whenever a stressful situation is encountered by an individual, physiological,
physical, or behavioral change is induced which help in coping with the

relationship between these stressful situations and the response of human

Here, we show that the node representations generated by the Transformer with
positional encoding do not necessarily capture structural similarity between
them. To address this issue, we propose the Structure-Aware Transformer, a
class of simple and flexible graph Transformers built upon a new self-attention
mechanism. This new self-attention incorporates structural information into the
original self-attention by extracting a subgraph representation rooted at each

automatically generating the subgraph representation and show theoretically
that the resulting representations are at least as expressive as the subgraph
representations. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance

Researchers investigate sophisticated Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN),
autoencoders, and other approaches to establish precise and robust algorithms
for face swapping. Achieved results show that the deep fake unsupervised
synthesis task has problems in terms of the visual quality of generated data.
These problems usually lead to high fake detection accuracy when an expert
analyzes them. The first problem is that existing image-to-image approaches do
not consider video domain specificity and frame-by-frame processing leads to
face jittering and other clearly visible distortions. Another problem is the
generated data resolution, which is low for many existing methods due to high
computational complexity. The third problem appears when the source face has
larger proportions (like bigger cheeks), and after replacement it becomes
visible on the face border. Our main goal was to develop such an approach that
could solve these problems and outperform existing solutions on a number of
clue metrics. We introduce a new face swap pipeline that is based on
FaceShifter architecture and fixes the problems stated above. With a new eye
loss function, super-resolution block, and Gaussian-based face mask generation
leads to improvements in quality which is confirmed during evaluation.

  depression from social media postings","12 pages",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Depression is a common mental illness that has to be detected and treated at
an early stage to avoid serious consequences. There are many methods and
modalities for detecting depression that involves physical examination of the
individual. However, diagnosing mental health using their social media data is
more effective as it avoids such physical examinations. Also, people express
their emotions well in social media, it is desirable to diagnose their mental
health using social media data. Though there are many existing systems that
detects mental illness of a person by analysing their social media data,
detecting the level of depression is also important for further treatment.
Thus, in this research, we developed a gold standard data set that detects the
levels of depression as `not depressed', `moderately depressed' and `severely
depressed' from the social media postings. Traditional learning algorithms were
employed on this data set and an empirical analysis was presented in this
paper. Data augmentation technique was applied to overcome the data imbalance.
Among the several variations that are implemented, the model with Word2Vec
vectorizer and Random Forest classifier on augmented data outperforms the other
variations with a score of 0.877 for both accuracy and F1 measure.

motion numerically and obtain the effect of different values of mass, nonlinear
gauge field and Gauss-Bonnet parameters on critical temperature and
condensation. Based on our results, increasing each of these three parameters
leads to lower temperatures and larger values of condensation. This phenomenon
is rooted in the fact that conductor/superconductor phase transition faces with
difficulty for higher effect of nonlinear and Gauss-Bonnet terms in the
presence of a massive field. In addition, we study the electrical conductivity
in holographic setup. In $D=4$, real and imaginary parts of conductivity in
holographic $s$- and $p$-wave models behave similarly and follow the same trend
as higher dimensions by showing the delta function and pole at low frequency
regime that Kramers-Kronig relation can connect these two parts of conductivity
to each other. We observe the appearance of a gap energy at $\omega_{g}\approx
8T_{c}$ at which shifts toward higher frequencies by diminishing temperature
and increasing the effect of nonlinear and Gauss-Bonnet terms. Conductivity in
$D = 3$ is far different from other dimensions. Even the real and imaginary
parts in $s$- and $p$-wave modes pursue various trends. For example in $\omega
\rightarrow 0$ limit, imaginary part in holographic $s$-wave model tends to
infinity but in $p$-wave model approaches to zero. However, the real parts in
both models show a delta function behavior. In general, real and imaginary
parts of conductivity in all cases that we study tend to a constant value in
$\omega \rightarrow \infty$ regime.

workhorse of many discrete optimization problems in machine learning
applications. Traditionally, the study of submodular functions was based on
binary function properties. However, such properties have an inherit weakness,
namely, if an algorithm assumes functions that have a particular property, then
it provides no guarantee for functions that violate this property, even when
the violation is very slight. Therefore, recent works began to consider
continuous versions of function properties. Probably the most significant among
these (so far) are the submodularity ratio and the curvature, which were
studied extensively together and separately.
  The monotonicity property of set functions plays a central role in submodular
maximization. Nevertheless, and despite all the above works, no continuous
version of this property has been suggested to date (as far as we know). This
is unfortunate since submoduar functions that are almost monotone often arise
in machine learning applications. In this work we fill this gap by defining the
monotonicity ratio, which is a continues version of the monotonicity property.
We then show that for many standard submodular maximization algorithms one can
prove new approximation guarantees that depend on the monotonicity ratio;
leading to improved approximation ratios for the common machine learning
applications of movie recommendation, quadratic programming and image
summarization.

Our work presents an elegant solution for the integration of temporal

a labelled graph. Being a dynamical system, the distribution of its closed
orbits may indicate the complexity of the space. For this purpose, prime orbit
and Mertens' orbit counting functions are introduced as a way to describe the
growth of the closed orbits. The asymptotic behaviours of these counting
functions can be implied from the analiticity of the Artin-Mazur zeta function
of the space. Despite having a closed-form expression, the zeta function is
expressed implicitly in terms of several signed subset matrices, and this makes
the study on its analyticity to be seemingly difficult. In this paper, we will
prove the asymptotic behaviours of the counting functions for a sofic shift via
its zeta function. This involves investigating the properties of the said
matrices. Suprisingly, the proof is rather short and only uses well-known facts
about a sofic shift, especially on its minimal right-resolving presentation.

critical data. People tend to employ TSTs as trusted basic tools and rarely
have any doubt about their reliability. This paper systematically uncovers the
failure mode of non-parametric TSTs through adversarial attacks and then
proposes corresponding defense strategies. First, we theoretically show that an
adversary can upper-bound the distributional shift which guarantees the
attack's invisibility. Furthermore, we theoretically find that the adversary
can also degrade the lower bound of a TST's test power, which enables us to
iteratively minimize the test criterion in order to search for adversarial
pairs. To enable TST-agnostic attacks, we propose an ensemble attack (EA)
framework that jointly minimizes the different types of test criteria. Second,
to robustify TSTs, we propose a max-min optimization that iteratively generates
adversarial pairs to train the deep kernels. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real-world datasets validate the adversarial vulnerabilities of
non-parametric TSTs and the effectiveness of our proposed defense. Source code

injection can lead to multiple luminosity peaks. The multiple luminosity peaks
caused by the variable thermal energy injection is found to be accompanied by
significant increase in photospheric temperature, and photospheric radii are
not significantly changed. We show that the bumpy light curves of SN 2015bn and

energy input by a factor of 2-3 for 5-20 days. However, not all the light-curve
bumps are accompanied by the clear photospheric temperature increase as
predicted by our synthetic models. In particular, the secondary light-curve
bump of SN 2019stc is accompanied by a temporal increase in photospheric radii
rather than temperature, which is not seen in our synthetic models. We,
therefore, conclude that not all the light-curve bumps observed in luminous

motivated or are not adapted to the different input modality of sign languages.
We explore challenges related to the representation of sign language data, the
collection of datasets, the need for interdisciplinary research and
requirements for moving beyond research, towards applications. Based on our
findings, we advocate for interdisciplinary research and to base future
research on linguistic analysis of sign languages. Furthermore, the inclusion
of deaf and hearing end users of sign language translation applications in use
case identification, data collection and evaluation is of the utmost importance
in the creation of useful sign language translation models. We recommend
iterative, human-in-the-loop, design and development of sign language
translation models.

change, a new challenging problem with more practical usability and scalability
to real-world deployment. Most existing re-id methods artificially assume the
clothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. This
condition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an average
person would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviate
this assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facet
to re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminative
representation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step further
towards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement of
person identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and more
tedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Compared
to conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drastically
more challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the same
person can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and times
with very distinct appearance. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce a novel
Curriculum Person Clustering (CPC) method that can adaptively regulate the
unsupervised clustering criterion according to the clustering confidence.
Experiments on three long-term person re-id datasets show that our CPC
outperforms SOTA unsupervised re-id methods and even closely matches the
supervised re-id models.

it usually requires training each pairwise combination of tasks together in
order to capture task relationships, at an extremely high computational cost.
In this work, we learn task relationships via an automated weighting framework,

to be fixed, Auto-Lambda is a gradient-based meta learning framework which
explores continuous, dynamic task relationships via task-specific weightings,
and can optimise any choice of combination of tasks through the formulation of
a meta-loss; where the validation loss automatically influences task weightings
throughout training. We apply the proposed framework to both multi-task and

Auto-Lambda achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared to
optimisation strategies designed specifically for each problem and data domain.
Finally, we observe that Auto-Lambda can discover interesting learning

and more practical extension of the standard 0-1 knapsack problem and the set

with nonnegative costs, and a total budget, BMCP aims to select some subsets
such that the total cost of selected subsets does not exceed the budget, and
the total weight of associated elements is maximized. In this paper, we propose
a variable depth local search algorithm (VDLS) for the BMCP. VDLS first
generates an initial solution by a greedy algorithm, then iteratively improves
the solution through a partial depth-first search method, that can improve the
solution by simultaneously changing the states (selected or not) of multiple
subsets. Such method allows VDLS to explore the solution space widely and
deeply, and to yield high-quality solutions. We further propose a neighbour
structure to boost the algorithm performance, that is, both subsets have a
neighbour relation if they have at least one common associated element. By
applying the neighbour structure, VDLS can adjust the selected subsets while
losing as few covered elements as possible. Since the existing BMCP benchmarks
only have simple structures and small scales, we design 60 new instances with
relatively large scales and complex structures to enrich the diversity of the
BMCP instances. Experimental results on 30 public instances and 60 new

energy and scalar variance in turbulence driven by a scalar-based volume force
in $M{\nabla}^{\beta} s'$ form associated with scalar fluctuations $s'$ in
wavenumber space relies on flux conservation equation. The equation has one
real solution and two complex solutions, which lead to four different cascade
processes, including inertial subrange (constant fluxes of kinetic energy and
scalar variance), CEF subrange (quasi-constant flux of kinetic energy), CSF
subrange (quasi-constant flux of scalar variance), and a new subrange with both
non-constant fluxes of kinetic energy and scalar variance in addition to
dissipation subrange. ${\beta}$ controls the cascade processes and the scaling
exponents. For the real solution, in the CEF subrange, ${\xi}_u$ is always
-5/3, while ${\xi}_s=-(6{\beta}+1)/3$. In the CSF subrange,
${\xi}_u=(4{\beta}-11)/5$ and ${\xi}_s=-(2{\beta}+7)/5$ which are both
consistent with the theory of Zhao and Wang (2021). Relying on ${\beta}$, the
transport of kinetic energy and scalar variance can be distinguished as four
cases. (1) When $\beta<3/2$ (except $\beta=2/3$), the CEF and CSF subranges are
coexisted, with the former located on the lower wavenumber side of the latter.
At ${\beta}=2/3$, a new inertial subrange with both ${\xi}_u$ and ${\xi}_s$
equal to -5/3 is present. (2) When $3/2<=\beta<2$, only the CEF subrange is
predicted. (3) At $\beta=2$, special and singular exponents of ${\xi}_u=-1$,
${\xi}_s=-3$, ${\lambda}_u=1$, and ${\lambda}_s=-1$ can be found, if $MN=1$.
Otherwise, a CSF subrange is predicted. (4) When $2<\beta<=4$, only the CSF
subrange is predicted. Thus, a complete transport picture of both kinetic
energy and scalar variance has been established for the type of forced
turbulence.

graph representation learning which maximizes the mutual information between
paired graph augmentations that share the same semantics. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to preserve semantics well during augmentations in view of the
diverse nature of graph data. Currently, data augmentations in GCL that are
designed to preserve semantics broadly fall into three unsatisfactory ways.
First, the augmentations can be manually picked per dataset by
trial-and-errors. Second, the augmentations can be selected via cumbersome
search. Third, the augmentations can be obtained by introducing expensive
domain-specific knowledge as guidance. All of these limit the efficiency and
more general applicability of existing GCL methods. To circumvent these crucial

graph data can preserve their semantics well during encoder perturbations while
not requiring manual trial-and-errors, cumbersome search or expensive domain
knowledge for augmentations selection. Also, we explain why SimGRACE can
succeed. Furthermore, we devise adversarial training scheme, dubbed
\textbf{AT-SimGRACE}, to enhance the robustness of graph contrastive learning

cold helium gas as a function of its density \(N\) is made difficult by the
fact that a significant fraction of electrons is localized in low mobility
bubbles. The measured mobility is a weighted average of the contributions of
the slow electron bubbles, whose mobility is determined by hydrodynamics, and
of the fast quasi-free electrons. A precise description of the fast electron
mobility is thus required. In the past we have developed a heuristic model that
proved succesful at rationalizing the electron mobility in argon and neon
gases. In order to validate it, we have carried out new accurate %electron
mobility measurements in helium gas in the temperature range $\textbf{26} \,
\text{K} < \text{\em T} < \textbf{300}\,$K at densities, in which the presence
of localized states is negligible. The analysis of these new data confirms the
validity of the model.

subject, we have opted for a compact exposition whose contents are a compromise

level and the space limitation born furthermore upon the final selection of the
topics, which cover the three items named in the title. Specifically, the first
part is devoted to the avatars of entropy in the traditional contexts: many
particle physics, information theory, and dynamical systems. This chronological
order helps to present the materials in a didactic manner. The axiomatic
approach will be also considered at this stage to show that, quite remarkably,
the essence of entropy can be encapsulated in a few basic properties. Inspired
by the classical entropies, further akin quantities have been proposed in the
course of time, mostly aimed at specific needs. A common denominator of those
addressed in the second part of this review is their major impact on research.
The final part shows that, along with its profound role in the theory, entropy
has interesting practical applications beyond information theory and
communications technology. For this sake we preferred examples from applied
mathematics, although there are certainly nice applications in, say, physics,
computer science and even social sciences. This review concludes with a

printing; understanding how droplets spread after impact is thus of utmost
importance. Such impacts may occur with different velocities on a variety of
substrates. The fluids may also be non-Newtonian and thus possess different
rheological properties. How the different properties such as surface roughness
and wettability, droplet viscosity and rheology as well as interfacial
properties affect the spreading dynamics of the droplets and the eventual drop
size after impact are unresolved questions. Most recent work focuses on the
maximum spreading diameter after impact and uses scaling laws to predict this.
In this paper we show that a proper rescaling of the spreading dynamics with
the maximum radius attained by the drop, and the impact velocity leads to a
unique single and thus universal curve for the variation of diameter versus
time. The validity of this universal functional shape is validated for
different liquids with different rheological properties as well as substrates
with different wettabilities. This universal function agrees with a recent
model that proposes a closed set of differential equations for the spreading
dynamics of droplets.

set up an estimation framework that allows us to systematically estimate and

indicate that there are indeed better performing models than the current

Emden polytropic sphere of index 5 in general relativity. This model has a
parameter range where all the energy conditions are satisfied in the entire
region. Within the parameter range, the asymptotic analysis for stellar motion
allows us to identify two competing effects on the bounded motion: the
general-relativistic effect and a local-density effect of matter. Furthermore,
using nearly circular bound orbits, we demonstrate that retrograde periapsis
shifts occur near the center, where the local-density effect dominates over the
general-relativistic effect, whereas prograde periapsis shifts occur in the far
region, where the general-relativistic effect dominates over the local-density
effect. This result means that a natural explanation for the retrograde
periapsis shifts is not the existence of exotic objects (e.g., naked
singularities or wormholes) but the local distribution of physically reasonable
matter on the stellar orbit. Furthermore, it also implies that the periapsis
shift plays a crucial role in distinguishing black hole alternatives, such as
dark matter cores, from a pure black hole.

time-reversal symmetry breaking is the spin revolution and not the dissipation.
The time-reversal symmetry breaking leads to a variety of unexpected effects
including upward propulsion on vertical surfaces defying gravity as well as
magnetic gyroscopic motion that is perpendicular to the applied force. In
contrast to the spin, the angular momentum of spin revolution can be parallel
or antiparallel to the equilibrium magnetization. The spin revolution emerges
spontaneously, without external rotations, and offers various applications in

crossing symmetry. It is found that the $IJ=00$ $\pi\pi$ scattering phase
shifts obtained at $m_\pi=391$ MeV by Hadron Spectrum Collaboration (HSC)
reveal the presence of both a bound state pole and a virtual state pole below
the $\pi\pi$ threshold rather than only one bound state pole for the $\sigma$.
To reproduce the lattice phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$ MeV, a virtual-state pole
in the $IJ=20$ channel is found to be necessary in order to balance the
left-hand cut effects from the chiral amplitudes. Similar discussions are also
carried out for the lattice results with $m_\pi=236$ MeV from HSC. The observed
behaviors of the pole positions with respect to the variation of the pion
masses can provide deep insights into our understanding of the dynamical origin
of $\sigma$ resonance.

aspect of its performance, as it measures how many different speaker profiles
TTS systems could possibly synthesize. However, this important aspect is often
overlooked when building multi-speaker TTS systems and there is no established
framework to evaluate this diversity. The reason behind is that most
multi-speaker TTS systems are limited to generate speech signals with the same
speaker profiles as its training data. They often use discrete speaker
embedding vectors which have a one-to-one correspondence with individual
speakers. This correspondence limits TTS systems and hinders their capability
of generating unseen speaker profiles that did not appear during training. In
this paper, we aim to build multi-speaker TTS systems that have a greater
variety of speaker profiles and can generate new synthetic speaker profiles
that are different from training data. To this end, we propose to use
generative models with a triplet loss and a specific shuffle mechanism. In our
experiments, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method have been
demonstrated in terms of both the distinctiveness and intelligibility of
synthesized speech signals.

labeled data. Recent work has shown impressive results when underlying classes
have significant semantic differences. One important dataset in which this
technique thrives is ImageNet, as intra-class distances are substantially lower
than inter-class distances. However, this is not the case for several critical
tasks, and general self-supervised learning methods fail to learn
discriminative features when classes have closer semantics, thus requiring more
robust strategies. We propose a strategy to tackle this problem, and to enable
learning from unlabeled data even when samples from different classes are not
prominently diverse. We approach the problem by leveraging a novel
ensemble-based clustering strategy where clusters derived from different
configurations are combined to generate a better grouping for the data samples
in a fully-unsupervised way. This strategy allows clusters with different
densities and higher variability to emerge, which in turn reduces intra-class
discrepancies, without requiring the burden of finding an optimal configuration
per dataset. We also consider different Convolutional Neural Networks to
compute distances between samples. We refine these distances by performing
context analysis and group them to capture complementary information. We
consider two applications to validate our pipeline: Person Re-Identification
and Text Authorship Verification. These are challenging applications
considering that classes are semantically close to each other and that training
and test sets have disjoint identities. Our method is robust across different
modalities and outperforms state-of-the-art results with a fully-unsupervised
solution without any labeling or human intervention.

These phenomena, often referred to as other nonlocal aspects of quantum theory,
have utmost importance in the domain of secret sharing etc. It, therefore,
becomes a pertinent question to distill/activate such behaviours from a set,
apparently devoid of these nonlocal features and free from local redundancy.
While the activation of local indisitinguishability in the sets of entangled
states has recently been reported, other stronger notion of quantum nonlocality
has yet not been inspected in the parlance of activation. Here, we explored all
such stronger versions of nonlocality and affirmatively answered to activate
each of them. We also find a locally distinguishable set of multipartite

However, existing methods for this task are limited to convolutional neural

multicast service. Providing multicast services in the smart communicative grid
poses several challenges, including the heterogeneity of different
communication media and the strict requirements of reliability, security and
latency. Wireless technologies and PLC connections are the two most important
media used in this grid, among which PLC connections are very unstable, which
makes it difficult to provide reliability. In this research, the problem of
geographically flooding of multicast data has been considered. First, this
problem has been modeled as an optimization problem which is used as a
reference model in evaluating the proposed approaches. Then, two MKMB and GCBT
multicast tree formation algorithms have been developed based on geographical
information according to the characteristics of smart grids. Comparison of
these two approaches shows the advantages and disadvantages of forming a
core-based tree compared to a source-based tree. Evaluation of these approaches
shows a relative improvement in tree cost and the amount of end-to-end delay
compared to basic algorithms. In the second part, providing security and
reliability in data transmission has been considered. Both Hybrid and Multiple
algorithms have been developed based on the idea of multiple transmission tree.
In the Hybrid algorithm, the aim is to provide higher security and reliability,
but in the Multiple algorithms, minimization of message transmission delay is
targeted. In the section of behavior evaluation, these two algorithms have been
studied in different working conditions, which indicates the achievement of the
desired goals.

corrosion rates are so low that rust accumulates often over tens of years near
the surface of the reinforcement bars before sufficient pressure in the
surrounding concrete is generated to induce cracking in the concrete cover. To
speed up the process, corrosion tests with impressed currents have been
developed in which the corrosion rate is controlled to be so high that cracking
of the concrete cover occurs within a few days. Extrapolating the results of
these accelerated tests to those of naturally occurring corrosion requires an
understanding of the influence of long-term creep deformations of concrete on
the corrosion-induced cracking process. In mathematical models in the
literature, creep deformations are often ignored for accelerated but considered
for natural corrosion rates in the form of an effective modulus. Here, three
numerical models of increasing complexity are proposed with the aim to
investigate the effect of creep on corrosion-induced cracking. The simplest
approach is based on an uncracked axis-symmetric thick-walled cylinder combined
with a plastic limit on the radial pressure-induced by the accumulation of
rust. The model with intermediate complexity comprises a thick-walled cylinder
model divided into an inner cracked and an outer uncracked layer. The most
comprehensive model consists of a thick-walled cylinder discretised by a
three-dimensional lattice approach. Basic creep is predicted in all three
approaches by means of the B3 model developed by Ba\v{z}ant and co-workers.
Time dependence of strength of concrete is modelled using fib Model Code
expressions. It is shown that for the comprehensive lattice model, creep has
limited influence on critical corrosion penetration, which indicates that the
dependence of the critical corrosion penetration on corrosion rate must have
other sources.

discussing chatbots, intended for casual conversation with a user, as well as
task-oriented agents that generally engage in discussions intended to reach one
or several specific goals, often (but not always) within a specific domain. We
also consider the concept of embodied conversational agents, briefly reviewing
aspects such as character animation and speech processing. The many different
approaches for representing dialogue in CAs are discussed in some detail, along
with methods for evaluating such agents, emphasizing the important topics of
accountability and interpretability. A brief historical overview is given,
followed by an extensive overview of various applications, especially in the
fields of health and education. We end the chapter by discussing benefits and
potential risks regarding the societal impact of current and future CA

be not only accurate and but also fair. Among various algorithms for fairness
AI, learning a prediction model by minimizing the empirical risk (e.g.,
cross-entropy) subject to a given fairness constraint has received much
attention. To avoid computational difficulty, however, a given fairness
constraint is replaced by a surrogate fairness constraint as the 0-1 loss is
replaced by a convex surrogate loss for classification problems. In this paper,
we investigate the validity of existing surrogate fairness constraints and
propose a new surrogate fairness constraint called SLIDE, which is
computationally feasible and asymptotically valid in the sense that the learned
model satisfies the fairness constraint asymptotically and achieves a fast
convergence rate. Numerical experiments confirm that the SLIDE works well for
various benchmark datasets.

develop decision-making algorithms that can cope with such a high-dimensional

has a variety of items to recommend. In this paper, we build upon the linear
contextual multi-armed bandit framework to address this problem. We develop a
decision-making policy for a linear bandit problem with high-dimensional
context vectors and several arms. Our policy employs Thompson sampling and
feeds it with reduced context vectors, where the dimensionality reduction
follows by random projection. Our proposed recommender system follows this
policy to learn online the item preferences of users while keeping its runtime
as low as possible. We prove a regret bound that scales as a factor of the
reduced dimension instead of the original one. For numerical evaluation, we use
our algorithm to build a recommender system and apply it to real-world
datasets. The theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of
computational complexity and regret performance.

CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations

which only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. In

  Neural Networks","15 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning-based methods for
processing graph domain information. GNNs have recently become a widely used
graph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representations
for complex graph data. However, due to privacy concerns and regulation
restrictions, centralized GNNs can be difficult to apply to data-sensitive
scenarios. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed for
privacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared global
model collaboratively. Although several research works have applied FL to train
GNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoor
attacks.
  This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks in
Federated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoor
attacks (DBA). Our experiments show that the DBA attack success rate is higher
than CBA in almost all evaluated cases. For CBA, the attack success rate of all
local triggers is similar to the global trigger even if the training set of the
adversarial party is embedded with the global trigger. To further explore the
properties of two backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs, we evaluate the attack
performance for a different number of clients, trigger sizes, poisoning
intensities, and trigger densities. Moreover, we explore the robustness of DBA
and CBA against one defense. We find that both attacks are robust against the
investigated defense, necessitating the need to consider backdoor attacks in
Federated GNNs as a novel threat that requires custom defenses.

reduces with increase of lattice parameters ratio $c/a$ and reaches nearly 850
K at ${c/a=1.22}$. For all considered $c/a$ from 1 to $\sqrt{2}$, we find
well-localized magnetic moments on Fe sites, which are formed due to strong
correlations originating from Hund's coupling. At the same time, magnetism of
Co sites is more itinerant with a much less lifetime of local magnetic moments.
However, these short-lived local moments are also formed due to Hund's
exchange. Electronic states at Fe sites are characterized by a
non-quasiparticle form of self-energies, while the ones for Co sites are found
to have a Fermi-liquid-like shape with quasiparticle mass enhancement factor
${m^*/m\sim 1.4}$, corresponding to moderately correlated metal. The strong
electron correlations on Fe sites leading to Hund's metal behaviour can be
explained by peculiarities of the density of states, which has pronounced peaks
near the Fermi level, while weaker many-body effects on Co sites can be caused
by stronger deviation from half-filling of their $3d$ states. The obtained
momentum dependence of magnetic susceptibility suggests that the ferromagnetic
ordering is the most favourable one except for the near vicinity of the fcc

achieves semantic segmentation in two steps: planarity-sensible
over-segmentation followed by semantic classification. The over-segmentation
step generates an initial set of mesh segments that capture the planar and
non-planar regions of urban scenes. In the subsequent classification step, we
construct a graph that encodes the geometric and photometric features of the
segments in its nodes and the multi-scale contextual features in its edges. The
final semantic segmentation is obtained by classifying the segments using a
graph convolutional network. Experiments and comparisons on two semantic urban
mesh benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in terms of boundary quality, mean IoU (intersection over union), and
generalization ability. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating

and commercial development, as they are capable of performing over-the-air
validation tests under laboratory conditions by generating virtual radar echoes
that are perceived as targets by a radar under test (RuT). The estimated angle
of arrival (AoA) of such a virtual target is determined by the physical
position of the particular RTS channel that creates it, which must therefore be
considered when planning the setup. A single channel employs two antennas, one
for the reception and the other for the re-transmission of the incoming radar
signal. The antennas are positioned close together, but still spatially
separated, thus an RTS channel can be considered quasi-monostatic, which causes
non-negligible inaccuracies in the angle simulation. In this paper, the authors
examine the analytical implications of this systemic deficiency on the angle
estimation, which provides support for the design and setup of angle-simulating
RTS systems. The mathematical derivations developed are verified by

redundancy removal module to compress the transmitted data. In particular, the
former extracts only the text-related semantic features, and the latter further
drops the semantically redundant content, greatly reducing the amount of
semantic redundancy compared to existing methods. We also propose a two-stage

these models are fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data for a downstream

tasks, and increase scalability of the model to multiple tasks or languages.
Using adapters we can perform ASR while training fewer than 10% of parameters
per task compared to full fine-tuning with little degradation of performance.
Ablations show that applying adapters into just the top few layers of the
pre-trained network gives similar performance to full transfer, supporting the
theory that higher pre-trained layers encode more phonemic information, and

improvements with respect to the more commonly used Fermi gas-based models.
Electron scattering experiments offer a precise probe of the structure of the

where the entire angular space is segmented into many small regions and a

the global positioning system. Inside each neural network, the region-specific
measurement matrix and channel estimator are jointly optimized, which not only
improves the signal measurement efficiency, but also enhances the channel
estimation capability. Simulation results show that the proposed approach

by implicitly learning underlying constraints using their solved instances,
such as sudoku or graph coloring (GCP). One drawback of the proposed
architectures, which are often based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), is that
they cannot generalize across the size of the output space from which variables
are assigned a value, for example, set of colors in a GCP, or board-size in
sudoku. We call the output space for the variables as 'value-set'. While many
works have demonstrated generalization of GNNs across graph size, there has
been no study on how to design a GNN for achieving value-set invariance for
problems that come from the same domain. For example, learning to solve 16 x 16
sudoku after being trained on only 9 x 9 sudokus. In this work, we propose
novel methods to extend GNN based architectures to achieve value-set
invariance. Specifically, our model builds on recently proposed Recurrent
Relational Networks. Our first approach exploits the graph-size invariance of
GNNs by converting a multi-class node classification problem into a binary node
classification problem. Our second approach works directly with multiple
classes by adding multiple nodes corresponding to the values in the value-set,
and then connecting variable nodes to value nodes depending on the problem
initialization. Our experimental evaluation on three different combinatorial
problems demonstrates that both our models perform well on our novel problem,
compared to a generic neural reasoner. Between two of our models, we observe an
inherent trade-off: while the binarized model gives better performance when
trained on smaller value-sets, multi-valued model is much more memory
efficient, resulting in improved performance when trained on larger value-sets,
where binarized model fails to train.

are very well described from the capillary and gravity contributions. These
dynamics are independent of the surfactant concentration. In a second part, our
study reveals that the physical-chemistry impacts the thinning dynamics through

evaporation, which shows a good description of the experimental data below the

dynamics at long times is correctly rendered and we establish that the increase
of the surfactant concentration decreases the impact of evaporation. Finally,
the addition of a hygroscopic compound, glycerol, can be also rationalized by
our model. We demonstrate that glycerol decreases the bubble thinning rate at

the battery performance. Although phonon properties can provide a direct clue
for structural stability and transitions, it has been less explored in sodium
cathode materials. Here, using the first-principles calculations, we
investigate phonon and electronic properties of various layered NaMnO$_2$
materials, especially focusing on the dependency of the Jahn-Teller distortion
of Mn$^{3+}$. The phonon dispersion curves show that the O$'$3 and P$'$2
structures with the Jahn-Teller distortion are dynamically stable in contrast
to undistorted O3 and P2 structures. The structural instability of O3 and P2
structures is directly observed from the imaginary phonon frequencies, as
so-called phonon soft modes, whose corresponding displacements are from O atoms
distorting along the local Mn-O bond direction in the MnO$_6$ octahedra. This
is consistent with the experimental stability and a structural transition with
the Jahn-Teller distortion at the high Na concentration. Furthermore, the
orbital-decomposed density of states presents the orbital redistribution by the
Jahn-Teller distortion such as $e_g$-band splitting, and the stability of O$'$3
and P$'$2 is not sensitive to the electron-electron correlation. Our results
demonstrate the importance of phonon analysis to further understand the
structural stability and phase transitions in cathode materials.

both node-level and graph-level classification tasks. However, GNNs typically
treat the graph structure as given and ignore how the edges are formed. This
paper introduces a graph generative process to model how the observed edges are
generated by aggregating the node interactions over a set of overlapping node
communities, each of which contributes to the edges via a logical OR mechanism.
Based on this generative model, we partition each edge into the summation of
multiple community-specific weighted edges and use them to define
community-specific GNNs. A variational inference framework is proposed to
jointly learn a GNN-based inference network that partitions the edges into
different communities, these community-specific GNNs, and a GNN-based predictor
that combines community-specific GNNs for the end classification task.
Extensive evaluations on real-world graph datasets have verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method in learning discriminative representations
for both node-level and graph-level classification tasks.

kinematic and magnetic boundary conditions using DNS. At a fixed rotation rate,
represented by the Ekman number $E=5\times10^{-7}$, the thermal forcing is
varied from 2 to 20 times its value at the onset of convection
($\mathcal{R}=Ra/Ra_c=2-20$), keeping the fluid properties constant
($Pr=Pr_m=1$). The statistical behavior, force balance and heat transport
characteristics of the dynamos depend on boundary conditions that dictate both
boundary layer and the interior dynamics. At a fixed thermal forcing
($\mathcal{R}=3$), the Ekman plumes in the presence of viscous boundary layers
lead to energetic vortices that result in higher enstrophy and kinetic helicity
with no-slip boundaries compared to free-slip boundaries. The structure and
strength of the magnetic field are also dictated by the boundary conditions.
Though the leading order force balance remains geostrophic, Lorentz force
dominates inside the thermal boundary layer with no-slip, electrically
conducting walls. Here, the Lorentz work term in the turbulent kinetic energy
budget is found to have components that exchange energy from the velocity field
to the magnetic field, and vice-versa. However, with no-slip, insulated walls,
all Lorentz work components perform unidirectional energy transfer to produce
magnetic energy from the kinetic energy of the fluid. The heat transfer
enhancement in dynamos, compared to non-magnetic rotating convection, exhibits
a peak in the range $\mathcal{R}=3-5$. For free-slip conditions, dynamo action
may alter the heat transport by suppressing the formation of large-scale
vortices. However, the highest heat transfer enhancement occurs when the
boundaries are no-slip, electrically conducting walls.

long-term performance. An advantage with passive learning is that it is
compatible with models used in the industry. Two passive learning methods,
periodic batch learning and online learning, are applied with varying
calibration frequency to train virtual flow meters. Six different model types,
ranging from data-driven to first-principles, are trained on historical
production data from 10 petroleum wells. The results are two-fold: first, in
the presence of frequently arriving measurements, frequent model updating
sustains an excellent prediction performance over time; second, in the presence
of intermittent and infrequently arriving measurements, frequent updating in
addition to the utilization of expert knowledge is essential to increase the
performance accuracy. The investigation may be of interest to experts

programs on bistochastic matrices, such approaches, relying on Birkhoff-von
Neumann (BvN) decompositions, are too slow to be implemented at large scale.
  In this paper we introduce a geometrical object, a polytope that we call
expohedron, whose points represent all achievable exposures of items for a
Position Based Model (PBM). We exhibit some of its properties and lay out a
Carath\'eodory decomposition algorithm with complexity $O(n^2\log(n))$ able to
express any point inside the expohedron as a convex sum of at most $n$
vertices, where $n$ is the number of items to rank. Such a decomposition makes
it possible to express any feasible target exposure as a distribution over at
most $n$ rankings. Furthermore we show that we can use this polytope to recover
the whole Pareto frontier of the multi-objective fairness-utility optimization
problem, using a simple geometrical procedure with complexity $O(n^2\log(n))$.
Our approach compares favorably to linear or quadratic programming baselines in
terms of algorithmic complexity and empirical runtime and is applicable to any
merit that is a non-decreasing function of item relevance. Furthermore our
solution can be expressed as a distribution over only $n$ permutations, instead
of the $(n-1)^2 + 1$ achieved with BvN decompositions. We perform experiments

We consider systems with external (e.g., cell-substrate) and internal (e.g.,
cell-cell) dissipation mechanisms, and derive expressions for stresses on cells
due to mechanical and dissipative forces. The semi-analytical method developed
here is, however, general and can be directly applied to study the linear
response of a broad class of soft matter systems with internal and external
dissipation. It involves normal mode decomposition to calculate linear loss and
storage moduli of the system. Specifically, displacements along each normal
mode produce stresses due to elastic deformation and internal dissipation,
which are in force balance with loads due to external dissipation. Each normal
mode responds with a characteristic relaxation timescale, and its rheological
behavior can be described as a combination of a standard linear solid element
due to elastic stresses and a Jeffreys model element due to the internal
dissipative stresses. The total response of the system is then fully determined
by connecting in parallel all the viscoelastic elements corresponding to
individual normal modes. This allows full characterization of the potentially
complex linear rheological response of the system at all driving frequencies
and identification of collective excitations. We show that internal and
external dissipation mechanisms lead to qualitatively different rheological
behaviors due to the presence or absence of Jeffreys elements, which is
particularly pronounced at high driving frequencies. Our findings, therefore,
underscore the importance of microscopic dissipation mechanisms in
understanding the rheological behavior of soft materials and tissues, in
particular.

the fluid equation acting on an arbitrary small collar $\omega$ supported by

$1$. The resulting space of well-posedness and stabilization is a suitable,
tight Besov space for the fluid velocity component (close to

in different use cases, they suffer from high communication costs, especially

Siamese structure that aims at minimizing distances between positive pairs. For
high performance Siamese representation learning, one of the keys is to design
good contrastive pairs. Most previous works simply apply random sampling to
make different crops of the same image, which overlooks the semantic
information that may degrade the quality of views. In this work, we propose
ContrastiveCrop, which could effectively generate better crops for Siamese
representation learning. Firstly, a semantic-aware object localization strategy
is proposed within the training process in a fully unsupervised manner. This
guides us to generate contrastive views which could avoid most false positives
(i.e., object vs. background). Moreover, we empirically find that views with
similar appearances are trivial for the Siamese model training. Thus, a
center-suppressed sampling is further designed to enlarge the variance of
crops. Remarkably, our method takes a careful consideration of positive pairs
for contrastive learning with negligible extra training overhead. As a
plug-and-play and framework-agnostic module, ContrastiveCrop consistently
improves SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, SimSiam by 0.4% ~ 2.0% classification accuracy on

  over the full transformation monoid","21 pages",,,,"math.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With each semigroup one can associate a partial algebra, called the biordered
set, which captures important algebraic and geometric features of the structure
of idempotents of that semigroup. For a biordered set $\mathcal{E}$, one can
construct the free idempotent-generated semigroup over $\mathcal{E}$,
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$, which is the free-est semigroup (in a definite
categorical sense) whose biorder of idempotents is isomorphic to $\mathcal{E}$.
Studies of these intriguing objects have been recently focusing on their
particular aspects, such as maximal subgroups, the word problem, etc. In 2012,
Gray and Ru\v{s}kuc pointed out that a more detailed investigation into the
structure of the free idempotent-generated semigroup over the biorder of
$\mathcal{T}_n$, the full transformation monoid over an $n$-element set, might
be worth pursuing. In 2019, together with Gould and Yang, the present author
showed that the word problem for $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{T}_n})$ is
algorithmically soluble. In a recent work by the author, it was showed that,
for a wide class of biorders $\mathcal{E}$, the algorithmic solution of the
word problem revolves around the so-called vertex groups, which arise as
certain subgroups of direct products of pairs of maximal subgroups of
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$. In this paper we determine these vertex groups for
the case when $\mathcal{E}$ is the biorder of idempotents of $\mathcal{T}_n$.

conditional ACE (CACE). Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as
Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals
(RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the
SCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE. However, much work remains before
traditional estimation methods can be used for counterfactual inference, and
for the benefit of Personalized Public Policy Analysis (P$^3$A) in the social
sciences. While doctors rely on personalized medicine to tailor treatments to
patients in laboratory settings (relatively closed systems), P$^3$A draws
inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it for open social systems. In this
article, we develop a method for counterfactual inference that we name
causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitating P$^3$A. First, we show
how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making any assumption about
functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantization trick to deal with
discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizing flows in general.
Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performs on-par with IPW and
RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE, when the true
functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown. Fourth and most
importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs, demonstrating
promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like other traditional
methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFs will likely
play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitating P$^3$A,
optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current
`one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.

problems, this paper proposes a freely available dataset, named CZU-MHAD

consists of 22 actions and three modals temporal synchronized data. These
modals include depth videos and skeleton positions from a kinect v2 camera, and
inertial signals from 10 wearable sensors. Compared with single modal sensors,
multi-modal sensors can collect different modal data, so the use of multi-modal

3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity of 10 main motion joints by
binding inertial sensors to them, and these data were captured at the same

estimate the joint distribution of latent and observed variables using the

control of arbitrary transportation networks with signalized intersections. The
traditional number-of-vehicle-based Max Pressure (Original-MP) algorithm has
received tremendous attention recently due to its ease of implementation and
scalability to large network scenarios. The Original-MP algorithm also has a
desirable property called maximum stability, which means a demand scenario can
be accommodated by this method as long as it can be accommodated by any
existing control policy. However, implementation of the Original-MP Max
Pressure algorithm may be difficult in practice as estimation of queue lengths
at intersections requires significant measurement infrastructure. The
Original-MP framework also uses a point queue model to represent the vehicle
transition between links, which does not consider the position of the vehicles,
even though this may significantly impact the control performance. In addition,
intersection approaches with low travel demand can incur arbitrarily large
delays due to having short queues. The proposed travel-delay based Max Pressure
model overcomes these drawbacks while inheriting the maximum stability feature
of the Original-MP. It also is shown to outperform several benchmark Max
Pressure variants in a battery of simulation tests. Lastly, the proposed
algorithm can be implemented in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment, in which
a subset of vehicles serve as mobile probes. The results show the proposed
travel-delay-based model generates lower delay with non-full penetration rate
than the benchmark models with full penetration rate under certain traffic
conditions.

uncertainty for learning from limited number of samples of high-dimensional

the Bayesian uncertainty (i.e. the posterior marginals) can be asymptotically
obtained by the approximate message passing algorithm, bypassing the canonical

Recent developments have advocated projecting both the score function and the

overestimate the epistemic (model) uncertainty. In this work, we propose
Grassmann Stein variational gradient descent (GSVGD) as an alternative
approach, which permits projections onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces.
Compared with other variants of SVGD that rely on dimensionality reduction,
GSVGD updates the projectors simultaneously for the score function and the

Grassmann-valued diffusion process which explores favourable subspaces. Both
our theoretical and experimental results suggest that GSVGD enjoys efficient
state-space exploration in high-dimensional problems that have an intrinsic

deployed in the wild. Recent methods use auxiliary outlier data to regularize
the model for improved OOD detection. However, these approaches make a strong
distributional assumption that the auxiliary outlier data is completely
separable from the in-distribution (ID) data. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages wild mixture data, which naturally consists of both ID
and OOD samples. Such wild data is abundant and arises freely upon deploying a
machine learning classifier in their natural habitats. Our key idea is to
formulate a constrained optimization problem and to show how to tractably solve
it. Our learning objective maximizes the OOD detection rate, subject to
constraints on the classification error of ID data and on the OOD error rate of
ID examples. We extensively evaluate our approach on common OOD detection tasks
and demonstrate superior performance.

benefit of locally repairing at least $\delta-1$ erasures via other $r$
survival nodes among the same local group. An LRC achieving the $(r,\delta)$
Singleton-type bound is called an optimal $(r,\delta)$ LRC. Constructions of
optimal $(r,\delta)$ LRCs with longer code length and determining the maximal
code length have been an important research direction in coding theory in
recent years. In this paper, we conduct further research on the improvement of
maximum code length of optimal $(r,\delta)$ LRCs. For $2\delta+1\leq d\leq
2\delta+2$, our upper bounds largely improve the ones by Cai \emph{et al.},

Chen \emph{et al.} and obtain a complete characterization of optimal $(r=2,

plane $PG(2,q)$. Within this geometrical characterization, we construct a class
of optimal $(r,\delta)$ LRCs based on the sunflower structure. Both the

up, we start with Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We derive the one point function of
stress tensor and show that the central charge related to the norm of
displacement operator is positive for the couplings obeying causality
constraints. Furthermore, by imposing the null energy condition on the
end-of-the-world brane, we prove the holographic g-theorem for Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. This corrects a wrong point of view in the literature, which claims
that the holographic g-theorem is violated for Gauss-Bonnet gravity. As a
by-product, we obtain the boundary entropy and A-type boundary central charges
in general dimensions. We also study AdS/BCFT for general curvature-squared
gravity. We find that it is too restrictive for the shape of the brane and the
dual BCFT is trivial if one imposes Neumann boundary conditions for all of the
gravitational modes. Instead, we propose to impose Dirichlet boundary condition
for the massive graviton, while imposing Neumann boundary condition for the
massless graviton. In this way, we obtain non-trivial shape dependence of
stress tensor and well-defined central charges. In particular, the holographic
g-theorem is satisfied by general curvature-squared gravity. Finally, we
discuss the island and show that the Page curve can be recovered for
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Interestingly, there are zeroth-order phase transitions
for the Page curve within one range of couplings obeying causality constraints.
Generalizing the discussions to holographic entanglement entropy and
holographic complexity in AdS/CFT, we get new constraints for the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling, which is stronger than the causality constraint.

addressable shutters whose open areas on the sky measure 0.20 arcsec $\times$
0.46 arcsec on a 0.27 arcsec $\times$ 0.53 arcsec pitch. This is the first time
that a configurable multi-object spectrograph has been available on a space
mission. The levels of multiplexing achievable with NIRSpec MOS mode are
quantified and we show that NIRSpec will be able to observe typically fifty to
two hundred objects simultaneously with the pattern of close to a quarter of a
million shutters provided by the MSA. This pattern is fixed and regular, and we
identify the specific constraints that it yields for NIRSpec observation
planning. We also present the data processing and calibration steps planned for
the NIRSpec MOS data. The significant variation in size of the mostly
diffraction-limited instrument point spread function over the large wavelength
range of 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m covered by the instrument, combined with the fact that
most targets observed with the MSA cannot be expected to be perfectly centred
within their respective slits, makes the spectrophotometric and wavelength
calibration of the obtained spectra particularly complex. These challenges
notwithstanding, the sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities anticipated of
NIRSpec in MOS mode are unprecedented, and should enable significant progress
to be made in addressing a wide range of outstanding astrophysical problems.

increasingly sophisticated and automated measurements deploying Overhauser
Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) at low field. The development of these

pathway information employed by the overwhelming majority of contemporary
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) research. Specifically, on well-tested, stable
NMR systems running well-tested pulse sequences in highly optimized,
homogeneous magnetic fields, traditional hardware and software quickly isolate
a meaningful subset of data by averaging and discarding between 3/4 and 127/128

that more fully reflects the rich physics underlying these NMR experiments. In
addition to discussing the outline and implementation of the general DCCT
schema and associated plotting methods, this manuscript presents a collection
of algorithms that provide robust phasing, avoidance of baseline distortion,
and the ability to realize relatively weak signals amidst background noise

Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), the optimization problem to be solved
becomes extremely complex. The theoretically accurate and optimal solutions are
often difficult to obtain. Therefore, meta-heuristic algorithms based on
multi-point search have received extensive attention. Aiming at these problems,
the design strategy of hybrid flower pollination algorithm for Virtual Network
Embedding (VNE) problem is discussed. Combining the advantages of the Genetic
Algorithm (GA) and FPA, the algorithm is optimized for the characteristics of
discrete optimization problems. The cross operation is used to replace the
cross-pollination operation to complete the global search and replace the
mutation operation with self-pollination operation to enhance the ability of
local search. Moreover, a life cycle mechanism is introduced as a complement to
the traditional fitness-based selection strategy to avoid premature
convergence. A chaotic optimization strategy is introduced to replace the
random sequence-guided crossover process to strengthen the global search
capability and reduce the probability of producing invalid individuals.

two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of spin-orbit coupled Rydberg atoms gives
rise to disordered quantum phases which are candidates for quantum spin
liquids. As recently demonstrated in [Lienhard et al. Phys. Rev. X, 10, 021031
(2020)] the spin-orbit coupling breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetries and
leads to a tunable density-dependent complex hopping of the hard-core bosons or
equivalently to complex XY spin interactions. Using exact diagonalization (ED)
we numerically investigate the phase diagram resulting from the competition
between density-dependent and direct transport terms. In mean-field
approximation there is a phase transition from a quasi-condensate to a
120{\deg} phase when the amplitude of the complex hopping exceeds that of the
direct one. In the full model a new phase with a finite spin gap emerges close
to the mean-field critical point as a result of quantum fluctuations induced by
the density-dependence of the complex hopping. We show that this phase is a
genuine disordered one, has a non-vanishing spin chirality and is characterized
by a non-trivial many-body Chern number. ED simulations of small lattices with
up to 28 lattice sites point to a non-degenerate ground state and thus to a
bosonic integer-quantum Hall (BIQH) phase, protected by U(1) symmetry. The
Chern number of C = 1, which is robust to disorder, is however different from
the even Chern numbers found in BIQH phases. For very strong, nonlinear
hoppings of opposite sign we find another disordered regime with vanishing spin
gap. This phase also has a large spin chirality and could be a gapless
spin-liquid but lies outside the parameter regime accessible in the Rydberg
system.

may have inflated the authentic trading volumes by as much as 149,5m for the

Knowledge of cerebral autoregulatory function should be a key factor in
clinical decision-making, yet it is often insufficiently and incorrectly
applied. Multiple physiologic mechanisms impact cerebral autoregulation, each
of which operate on potentially different and incompletely understood
timescales confounding conclusions drawn from observations. Because of such
complexities, clinical conceptualization of cerebral autoregulation has been
distilled into practical indices defined by multimodal neuromonitoring, which
removes mechanistic information and limits decision options. The next step
towards cerebral autoregulatory-informed clinical decision-making is to
quantify cerebral autoregulation mechanistically, which requires decomposing
cerebral autoregulation into its fundamental processes and partitioning those
processes into the timescales at which each operates. In this review, we
scrutinize biologically, clinically, and computationally focused literature to
build a timescales-based framework around cerebral autoregulation. This new
framework will allow us to quantify mechanistic interactions and directly infer
which mechanism(s) are functioning based only on current monitoring equipment,
paving the way for a new frontier in cerebral autoregulatory-informed clinical

prescription is well supported by vaccination theory, e.g., when the

however, that for vaccines providing partial protection (leaky vaccines) and
for sufficiently high values of the basic reproduction number, intuition is
overturned: the optimal allocation for minimizing the number of infections
prioritizes the vaccination of those who are least likely to be infected.
Furthermore, we show that this phenomenon occurs at a range of basic
reproduction numbers relevant for the currently circulating strains of

However, databases of drug combinations are biased towards synergistic agents
and these results do not necessarily generalise out of distribution. We employ
a sequential model optimization search utilising a deep learning model to
quickly discover synergistic drug combinations active against a cancer cell
line, requiring substantially less screening than an exhaustive evaluation. Our

enabling fast turnaround from design to fabrication. However, the throughput of
the rapid prototyping pipeline remains constrained by print optimization,
requiring multiple iterations of fabrication and ex-situ metrology. Despite the
need for a suitable technology, robust in-situ shape measurement of an entire
print is not currently available with any additive manufacturing modality.
Here, we address this shortcoming by demonstrating fully simultaneous 3D
metrology and printing. We exploit the dramatic increase in light scattering by
a photoresin during gelation for real-time 3D imaging of prints during
tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing. Tomographic imaging of the light
scattering density in the build volume yields quantitative, artifact-free 3D +
time models of cured objects that are accurate to below 1% of the size of the
print. By integrating shape measurement into the printing process, our work
paves the way for next-generation rapid prototyping with real-time defect
detection and correction.

examined the density-dependent diffusion behavior of some biological processes
such as tumor growth and invasion [23]. Here, we extend our previous work by
developing computational techniques to analyze the density-dependent diffusion
behavior of one-dimensional interacting particle systems, which have been used
to model numerous microscopic processes [17-19], and we apply our techniques to
an interacting system of Brownian particles, with hard-core interactions and
nearest-neighbor adhesion, known as single-file dynamics. Through large-scale
numerical simulations that exploit Monte-Carlo techniques and high-performance
computing resources, we show that the diffusion rate in such systems depends on
the average particle density. Extensions to the techniques we present here
enable researchers to examine the density-dependent diffusion behavior of many
physical systems in nature that undergo one-dimensional diffusion associated
with a change in the particle density; such as ion transport processes,
channeling in zeolites, etc.

virtualization. Since virtual network mapping is an NP-hard problem, a lot of
research has focused on the evolutionary algorithm's masterpiece genetic
algorithm. However, the parameter setting in the traditional method is too
dependent on experience, and its low flexibility makes it unable to adapt to
increasingly complex network environments. In addition, link-mapping strategies
that do not consider load balancing can easily cause link blocking in
high-traffic environments. In the IoT environment involving medical, disaster
relief, life support and other equipment, network performance and stability are
particularly important. Therefore, how to provide a more flexible virtual
network mapping service in a heterogeneous network environment with large
traffic is an urgent problem. Aiming at this problem, a virtual network mapping
strategy based on hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed. This strategy uses a
dynamically calculated cross-probability and pheromone-based mutation gene
selection strategy to improve the flexibility of the algorithm. In addition, a
weight update mechanism based on load balancing is introduced to reduce the
probability of mapping failure while balancing the load. Simulation results
show that the proposed method performs well in a number of performance metrics
including mapping average quotation, link load balancing, mapping cost-benefit
ratio, acceptance rate and running time.

self-powered IoT devices have been increasingly employed in various fields such
as providing observation data in remote areas, especially in rural areas or
post-disaster scenarios. Generally, through multi-hop relay, the sensed data of
those self-powered IoT devices are collected by the sink node which connects to
the IoT backbones. However, due to the remoteness, the sink needs to be located
at the border of the monitoring area where both the backbone of IoT and
electrical infrastructures are accessible. Under such deployment, significant
data flow and relay overhead will incur considering the large scale of the
monitoring area. Motivated by this issue, this paper aims to design a
UAV-assisted self-powered heterogeneous system to provide comprehensive

self-powered IoT devices, periodically so as to alleviate the data overflow.
Moreover, based on that the self-powered IoT devices are expected to have a
more considerable capability in the heavy data flow area, we also developed a
placement upgrade strategy to upgrade the general homogeneous self-powered IoT
system to the heterogeneous self-powered IoT system. Simulation results
indicated the developed UAV-assisted self-powered heterogeneous system can
achieve around $1.28\times$ the amount of data delivery to sink compared with

power an ever-growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, due
to the weak and transient natures of energy harvesting, IoT devices have to
work intermittently rendering conventional routing policies and energy
allocation strategies impractical. To this end, this paper, for the very first
time, developed a distributed multi-agent reinforcement algorithm known as
global actor-critic policy (GAP) to address the problem of routing policy and
energy allocation together for the energy harvesting powered IoT system. At the
training stage, each IoT device is treated as an agent and one universal model
is trained for all agents to save computing resources. At the inference stage,
packet delivery rate can be maximized. The experimental results show that the
proposed GAP algorithm achieves around 1.28 times and 1.24 times data
transmission rate than that of the Q-table and ESDSRAA algorithm, respectively.

foreseeable crisis mainly motivated by the dichotomy between the real economy
and the virtual economy. Skepticism is widespread even when it comes to
investments in sustainable economy. The concentration of capital in a few
persons is one of the greatest risks for the possible reiteration of economic
crises. The benevolent sentences of the courts to some of the fraudsters do not
contribute to dispelling the ghost of fraud nor to the disappearance of tax
havens. From the diachronic perspective, it is observed that economic crises
are increasingly frequent and incidents always in the financial field; which
forces us to rethink an economic model on an international scale in which there
is a greater weight of the economic policy of governments over the power of
multinational companies in the context of globalization. In the context of
Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Governance is listed as one of the
fundamental levers to curb large business fraud, but its efficiency seems
insufficient due to the lack of international regulations and the ignorance of
hidden forces in what has been known as fiscal and financial engineering. The
application of liberal policies in an unorthodox way is causing real social
gaps in the distribution of income and is undermining the current capitalist
system. The need to implement corporate governments is recommended as one of
the essential formulas for sustaining the international economic system.
