vulnerabilities. Existing sanitizers enforce checks and catch such bugs during
development and testing. However, they either provide partial memory safety or
have overwhelmingly high performance overheads. Our novel sanitizer PACSan
enforces spatial and temporal memory safety with no false positives at low
performance overheads. PACSan removes the majority of the overheads involved in
pointer tracking by sealing metadata in pointers through ARM PA (Pointer
Authentication), and performing the memory safety checks when pointers are
dereferenced. We have developed a prototype of PACSan and systematically
evaluated its security and performance on the Magma, Juliet, Nginx, and SPEC
CPU2017 test suites, respectively. In our evaluation, PACSan shows no false
positives together with negligible false negatives, while introducing stronger
security guarantees and lower performance overheads than state-of-the-art
sanitizers, including HWASan, ASan, SoftBound+CETS, Memcheck, LowFat, and
PTAuth. Specifically, PACSan has 0.84x runtime overhead and 1.92x memory
overhead on average. Compared to the widely deployed ASan, PACSan has no false
positives and much fewer false negatives and reduces 7.172% runtime overheads
and 89.063%memory overheads.

areas, such as self-driving, autonomous robots, and surveillance systems. The
future trajectory forecasting is multi-modal, influenced by physical
interaction with scene contexts and intricate social interactions among
pedestrians. The mainly existing literature learns representations of social
interactions by deep learning networks, while the explicit interaction patterns
are not utilized. Different interaction patterns, such as following or
collision avoiding, will generate different trends of next movement, thus, the
awareness of social interaction patterns is important for trajectory
forecasting. Moreover, the social interaction patterns are privacy concerned or
lack of labels. To jointly address the above issues, we present a social-dual
conditional variational auto-encoder (Social-DualCVAE) for multi-modal
trajectory forecasting, which is based on a generative model conditioned not
only on the past trajectories but also the unsupervised classification of
interaction patterns. After generating the category distribution of the
unlabeled social interaction patterns, DualCVAE, conditioned on the past

the formation of the thermal continuum at 3 mm using contribution functions. We
find enhanced heating rates in the upper chromosphere of up to $\sim
5\rm\,kW\,m^{-2}$, where small-scale emerging loops interact with the overlying
magnetic canopy leading to current sheets as shown by the magnetic field

values, but they are limited by the ALMA spatial resolution ($\sim
1.2^{\prime\prime}$). Band 3 brightness temperatures reach about
$\sim10^{4}\,$K in the region, and the transverse magnetic field strength
inferred from the non-LTE inversions is on the order of $\sim 500\,$G in the
chromosphere. We are able to quantitatively reproduce many of the observed

learning models. Common methods often consider the feature statistics as
deterministic values measured from the learned features and do not explicitly
consider the uncertain statistics discrepancy caused by potential domain shifts
during testing. In this paper, we improve the network generalization ability by
modeling the uncertainty of domain shifts with synthesized feature statistics
during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature statistic, after
considering the potential uncertainties, follows a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. Hence, each feature statistic is no longer a deterministic value,
but a probabilistic point with diverse distribution possibilities. With the
uncertain feature statistics, the models can be trained to alleviate the domain
perturbations and achieve better robustness against potential domain shifts.
Our method can be readily integrated into networks without additional
parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
consistently improves the network generalization ability on multiple vision
tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and instance
retrieval. The code can be available at https://github.com/lixiaotong97/DSU.

for the mercury speed of sound. These values do not necessarily represent the
nominal mercury physical properties, but the ones that fit the strain data and
the solid mechanics model we have used, and can be explained by three reasons:
The limitations of the computer model or what is known as the model-form
uncertainty, the biases and errors in the experimental data, and the mercury
cavitation damage that also contributes to the change in mercury behavior.
Consequently, the equation of state model parameters try to compensate for
these effects to improve fitness to the data. The mercury target simulations
using the updated parametric values result in an excellent agreement with 88%
average accuracy compared to experimental data, 6% average increase compared to
reference parameters, with some sensors experiencing an increase of more than
25%. With a more accurate simulated strain response, the component fatigue

investigate whether the influence gap is able to predict the outcome of
multi-party elections on networks exhibiting community structure, i.e., made of
highly interconnected components, and therefore more resembling of real-world
interaction. To encode communities we build on the classical model of caveman
graphs, which we extend to a richer graph family that displays different levels
of homophily, i.e., how much connections and opinions are intertwined. First,
we study the predictive power of the influence gap in the presence of
communities. We show that when there is no clear initial majority the influence
gap is not a good predictor of the election outcome. When we instead allow for
varying majorities, although the influence gap improves as a predictor,
counting the initial partisan majority does consistently better, across all
levels of homophily. Second, we study the combined effect of the more
predictive metrics, as function of the homophily levels. Using regression
models, we demonstrate that the influence gap combined with the initial votes
count does increase the overall predictive power for some levels of homophily.
Third, we study elections with more than two parties. Specifically, we extend
the definition of the influence gap to any number of parties, considering
various generalisations, and show that the initial votes count has an even
higher predictive power when compared to influence gap than it did in the

powerful method to improve the sample complexity of deep neural networks. This
makes them applicable to practically important use-cases where training data is

invariance to those transformations. Invariance can be imposed using
group-equivariant convolutions followed by a pooling operation.
  For rotation-invariance, previous work investigated replacing the spatial
pooling operation with invariant integration which explicitly constructs
invariant representations. Invariant integration uses monomials which are
selected using an iterative approach requiring expensive pre-training. We
propose a novel monomial selection algorithm based on pruning methods to allow
an application to more complex problems. Additionally, we replace monomials
with different functions such as weighted sums, multi-layer perceptrons and
self-attention, thereby streamlining the training of
invariant-integration-based architectures.
  We demonstrate the improved sample complexity on the Rotated-MNIST, SVHN and

contrastive learning where neighboring spectral vectors in the same image are
clustered together in a common representation space encompassing multiple

dual mu*-Agewr relation, resulting in a young sequence and an old ridge, and
ii) a mu*-Z*wr relation, overall independent of the age of the regions. The
global mass parameters (M* and, possibly secondarily, <mu>e) determine the
distribution of mu* in a galaxy and set the maximum attainable mu*, which
increases with M*. M* affects the shape and normalization of the local

remain unchanged. We conclude that stellar mass is a ""glocal"" (i.e.
simultaneously global and local) driver of the stellar population properties.
We consider how the local and global mass-age and mass-metallicity relations
are connected, and in particular discuss how it is possible, from a single
local relation, to produce two different global mass-metallicity relations for
quiescent and star-forming galaxies respectively, as reported in the

When adapting the individualized model to a later fraction of the same patient,
the average time is reduced to about one minute and the accuracy is slightly

stars by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) with the help of stellar
atmosphere models. Two new far-UV (FUV) bright cluster member stars situated
near the core of the cluster have been detected; one of them is an EHB star and
the other one is either in its post-blue hook evolutionary phase or in white
dwarf phase. The evolutionary status of all the hot stars, identified in the
cluster, has been investigated by using various evolutionary models. We find
the massive and younger BSs are concentrated at the center of the cluster
whereas the older and less massive BSs are distributed though out the cluster.
The BSs normalized radial distribution seems to be bi-modal with a minimum
located at r$_{\mathrm{min}}$ = 4.3 r$_c$. We calculated A$^+$ parameter of the
cluster which is obtained using cumulative normalized radial distribution of

applying LPol, RPol and MPol recursively to a single input class. We prove that
these hierarchies can actually be defined using almost exclusively MPol. We
also consider quantifier alternation hierarchies for two-variable first-order
logic and prove that one can climb them using MPol. The result is generic in
the sense that it holds for most standard choices of signatures. We use it to
prove that for most of these choices, membership is decidable for all levels in
the hierarchy. Finally, we prove that separation is decidable for the hierarchy
of two-variable first-order logic equipped with only the linear order.

trained with an increasing amount of data augmentation. The chosen
architectures can be considered baseline references for the respective design
paradigms. Our models are trained and evaluated on single or multiple items
from the MNIST or FashionMNIST dataset projected onto the sphere. For the task
of image classification, which is inherently rotationally invariant, we find
that by considerably increasing the amount of data augmentation and the size of
the networks, it is possible for the standard CNNs to reach at least the same
performance as the equivariant network. In contrast, for the inherently
equivariant task of semantic segmentation, the non-equivariant networks are
consistently outperformed by the equivariant networks with significantly fewer
parameters. We also analyze and compare the inference latency and training
times of the different networks, enabling detailed tradeoff considerations
between equivariant architectures and data augmentation for practical problems.

muon events passing the experimental setup, the NUCLEUS muon veto has to
fulfill tight spatial requirements to fit the constraints given by the

highly efficient and compact muon veto modules based on plastic scintillators
equipped with wavelength shifting fibers and silicon photo multipliers to
collect and detect the scintillation light. In this paper, we present the full

the high computational cost; given a dataset of $n$ samples, the cost grows as
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Existing sparse approximation methods can yield a
significant reduction in the computational cost, effectively reducing the
actual cost down to as low as $\mathcal{O}(n)$ in certain cases. Despite this
remarkable empirical success, significant gaps remain in the existing results

provide novel confidence intervals for the Nystr\""om method and the sparse

Lochs' theorem related decimal expansions with continued fraction expansions.
Such conversion results can also be stated for sequences of interval partitions

to deal with sequences of partitions beyond positive entropy, this paper
introduces the notion of log-balanced sequences of partitions, together with
their weight functions. These are sequences of interval partitions such that
the logarithms of the measures of their intervals at each depth are roughly the

partitions of a number-theoretic nature.

we focus on a specific marketplace, namely NBA TopShot, that facilitates the
purchase and (peer-to-peer) trading of sports collectibles. Our objective is to
build a framework that is able to label peer-to-peer transactions on the
platform as anomalous or not. To achieve our objective we begin by building a
model for the profit to be made by selling a specific collectible on the
platform. We then use RFCDE - a random forest model for the conditional density
of the dependent variable - to model the errors from the profit models. This
step allows us to estimate the probability of a transaction being anomalous. We
finally label as anomalous any transaction whose aforementioned probability is
less than 1%. Given the absence of ground truth for evaluating the model in
terms of its classification of transactions, we analyze the trade networks
formed from these anomalous transactions and compare it with the full trade
network of the platform. Our results indicate that these two networks are
statistically different when it comes to network metrics such as, edge density,
closure, node centrality and node degree distribution. This network analysis
provides additional evidence that these transactions do not follow the same
patterns that the rest of the trades on the platform follow. However, we would
like to emphasize here that this does not mean that these transactions are also
illegal. These transactions will need to be further audited from the
appropriate entities to verify whether or not they are illicit.

survey to detect and characterise luminous and smoothly evolving transients in
a sample of 215 U/LIRGs. We report three new transients, all with $\Delta L >
10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in addition to two previously known cases. Their host
galaxies are all part of major galaxy mergers, and through radiative transfer
model fitting we find that all have a significant contribution from an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). We characterised the transients through measurements of
their luminosities and resulting energetics, all of which are between
10$^{50.9}$ erg and 10$^{52.2}$ erg. The IR emission of the five transients was
found to be consistent with re-radiation by the hot dust of emission at shorter
wavelengths, presumably originating from an accretion event, onto the
supermassive black hole. The corresponding transient rate of
(1.6-4.6)$\times$10$^{-3}$ / yr / galaxy is over an order of magnitude higher
than the rate of large amplitude flares shown by AGN in the optical. We suggest
that the observed transients are part of a dust-obscured population of tidal
disruption events (TDEs) that have remained out of the reach of optical surveys
due to the obscuring dust. In one case, this is supported by our radio
observations. We also discuss other plausible explanations. The observed rate
of events is significantly higher than optical TDE rates, which can be expected
in U/LIRG hosts undergoing a major galaxy merger with increased stellar
densities in the nuclear regions. Continued searches for such transients and
their multi-wavelength follow-up is required to constrain their rate and

Such problems generalize the fundamental task of principal component analysis

gradient methods with highly-efficient iterations, but for which arguing about
fast convergence to a global minimizer is difficult or, via a convex relaxation

but the corresponding methods are often inefficient in high dimensions. In this
work we bridge these two approaches under a strict complementarity assumption,
which in particular implies that the optimal solution to the convex relaxation
is unique and is also the optimal solution to the original nonconvex problem.
Our main result is a proof that a natural nonconvex gradient method which is
\textit{SVD-free} and requires only a single QR-factorization of an $n\times k$

distinct mechanisms. In a conventional insulator, the charge carrier
concentration vanishes, when an energy gap separates filled and unfilled
electronic states. In the established picture of a Mott insulator, by contrast,
electronic interactions cause coherent charge carriers to slow down and
eventually stop in electronic grid-lock without materially affecting the
carrier concentration itself. This description has so far escaped experimental
verification by quantum oscillation measurements, which directly probe the
velocity distribution of the coherent charge carriers. By extending this
technique to high pressure we were able to examine the evolution of carrier
concentration and velocity in the strongly correlated metallic state of the
clean, crystalline material NiS$_2$, while tuning the system towards the Mott
insulating phase. Our results confirm that pronounced electronic slowing down
indeed governs the approach to the insulating state. However, the critical
point itself, at which the carrier velocity would reach zero and the effective
carrier mass diverge, is concealed by the insulating sector of the phase
diagram. In the resulting, more nuanced view of Mott localisation, the
inaccessibility of the low temperature Mott critical point resembles that of
the threshold of magnetic order in clean metallic systems, where criticality is
almost universally interrupted by first order transitions, tricritical

computationally and experimentally that those limitations can be overcome by
adding to the metallic melt an element that promotes high-genus topologies by
limiting the leakage of the immiscible element during dealloying. We further
interpret this finding by showing that bulk diffusive transport of the

low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and
computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been
slow paced.
  In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems.
Mainly, we prove that under a natural \textit{generalized strict

nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, the
\textit{extragradient method}, when initialized with a ""warm-start"" point,
converges to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$ while requiring only two

rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to
initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical
experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating
that using simple initializations, the extragradient method produces exactly
the same iterates when full-rank SVDs are replaced with SVDs of rank that
matches the rank of the (low-rank) ground-truth matrix to be recovered.

universe without resorting to any type of scalar field(s). Instead, this
accelerated expansion is driven by a dynamical ""cosmological constant"" in the
framework of unimodular gravity. The time dependent cosmological constant can
be related to an energy diffusion term that arises naturally in unimodular
gravity due to its restrictive diffeomorphism invariance. We derive the generic
conditions required for any type of diffusion to generate a realistic
inflationary epoch. Furthermore, for a given parameterization of inflation (in
terms of the Hubble flow functions), we show how to construct the corresponding
diffusion term in such a way that a smooth transition occurs between inflation
and the subsequent radiation dominated era, hence reheating proceeds naturally.
The primordial spectrum is obtained during the inflationary phase by
considering inhomogeneous perturbations associated to standard hydrodynamical
matter (modeled as a single ultra-relativistic fluid). We demonstrate that the
resulting spectrum is equivalent to that obtained in traditional inflationary
models, and is also independent of the particular form of the diffusion term.
In addition, we analyze the feasibility of identifying the variable
cosmological constant, responsible for the inflationary expansion, with the
current observed value.

However, detection accuracy is compromised from the lack of labelled data and

finetuning DL models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach suffers
from poor generalisation on real InSAR data. This letter proposes the use of
self-supervised contrastive learning to learn quality visual representations
hidden in unlabeled InSAR data. Our approach, based on the SimCLR framework,
provides a solution that does not require a specialized architecture nor a

achieves higher accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art methods, and
shows excellent generalisation even for out-of-distribution test data. Finally,
we showcase the effectiveness of our approach for detecting the unrest episodes

looking for something invisible. There are searches based on production and
decay processes where DM may reveal itself as missing energy. If nothing is
found, our best tool to constrain the parameter space of many extensions of the
Standard Model (SM) with a DM candidate is the Higgs boson. As the measurements
of the Higgs couplings become increasingly precise, higher-order corrections
will start to play a major role. The tree-level contribution to the invisible
decay width provides information about the portal coupling. Higher-order
corrections also gives us access to other parameters from the dark sector of
the Higgs potential that are not present in the tree-level amplitude. In this
work we will focus on the complex singlet extension of the SM in the phase with
a DM candidate. We calculate the one-loop electroweak corrections to the decay
of the Higgs boson into two DM particles. We find that the corrections are
stable and of the order of a few percent. The present measurement of the Higgs
invisible branching ratio, BR$(H \to$ invisible $) < 0.11$, already constrains
the parameter space of the model at leading order. We expect that by the end of
the LHC the experimental measurement will require the inclusion of the
electroweak corrections to the decay in order to match the experimental
accuracy. Furthermore, the only competing process, which is direct detection,
is shown to have a cross section below the neutrino floor.

equations, where the variables appear as exponents of group elements and take
values from the natural numbers. Solvability of such (systems of) equations has
been intensively studied for various classes of groups in recent years. In many
cases, it turns out that the set of all solutions on an exponent equation is a
semilinear set that can be constructed effectively. Such groups are called
knapsack semilinear. Examples of knapsack semilinear groups are hyperbolic
groups, virtually special groups, co-context-free groups and free solvable
groups. Moreover, knapsack semilinearity is preserved by many group theoretic
constructions, e.g., finite extensions, graph products, wreath products,
amalgamated free products with finite amalgamated subgroups, and HNN-extensions
with finite associated subgroups. On the other hand, arbitrary HNN-extensions
do not preserve knapsack semilinearity. In this paper, we consider the knapsack
semilinearity of HNN-extensions, where the stable letter $t$ acts trivially by
conjugation on the associated subgroup $A$ of the base group $G$. We show that
under some additional technical conditions, knapsack semilinearity transfers
from base group $G$ to the HNN-extension $H$. These additional technical
conditions are satisfied in many cases, e.g., when $A$ is a centralizer in $G$
or $A$ is a quasiconvex subgroup of the hyperbolic group $G$.

distribution - behind. We argue that this bias is responsible not only for
fairness concerns, but that it plays a key role in the collapse of
latent-traversal editing methods when deviating away from the distribution's
core. Building on this observation, we outline a method for mitigating
generative bias through a self-conditioning process, where distances in the
latent-space of a pre-trained generator are used to provide initial labels for
the data. By fine-tuning the generator on a re-sampled distribution drawn from
these self-labeled data, we force the generator to better contend with rare
semantic attributes and enable more realistic generation of these properties.
We compare our models to a wide range of latent editing methods, and show that
by alleviating the bias they achieve finer semantic control and better identity

has not been a detailed analysis on how to evaluate such models. In this work,
we investigate the visual reasoning capabilities and social biases of different

propose PaintSkills, a compositional diagnostic dataset and evaluation toolkit

between the performance of recent text-to-image models and the upper bound

we assess gender and skin tone biases by measuring the variance of the

demonstrate that recent text-to-image models learn specific gender/skin tone

reformulated in a transformed system with static background and fixed damping.
The energy and momentum evolution in dark matter flow are rigorously formulated
for both systems. The energy evolution in transformed system has a simple form
that is identical to the damped harmonic oscillator. The cosmic energy equation
can be easily derived in both systems. For entire N-body system, 1) combined
with the two-body collapse model (TBCM), kinetic and potential energy increase
linearly with time $t$ such that $K_p=\varepsilon_ut$ and
$P_y=-7\varepsilon_ut/5$, where $\varepsilon_u$ is a constant rate of energy
cascade; 2) an effective gravitational potential exponent $n_e=-10/7\ne-1$
($n_e=-1.38$ from simulation) can be identified due to surface energy of fast
growing halos; 3) the radial momentum $G\propto a^{3/2}$ and angular momentum
$H\propto a^{5/2}$, where $a$ is the scale factor. On halo scale, 1) halo
kinetic and potential energy can be modelled by two dimensionless constants
$\alpha_s^*$ and $\beta_s^*$. Both constants are independent of time and halo
mass; 2) both halo radial and angular momentum $\propto a^{3/2}$ and can be
modeled by two mass-dependent coefficients $\tau_s^*$ and $\eta_s^*$; 3) halo
spin parameter is determined by $\alpha_s^*$ and $\eta_s^*$ and decreases with
halo mass with derived values of 0.09 and 0.031 for small and large halos.
Finally, the radial and angular momentum are closely related to the integral
constants of motion $I_m$, i.e. the integral of velocity correlation or the
$m$th derivative of energy spectrum at long wavelength limit. On large scale,
angular momentum is negligible, $I_2$=0 reflects the conservation of linear
momentum, while $I_4$ reflects the fluctuation of radial momentum $G$. On halo
scale, $I_4$ is determined by both momentum that are comparable with each
other.

is interesting and intriguing. The aim of this study is to propose an
approximate analytical expression that allows to simulate changes in surface
charge density changes at cancer-surrounding healthy tissue interface during
the untreated solid tumor growth. For this, the Gompertz and Poisson equations
are used. Simulations reveal that the unperturbed solid tumor growth is closely
related to changes in the surface charge density over time between the tumor
and the surrounding healthy tissue. Furthermore, the unperturbed solid tumor
growth is governed by temporal changes in this surface charge density. It is
concluded that graphic strategies corroborate the correspondence between the
electrical and physiological parameters in the untreated cancer, which may have
an essential role in its growth, progression, metastasis and protection against
immune system attack and anti-cancer therapies. In addition, the knowledge of
surface charge density changes at cancer-surrounding healthy tissue interface
may be relevant when redesigning the molecules in chemotherapy and

GCN-based methods still have two main limitations: 1) They only consider the
motion information of the joints or process the joints and bones separately,
which are unable to fully explore the latent functional correlation between
joints and bones for action recognition. 2) Most of these works are performed
in the supervised learning way, which heavily relies on massive labeled
training data. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised
skeleton-based action recognition method which has been rarely exploited
before. We design a novel correlation-driven joint-bone fusion graph
convolutional network (CD-JBF-GCN) as an encoder and use a pose prediction head
as a decoder to achieve semi-supervised learning. Specifically, the CD-JBF-GC
can explore the motion transmission between the joint stream and the bone
stream, so that promoting both streams to learn more discriminative feature
representations. The pose prediction based auto-encoder in the self-supervised
training stage allows the network to learn motion representation from unlabeled
data, which is essential for action recognition. Extensive experiments on two
popular datasets, i.e. NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that our

increased redshift span, and improved treatment of systematic uncertainties in
comparison to the original Pantheon analysis and results in a factor of two
improvement in cosmological constraining power. For a Flat$\Lambda$CDM model,
we find $\Omega_M=0.334\pm0.018$ from SNe Ia alone. For a Flat$w_0$CDM model,
we measure $w_0=-0.90\pm0.14$ from SNe Ia alone, H$_0=73.5\pm1.1$ km s$^{-1}$

and $w_0=-0.978^{+0.024}_{-0.031}$ when combining the SN likelihood with
constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic

effects that need to be taken into account to compare populations across a

that hosted type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and have been observed with the
integral field spectrograph MUSE through the AMUSING survey. Here, we present a
study of the systematic errors and bias in the host stellar mass with
increasing redshifts that are generally overlooked in SNe Ia cosmological
analyses. We simulate observations at different redshifts (0.1<z<2.0) using
four photometric bands (griz, similar to the Dark Energy Survey-SN program) to
then estimate the host galaxy properties across cosmic time. We find that
stellar masses are systematically underestimated as we move towards higher
redshifts, due mostly to different rest-frame wavelength coverage, with
differences reaching 0.3 dex at z~1. We have used the newly derived corrections
as a function of redshift to correct the stellar masses of a known sample of SN
Ia hosts and derive cosmological parameters. We show that these corrections
have a small impact on the derived cosmological parameters. The most affected
is the value of the mass step $\Delta_M$, which is reduced by $\sim$0.004 (6%
lower). The dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ changes by $\Delta w
\sim $0.006 (0.6% higher) and the value of $\Omega_m$ increases at most by
0.001 ($\sim$0.3%), all within the derived uncertainties of the model. While
the systematic error found in the estimate of the host stellar mass does not
significantly affect the derived cosmological parameters, it is an important
source of a systematic error that one should correct for as we enter a new era

scalar is a non-Markovian field with index (3-d) for a d-dimensional fluid. We
reproduce (and extend) the dispersion relation of the holographic sound mode to

wide-area optical, near-IR, and Spitzer/IRAC data over the COSMOS/UltraVISTA
field and were targeted on the basis of tight constraints on their redshifts
from their IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] colors. We detect significant ($>9\sigma$) [CII]
lines in three of our six targets ($50\%$) co-spatial with the rest-$UV$

[CII] lines lie in the range $5.6$ to $8.8\times10^{8}L_{\odot}$, consistent
with the local [CII]-SFR relation. Meanwhile, their
[CII]/$L_{IR}\sim1-3\times10^{-3}$ ratios are slightly elevated compared to
local (U)LIRGS. This could be due to lower dust-to-gas or dust-to-metal ratios.
We also find that our sources display a large kinematic diversity, with one
source showing signs of rotation, one source a likely major merger and one

lower-mass galaxies below $10^{9}$ M$\odot$, which are also the highest-EW
galaxies. These findings suggest that the burstiness parameters of these strong
emission line galaxies may differ from those inferred from hydrodynamical
simulations and previous observations. For instance, a larger burstiness duty
cycle would explain the observed SFR(H$\alpha$) excess. We also estimate the
ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_{ion}$, finding a median value of
Log($\xi_{ion}$/erg$^{-1}$ Hz)$=24.80 \pm 0.26$ when adopting a Galactic dust
correction for H$\alpha$ and an SMC one for the stellar component. We observe
an increase of $\xi_{ion}$ with redshift, further confirming similar results at
higher redshifts. We also find that $\xi_{ion}$ is strongly correlated with
EW(H$\alpha$), which provides an approach for deriving $\xi_{ion}$ in early
galaxies. Lower-mass, lower-luminosity galaxies have a higher $\xi_{ion}$.
Overall, these results provide further support for faint galaxies playing a
major role in the reionization of the Universe.

spectral fitting code firefly is employed to derive parameters such as stellar
ages, metallicities, stellar and remnant masses, star formation histories, star
formation rates and dust attenuation. In addition to Voronoi-binned
measurements, our VAC also provides global properties, such as central values
and radial gradients. Two variants of the VAC are available: presenting the
results from fits using the M11-MILES and the novel MaStar stellar population
models. MaStar allows to constrain the fit over the whole MaNGA wavelength
range, extends the age-metallicity parameter space, and uses empirical spectra
from the same instrument as MaNGA. The fits employing MaStar models find on
average slightly younger ages, higher mass-weighted metallicities and smaller
colour excesses. These differences are reduced when matching wavelength range
and converging template grids. We further report that FIREFLY stellar masses
are systematically lower by ~0.3 dex than masses from the MaNGA PCA and Pipe3D
VACs, but match masses from the NSA best with only ~0.1 dex difference.
Finally, we show that FIREFLY stellar ages correlate with spectral index age

metallicity dependence.

represent one of our strongest probes of galaxy formation physics across nearly
all redshifts accessible to observations. The vast majority of simulations that
model these metal lines often assume either collisional or photoionisation
equilibrium, or a combination of the two. For the few simulations that have
relaxed these assumptions, a redshift-dependent meta-galactic UV background or
fixed spectrum is often used in the non-equilibrium photoionisation
calculation, which is unlikely to be accurate in the interstellar medium where
the gas can self-shield as well as in the high-redshift circumgalactic medium
where locally emitted radiation may dominate over the UV background. In this
work, we relax this final assumption by coupling the ionisation states of
individual metals to the radiation hydrodynamics solver present in RAMSES-RT.
Our chemical network follows radiative recombination, dielectronic
recombination, collisional ionisation, photoionisation, and charge transfer and
we use the ionisation states to compute non-equilibrium optically-thin
metal-line cooling. The fiducial model solves for the ionisation states of C,
N, O, Mg, Si, S, Fe, and Ne in addition to H, He, and H$_2$, but can be easily
extended for other ions. We provide interfaces to two different ODE solvers
that are competitive in both speed and accuracy. The code has been benchmarked
across a variety of gas conditions to reproduce results from CLOUDY when
equilibrium is reached. We show an example isolated galaxy simulation with
on-the-fly radiative transfer that demonstrates the utility of our code for
translating between simulations and observations without the use of idealised
photoionisation models.

perturbative data in both QCD and $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM. We derive the celestial

spectrum of light-ray operators appearing in the expansion, showing, in
particular, that the OPE data is analytic in transverse spin. Throughout our
presentation, we highlight the relation between the OPE approach, and more
standard splitting function based approaches of perturbative QCD, emphasizing
the utility of the OPE approach for incorporating symmetries in jet
substructure calculations. We hope that our presentation introduces a number of
new techniques to the jet substructure community, and also illustrates the
phenomenological relevance of the study of light-ray operators in the OPE limit

passive galaxies at high redshift contain information about their assembly
mechanisms, based on which galaxy formation and evolution scenarios may be
distinguished.
  Aims: The aim of this work is to give constraints on massive galaxy formation
scenarios through one of the first analyses of age and metallicity gradients of
the stellar populations in a sample of passive galaxies at $z > 1.6$ based on
spectroscopic data from the Hubble Space Telescope.
  Methods: We combined G$141$ deep slitless spectroscopic data and F$160$W
photometric data of the spectroscopically passive galaxies at $1.6< z < 2.4$
with $H_{160} < 22.0$ in the field of view of the cluster JKCS $041$. We
extracted spectra from different zones of the galaxies, and we analysed them by
fitting them with a library of synthetic templates of stellar population models
to obtain estimates of the age and metallicity gradients.
  Results: We obtained reliable measurements of age and metallicity parameters
in different spatial zones of $\text{four}$ galaxies. We performed spatially
resolved measurements in individual high-redshift galaxies without the need of
peculiar situations (i.e. gravitational lensing) for the first time. All four
galaxies exhibit negative metallicity gradients. Their amplitude, similar to
that measured in galaxies in the local Universe, suggests that the stellar
populations of passive galaxies from $z \sim 2$ to $z = 0$ are not
redistributed.
  Conclusions: Although the sample we analysed is small, the results we
obtained suggest that the main mechanism that determines the spatial
distribution of the stellar population properties within passive galaxies is
constrained in the first $3$ Gyr of the Universe. This is consistent with the
revised monolithic scenario.

exponentially large. However, as has recently been emphasised, in practice the
most explicit models are rather on the border of parametric control. We
identify and quantify parametrically what we believe to be the main issue
behind this difficulty. Namely, a large volume implies a shallow AdS minimum
and hence a small uplift. The latter, if it relies on an anti-D3 in a throat,
requires a large negative tadpole. As our main result, we provide a simple and
explicit formula for what this tadpole has to be in order to control the most
dangerous corrections. The fundamental ingredients are parameters specifying
the desired quality of control. We comment on the interplay between our
constraint and the tadpole conjecture. We also discuss directions for future
work which could lead to LVS constructions satisfying the tadpole constraint
with better control, as well as further challenges that may exist for the LVS.
Our formula then represents a very concrete challenge for future searches for

Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the

human intuitions play a central role in enabling human understanding.
Specifically, we identify three core concepts of interest that cover all
existing quantitative measures of understanding in the context of human-AI
decision making: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model
error. Our key result is that without assumptions about task-specific
intuitions, explanations may potentially improve human understanding of model
decision boundary, but they cannot improve human understanding of task decision
boundary or model error. To achieve complementary human-AI performance, we
articulate possible ways on how explanations need to work with human
intuitions. For instance, human intuitions about the relevance of features
(e.g., education is more important than age in predicting a person's income)
can be critical in detecting model error. We validate the importance of human
intuitions in shaping the outcome of machine explanations with empirical
human-subject studies. Overall, our work provides a general framework along

the asymptotic structure of gravitational radiation in dynamical, astrophysical
spacetimes. In this paper, we distil some of the key ideas from recent works
and assemble them in a new way in order to make them more accessible to the
wider general relativity community. We also announce some new physical findings
in this process.
  First, we introduce the conserved $f(r)$-modified Newman--Penrose charges on
asymptotically flat spacetimes, and we show that these charges provide a
dictionary that relates asymptotics of massless, general spin fields in
different regions: Asymptotic behaviour near $i^+$ (""late-time tails"") can be
read off from asymptotic behaviour towards $\mathcal I^+$, and, similarly,
asymptotic behaviour towards $\mathcal I^+$ can be read off from asymptotic
behaviour near $i^-$ or $\mathcal I^-$.
  Using this dictionary, we then explain how: (I) the quadrupole approximation
for a system of $N$ infalling masses from $i^-$ causes the ""peeling property
towards $\mathcal I^+$"" to be violated, and (II) this failure of peeling
results in deviations from the usual predictions for tails in the late-time
behaviour of gravitational radiation: Instead of the Price's law rate
$r\Psi^{[4]}|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-6}$ as~$u\to\infty$, we predict that
$r\Psi^{[4]}|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-4}$, with the coefficient of this latter
decay rate being a multiple of the monopole and quadrupole moments of the
matter distribution in the infinite past.

likelihood with non-linearity incorporated into the covariance matrix; here we
provide the theory underpinning this assumption. We calculate, for the first
time, the leading-order correction to the distribution of angular power spectra
from non-Gaussianity in the underlying signal and study the transition to
Gaussianity. Our expressions are valid for an arbitrary number of correlated
maps and correct the Wishart distribution in the presence of weak (but
otherwise arbitrary) non-Gaussianity in the signal. Surprisingly, the resulting
distribution is not equivalent to an Edgeworth expansion. The leading-order
effect is to broaden the covariance matrix by the usual trispectrum term, with
residual skewness sourced by the trispectrum and the square of the bispectrum.
Using lognormal lensing maps we demonstrate that our likelihood is uniquely
able to model both large and mildly non-linear scales. We provide
easy-to-compute statistics to quantify the size of the non-Gaussian
corrections. We show that the full non-Gaussian likelihood can be accurately
modelled as a Gaussian on small, non-linear scales. On large angular scales
non-linearity in the lensing signal imparts a negligible correction to the
likelihood, which takes the Wishart form in the full-sky case. Our formalism is
equally applicable to any kind of projected field.

dynamics of a rigid body with its centre of mass held fixed. The configuration
space of this problem is $SO(3)$, the space of all rotations in three
dimensions. This is a topological space with two types of closed loops: trivial
loops that can be adiabatically shrunk to a point and non-trivial loops that
cannot. In the traditional formulation of the problem, stationary states are
periodic over both types of closed loops. However, periodicity conditions may
change if Berry phases are introduced. We argue that time-reversal-symmetry
allows for only one new possibility -- a Berry phase of $\pi$ attached to all
non-trivial loops. We derive the corresponding stationary states by exploiting
the connection between $SO(3)$ and $SU(2)$ spaces. The solutions are
anti-periodic over any non-trivial loop, i.e., stationary states reverse sign
under a $2\pi$ rotation about any axis. Remarkably, this framework is realized
in the low-energy physics of certain quantum magnets. The magnets must satisfy
the following conditions: (a) the classical ground states are unpolarized,
carrying no net magnetization, (b) the set of classical ground states is
indexed by $SO(3)$, and (c) the product $N\times S$ is a half-integer, where
$N$ is the number of spins and $S$ is the spin quantum number. We demonstrate
this result in a family of Heisenberg antiferromagnets defined on polygons with
an odd number of vertices. At each vertex, we have a spin-$S$ moment that is
coupled to its nearest neighbours. In the classical limit, these magnets have
coplanar ground states. Their quantum spectra, at low energies, correspond to
`spherical top' and `symmetric top' rigid rotors. For integer values of $S$, we
recover traditional rigid rotor spectra. With half-integer-$S$, we obtain rotor
spectra with a Berry phase of $\pi$.

an economic planner seeks to move an economy from one level of capital to
another, then the most efficient path, as long as the planner has enough time,
is to rapidly move stock to a level close to the optimal stationary or constant
path, then allow for capital to develop along that path until the desired term
is nearly reached, at which point the stock ought to be moved to the final
target. Motivated in part by its nature as a resource allocation strategy, over
the past decade, the turnpike property has also been shown to hold for several
classes of partial differential equations arising in mechanics. When formalized
mathematically, the turnpike theory corroborates the insights from economics:
for an optimal control problem set in a finite-time horizon, optimal controls
and corresponding states, are close (often exponentially), during most of the
time, except near the initial and final time, to the optimal control and
corresponding state for the associated stationary optimal control problem. In
particular, the former are mostly constant over time. This fact provides a
rigorous meaning to the asymptotic simplification that some optimal control
problems appear to enjoy over long time intervals, allowing the consideration
of the corresponding stationary problem for computing and applications. We
review a slice of the theory developed over the past decade --the
controllability of the underlying system is an important ingredient, and can
even be used to devise simple turnpike-like strategies which are nearly
optimal--, and present several novel applications, including, among many
others, the characterization of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman asymptotics, and
stability estimates in deep learning via residual neural networks.

The inferred galaxy population of SIBELIUS-DARK also match well the

that the local volume is somewhat unusual in the wider context of $\Lambda$CDM:
it contains an abnormally high number of supermassive clusters, as well as an
overall large-scale underdensity at the level of $\approx 5$\% relative to the
cosmic mean. However, whilst rare, the extent of these peculiarities does not
significantly challenge the $\Lambda$CDM model. SIBELIUS-DARK is the most
comprehensive constrained realisation simulation of the local volume to date,

expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor associated with an

$SU(2)$ vortex, taking into account the effect of the conical geometry produced
by this object. We consider the vortex as an idealized topological defect,
i.e., very thin, straight and carrying a magnetic flux running along its core.
Besides the direct coupling of the fermionic field with the iso-vector gauge
field, we also admit the coupling with the scalar sector of the non-Abelian
vortex system, expressed as a vector in the three-dimensional isospace. Due to
this interaction, the FC is expressed as the sum of two contributions
associated with the two different effective masses for the $\pm 1/2$ fermionic
components of the isospin operator, $\tau^3/2$. The VEV of the energy-tensor
also presents a similar structure. The vacuum energy density is equal to the
radial and axial stresses. As to the azimuthal one, it is expressed in terms of
the radial derivative of energy-density. Regarding to the magnetic flux, both,
the FC and the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, can be positive or negative.
Another interesting consequence of the interaction with the bosonic sector, the
FC and VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, present different intensity for
different values of the ratio between the scalar coupling constant and the mass
of the fermionic field. This is a new feature that the system presents.

less dense and turbulent broad component with a line width of $\sim$20 km

attractive objects in images/videos. Recently, a growing amount of approaches
have been proposed all of which rely on the contour/edge information to improve
detection performance. The edge labels are either put into the loss directly or
used as extra supervision. The edge and body can also be learned separately and
then fused afterward. Both methods either lead to high prediction errors near
the edge or cannot be trained in an end-to-end manner. Another problem is that
existing methods may fail to detect objects of various sizes due to the lack of
efficient and effective feature fusion mechanisms. In this work, we propose to
decompose the saliency detection task into two cascaded sub-tasks, \emph{i.e.},
detail modeling and body filling. Specifically, the detail modeling focuses on
capturing the object edges by supervision of explicitly decomposed detail label
that consists of the pixels that are nested on the edge and near the edge. Then
the body filling learns the body part which will be filled into the detail map
to generate more accurate saliency map. To effectively fuse the features and
handle objects at different scales, we have also proposed two novel multi-scale
detail attention and body attention blocks for precise detail and body
modeling. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art

suitably choosing the potential of the mimetic field, we are able to solve the
perturbed field equations in the linear regime and derive the matter density
contrast {\delta}m in terms of the redshift parameter z. We observe that
{\delta}m starts growing at the early stages and as the universe expands, it
grows faster compared to the standard cosmology. This may due to the extra
degree of freedom of the gravitational field which affects the growth of
perturbations. We observe that in the presence of a mimetic potential, the
growth rate function is smaller than {\Lambda}CDM model in small redshifts. We
then consider the effects of this potential on the density abundance, the
deceleration parameter and jerk parameter. We find out that mimetic potential
can play the role of dark energy (DE) and affects the dynamics of matter
perturbations and cosmological parameters. We also investigate the mass
function and the number count for the collapsed objects in the mimetic
scenario. We find that the mass function of models with potential is smaller
than model without potential. With decreasing the role of DE, the mass function
start to grow in smaller redshifts i.e., halo abundance is formed later. It is
found that the more massive structures are less abundant and form at later
times, as it should be in the hierarchical model of structure formation.

dynamic behavior that can be categorized into different regimes based on
Reynolds number ($Re$) and Froude number ($Fr$). Topological differences in
wake structure across these different regimes have been clarified recently
through the use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) on Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) and laboratory data for a sphere in a stratified fluid for
$Re\in [200,1000]$ and $Fr\in[0.5,16]$. In this work, we attempt to identify
the dynamic regime from limited measurement data in a stratified wake with
(nominally) unknown $Re$ and $Fr$. A large database of candidate basis
functions is compiled by pooling the DMD modes obtained in prior DNS. A sparse
model is built using the Forward Regression with Orthogonal Least Squares
(FROLS) algorithm, which sequentially identifies DMD modes that best represent
the data and calibrates their amplitude and phase. After calibration, the
velocity field can be reconstructed using a weighted combination of the
dominant DMD modes. The dynamic regime for the measurements is estimated via a
projection-weighted average of $Re$ and $Fr$ corresponding to the identified
modes. Regime identification is carried out from a limited number of 2D
velocity snapshots from numerical and experimental datasets, as well as 3 point
measurements in the wake of the body. A metric to assess confidence is
introduced based on the observed predictive capability. This approach holds
promise for the implementation of data-driven fluid pattern classifiers.

new digital communication model, the Internet of Things (IoT). The seamless
network of these smart devices is the core of this IoT model. However, on the
other hand, integrating smart devices to constitute a network introduces many
security challenges. These connected devices have created a security blind

devices using malware proliferation techniques. Therefore, malware detection is
considered a lifeline for the survival of IoT devices against cyberattacks.
This study proposes a novel IoT Malware Detection Architecture (iMDA) using
squeezing and boosting dilated convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed
architecture exploits the concepts of edge and smoothing, multi-path dilated
convolutional operations, channel squeezing, and boosting in CNN. Edge and
smoothing operations are employed with split-transform-merge (STM) blocks to
extract local structure and minor contrast variation in the malware images. STM
blocks performed multi-path dilated convolutional operations, which helped
recognize the global structure of malware patterns. Additionally, channel
squeezing and merging helped to get the prominent reduced and diverse feature
maps, respectively. Channel squeezing and boosting are applied with the help of
STM block at the initial, middle and final levels to capture the texture
variation along with the depth for the sake of malware pattern hunting. The
proposed architecture has shown substantial performance compared with the
customized CNN models. The proposed iMDA has achieved Accuracy: 97.93%,

Background-Oriented Schlieren (BOS) of subsonic round turbulent helium jets in
air at Red = 5,890 and 11,300. Digital images with 1024 pixels streamwise
resolution (0 < x/d < 200) were captured at 6000 frames/s in large ensembles.
Velocimetry was performed on these results by digital image correlation (DIC)
using OpenPIV software, and by streak-schlieren analysis of x-t diagrams
(kymography). Limited PIV data were also collected for verification of the
schlieren velocimetry results. Both BOS and traditional schlieren show partial
success in measuring the mean-flow helium jet self-similarity in terms of the
1/x decay of centerline velocity, Gaussian-shaped radial velocity profiles, and
linear spreading rate of the jet. Visualized turbulent eddies, used as tracers
in schlieren velocimetry, are observed to last longer than is necessary for
this purpose in the present helium jets. Also, the measured convective velocity
appears to be sufficiently robust to sum to the jet mean velocity in some of
the results. Kymography yields better overall results than DIC, which we
attribute to kymography's spatiotemporal ""spectrum"" of jet velocities, enabling
the discrimination of fast eddies near the jet centerline from slower ones near
the jet periphery. DIC and other analysis methods suffer from a path-averaging
bias which negatively affects the results. The reduction of kymographic data
for velocimetry was done manually and also by a Fourier-transform

on the celling to serve multiple users. In this context, efficient multiple
access schemes are required to share the resources among the users and align
multi-user interference. Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has
been studied to serve multiple users simultaneously using the same resources,
while a different power level is allocated to each user. Despite the acceptable
performance of NOMA, users might experience a high packet loss due to high
noise, which results from the use of successive interference cancelation (SIC).
In this work, random linear network coding (RLNC) is proposed to enhance the
performance of NOMA in an optical wireless network where users are divided into
multicast groups, and each group contains users that slightly differ in their
channel gains. Moreover, a fixed power allocation (FPA) strategy is considered
among these groups to avoid complexity. The performance of the proposed scheme
is evaluated in terms of total packet success probability. The results show
that the proposed scheme is more suitable for the network considered compared
to other benchmark schemes such as traditional NOMA and orthogonal transmission
schemes. Moreover, the total packet success probability is highly affected by
the level of power allocated to each group in all the scenarios.

first-order methods. Some of these methods (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSprop,
and their variants) incorporate a small amount of curvature information by
using a diagonal matrix to precondition the stochastic gradient. Recently,
effective second-order methods, such as KFAC, K-BFGS, Shampoo, and TNT, have
been developed for training DNNs, by preconditioning the stochastic gradient by
layer-wise block-diagonal matrices. Here we propose a ""mini-block Fisher (MBF)""
preconditioned gradient method, that lies in between these two classes of
methods. Specifically, our method uses a block-diagonal approximation to the
empirical Fisher matrix, where for each layer in the DNN, whether it is
convolutional or feed-forward and fully connected, the associated diagonal
block is itself block-diagonal and is composed of a large number of mini-blocks
of modest size. Our novel approach utilizes the parallelism of GPUs to
efficiently perform computations on the large number of matrices in each layer.
Consequently, MBF's per-iteration computational cost is only slightly higher
than it is for first-order methods. The performance of our proposed method is
compared to that of several baseline methods, on both autoencoder and CNN
problems, to validate its effectiveness both in terms of time efficiency and
generalization power. Finally, it is proved that an idealized version of MBF
converges linearly.

evolution is a topic of discussion in both fronts, observations and
simulations. This paper analyses the gas metallicity gradients for a sample of
10 Fornax cluster galaxies observed with MUSE as part of the Fornax3D project.
Detailed maps of emission lines allowed a precise determination of gas
metallicity and metallicity gradients.
  The integrated gas metallicity of our Fornax cluster galaxies show slightly
higher metallicities (~0.045 dex) in comparison to a control sample. In
addition, we find signs of a mass and metallicity segregation from the center
to the outskirts of the cluster.
  By comparing our Fornax cluster metallicity gradients with a control sample
we find a general median offset of ~0.04 dex/Re, with 8 of our galaxies showing
flatter or more positive gradients.
  We find no systematic difference between the gradients of recent and
intermediate infallers when considering the projected distance of each galaxy
to the cluster center.
  To identify the origin of the observed offset in the metallicity gradients,
we perform a similar analysis with data from the TNG50 simulation. We identify
12 subhalos in Fornax-like clusters and compare their metallicity gradients
with a control sample of field subhalos. This exercise also shows a flattening
in the metallicity gradients for galaxies in Fornax-like halos, with a median
offset of ~0.05 dex/Re We also analyse the merger history, Mach numbers (M),
and ram pressure stripping of our TNG50 sample. We conclude that the observed
flattening in metallicity gradients is likely due to a combination of galaxies
traveling at supersonic velocities (M>1) that are experiencing high ram
pressure stripping and flybys.

attracted the attention of the research community, current approaches assume
that the input videos are ""trimmed"", meaning that a short video sequence is
sampled a fixed time before the beginning of the action. We argue that, despite
the recent advances in the field, trimmed action anticipation has a limited
applicability in real-world scenarios where it is important to deal with
""untrimmed"" video inputs and it cannot be assumed that the exact moment in
which the action will begin is known at test time. To overcome such
limitations, we propose an untrimmed action anticipation task, which, similarly
to temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test
time, while still requiring predictions to be made before the actions actually
take place. We design an evaluation procedure for methods designed to address
this novel task, and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100

resolutions. United atom (UA) models are one such example, where groups of
certain atoms in a molecule are clustered into superatoms. Although their
computational simplicity makes them particularly attractive for studying a wide
range of polymer properties, the missing degrees of freedom in UA models can
impact certain properties that are intimately linked to localized vibrations,
such as the heat capacity and the thermal transport coefficient $\kappa$. In
contrast, the numerically exhausting all atom (AA) models produce results that
better match experimental data. In this work, we systematically investigate and
compare $\kappa$ obtained from an AA and a UA models for an amorphous
polyethylene system. The results indicate that the UA description may not be a
suitable model for evaluating thermal transport, since it underestimates
$\kappa$ in comparison to an AA description and the experimental value. The
coarse-graining leads to the softer interactions and its presence is
highlighted in a weaker mechanical response from the UA model, thus also
underestimates $\kappa$. We further consolidate our findings by extracting the
bonded and the nonbonded contributions to $\kappa$ within the framework of the
single chain energy transfer model.

learning models for predicting later neurodevelopmental deficits. However,
traditional machine learning models would suffer from a large
feature-to-instance ratio (i.e., a large number of features but a small number
of instances/samples). Ensemble learning is a paradigm that strategically
generates and integrates a library of machine learning classifiers and has been
successfully used on a wide variety of predictive modeling problems to boost
model performance. Attribute (i.e., feature) bagging method is the most
commonly used feature partitioning scheme, which randomly and repeatedly draws
feature subsets from the entire feature set. Although attribute bagging method
can effectively reduce feature dimensionality to handle the large
feature-to-instance ratio, it lacks consideration of domain knowledge and
latent relationship among features. In this study, we proposed a novel
Ontology-guided Attribute Partitioning (OAP) method to better draw feature
subsets by considering the domain-specific relationship among features. With
the better partitioned feature subsets, we developed an ensemble learning
framework, which is referred to as OAP-Ensemble Learning (OAP-EL). We applied
the OAP-EL to predict cognitive deficits at 2 years of age using quantitative
brain maturation and geometric features obtained at term equivalent age in very
preterm infants. We demonstrated that the proposed OAP-EL approach
significantly outperformed the peer ensemble learning and traditional machine
learning approaches.

communication data rates in current and future cellular systems. Currently, the
ns-3 lte module leverages an abstraction model for 2x2 MIMO with spatial
multiplexing of two streams; while mmwave and nr modules were lacking the
spatial multiplexing option until this work, since the ns-3 models were not
supporting the usage of multiple antennas for spatial multiplexing and an
abstraction model such as the one used in the lte module is not suitable for
the mmWave frequencies. In this paper, we propose, implement and evaluate
models for ns-3 and the nr module to enable Dual-Polarized MIMO (DP-MIMO). The
proposed extension for the ns-3 supports multiple antennas for DP-MIMO with
spatial multiplexing of two streams and can be used by any ns-3 module that is
compatible with the ns-3 antenna array-based models, such as nr and mmwave
modules. We leverage this ns-3 extension to model DP-MIMO by exploiting
dual-polarized antennas and their orthogonality under line-of-sight conditions,
as it happens at high-frequency bands, to send the two data streams. The
proposed model does not rely on abstraction, as the MIMO model in the ns-3 lte
module, and can thus model more realistically the propagation differences of
the two streams, correlation, inter-stream interference, and allows design and
evaluation of the rank adaptation algorithms. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate an adaptive rank adaptation scheme and compare it with a fixed scheme.
The developed DP-MIMO spatial multiplexing models for the ns-3 simulator and
the nr module are openly available.

approach to causal representation learning for multitask learning. Our approach
makes a minor change to the conventional multitask inference objective, and
improves robustness to target shift. Since GMTL only modifies the inference
objective, it can be used with existing multitask learning methods without
requiring additional training. The improvement in robustness comes from
mitigating unobserved confounders that cause the targets, but not the input. We
refer to them as \emph{target-causing confounders}. These confounders induce
spurious dependencies between the input and targets. This poses a problem for
conventional multitask learning, due to its assumption that the targets are
conditionally independent given the input. GMTL mitigates target-causing
confounding at inference time, by removing the influence of the joint target
distribution, and predicting all targets jointly. This removes the spurious
dependencies between the input and targets, where the degree of removal is
adjustable via a single hyperparameter. This flexibility is useful for managing
the trade-off between in- and out-of-distribution generalization. Our results
on the Attributes of People and Taskonomy datasets reflect an improved

of such early galaxies is to age-date the stellar population of systems in the
reionisation era. As a significant fraction of $z\simeq7-8$ galaxies are
inferred from Spitzer photometry to have extremely intense [OIII] emission
lines, it is commonly believed these are genuinely young systems that formed at
redshifts $z<10$, consistent with a claimed rapid rise in the star formation
density at that time. Here we study a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of
extreme [OIII] emitters at $z=1.3-3.7$, using both dynamical masses estimated
from [OIII] line widths and rest-frame UV to near-infrared photometry to
illustrate the dangers of assuming such systems are genuinely young. For the
most extreme of our intermediate redshift line emitters, we find dynamical
masses $10-100$ times that associated with a young stellar population mass,
which are difficult to explain solely by the presence of additional dark matter
or gaseous reservoirs. Adopting nonparametric star formation histories, we show
how the near-infrared photometry of a subset of our sample reveals an
underlying old ($>100$ Myr) population whose stellar mass is $\simeq40$ times
that associated with the starburst responsible for the extreme line emission.
Without adequate rest-frame near-infrared photometry we argue it may be
premature to conclude that extreme line emitters in the reionisation era are
low mass systems that formed at redshifts below $z\simeq10$.

understanding of planet formation. In a protoplanetary disk, pebbles drift
inward near the disk midplane via gas drag and they may enter a dead zone. In
this context, we identified that the backreaction of the drag of pebbles onto
the gas could lead to a runaway pile-up of pebbles, the so-called no-drift
mechanism. We improve upon the previous study of the no-drift mechanism by
investigating the nature and characteristics of the resultant planetesimal
belt. We performed 1D diffusion-advection simulations of drifting pebbles in
the outer region of a dead zone by including the backreaction to the radial
drift of pebbles and including planetesimal formation via the streaming
instability. We considered the parameters that regulate gas accretion and
vertical stirring of pebbles in the disk midplane. In this study, the
pebble-to-gas mass flux ($F_{\rm p/g}$) was fixed as a parameter. We find that
planetesimals initially form within a narrow ring whose width expands as
accumulating pebbles radially diffuse over time. The system finally reaches a
steady-state where the width of the planetesimal belt no longer changes. A
non-negligible total mass of planetesimals (more than one Earth mass) is formed

$\alpha_{\rm acc} \simeq 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ at $r \lesssim 10$ au, where $r$,
$\tau_{\rm s}$, $\alpha_{\rm mid}$, and $\alpha_{\rm acc}$ are the heliocentric

slight distortion in the crystal structure is also possible. It is also shown
that Raman activities (350-400 cm^-1) obtained from the vibrational spectrum

structure. Electronically, both FM and the AFM phases are semiconductors with
an indirect band gap and they can form a type-III vdW heterojunction with

oxygen defects that inevitably occur during synthesis and production do not
alter the magnetic state, even at high vacancy density. Apparently, ultra-thin

frequency and symbols) in such channels render conventional precoding
sub-optimal in practice, and have led to historically poor characterization of

generalization of Mercer's Theorem to decompose the non-stationary channel into
constituent fading sub-channels (2-D eigenfunctions) that are jointly
orthogonal across its degrees of freedom. Consequently, transmitting these
eigenfunctions with optimally derived coefficients eventually mitigates any
interference across these dimensions and forms the foundation of the proposed
joint spatio-temporal precoding. The precoded symbols directly reconstruct the
data symbols at the receiver upon demodulation, thereby significantly reducing
its computational burden, by alleviating the need for any complementary
decoding. These eigenfunctions are paramount to extracting the second-order

ethyl radical molecule. The radiative lifetime for the defect-bound exciton is
calculated to be on the order of $\mu$s, much longer than other quantum defects
such as the NV center in diamond and in agreement with experiments. The longer
lifetime is associated with the small transition dipole moment as a result of
the very different nature of the localized and delocalized states forming the
defect-bound exciton. Finally, we use first principles calculations to assess
the stability of the T-center. We find the T-center to be stable against
decomposition into simpler defects when keeping the stoichiometry fixed.

signals makes short-time harmonic modeling an appealing choice to extract vocal
feature parameters. For dysphonic voice, however, a fixed harmonic structure
could be too constrained as it strictly enforces periodicity in the model.
Slight variation in amplitude or frequency in the signal may cause the model to
misrepresent the observed signal. To address these issues, this paper presents
a time-varying harmonic model, which allows its fundamental frequency and
harmonic amplitudes to be polynomial functions of time. The model decouples the
slow deviations of frequency and amplitude from fast irregular vocal fold
vibratory behaviors such as subharmonics and diplophonia. The time-varying
model is shown to track the frequency and amplitude modulations present in
voice with severe tremor. This reduces the sensitivity of the model-based
harmonics-to-noise ratio measures to slow frequency and amplitude variations
while maintaining its sensitivity to increase in turbulent noise or the
presence of irregular vibration. Other uses of the model include the vocal
tract filter estimation and the rates of frequency and intensity changes. These
use cases are experimentally demonstrated along with the modeling accuracy.

models into a unified projection. However, existing integration approaches
based on model averaging can dilute fine-scale spatial information and incur
bias from rescaling low-resolution climate models. We propose a statistical
approach, called NN-GPR, using Gaussian process regression (GPR) with an
infinitely wide deep neural network based covariance function. NN-GPR requires
no assumptions about the relationships between models, no interpolation to a
common grid, no stationarity assumptions, and automatically downscales as part
of its prediction algorithm. Model experiments show that NN-GPR can be highly
skillful at surface temperature and precipitation forecasting by preserving
geospatial signals at multiple scales and capturing inter-annual variability.
Our projections particularly show improved accuracy and uncertainty
quantification skill in regions of high variability, which allows us to cheaply
assess tail behavior at a 0.44$^\circ$/50 km spatial resolution without a
regional climate model (RCM). Evaluations on reanalysis data and SSP245 forced
climate models show that NN-GPR produces similar, overall climatologies to the
model ensemble while better capturing fine scale spatial patterns. Finally, we
compare NN-GPR's regional predictions against two RCMs and show that NN-GPR can
rival the performance of RCMs using only global model data as input.

collisionality. In the presence of acceleration fields and azimuthal electric
field waves, this results in strong deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium,
introducing kinetic effects. This work investigates the application of the
14-moment maximum-entropy model to this problem. This method consists in a set
of 14 PDEs for the density, momentum, pressure tensor components, heat flux
vector and fourth-order moment associated to the particle velocity distribution
function. The model is applied to the study of collisionless ion dynamics in a
Hall thruster-like configuration, and its accuracy is assessed against
different models, including the Vlasov kinetic equation. Three test cases are
considered: a purely axial acceleration problem, the problem of ion-wave
trapping and finally the evolution of ions in the axial-azimuthal plane.
  Most of this work considers ions only, and the coupling with electrons is
removed by prescribing reasonable values of the electric field. This allows us
to obtain a direct comparison among different ion models. However, the
possibility to run self-consistent plasma simulations is also briefly
discussed, considering quasi-neutral or multi-fluid models. The maximum-entropy
system appears to be a robust and accurate option for the considered test
cases. The accuracy is improved over the simpler pressureless gas model (cold
ions) and the Euler equations for gas dynamics, while the computational cost
shows to remain much lower than direct kinetic simulations.

learning systems, where a central server aggregates local models of $N$
distributed users, each of size $L$, trained on their local data, in a
privacy-preserving manner. Compared with state-of-the-art secure aggregation
protocols, SwiftAgg significantly reduces the communication overheads without
any compromise on security. Specifically, in presence of at most $D$ dropout
users, SwiftAgg achieves a users-to-server communication load of $(T+1)L$ and a
users-to-users communication load of up to $(N-1)(T+D+1)L$, with a worst-case
information-theoretic security guarantee, against any subset of up to $T$
semi-honest users who may also collude with the curious server. The key idea of
SwiftAgg is to partition the users into groups of size $D+T+1$, then in the
first phase, secret sharing and aggregation of the individual models are
performed within each group, and then in the second phase, model aggregation is
performed on $D+T+1$ sequences of users across the groups. If a user in a
sequence drops out in the second phase, the rest of the sequence remain silent.
This design allows only a subset of users to communicate with each other, and
only the users in a single group to directly communicate with the server,
eliminating the requirements of 1) all-to-all communication network across
users; and 2) all users communicating with the server, for other secure
aggregation protocols. This helps to substantially slash the communication
costs of the system.

fixed partner interaction leads to a behavioral self-organization. Shuffled
partners generate subgroups of strategies that remain entangled, apparently
blocking the self-selection process that leads to fully cooperating

enhancement in noisy environments are generally trained to minimise the
distance between clean and enhanced speech features. These often result in
improved speech quality however they suffer from a lack of generalisation and
may not deliver the required speech intelligibility in everyday noisy
situations. In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers have
explored intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions to train DL approaches
for robust speech enhancement (SE). In this paper, we formulate a novel
canonical correlation-based I-O loss function to more effectively train DL
algorithms. Specifically, we present a fully convolutional SE model that uses a
modified canonical-correlation based short-time objective intelligibility
(CC-STOI) metric as a training cost function. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits the integration of canonical correlation
in an I-O based loss function for SE. Comparative experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CC-STOI based SE framework outperforms DL models
trained with conventional STOI and distance-based loss functions, in terms of
both standard objective and subjective evaluation measures when dealing with
unseen speakers and noises.

reduce the toxicity of language models. We conduct this study on three
dimensions: training corpus, model size, and parameter efficiency. For the
training corpus, we propose to leverage the generative power of LMs and
generate nontoxic datasets for domain-adaptive training, which mitigates the
exposure bias and is shown to be more data-efficient than using a curated
pre-training corpus. We demonstrate that the self-generation method
consistently outperforms the existing baselines across various model sizes on
both automatic and human evaluations, even when it uses a 1/3 smaller training
corpus. We then comprehensively study detoxifying LMs with parameter sizes
ranging from 126M up to 530B (3x larger than GPT-3), a scale that has never
been studied before. We find that i) large LMs have similar toxicity levels as
smaller ones given the same pre-training corpus, and ii) large LMs require more
endeavor to detoxify. We also explore parameter-efficient training methods for
detoxification. We demonstrate that adding and training adapter-only layers in
LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off
between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for the large-scale
models.

government policy of lockdown and testing, and agents' decision to social
distance in order to avoid getting infected. The model is calibrated with data
on deaths and testing outcomes in the Unites States. It is shown that an
intermediate but prolonged lockdown is socially optimal when both mortality and
GDP are taken into account. This is because the government wants the economy to
keep producing some output and the slack in reducing infection is picked up by
social distancing agents. Social distancing best responds to the optimal
government policy to keep the effective reproductive number at one and avoid
multiple waves through the pandemic. Calibration shows testing to have been
effective, but it could have been even more instrumental if it had been
aggressively pursued from the beginning of the pandemic. Not having any
lockdown or shutting down social distancing would have had extreme
consequences. Greater centralized control on social activities would have
mitigated further the spread of the pandemic.

reconstruction models, albeit privacy risks arise during cross-site sharing of
imaging data. Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address
privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging
data. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to
map from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of
the imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across
different acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be
fixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across
sites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional
collaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based
on Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a
two-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and
subject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is
learned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR
images based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a
mapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the
prior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable
reconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing
data-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional
datasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP
against site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as
well as traditional reconstruction methods.

quantifying links between pairs of system units, higher-order interactions
(HOIs) involving three or more units play a major role in governing the
collective network behavior. This work introduces an approach to quantify
pairwise and HOIs for multivariate rhythmic processes interacting across
multiple time scales. We define the so-called O-information rate (OIR) as a new
metric to assess HOIs for multivariate time series, and propose a framework to
decompose it into measures quantifying Granger-causal and instantaneous
influences, as well as to expand it in the frequency domain. The framework
exploits the spectral representation of vector autoregressive and state-space
models to assess synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of
processes, both in specific bands and in the time domain after whole-band
integration. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the spectral OIR
can highlight redundant and synergistic HOIs emerging at specific frequencies
but not using time-domain measures. The application to physiological networks
described by heart period, arterial pressure and respiration measured in
healthy subjects during paced breathing, and to brain networks described by
ECoG signals acquired in an animal experiment during anesthesia, document the
capability of our approach to identify informational circuits relevant to
well-defined cardiovascular oscillations and brain rhythms and related to
specific physiological mechanisms of autonomic control and altered
consciousness. The proposed framework allows a hierarchically-organized
evaluation of time- and frequency-domain interactions in networks mapped by
multivariate time series, and its high flexibility and scalability make it

basic concept of our approach is that if someone is unaware of the objects in

transformation that was applied to them. This self supervised scheme is based
on pretext task and the downstream task. The pretext classification task to
quantify the geometric transformations should force the CNN to learn high-level
salient features of objects useful for image classification. In our baseline
model, we define image rotations by multiples of 90 degrees. The CNN trained on
this pretext task will be used for the classification of images in the CIFAR-10
dataset as a downstream task. we run the baseline method using various models,
including ResNet, DenseNet, VGG-16, and NIN with a varied number of rotations
in feature extracting and fine-tuning settings. In extension of this baseline
model we experiment with transformations other than rotation in pretext task.
We compare performance of selected models in various settings with different
transformations applied to images,various data augmentation techniques as well

differentially with the fast equator and the slow pole. It is widely thought
that the thermal convection maintains the differential rotation, but recent
high-resolution simulations tend to fail to reproduce the fast equator. This
fact is an aspect of one of the biggest problems in solar physics called the
convective conundrum. Hotta & Kusano, 2021 succeed in reproducing the
solar-like differential rotation without using any manipulation with
unprecedentedly high-resolution simulation. In this study, we analyze the
simulation data to understand the maintenance mechanism of the fast equator.
Our analyses lead to conclusions that are summarized as follows. 1.
Superequipatition magnetic field is generated by the compression, which can
indirectly convert the massive internal energy to magnetic energy. 2. The
efficient small-scale energy transport suppresses large-scale convection
energy. 3. Non-Taylor--Proudman differential rotation is maintained by the
entropy gradient caused by the anisotropic latitudinal energy transport
enhanced by the magnetic field. 4. The fast equator is maintained by the
meridional flow mainly caused by the Maxwell stress. The Maxwell stress itself
also has a role in the angular momentum transport for fast near-surface equator
(we call it the Punching ball effect). The fast equator in the simulation is
reproduced not due to the low Rossby number regime but due to the strong
magnetic field. This study newly finds the role of the magnetic field in the
maintenance of differential rotation.

indexed key. As a result, when loading data, if we anticipate future selective
(point or range) queries, we typically maintain an index that is gradually
populated as new data is ingested. In that respect, indexing can be perceived
as the process of adding structure to an incoming, otherwise unsorted, data
collection. The process of adding structure comes at a cost, as instead of
simply appending incoming data, every new entry is inserted into the index. If
the data ingestion order matches the indexed attribute order, the ingestion
cost is entirely redundant and can be avoided (e.g., via bulk loading in a
B+-tree). However, state-of-the-art index designs do not benefit when data is
ingested in an order that is close to being sorted but not fully sorted. In
this paper, we study how indexes can benefit from partial data sortedness or
near-sortedness, and we propose an ensemble of techniques that combine bulk
loading, index appends, variable node fill/split factor, and buffering, to
optimize the ingestion cost of a tree index in presence of partial data
sortedness. We further augment the proposed design with necessary metadata
structures to ensure competitive read performance. We apply the proposed design
paradigm on a state-of-the-art B+-tree, and we propose the Ordered Sort-Merge

so-called Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model conveniently describes crystals at
diffusive time scales through a continuous periodic field which varies on
atomic scales and is related to the atomic number density. To go beyond the

this approach can describe crystalline defects, interfaces, and lattice

distributions of clusters of objects. Frequently used approaches treat the
central object of each cluster as latent, but it is often the case that cells

are common, for example, in microbial biofilm, in which close interspecies
spatial clustering is thought to reflect physical interactions among species.
Because these interactions arise from or drive biofilm community structure,
quantifying these spatial relationships may provide clues to disease
pathogenesis or treatment effects. Even when clustering arrangements are not
strictly parent-offspring relationships, treating the central object as a
parent can enable use of parent-offspring clustering frameworks. We propose a
novel multivariate spatial point process model to quantify multicellular

model to analyze data from a human dental plaque biofilm image containing
spatial locations of Streptococcus, Porphyromonas, Corynebacterium, and
Pasteurellaceae, among other species. The proposed multivariate cluster point

the locations of the central object in clusters. It also accounts for possibly
multilayered, multivariate parent-offspring clustering. In simulated datasets,
the MCPP outperforms the classical Neyman-Scott process model, a univariate
model for modeling spatially clustered processes, by producing decisively more
accurate and precise parameter estimates. Applied to the motivating data, we
quantified the simultaneous clustering of Streptococcus and Porphyromonas

double-degenerate ($1.18\pm 0.10$\%) and white dwarf plus main-sequence stars
($6.31\pm0.23$\%) among all white dwarfs through comoving pairs identification.
With the aid of a detailed population synthesis code we are able to reproduce
synthetic white dwarf populations with nearly identical fractions as the
observed ones, thus obtaining valuable information about the binary fraction,
$f_{\rm b}$, initial mass ratio distribution, $n(q)$, and initial separation
distribution, $f(a)$, among other parameters. Our best-fit model is achieved

find that around $1\sim3\%$ of the white dwarf population are unresolved

necessary for fitting the observed sky separation of double-degenerate systems.

to tokens in all directions. At inference time, the model begins with
generating all tokens of an image simultaneously, and then refines the image
iteratively conditioned on the previous generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that MaskGIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer model

iVAEs use auxiliary covariates to build an identifiable generation structure

we show that iVAEs could have local minimum solution where observations and the

develop a new approach, covariate-informed iVAE (CI-iVAE) by considering a

doing so, the objective function prevents the posterior collapse, resulting
latent representations that contain more information of the observations.

outcomes are not fully observed for any unit. Furthermore, in observational
studies, treatment assignment is likely to be confounded. Many statistical
methods have emerged for causal inference under unconfoundedness conditions
given pre-treatment covariates, including propensity score-based methods,
prognostic score-based methods, and doubly robust methods. Unfortunately for
applied researchers, there is no `one-size-fits-all' causal method that can
perform optimally universally. In practice, causal methods are primarily
evaluated quantitatively on handcrafted simulated data. Such data-generative
procedures can be of limited value because they are typically stylized models
of reality. They are simplified for tractability and lack the complexities of
real-world data. For applied researchers, it is critical to understand how well
a method performs for the data at hand. Our work introduces a deep generative
model-based framework, Credence, to validate causal inference methods. The
framework's novelty stems from its ability to generate synthetic data anchored
at the empirical distribution for the observed sample, and therefore virtually
indistinguishable from the latter. The approach allows the user to specify
ground truth for the form and magnitude of causal effects and confounding bias
as functions of covariates. Thus simulated data sets are used to evaluate the
potential performance of various causal estimation methods when applied to data
similar to the observed sample. We demonstrate Credence's ability to accurately
assess the relative performance of causal estimation techniques in an extensive
simulation study and two real-world data applications from Lalonde and Project
STAR studies.

increase (decrease) in oxygen vacancy concentration is similar in effect to the
reduction (expansion) of the tunnel gap used as a state variable in existing
compact models, providing a mechanism for the electronic current to increase
(decrease) based upon the polarity of the applied voltage. Rate equations
defining the dynamics of state variables are obtained from simplifications of a
recent manuscript in which electronic processes (i.e., electron
capture/emission) were combined with atomic processes (i.e., Frenkel pair
generation/recombination, diffusion) stemming from the thermochemical model of
dielectric breakdown. Central to the proposed model is the effect of the
electron occupancy of oxygen vacancy traps on resistive switching dynamics. The
electronic current is calculated considering Ohmic, band-to-band, and
bound-to-band contributions. The model includes uniform self-heating with
Joule-heating and conductive loss terms. The model is calibrated using
experimental current-voltage characteristics for HfO2 memristors with different
electrode materials. Though a general model is presented, a delta-shaped
density of states profile for oxygen vacancies is found capable of accurately
representing experimental data while providing a minimal description of bound
to band transitions. The model is implemented in Verilog-A and tested using
read/write operations in a 4x4 1T1R nonvolatile memory array to evaluate its
ability to perform circuit simulations of practical interest. A particular
benefit is that the model does not make strong assumptions regarding filament

rotating machinery manufacturing systems. In many real applications of fault
detection and diagnosis, data tend to be imbalanced, meaning that the number of
samples for some fault classes is much less than the normal data samples. At
the same time, in an industrial condition, accelerometers encounter high levels
of disruptive signals and the collected samples turn out to be heavily noisy.
As a consequence, many traditional Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD)
frameworks get poor classification performances when dealing with real-world
circumstances. Three main solutions have been proposed in the literature to
cope with this problem: (1) the implementation of generative algorithms to
increase the amount of under-represented input samples, (2) the employment of a
classifier being powerful to learn from imbalanced and noisy data, (3) the
development of an efficient data pre-processing including feature extraction
and data augmentation. This paper proposes a hybrid framework which uses the
three aforementioned components to achieve an effective signal-based FDD system
for imbalanced conditions. Specifically, it first extracts the fault features,
using Fourier and wavelet transforms to make full use of the signals. Then, it
employs Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) to generate
synthetic samples to populate the rare fault class and enhance the training
set. Moreover, to achieve a higher performance a novel combination of
Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (CLSTM) and Weighted Extreme Learning
Machine (WELM) is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the developed
framework, different datasets settings on different imbalance severities and
noise degrees were used. The comparative results demonstrate that in different

model inaccuracies remains a critical yet difficult problem in robotics. While
Kalman filters provide the optimal solution in the least squared sense for
linear and Gaussian noise problems, the general nonlinear and non-Gaussian
noise case is significantly more complicated, typically relying on sampling
strategies that are limited to low-dimensional state spaces. In this paper we
devise a general inference procedure for filtering of nonlinear, non-Gaussian
dynamical systems that exploits the differentiability of both the update and
prediction models to scale to higher dimensional spaces. Our method, Stein
particle filter, can be seen as a deterministic flow of particles, embedded in
a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, from an initial state to the desirable
posterior. The particles evolve jointly to conform to a posterior approximation
while interacting with each other through a repulsive force. We evaluate the
method in simulation and in complex localization tasks while comparing it to
sequential Monte Carlo solutions.

information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size
gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the
sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true
parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the application. To further improve
that computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order
information in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study
the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter
estimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient
descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the
population loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when
$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the
NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter
after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed
dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This
computational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient
descent algorithm, which is of the order $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ for some $\tau
> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius. We illustrate our general theory
under two statistical models: generalized linear models and mixture models, and
experimental results support our prediction with general theory.

projected to be over 10 percent by 2026 as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The prevalence of post-retirement work changes existing
considerations of optimal annuitization, a research question further
complicated by novel factors such as post-retirement labor rates, wage rates,
and capacity or willingness to work. To our knowledge, this poses a practical
and theoretical problem not previously investigated in actuarial literature. In
this paper, we study the problem of post-retirement annuitization with extra
labor income in the framework of stochastic control, optimal stopping, and
expected utility maximization. The utility functions are of the Cobb-Douglas
type. The martingale methodology and duality techniques are employed to obtain
closed-form solutions for the dual and primal problems. The effect of labor
income is investigated by exploiting the explicit solutions and Monte-Carlo
simulation. The latter reveals that the optimal annuitization time is strongly
linear with respect to the initial wealth, with or without labor income. When
it comes to optimal annuitization, we find that the wage and labor rates may
play opposite roles. However, their impact is mediated by the leverage ratio.

the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$. In this paper, we focus on the critical
points that possess a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry $S\rightarrow -S$ and all the
other fields are left invariant. Then $S$ becomes a natural dark matter (DM)

researches about demand bidding aggregator involved in the electricity market

the bidding and purchasing strategy simultaneously employing the smart meter

developed to optimize the decisions through learning historical bidding
experiences. The online learning further utilizes the daily newest bidding
experience attained to ensure trend tracing and self-adaptation. Two

type of distribution shift, CNNs learn to focus on features that are not

focusing (ReFF). ReFF detects task-relevant features and regularizes CNNs via
explanation outputs (e.g., Grad-CAM). Since ReFF is composed of post-hoc
explanation modules, it can be easily applied to off-the-shelf CNNs.
Furthermore, ReFF requires no additional inference cost at test time because it

improves the test-time accuracy.

at regional scale to provide the basis for a continuous phenology map that
guides supplementary label collection over irrigated and non-irrigated
agriculture. Subsequently, validated dry season greening and senescence cycles
observed in 10m Sentinel-2 imagery are used to train a suite of classifiers for
automated detection of potential smallholder irrigation. Strategies to improve
model robustness are demonstrated, including a method of data augmentation that
randomly shifts training samples; and an assessment of classifier types that
produce the best performance in withheld target regions. The methodology is
applied to detect smallholder irrigation in two states in the Ethiopian
highlands, Tigray and Amhara. Results show that a transformer-based neural
network architecture allows for the most robust prediction performance in
withheld regions, followed closely by a CatBoost random forest model. Over
withheld ground-collection survey labels, the transformer-based model achieves
96.7% accuracy over non-irrigated samples and 95.9% accuracy over irrigated
samples. Over a larger set of samples independently collected via the
introduced method of label supplementation, non-irrigated and irrigated labels
are predicted with 98.3% and 95.5% accuracy, respectively. The detection model
is then deployed over Tigray and Amhara, revealing crop rotation patterns and

show that the optimized structure of 2D Cu-Au exhibits the hexagonal lattice of
a hexagonal ring of Cu atoms containing one Au atom, where the number of the Cu
atoms is larger than that of the Au atoms in the unit cell, which is difficult
to speculate from the atomic distribution of CuAu in the L1$_0$ structure. We
also show that 2D Cu-$X$ with $X=$ Be, Zn, and Pd have hexagonal or elongated

weakly-bonded systems located in between the phase-separated and

constraints and the impact of imposing them on consumer surplus, producer
surplus, and social welfare. We theoretically prove that both proposed
constraints can help balance consumer surplus and producer surplus at the
expense of total surplus for common demand distributions, such as uniform,
logistic, and exponential distributions. Experiments on both simulation and
real-world datasets demonstrate the correctness of these theoretical results.
Our findings and insights shed light on regulatory policy design for the
increasingly monopolized business in the digital era.

the decision problem for the existence of perfect matchings in $n$-vertex
$k$-uniform hypergraphs with minimum $\ell$-degree at least
$\delta\binom{n-\ell}{k-\ell}$. For $k\ge 3$, the decision problem in general
$k$-uniform hypergraphs, equivalently $\textbf{PM}(k,\ell,0)$, is one of Karp's
21 NP-complete problems. Moreover, for $k\ge 3$, a reduction of Szyma\'{n}ska
showed that $\textbf{PM}(k, \ell, \delta)$ is NP-complete for $\delta <
1-(1-1/k)^{k-\ell}$. A breakthrough by Keevash, Knox and Mycroft resolved this
problem for $\ell=k-1$ by showing that $\textbf{PM}(k, k-1, \delta)$ is in P
for $\delta > 1/k$. Based on their result for $\ell=k-1$, Keevash, Knox and

  In this paper it is shown that this decision problem for perfect matchings
can be reduced to the study of the minimum $\ell$-degree condition forcing the
existence of fractional perfect matchings. That is, we hopefully resolve the
""computational complexity"" aspect of the problem by reducing it to a well-known
extremal problem in hypergraph theory. In particular, together with existing
results on fractional perfect matchings, this solves the conjecture of Keevash,
Knox and Mycroft for $\ell\ge 0.4k$. Moreover, we also supply an algorithm that
outputs a perfect matching, provided that one exists.

sensitive enough to observe primordial GW background (PGW). However, due to the
lowered upper limit of the PGW by the Planck observation, further improvement
of the target sensitivity of DECIGO is required. In the previous studies,
DECIGO's parameters were optimized to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of the PGW to quantum noise including the effect of diffraction loss. To
simulate the SNR more realistically, we optimize DECIGO's parameters
considering the GWs from double white dwarfs (DWDs) and the thermal noise of
test masses. We consider two cases of the cutoff frequency of GWs from DWDs. In
addition, we consider two kinds of thermal noise: thermal noise in a residual
gas and internal thermal noise. To investigate how the mirror geometry affects
the sensitivity, we calculate it by changing the mirror mass, keeping the
mirror thickness, and vice versa. As a result, we obtained the optimums for the
parameters that maximize the SNR that depends on the mirror radius. This result
shows that a thick mirror with a large radius gives a good SNR and enables us
to optimize the design of DECIGO based on the feasibility study of the mirror
size in the future.

field of yield-stress fluids within and around vane tools with N=3 to 24 arms
for a wide range of Bingham numbers, B (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress over
the characteristic viscous stress). This allows for accurate calculations of
the velocity and stress fields around vanes with various geometries, as well as
direct comparison to experimental observations of the output torque measured by
a rheometer, revealing sources of variation and error. We describe the impact
of the vane structure on the fluid velocity field, from few-arm cruciform vanes
(N < 6) that significantly perturb the flow away from ideal azimuthal
kinematics, to many-arm fractal vanes (N > 12) in which the internal structural
features are successfully ``cloaked"" by a yield surface. This results in the
shearing of an almost-circular ring of viscoplastic fluid that is
indistinguishable from the annular ring of fluid deformed around a slip-free
rotating cylindrical bob and leads to more accurate rheometric measurements of
the material flow curve. Moreover, in direct comparison with data from previous
literature, we show that slip conditions on the vane surface do not impact the
velocity field or measured overall torque T, whereas slip conditions on the
smooth outer wall have significant impact on data, even when using a vane
geometry. Finally, we describe the impact of vane topography and Bingham

image recognition models extracts deep latent features and then a neck module
fuses these latent features to capture information at different scales. As the
resolution in object detection is much larger than in image recognition, the
computational cost of the backbone often dominates the total inference cost.
This heavy-backbone design paradigm is mostly due to the historical legacy when
transferring image recognition models to object detection rather than an
end-to-end optimized design for object detection. In this work, we show that
such paradigm indeed leads to sub-optimal object detection models. To this end,
we propose a novel heavy-neck paradigm, GiraffeDet, a giraffe-like network for
efficient object detection. The GiraffeDet uses an extremely lightweight
backbone and a very deep and large neck module which encourages dense
information exchange among different spatial scales as well as different levels
of latent semantics simultaneously. This design paradigm allows detectors to
process the high-level semantic information and low-level spatial information
at the same priority even in the early stage of the network, making it more
effective in detection tasks. Numerical evaluations on multiple popular object
detection benchmarks show that GiraffeDet consistently outperforms previous
SOTA models across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. The source code is

observations limited only by the cosmic variance (CV), we hereby forecast the
potential of future CMB observations in constraining the history of
reionization. In this study, we perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for
CV-limited E-mode polarization observations such as the LiteBIRD (Light
satellite for the studies of B-mode polarization and Inflation from cosmic
background Radiation Detection), based on a few different methods that vary in
the way of sampling reionization histories. We focus especially on estimating
the very early history of reionization that occurs at redshifts $z>15$, which
is quantified by the partial CMB optical depth due to free electrons at $z>15$,
$\tau_{z>15}$. We find that reionization with $\tau_{z>15} \sim 0.008$, which
are well below the current upper limit $\tau_{z>15} \sim 0.02$, are achievable
by reionization models with minihalo domination in the early phase and can be
distinguished from those with $\tau_{z>15} \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ through
CV-limited CMB polarization observations. An accurate estimation of
$\tau_{z>15}$, however, remains somewhat elusive. We investigate whether
resampling the E-mode polarization data with limited spherical-harmonic modes
may resolve this shortcoming.

explosion of a white dwarf (WD), but the nature of the progenitor system(s) is
still unclear. Recent theoretical and observational developments have led to
renewed interest in double degenerate models, in particular the ""helium-ignited
violent merger"" or ""dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation""
(D$^6$). In this paper we take the output of an existing D$^6$ SN model and
carry it into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase up to 4000 years after the
explosion, past the time when all the ejecta have been shocked. Assuming a
uniform ambient medium, we reveal specific signatures of the explosion
mechanism and spatial variations intrinsic to the ejecta. The first detonation
produces an ejecta tail visible at early times, while the second detonation
leaves a central density peak in the ejecta that is visible at late times. The
SNR shell is off-centre at all times, because of an initial velocity shift due
to binary motion. The companion WD produces a large conical shadow in the
ejecta, visible in projection as a dark patch surrounded by a bright ring. This
is a clear and long-lasting feature that is localized, and its impact on the
observed morphology is dependent on the viewing angle of the SNR. These results
offer a new way to diagnose the explosion mechanism and progenitor system using
observations of a Type Ia SNR.

it with a membrane structure that utilizes the advantages of the tip-extension

many $K << N$ cuboidal boxes need to manufactured and what should be their

problem in the $3$ dimensional space of length, width and height where each
cluster corresponds to the group of products that will be shipped in a
particular size variant, and (ii) present an efficient forward-backward
decision tree based clustering method with low computational complexity on $N$

material for spintronic device applications because of the n-type carrier
conduction and the ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature (TC > 300 K). To
clarify the mechanism of the high-TC ferromagnetism, we have investigated the
electronic structure and magnetic properties of an (In,Fe)Sb thin film by
performing x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Fe L2,3 edges. The magnetic-field
dependence of the XMCD spectra reveals that there are ferromagnetic-like Fe and
paramagnetic-like Fe components in the (In,Fe)Sb thin film. The XAS and XMCD
spectra of the ferromagnetic-like and paramagnetic-like Fe components resemble
those of other Fe-doped FMSs and extrinsic oxides, respectively. The finite
value of the ratio between the orbital and spin magnetic moments estimated by
applying the XMCD sum rules indicates that the valence state of the Fe ions
substituting for the In sites in (In,Fe)Sb is not purely ionic Fe3+, but
intermediate between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The qualitative correspondence between the
magnetic-field dependence of the visible-light magnetic circular dichroism
intensity and that of the XMCD intensity demonstrates that the Zeeman splitting
of the InSb band is proportional to the net magnetization of the doped Fe.
These results suggest that the ferromagnetism of (In,Fe)Sb originates from the
Fe 3d orbitals hybridized with the host InSb bands.

Prior-arts attempt this indirectly by employing adversarial domain

more tractable mapping with domain discrimination. Motivated by this, we
propose a novel feature space Amplitude Spectrum Transformation (AST). During
adaptation, we employ the AST auto-encoder for two purposes. First, carefully
mined source-target instance pairs undergo a simulation of cross-domain feature
stylization (AST-Sim) at a particular layer by altering the AST-latent. Second,
AST operating at a later layer is tasked to normalize (AST-Norm) the domain

technique is not only clustering-free but also free from complex adversarial
alignment. We achieve leading performance against the prior arts on the OCDA

However, wear and bacterial infection are identified as two major reasons that

room temperature and at an elevated substrate temperature are discussed wherein
a comparison of the change in surface roughness, wettability, surface free
energy, tribological and antibacterial properties of uncoated and zirconia
coated Ti6Al4V samples is presented. The results of tribological analysis
carried out using a standard ball-on-disc tribometer at different loads (2N, 5N
and 7N) exhibited advantageous effects of zirconia coating on Ti6Al4V.
Prominently, the sample coated at 200 C substrate temperature maintained very
low coefficient of friction up to hundreds of sliding cycles and showed a
notable reduction in the wear rate by 49% at 5N load. The in vitro bacterial
retention test showed a clear inhibition in growth of Staphylococcus aureus and
Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria on the surface of the coated samples indicating
the possibility of prevention of biofilm formation. More than 50% reduction in
density of Staphylococcus aureus was observed on coated sample in comparison to
pristine Ti6Al4V and this can be attributed to reduction in surface energy of
the sample after coating. Additionally, the observation of a larger number of
decimated bacteria on coated samples by fluorescence microscopy revealed
superior antibacterial properties of zirconia coating. The novelty of this work
is the use of pulsed laser deposition technique for zirconia coating which
dearly improves tribological and antibacterial properties of Ti6Al4V
simultaneously; this shows prospects of increasing durability of artificial

easily overfit to noisy labels which are prevalent in many real-world
scenarios. Generally, noisy supervision could stem from variation among
labelers, label corruption by adversaries, etc. To combat such label noises,
one popular line of approach is to apply customized weights to the training
instances, so that the corrupted examples contribute less to the model
learning. However, such learning mechanisms potentially erase important
information about the data distribution and therefore yield suboptimal results.
To leverage useful information from the corrupted instances, an alternative is
the bootstrapping loss, which reconstructs new training targets on-the-fly by
incorporating the network's own predictions (i.e., pseudo-labels).
  In this paper, we propose a more generic learnable loss objective which
enables a joint reweighting of instances and labels at once. Specifically, our
method dynamically adjusts the per-sample importance weight between the real
observed labels and pseudo-labels, where the weights are efficiently determined
in a meta process. Compared to the previous instance reweighting methods, our
approach concurrently conducts implicit relabeling, and thereby yield
substantial improvements with almost no extra cost. Extensive experimental
results demonstrated the strengths of our approach over existing methods on

the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The maximum transverse power factor

Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the

queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent observation from the
distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as
well as the previously obtained samples. The agent's task is to uncover the
underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a
probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant $\delta$. The problem
proposed finds numerous applications from clustering of variants of viruses to
online market segmentation. We present an instance-dependent
information-theoretic lower bound on the expected sample complexity for this

given to implement AI algorithms on resource constrained tiny devices to expand
the application domain of IoT. Multimodal Learning has recently become very
popular with the classification task due to its impressive performance for both
image and audio event classification. This paper presents TinyM$^2$Net -- a
flexible system algorithm co-designed multimodal learning framework for
resource constrained tiny devices. The framework was designed to be evaluated
on two different case-studies: COVID-19 detection from multimodal audio
recordings and battle field object detection from multimodal images and audios.
In order to compress the model to implement on tiny devices, substantial
network architecture optimization and mixed precision quantization were
performed (mixed 8-bit and 4-bit). TinyM$^2$Net shows that even a tiny
multimodal learning model can improve the classification performance than that
of any unimodal frameworks. The most compressed TinyM$^2$Net achieves 88.4%
COVID-19 detection accuracy (14.5% improvement from unimodal base model) and
96.8% battle field object detection accuracy (3.9% improvement from unimodal
base model). Finally, we test our TinyM$^2$Net models on a Raspberry Pi 4 to
see how they perform when deployed to a resource constrained tiny device.

minutes was previously reported for AU Mic b, which was suggested to be an
outcome of mutual perturbations between the planets in the system. In 2021, we
observed AU Mic b (five transits) and c (three transits) with the CHEOPS space

c. When analyzing TESS and CHEOPS 2020--2021 measurements together, we find
that a prominent TTV emerges with a full span of ~23 minutes between the two
TTV extrema. Assuming that the period change results from a periodic process -

sequence dominated by early-type galaxies. These red/quenched massive disk
galaxies have recently gained great interest into their formation and origins.
The usually proposed quenching mechanisms, such as bar quenching and
environment quenching, seem not suitable for those bulge-less quenched disks in
low-density environment. In this paper, we use the IllustrisTNG-300 simulation
to investigate the formation of massive quenched central disk galaxies. It is
found that these galaxies contain less gas and harbor giant supermassive black
holes(SMBHs) (above $ 10^{8}M_{\odot}$) than their star forming counterparts.
By tracing their formation history, we found that quenched disk galaxies formed
early and preserved disk morphology for cosmological time scales. They have
experienced less than one major merger on average and it is mainly mini-mergers
(mass ratio $<$1/10) that contribute to the growth of their SMBHs. In the
Illustris-TNG simulation the black hole feedback mode switches from thermal to
kinetic feedback when the black hole mass is more massive than $\sim
10^{8}M_{\odot}$, which is more efficient to eject gas outside of the galaxy
and to suppress further cooling of hot gaseous halo. We conclude that kinetic
AGN feedback in massive red/quenched disk galaxy is the dominant quenching
mechanism.

  Cortical Electrophysiological Activity Among High and Low Complex States","22 pages, 11 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anesthetic agents are known to induce a series of alterations in cortical
electrophysiological activity, such as the rise of signature patterns, changes
in statistical properties, and altered dynamic behavior of neural records.
Plenty of methods can be used to trace and monitor these changes, among them
complexity metrics demonstrated to have the power to discriminate states of
distinct levels of awareness. There is a consensus that anesthetic drugs are
capable of interfering with neural activities at different levels and time
scales, being able to induce alterations both locally as well as on the
spatiotemporal patterns throughout the whole cortex. However, it is still
unclear how such changes in the complexity of cortical activity are supposed to
occur, and experimental evidence is still needed. To this purpose, we have
analyzed an ECoG records database of a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic
induction experiment in a non-human primate subject. The MDR-ECoG provided
records of cortical activity with both high temporal and spatial resolution
allied with extensive coverage of the cortical surface. The Permutation Entropy
and the Fractal Dimension were employed to evaluate the complexity of the
neural time series. The complexity of cortical activity was relatively constant
during awakened conditions. The transition to unconsciousness occurred in a
fast manner, requiring about 30 to 40 seconds for the first changes to take
place. During general anesthesia, the complexity assumed a considerable
variation at local levels and fluctuated without a defined period. On a global
scale, the cortex dynamically alternated among high and low complex states.
This study brings novel evidence of the effects of anesthetics on neural
activity and cortical dynamics, complementing the actual scenario for the

approaches make assumptions about the neural code for representing world states

training is often unstable and lacks a reliable convergence estimator. If the
true environment reward is unknown and cannot be used to select the
best-performing model, this can result in bad real-world policy performance. We

the policy and expert state transition trajectories which can be optimized in a
non-adversarial fashion. Such methods demonstrate improved robustness when
learned density models guide the optimization. We further improve the sample
efficiency by rewriting the KLD minimization as the Soft Actor Critic objective

many mobile e-commerce Apps. Different from classical item recommendation, live
broadcast recommendation is to automatically recommend user anchors instead of
items considering the interactions among triple-objects (i.e., users, anchors,
items) rather than binary interactions between users and items. Existing
methods based on binary objects, ranging from early matrix factorization to
recently emerged deep learning, obtain objects' embeddings by mapping from
pre-existing features. Directly applying these techniques would lead to limited
performance, as they are failing to encode collaborative signals among
triple-objects. In this paper, we propose a novel TWo-side Interactive NetworkS
(TWINS) for live broadcast recommendation. In order to fully use both static
and dynamic information on user and anchor sides, we combine a product-based
neural network with a recurrent neural network to learn the embedding of each
object. In addition, instead of directly measuring the similarity, TWINS
effectively injects the collaborative effects into the embedding process in an
explicit manner by modeling interactive patterns between the user's browsing
history and the anchor's broadcast history in both item and anchor aspects.
Furthermore, we design a novel co-retrieval technique to select key items among
massive historic records efficiently. Offline experiments on real large-scale
data show the superior performance of the proposed TWINS, compared to
representative methods; and further results of online experiments on Diantao
App show that TWINS gains average performance improvement of around 8% on ACTR

entering the superconducting state, the single crystal at low temperature shows
a resistivity upturn, which is T1/2 dependent and insensitive to the applied

And the Weibel instability is excited by cold electrons in dilute plasmas.
After being accelerated to relativistic velocities by the shock electric field

twin state has the lowest energy barrier. Epitaxial strain can effectively tune
the ferroelectric polarization and ferroelectric switching by changing the
amplitude of octahedral rotation and tilt distortion. The increasing
compressive strain causes a polar to nonpolar phase transition by suppressing
the tilt distortion. The cooperative effect of octahedral distortion at the

rotation mode and can even change the lowest-energy ferroelectric switching
path.

(FDI) attacks in which an attacker manipulates meter data to disrupt the grid

single grid operator has access to all the data, and only some meters can be

  Our goal is to secure smart grids against FDI under a realistic threat model.
To this end, we present a threat model in which there are multiple operators,
each with a partial view of the grid, and each can be fully compromised. An
effective defense against FDI in this setting is to share data between the
operators. However, the main challenge here is to incentivize data sharing. We
address this by proposing an incentive mechanism that rewards operators for
uploading data, but penalizes them if the data is missing or anomalous. We
derive formal conditions under which our incentive mechanism is provably secure
against operators who withhold or distort measurement data for profit. We then
implement the data sharing solution on a private blockchain, introducing
several optimizations that overcome the inherent performance limitations of the

very short, limited to a few microseconds owing to the inherently dense nuclear
spin bath of the h-BN host. As the coherence time is one of the most
fundamental properties of spin qubits, the short T2 time of VB- could
significantly limit its potential as a promising spin qubit candidate. In this
study, we theoretically proposed two materials engineering methods, which can
substantially extend the T2 time of the VB- spin by four times more than its
intrinsic T2. We performed quantum many-body computations by combining density
functional theory and cluster correlation expansion and showed that replacing
all the boron atoms in h-BN with the 10B isotope leads to the coherence
enhancement of the VB- spin by a factor of three. In addition, the T2 time of
the VB- can be enhanced by a factor of 1.3 by inducing a curvature around VB-.
Herein, we elucidate that the curvature-induced inhomogeneous strain creates
spatially varying quadrupole nuclear interactions, which effectively suppress
the nuclear spin flip-flop dynamics in the bath. Importantly, we find that the
combination of isotopic enrichment and strain engineering can maximize the VB-
T2, yielding 207.2 and 161.9 {\mu}s for single- and multi-layer h-10BN,

certain applications (such as medical diagnosis, meteorological forecasting,

known as a calibrated estimate. In previous work, researchers have developed
several calibration methods to post-process the outputs of a predictor to
obtain calibrated values, such as binning and scaling methods. Compared with
scaling, binning methods are shown to have distribution-free theoretical
guarantees, which motivates us to prefer binning methods for calibration.
However, we notice that existing binning methods have several drawbacks: (a)
the binning scheme only considers the original prediction values, thus limiting
the calibration performance; and (b) the binning approach is non-individual,
mapping multiple samples in a bin to the same value, and thus is not suitable
for order-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-aware
binning framework, called Multiple Boosting Calibration Trees (MBCT), along
with a multi-view calibration loss to tackle the above issues. Our MBCT
optimizes the binning scheme by the tree structures of features, and adopts a
linear function in a tree node to achieve individual calibration. Our MBCT is
non-monotonic, and has the potential to improve order accuracy, due to its
learnable binning scheme and the individual calibration. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three datasets in different fields. Results show
that our method outperforms all competing models in terms of both calibration
error and order accuracy. We also conduct simulation experiments, justifying
that the proposed multi-view calibration loss is a better metric in modeling
calibration error.

the gyrotaxis is strong. By means of direct numerical simulations, we

did not. In a statistical sense, the eruptive ARs accumulate larger budgets of
both magnetic helicity and energy than the noneruptive ones over intervals that
start from flux emergence start time and end (i) at the end of flux emergence
phase, and (ii) when the AR produces its first CME or crosses W45, whichever
happens first. We found magnetic helicity and energy thresholds of $9 \times
10^{41}$ Mx$^2$ and $2 \times 10^{32}$ erg, respectively, which, if crossed,
ARs are likely to erupt. The segregation, in terms of accumulated magnetic
helicity and energy budgets, of the eruptive ARs from the noneruptive ones is
violated in one case when an AR erupts early in its emergence phase and in six
cases with noneruptive ARs exhibiting large magnetic helicity and energy
budgets. Decay index calculations may indicate that these ARs did not erupt
because the overlying magnetic field provided stronger or more extended
confinement than in eruptive ARs. Conclusions. Our results indicate that
emerging ARs tend to produce CMEs when they accumulate significant budgets of
both magnetic helicity and energy. Any study of their eruptive potential should
place magnetic helicity on equal footing with magnetic energy.

the intermediate domains was sufficiently large; hence, self-training was
possible without the need for labeled data. If the number of accessible
intermediate domains is restricted, the distances between domains become large,

outperforms artificial neural networks running on silicon chips in terms of
efficiency and footprint. However, digital hardware implementation of bionic
learning suffers from device heterogeneity in sensors and processing cores,
which incurs large hardware, energy and time overheads. Here, we present a
universal solution to simultaneously perform multi-modal sensing, memory and
processing using organic electrochemical transistors with designed architecture
and tailored channel morphology, selective ion injection into the
crystalline/amorphous regions. The resultant device work as either a volatile
receptor that shows multi-modal sensing, or a non-volatile synapse that
features record-high 10-bit analog states, low switching stochasticity and good
retention without the integration of any extra devices. Homogeneous integration
of such devices enables bionic learning functions such as conditioned reflex
and real-time cardiac disease diagnose via reservoir computing, illustrating
the promise for future smart edge health informatics.

resources to a set of available tasks, where the payoff of these tasks is
inherently uncertain. In credit card fraud detection, for instance, a bank can
only assign a small subset of transactions to their fraud investigations team.
Typically, such problems are solved using a classification framework, where the
focus is on predicting task outcomes given a set of characteristics. Resources
are then allocated to the tasks that are predicted to be the most likely to
succeed. However, we argue that using classification to address task
uncertainty is inherently suboptimal as it does not take into account the
available capacity. Therefore, we first frame the problem as a type of
assignment problem. Then, we present a novel solution using learning to rank by
directly optimizing the assignment's expected profit given limited, stochastic
capacity. This is achieved by optimizing a specific instance of the net
discounted cumulative gain, a commonly used class of metrics in learning to
rank. Empirically, we demonstrate that our new method achieves higher expected
profit and expected precision compared to a classification approach for a wide
variety of application areas and data sets. This illustrates the benefit of an
integrated approach and of explicitly considering the available resources when

to enhance wireless communication performance via passive signal reflection.
Existing works on IRS have mainly focused on investigating IRS's passive
beamforming/reflection design to boost the communication rate for users
assuming that their channel state information (CSI) is fully or partially
known. However, how to exploit IRS to improve the wireless transmission
reliability without any CSI, which is typical in high-mobility/delay-sensitive
communication scenarios, remains largely open. In this paper, we study a new
IRS-aided communication system with the IRS integrated to its aided access
point (AP) to achieve both functions of transmit diversity and passive
beamforming simultaneously. Specifically, we first show an interesting result
that the IRS's passive beamforming gain in any direction is invariant to the
common phase-shift applied to all of its reflecting elements. Accordingly, we
design the common phase-shift of IRS elements to achieve transmit diversity at
the AP side without the need of any CSI of the users. In addition, we propose a
practical method for the users to estimate the CSI at the receiver side for
information decoding. Meanwhile, we show that the conventional passive
beamforming gain of IRS can be retained for the other users with their CSI
known at the AP. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic performance of both
IRS-aided transmit diversity and passive beamforming in closed-form, by
considering the large-scale IRS with an infinite number of elements. Numerical
results validate our analysis and show the performance gains of the proposed
IRS-aided simultaneous transmit diversity and passive beamforming scheme over

forecast of travel demand could facilitate dispatch and relocation of bicycles
to improve user satisfaction. In recent years, many deep learning algorithms
have been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast. A typical practice is
to integrate convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture
spatial-temporal dependency in historical travel demand. For typical CNN, the
convolution operation is conducted through a kernel that moves across a
""matrix-format"" city to extract features over spatially adjacent urban areas.
This practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful
information that improves prediction accuracy. However, bicycle usage in
neighboring areas might not always be similar, given spatial variations in
built environment characteristics and travel behavior that affect cycling
activities. Yet, areas that are far apart can be relatively more similar in
temporal usage patterns. To utilize the hidden linkage among these distant
urban areas, the study proposes an irregular convolutional Long-Short Term
Memory model (IrConv+LSTM) to improve short-term bike sharing demand forecast.
The model modifies traditional CNN with irregular convolutional architecture to
extract dependency among ""semantic neighbors"". The proposed model is evaluated
with a set of benchmark models in five study sites, which include one dockless
bike sharing system in Singapore, and four station-based systems in Chicago,
Washington, D.C., New York, and London. We find that IrConv+LSTM outperforms
other benchmark models in the five cities. The model also achieves superior
performance in areas with varying levels of bicycle usage and during peak
periods. The findings suggest that ""thinking beyond spatial neighbors"" can
further improve short-term travel demand prediction of urban bike sharing
systems.

stream of tasks consisting of multiple locations to be visited by the agents on
a shared graph while avoiding collisions with one another. L-MAPF is typically
tackled by partitioning it into multiple consecutive, and hence similar,
""one-shot"" MAPF queries, as in the Rolling-Horizon Collision Resolution (RHCR)
algorithm. Therefore, a solution to one query informs the next query, which
leads to similarity with respect to the agents' start and goal positions, and
how collisions need to be resolved from one query to the next. Thus, experience
from solving one MAPF query can potentially be used to speedup solving the next
one. Despite this intuition, current L-MAPF planners solve consecutive MAPF
queries from scratch. In this paper, we introduce a new RHCR-inspired approach
called exRHCR, which exploits experience in its constituent MAPF queries. In
particular, exRHCR employs an extension of Priority-Based Search (PBS), a
state-of-the-art MAPF solver. The extension, which we call exPBS, allows to
warm-start the search with the priorities between agents used by PBS in the
previous MAPF instances. We demonstrate empirically that exRHCR solves L-MAPF
instances up to 39% faster than RHCR, and has the potential to increase system
throughput for given task streams by increasing the number of agents a planner
can cope with for a given time budget.

occurring in interacting quantum many-body systems. However, multicritical

multicritical points with specific behaviors and realizing their control
remains a challenging topic. Here, we propose a system that a quantized light
field interacts with a two-level atomic ensemble coupled by microwave fields in

Multicritical points for the superradiant quantum phase transition are shown to

demonstrate that they can be effectively manipulated through the tuning of
system parameters. Particularly, we find that the quantum critical points can
evolve into a Lifshitz point if the Rabi frequency of the light field is
modulated periodically in time. Remarkably, the texture of atomic pseudo-spins
can be used to characterize the quantum critical behaviors of the system. The
magnetic orders of the three phases around the Lifshitz point, represented by
the atomic pseudo-spins, are similar to those of an axial
next-nearest-neighboring Ising model. The results reported here are beneficial
for unveiling intriguing physics of quantum phase transitions and pave the way

a finite element exterior calculus formulation that is able to mimetically
represent conservation laws and cope with mixed open boundary conditions using
a single computational mesh. The possibility of including open boundary
conditions allows for modular composition of complex multi-physical systems
whereas the exterior calculus formulation provides a coordinate-free treatment.
Our approach relies on a dual-field representation of the physical system that
is redundant at the continuous level but eliminates the need of mimicking the
Hodge star operator at the discrete level. By considering the Stokes-Dirac
structure representing the system together with its adjoint, which embeds the
metric information directly in the codifferential, the need for an explicit
discrete Hodge star is avoided altogether. By imposing the boundary conditions
in a strong manner, the power balance characterizing the Stokes-Dirac structure
is then retrieved at the discrete level via symplectic Runge-Kutta integrators
based on Gauss-Legendre collocation points. Numerical experiments validate the
convergence of the method and the conservation properties in terms of energy
balance both for the wave and Maxwell equations in a three dimensional domain.
For the latter example, the magnetic and electric fields preserve their
divergence free nature at the discrete level.

characteristics of the upstream regions of interplanetary coronal mass
ejections (ICMEs) and their evolution as function of distance to the Sun in the
inner heliosphere. We use a sample of 40 well-observed ICMEs from Helios 1/2
(0.3-1au) and 5 from Parker Solar Probe (0.32-0.75au). For each event we
identify four main density structures, namely shock, sheath, leading edge (LE),
and magnetic ejecta (ME) itself. Methods: We derive separately for each
structure averaged plasma and magnetic field parameter values as well as
duration and place the results into comparison with the upstream solar wind
(SW) to investigate the interrelation between the different density structures.
Results: The sheath structure presumably consists of compressed plasma due to
the turbulent SW material following the shock. The sheath lies ahead of a
region of compressed ambient SW, the LE, which is typically found directly in
front of the magnetic driver and seems to match the bright leading edge
commonly observed in remote sensing observations of CMEs. The sheath becomes
denser than the ambient SW at about 0.06au, which we interpret as the average
starting distance for actual sheath formation. Between 0.09-0.28au the sheath
structure density starts to dominate over the density within the ME. The ME
density seems to fall below the ambient SW density over 0.45-1.07au. Besides
the well-known expansion of the ME, the sheath size shows a weak positive
correlation with distance, while the LE seems not to expand with distance from
the Sun. We further find a moderate anti-correlation between sheath density and
local SW plasma speed upstream of the ICME shock. An empirical relation is
derived connecting the ambient SW speed with sheath and LE density that can be
used for modeling of ICME evolution. Constraints to those results are given.

Machine learning (MLE) approaches for discrimination of spatial patterns of

inference is assessed by randomly permuting image labels or by the use of
random effect models that consider between-subject variability. These
multivariate MLE-based statistical pipelines, whilst potentially more effective
for detecting activations than hypotheses-driven methods, have lost their
mathematical elegance, ease of interpretation, and spatial localization of the
ubiquitous General linear Model (GLM). Recently, the estimation of the
conventional GLM has been demonstrated to be connected to an univariate
classification task when the design matrix is expressed as a binary indicator

GLM and MLE \emph{regressions}. To this purpose we derive a refined statistical
test with the GLM based on the parameters obtained by a linear Support Vector
Regression (SVR) in the \emph{inverse} problem (SVR-iGLM). Subsequently, random
field theory (RFT) is employed for assessing statistical significance following
a conventional GLM benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate how parameter
estimations derived from each model (mainly GLM and SVR) result in different
experimental design estimates that are significantly related to the predefined
functional task. Moreover, using real data from a multisite initiative the
proposed MLE-based inference demonstrates statistical power and the control of

superpositions of multiple spin density waves or spin spirals, as represented
by skyrmion crystals and hedgehog lattices. Such magnetic orderings have been
observed in various magnetic materials in recent years, and attracted enormous
attention, especially from the viewpoint of topology and emergent
electromagnetic fields originating from noncoplanar magnetic structures.
Although they often exhibit successive phase transitions among different
multiple-$Q$ states while changing temperature and an external magnetic field,
it is not straightforward to elucidate the phase diagrams, mainly due to the
lack of concise theoretical tools as well as appropriate microscopic models.
Here, we provide a theoretical framework for a class of effective spin models
with long-range magnetic interactions mediated by conduction electrons in
magnetic metals. Our framework is based on the steepest descent method with a
set of self-consistent equations that leads to exact solutions in the
thermodynamic limit, and has many advantages over existing methods such as
biased variational calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations. Applying
the framework to the models with instabilities toward triple- and hextuple-$Q$
magnetic orderings, we find that interesting reentrant phase transitions where
the multiple-$Q$ phases appear only at finite temperature and/or nonzero
magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the multiple-$Q$ states can be
topologically-nontrivial stacked skyrmion crystals or hedgehog lattices, which
exhibit large net spin scalar chirality associated with nonzero skyrmion
number. The results demonstrate that our framework could be a versatile tool
for studying magnetic and topological phase transitions and related quantum
phenomena in actual magnetic metals hosting multiple-$Q$ magnetic orderings.

is simulated using our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, taking into account the
heating of the surface layers of the disk with the stellar radiation. The
simulations show that MFTs periodically rise from the innermost region of the
disk with speeds up to $10-12$ km s$^{-1}$. MFTs experience decaying magnetic
oscillations under the action of the external magnetic field near the disk's
surface. The oscillation period increases with distance from the star and
initial plasma beta of the MFT, ranging from several hours at $r=0.012$ au up
to several months at $r=1$ au. The oscillations are characterized by pulsations
of the MFT's characteristics including its temperature. We argue that the
oscillations can produce observed IR-variability of Herbig Ae/Be stars, which
would be more intense than in the case of T Tauri stars, since the disks of

effect can limit the diversity of predictors being sampled by the learning

(i) favoring the learning of simpler but spurious features -- present in the
training data but absent from the test data -- and (ii) by only leveraging a
small subset of predictive features. Such an effect is especially magnified
when the test distribution does not exactly match the train distribution --
referred to as the Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. However,
given only the training data, it is not always possible to apriori assess if a

ensemble of models which capture a diverse set of predictive features. Towards
this, we propose a new algorithm D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training),

disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT naturally emerges from the

equation has a unique global bounded weak solution that converges towards a
steady state for large time horizons. Two scenarios might occur: When the
average density $\rho_{\infty}$ is larger than a certain critical density
$\rho_{cr}$, the steady state coincides with $\rho_{\infty}$ and the
convergence rate is exponential in the $L^2$ norm; while in the opposite case
$\rho_{\infty}<\rho_{cr}$, the steady state is unknown and the convergence is
algebraic in a negative Sobolev seminorm. Further investigations show that for
radially symmetric and decreasing initial data, the solution of the strongly

inverse-Compton losses at high redshift. Radio sources in denser environments
have flatter spectral indices, suggesting that spectral index asymmetry may be
a useful environment tracer. We simulate intermediate Mach number jets that
disrupt before reaching the tip of the lobe, and find that these retain an
edge-brightened Fanaroff-Riley Type II morphology, with the most prominent
emission remaining near the tip of the lobes for all environments and redshifts

we consider a model where the Lorentz violation is generated by the

  Methods. We applied a newly developed data reduction pipeline for integral
field spectrographs on archival SPHERE data of a resolved asteroid, (130)
Elektra. It was coupled with a dedicated point spread function reconstruction
algorithm to model the asteroid halo. Following the halo removal, the moon
signal could be extracted more accurately. The moon positions were fitted at
three epochs and were used to derive the orbital parameters via a genetic-based

  Results. We announce the discovery of S/2014 (130) 2, a third moon orbiting
(130) Elektra, making it the first quadruple asteroid ever found. It is
identified in three different epochs, 9, 30, and 31 Dec. 2014, at a respective
angular separation of 258 mas (333 km), 229 mas (327 km), and 319 mas (457 km).

344 km, with an eccentricity of 0.33 and an inclination of 38 degrees compared
to the primary rotation axis. With a relative magnitude to the primary of 10.5,

observed in various 1D devices. As for higher dimensions, numerous transverse
channels usually lead to dephasing that quenches the overall oscillation of the
conductance. Up to now, the FP oscillation in 2D electronic systems is only
reported in graphene-based devices, and very recently, the \emph{pn} junctions
of inverted InAs/GaSb double quantum well [Phys. Rev. X 10, 031007 (2020)]. In
the latter, the band shape of a sombrero hat plays an essential role, which
introduces a novel mechanism of electron-hole hybridization for the 2D FP
oscillation. In this work, we propose that such a scenario can be generalized
to the 2D planar junction composed of low-density Rashba gas, where the band
bottom possesses a sombrero hat shape as well. We show that the backscattering
between the outer and inner Fermi circles dominates the FP interference and
significantly suppresses the dephasing effect between different transverse
channels, which leads to a visible oscillation of the tunneling conductance.
Specially, the visibility of the oscillating pattern can be enhanced by
applying interface barriers, in contrast to that in the InAs/GaSb double
quantum well. Our results provide a promising way for the implementation of the
FP oscillation in the 2D electron gas.

some peculiar dispersive properties of linear fast sausage modes (FSMs) in
one-dimensional cylindrical equilibria with a continuous radial density profile
($\rho_0(r)$). As recognized recently on solid mathematical grounds, cutoff
axial wavenumbers may be absent for FSMs when $\rho_0(r)$ varies sufficiently
slowly outside the nominal cylinder. Trapped modes may therefore exist for
arbitrary axial wavenumbers and density contrasts, their axial phase speeds in
the long-wavelength regime differing little from the external Alfv$\acute{\rm
e}$n speed. If these trapped modes indeed show up in the solutions to the
associated initial value problem (IVP), then FSMs have a much better chance to
be observed than expected with classical theory, and can be invoked to account
for a considerably broader range of periodicities than practiced. However, with
axial fundamentals in active region loops as an example, we show that this
long-wavelength expectation is not seen in our finite-difference solutions to
the IVP, the reason for which is then explored by superposing the necessary
eigenmodes to re-solve the IVP. At least for the parameters we examine, the
eigenfunctions of trapped modes are characterized by a spatial extent well
exceeding the observationally reasonable range of the spatial extent of initial
perturbations, meaning a negligible fraction of energy that a trapped mode can
receive. We conclude that the absence of cutoff wavenumbers for FSMs in the
examined equilibrium does not guarantee a distinct temporal behavior.

have investigated the RKKY interaction between two magnetic impurities in both
time-reversal and inversion symmetry broken Weyl semimetals (WSMs) where the
energy dispersion is tilted in momentum space and the momentum of the
conduction electron is locked with the pseudo-spin. Two important features are
revealed, firstly, at the small tilt limit, we show that the RKKY coupling
varies quadratically with the tilt parameter and strikingly, at large
separation distance $\mathrm{R}$, the coupling decays as $1/\mathrm{R}$
compared to the conventional of $1/\mathrm{R}^{3}$ dependence exhibited by WSMs
with non-tilted dispersion. The slower decay by two orders i.e. ($1/\mathrm{R}$
as opposed to $1/\mathrm{R}^{3}$) of the RKKY coupling is significant for
maintaining long range RKKY coupling. Secondly, the RKKY coupling exhibits an
anisotropy with respect to the angle between the tilt direction ($\mathbf{w}$)
and the separation direction $\mathbf{R}$ unlike the case of non-tilted WSMs
which exhibit isotropic RKKY coupling. Consequently, the RKKY coupling in
tilted WSMs alternately favours ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic orders and
vice-versa with the change of the angle. Our results are derived analytically

local-feature matching. Direct matching of local features is sensitive to
significant changes in illumination. In contrast, object detection often
survives severe changes in lighting conditions. The proposed method first
detects semantic objects and establishes correspondences of those objects
between images. Object correspondences provide local coarse alignment of the
images in the form of a planar homography. These homographies are consequently
used to guide the matching of local features. Experiments on standard urban
localization datasets (Aachen, Extended-CMU-Season, RobotCar-Season) show that
OGuL significantly improves localization results with as simple local features

of a Hubble tension between measurements at high redshift ($z> 1000$) and at
low redshift ($z<1$) at the $5\sigma$ level with the low redshift measurement
giving a higher value. In this work we propose a particle physics model that
can help alleviate the Hubble tension via an out-of-equilibrium hidden sector
coupled to the visible sector. The particles that populate the dark sector
consist of a dark fermion, which acts as dark matter, a dark photon, a massive
scalar and a massless pseudo-scalar. Assuming no initial population of
particles in the dark sector, feeble couplings between the visible and the
hidden sectors via kinetic mixing populate the dark sector even though the
number densities of hidden sector particles never reach their equilibrium
distribution and the two sectors remain at different temperatures. A
cosmologically consistent analysis is presented where a correlated evolution of
the visible and the hidden sectors with coupled Boltzmann equations involving
two temperatures, one for the visible sector and the other for the hidden
sector, is carried out. The relic density of the dark matter constituted of
dark fermions is computed in this two-temperature formalism. As a consequence,
BBN predictions are upheld with a minimal contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.
However, the out-of-equilibrium decay of the massive scalar to the massless
pseudo-scalar close to the recombination time causes an increase in $\Delta
N_{\rm eff}$ that can help weaken the Hubble tension.

of polar transforms. In this paper, we observe that after each layer of polar
transforms, one can swap certain pairs of adjacent bits to accelerate the
polarization process. More precisely, if the previous bit is more reliable than
its next bit under the successive decoder, then switching the decoding order of
these two adjacent bits will make the reliable bit even more reliable and the
noisy bit even noisier.
  Based on this observation, we propose a new family of codes called the
Adjacent-Bits-Swapped (ABS) polar codes. We add a permutation layer after each
polar transform layer in the construction of the ABS polar codes. In order to
choose which pairs of adjacent bits to swap in the permutation layers, we rely
on a new polar transform that combines two independent channels with $4$-ary
inputs. This new polar transform allows us to track the evolution of every pair
of adjacent bits through different layers of polar transforms, and it also
plays an essential role in the Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder for
the ABS polar codes. Extensive simulation results show that ABS polar codes
consistently outperform standard polar codes by 0.15dB--0.3dB when we use
CRC-aided SCL decoder with list size $32$ for both codes. The implementations

isomers with short lifetimes via traditional accelerators or reactors because
of low beam intensity. Here, for the first time, we experimentally present
femtosecond pumping of nuclear isomeric states by the Coulomb excitation of
ions with the quivering electrons induced by laser fields. Nuclei populated on
the third excited state of 83Kr are generated with a peak efficiency of
2.34*10^15 particles=s from a tabletop hundred-TW laser system. It can be
explained by the Coulomb excitation of ions with the quivering electrons during
the interaction between laser pulses and clusters at nearly solid densities.
This efficient and universal production method can be widely used for pumping
isotopes with excited state lifetimes down to picoseconds, and could be a
benefit for fields like nuclear transition mechanisms and nuclear {\gamma}-ray

Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices in which the qubit states
quickly decay through processes of relaxation and decoherence. Ideal quantum
states evolve according to unitary dynamics, which modern devices are not
always capable of maintaining. Due to the persistent presence of noise from
various sources, the best NISQ devices ideally evolve according to Markovian
dynamics. NISQ devices, such as those offered by IBM through its cloud-based
open-access IBM Quantum Experience (IBM QE), are regularly re-calibrated to
reset the affect of external noise. The calibration information is shared to
provide the users with data about the qubit dynamics, which can be considered
in the design of experiments on the quantum devices. Recent literature has
shown evidence of superconducting qubit devices exhibiting non-Markovian
behaviour, while typically in IBM devices there are only built-in
implementations of Markovian noise models, implying that the devices evolve
according to Markovian dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate a method of
verifying the Markovian evolution of IBMQ devices in benchmark experiments,
while extracting multiple calibration parameters simultaneously through a
simplified process which is more reliable than typical calibration experiments.
This method has the additional benefit of highlighting the consistency among
qubit pairs when extracting parameters, which provides a less computationally

the mass of embedded bodies. Edge-on debris disks offer a unique opportunity to
simultaneously access the radial and vertical distribution of material, however
recovering either distribution in an unbiased way is challenging. In this

(scale height as a function of radius) of azimuthally symmetric, edge-on debris
disks. The method is primarily designed for observations at thermal emission

assumption of isotropic scattering. By removing assumptions on underlying
functional forms, this algorithm provides more realistic constraints on disk

relabeling and imitating self-generated experiences. In this paper, we revisit
the theoretical property of GCSL -- optimizing a lower bound of the goal
reaching objective, and extend GCSL as a novel offline goal-conditioned RL
algorithm. The proposed method is named Weighted GCSL (WGCSL), in which we
introduce an advanced compound weight consisting of three parts (1) discounted
weight for goal relabeling, (2) goal-conditioned exponential advantage weight,
and (3) best-advantage weight. Theoretically, WGCSL is proved to optimize an
equivalent lower bound of the goal-conditioned RL objective and generates
monotonically improved policies via an iterated scheme. The monotonic property
holds for any behavior policies, and therefore WGCSL can be applied to both
online and offline settings. To evaluate algorithms in the offline
goal-conditioned RL setting, we provide a benchmark including a range of point

demonstrate that WGCSL can consistently outperform GCSL and existing

two-phase flow procedure to optimize the shapes of free-floating vessels and
discusses three topics. First, we aim to convey that elements of a
Cahn-Hilliard formulation should augment the frequently employed
Volume-of-Fluid two-phase flow model to maintain dual consistency. It is seen
that such consistency serves as the basis for a robust primal/adjoint coupling
in practical applications at huge Reynolds and Froude numbers. The second topic
covers different adjoint coupling strategies. A central aspect of the
application is the floating position, particularly the trim and the sinkage,
that interact with a variation of hydrodynamic loads induced by the shape
updates. Other topics addressed refer to the required level of density coupling
and a more straightforward -- yet non-frozen -- adjoint treatment of
turbulence. The third part discusses the computation of a descent direction
within a node-based environment. We will illustrate means to deform both the
volume mesh and the hull shape simultaneously and at the same time obey
technical constraints on the vessel's displacement and its extensions. The
Hilbert-space approach provides smooth shape updates using the established
coding infrastructure of a computational fluid dynamics algorithm and provides
access to managing additional technical constraints. Verification and
validation follow from a submerged 2D cylinder case. The application includes a
full-scale offshore supply vessel at Re=3E+08 and Fn=0.37. Results illustrate

interest in the subsurface; such seismic reflections are however inevitably
contaminated by other events created by waves reverberating in the overburden.
Multi-Dimensional Deconvolution (MDD) is a powerful technique used at various
stages of the seismic processing sequence to create ideal datasets deprived of
such overburden effects. Whilst the underlying forward problem is well defined
for a single source, a successful inversion of the MDD equations requires
availability of a large number of sources alongside prior information
introduced in the form of physical preconditioners (e.g., reciprocity). In this
work, we reinterpret the cost function of time-domain MDD as a finite-sum
functional, and solve the associated inverse problem by means of stochastic
gradient descent algorithms, where gradients are computed using a small subset
of randomly selected sources. Through synthetic and field data examples, the
proposed method is shown to converge more stably than the conventional approach
based on full gradients. Stochastic MDD represents a novel, efficient, and
robust strategy to deconvolve seismic wavefields in a multi-dimensional

high-mass X-ray binary XTE J1855$-$026 taken entirely during the eclipse of the
neutron star (NS), covering the orbital phases $\phi= 0.00-0.11$. The analysis
of the data allows us to a) compare with the parameters obtained during the
existing pre eclipse observation and b) explore the back illuminated stellar
wind of the B0I type donor. The black body component, used to describe the soft
excess during pre eclipse, is not observed during eclipse. It must be then
produced near the NS or along the donor-NS line. The $0.3-10$ keV luminosity
during eclipse ($\sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is 70 times lower than pre
eclipse. The intensity of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, in the average eclipse
spectrum, is $\sim 7.4$ times lower than the one measured during pre eclipse.
Since K$\alpha$ photons can not be resonantly scattered in the wind, the vast
majority of Fe K$\alpha$ emission must come from distances within $1R_{*}$ from
the NS. The eclipse spectrum is successfully modelled through the addition of
two photoionized plasmas, one with low ionization ($\log\xi_{\rm 1,cold}=0.36$)
and high emission measure ($EM_{\rm 1,cold}\approx 3\times 10^{59}$ cm$^{-3}$)
and another with high ionization ($\log\xi_{\rm 2,hot}=3.7$) and low emission

cold and hot gas phases are the clumps and the interclump medium of the stellar
wind, respectively, and a clump volume filling factor of $\approx [0.04-0.05]$,
typical for massive stars, a density contrast between clumps and the interclump
medium of $n_{\rm c}/n_{\rm i}\approx 180$ is deduced, in agreement with
theoretical expectations and optical-UV observations of massive star winds.

variations of concentration of a resource, change the fitness of competing
strategies locally. The notion of fitness varying with respect to both genotype
and environment is important in modeling cancer initiation, microbial evolution
and evolution of drug resistance. Environmental interactions can be asymmetric,
that is, they affect the fitness of one type more than the other. The question
is how local environmental variations in network population structures change
the selection dynamics in a finite population setting. We consider
one-dimensional lattice population structures with spatial fitness
distributions with a periodic pattern. Heterogeneity is determined by standard
deviation of fitnesses and period. The model covers biologically relevant
limits of two-habitat subdivided populations and randomly-distributed resources
in high- and low-periods. We numerically calculate fixation probability and
fixation times for a constant population birth-death process as fitness
heterogeneity and period vary. We identify levels of heterogeneity for which a
previously deleterious mutant, in a uniform environment, becomes beneficial. In
other regimes of the problem we observe unexpected behavior where the fixation
probability of both types are larger than their neutral value at the same time.
This coincides with an exponential increase in time to fixation as a function
of population size, which points to significant slow-down in selection process
and the potential for coexistence between types in realistic time scales. We
also discuss `fitness shift' model where the fitness function of one type is
identical to the other up to a constant spatial shift. This leads to
significant increase (or decrease) in the fixation probability of the mutant

Moreover, it can be achieved in the regime beyond weak non-linearity -- when
the concentration deviation due to the soliton is of the order of the

optimisation. Many different policies have been introduced on an empirical
basis, and theoretical analyses have been developed for convex settings.
However, in many realistic problems the loss-landscape is high-dimensional and
non convex -- a case for which results are scarce. In this paper we present a
first analytical study of the role of learning rate scheduling in this setting,
focusing on Langevin optimization with a learning rate decaying as
$\eta(t)=t^{-\beta}$. We begin by considering models where the loss is a
Gaussian random function on the $N$-dimensional sphere ($N\rightarrow \infty$),
featuring an extensive number of critical points. We find that to speed up
optimization without getting stuck in saddles, one must choose a decay rate
$\beta<1$, contrary to convex setups where $\beta=1$ is generally optimal. We
then add to the problem a signal to be recovered. In this setting, the dynamics
decompose into two phases: an \emph{exploration} phase where the dynamics
navigates through rough parts of the landscape, followed by a
\emph{convergence} phase where the signal is detected and the dynamics enter a
convex basin. In this case, it is optimal to keep a large learning rate during
the exploration phase to escape the non-convex region as quickly as possible,
then use the convex criterion $\beta=1$ to converge rapidly to the solution.
Finally, we demonstrate that our conclusions hold in a common regression task
involving neural networks.

to help people automatically discover their interests. Existing models often
represent the rich information for recommendation, such as items, users, and
contexts, as embedding vectors and leverage them to predict users' feedback. In
the view of causal analysis, the associations between these embedding vectors
and users' feedback are a mixture of the causal part that describes why an item
is preferred by a user, and the non-causal part that merely reflects the
statistical dependencies between users and items, for example, the exposure
mechanism, public opinions, display position, etc. However, existing RSs mostly
ignored the striking differences between the causal parts and non-causal parts
when using these embedding vectors. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
framework named IV4Rec that can effectively decompose the embedding vectors
into these two parts, hence enhancing recommendation results. Specifically, we
jointly consider users' behaviors in search scenarios and recommendation
scenarios. Adopting the concepts in causal analysis, we embed users' search
behaviors as instrumental variables (IVs), to help decompose original embedding
vectors in recommendation, i.e., treatments. IV4Rec then combines the two parts
through deep neural networks and uses the combined results for recommendation.
IV4Rec is model-agnostic and can be applied to a number of existing RSs such as
DIN and NRHUB. Experimental results on both public and proprietary industrial
datasets demonstrate that IV4Rec consistently enhances RSs and outperforms a
framework that jointly considers search and recommendation.

important special case of the $q$-fold self-tensoring of a dataset, which is

their runtime or remove the dependence on $q$ at the expense of having
sub-optimal target dimension, and depend quadratically on the number of

$q$ partially correlated random projections which can be simultaneously applied
to a dataset $X$ in total time that only depends on the size of $X$, and at the

which can be used in isogeometric analysis (IGA). A key property of IGA is that
it is simple to achieve high order smoothness within a single patch. To
represent more complex geometries one often uses a multi-patch construction. In
this case, the global continuity for the basis functions is in general only
$C^0$. Therefore, to obtain $C^1$-smooth isogeometric functions, a special
construction for the basis is needed. Such spaces are of interest when solving
numerically fourth-order problems, such as the biharmonic equation or
Kirchhoff-Love plate/shell formulations, using an isogeometric Galerkin method.
  Isogeometric spaces that are globally $C^1$ over multi-patch domains can be
constructed as in (Collin, Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD, 2016) and (Kapl, Sangalli,
Takacs; CAGD, 2019). The constructions require so-called analysis-suitable
$G^1$ parametrizations. To allow $C^1$ spaces over more general multi-patch
parametrizations, we need to increase the polynomial degree and relax the $C^1$
conditions. We adopt the approximate $C^1$ construction for two-patch domains,
as developed in (Weinm\""uller, Takacs; CMAME, 2021), and extend it to more
general multi-patch domains.
  We employ the construction for a biharmonic model problem and compare the
results with Nitsche's method. We compare both methods over complex multi-patch
domains with non-trivial interfaces. The numerical tests indicate that the
proposed construction converges optimally under $h$-refinement, comparable to
the solution using Nitsche's method. In contrast to weakly imposing coupling
conditions, the approximate $C^1$ construction is explicit and no additional
terms need to be introduced to stabilize the method. Thus, the new proposed
method can be used more easily as no parameters need to be estimated.

all potentially possible emission reduction measures are linked by
interactions, the evaluation of a single measure in terms of cost efficiency,

comprehensive modeling of industrial processes and implementation of recycling
options, the impact of recycling measures in the context of national greenhouse
gas mitigation strategies can be analyzed. The scenario evaluation shows that
different recycling strategies have large effects on the German energy system.
Without recycling energy demand in 2050 will increase by more than 300 TWh and
cost of transformation will rise by 85% compared to a reference scenario. On
the other hand, if maximum recycling rates can be achieved, costs of

incoming data, and thus, are widely used as the storage layer of production
NoSQL data stores. To enable competitive read performance, LSM-trees
periodically re-organize data to form a tree with levels of exponentially
increasing capacity, through iterative compactions. Compactions fundamentally
influence the performance of an LSM-engine in terms of write amplification,
write throughput, point and range lookup performance, space amplification, and
delete performance. Hence, choosing the appropriate compaction strategy is
crucial and, at the same time, hard as the LSM-compaction design space is vast,
largely unexplored, and has not been formally defined in the literature. As a
result, most LSM-based engines use a fixed compaction strategy, typically
hand-picked by an engineer, which decides how and when to compact data.
  In this paper, we present the design space of LSM-compactions, and evaluate
state-of-the-art compaction strategies with respect to key performance metrics.
Toward this goal, our first contribution is to introduce a set of four design
primitives that can formally define any compaction strategy: (i) the compaction
trigger, (ii) the data layout, (iii) the compaction granularity, and (iv) the
data movement policy. Together, these primitives can synthesize both existing
and completely new compaction strategies. Our second contribution is to
experimentally analyze 10 compaction strategies. We present 12 observations and
7 high-level takeaway messages, which show how LSM systems can navigate the
compaction design space.

Neural Networks with canonical correlation analysis (CCA-GNN). The proposed
approach lays its foundations on a state-of-the-art CCA-GNN that learns
representative embeddings by maximizing the correlation between pairs of
augmented views of the same input while decorrelating disconnected features.
The key idea of the conventional CCA-GNN involves discarding
augmentation-variant information and preserving augmentation-invariant
information while preventing capturing of redundant information. Our proposed
AV CCA-GNN model deals with multimodal representation learning context.
Specifically, our model improves contextual AV speech processing by maximizing
canonical correlation from augmented views of the same channel and canonical
correlation from audio and visual embeddings. In addition, it proposes a
positional node encoding that considers a prior-frame sequence distance instead
of a feature-space representation when computing the node's nearest neighbors,
introducing temporal information in the embeddings through the neighborhood's
connectivity. Experiments conducted on the benchmark ChiME3 dataset show that
our proposed prior frame-based AV CCA-GNN ensures better feature learning in
the temporal context, leading to more energy-efficient speech reconstruction
than state-of-the-art CCA-GNN and multilayer perceptron.

potentials in one species, while the other species is influenced only via the
interspecies interaction. In both species, the number and the dominant sign of
the vortices are determined by the rotation frequency of the paddle potential.
Clusters of positive and negative vortices form at a low rotation frequency
comparable to that of the trap when using the single paddle potential. In
contrast, vortices of the same sign tend to dominate as the rotation frequency
of the paddle increases, and the angular momentum reaches a maximum value at a
paddle frequency, where the paddle velocity becomes equal to the sound velocity
of the condensate. When the rotation frequency is sufficiently high, the rapid
annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs significantly reduces the number of
vortices and antivortices in the system. For two paddle potentials rotating in
the same direction, the vortex dynamics phenomenon is similar to that of a
single paddle. However, when the paddle potentials are rotated in the opposite
direction, both positive and negative signed vortices occur at all rotational
frequencies. At the low rotation frequencies, the cluster of like-signed
vortices produces the $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$ power laws in the incompressible
kinetic energy spectrum at low and high wavenumbers, respectively, a hallmark

missing key components, bringing 3D hand model to a new level of realism. We
first annotate muscles, bones and skins on the recent Magnetic Resonance
Imaging hand (MRI-Hand) dataset and then register a volumetric template hand
onto individual poses and subjects within the dataset. NIMBLE consists of 20
bones as triangular meshes, 7 muscle groups as tetrahedral meshes, and a skin
mesh. Via iterative shape registration and parameter learning, it further
produces shape blend shapes, pose blend shapes, and a joint regressor. We
demonstrate applying NIMBLE to modeling, rendering, and visual inference tasks.
By enforcing the inner bones and muscles to match anatomic and kinematic rules,
NIMBLE can animate 3D hands to new poses at unprecedented realism. To model the
appearance of skin, we further construct a photometric HandStage to acquire
high-quality textures and normal maps to model wrinkles and palm print.
Finally, NIMBLE also benefits learning-based hand pose and shape estimation by
either synthesizing rich data or acting directly as a differentiable layer in

Hence, in this paper, artificial intelligence methods such as neural network
(NN), deep neural network (DNN), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering combined with
deep neural network (FCM-DNN) are developed for diagnosing CAD on a cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) dataset. The original dataset is used in two
different approaches. First, the labeled dataset is applied to the NN and DNN
to create the NN and DNN models. Second, the labels are removed, and the
unlabeled dataset is clustered via the FCM method, and then, the clustered
dataset is fed to the DNN to create the FCM-DNN model. By utilizing the second
clustering and modeling, the training process is improved, and consequently,
the accuracy is increased. As a result, the proposed FCM-DNN model achieves the
best performance with a 99.91% accuracy specifying 10 clusters, i.e., 5
clusters for healthy subjects and 5 clusters for sick subjects, through the
10-fold cross-validation technique compared to the NN and DNN models reaching
the accuracies of 92.18% and 99.63%, respectively. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has been conducted for CAD diagnosis on the CMRI dataset
using artificial intelligence methods. The results confirm that the proposed
FCM-DNN model can be helpful for scientific and research centers.

using segmentation maps to drive the training, but the edge maps are easier and
faster to acquire and do not require annotations. We evaluate our approach in

binary evolution models, and to constrain the neutron star equation of state.
In pulsar binaries with no measurable post-Keplerian parameters, this requires
an accurate estimate of the binary system's inclination and the radial velocity
of the companion star by other means than pulsar timing. In this paper, we
present the results of a new method for measuring this radial velocity using
the binary synthesis code Icarus. This method relies on constructing a model
spectrum of a tidally distorted, irradiated star as viewed for a given binary
configuration. This method is applied to optical spectra of the newly
discovered black widow PSR J1555-2908. By modelling the optical spectroscopy
alongside optical photometry, we find that the radial velocity of the companion
star is $397\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$ (errors quoted at 95\% confidence interval), as

thermoresponsive hydrogel ribbons (microgels) under periodic heating and
cooling in the confined space between two planar surfaces. As the result of the
temperature changes, the volume and thus the shape of the slender microgel
change, which lead to repeated cycles of bending and elastic relaxation, and to
net locomotion. Small devices designed for biomimetic locomotion need to
exploit flows that are not symmetric in time (non-reciprocal) to escape the
constraints of the scallop theorem and undergo net motion. Unlike other
biological slender swimmers, the non-reciprocal bending of the gel centreline
is not sufficient here to explain for the overall swimming motion. We show
instead that the swimming of the gel results from the flux of water
periodically emanating from (or entering) the gel itself due to its shrinking

propulsive force on the gel. We derive a theoretical model for this hypothesis
of jet-driven propulsion, which leads to excellent agreement with our

researchers have been overly dependent on pre-processing and hand-crafted

several other domains, deep learning has not yet been accomplished for EEG. In
this paper, the efficacy of the transformer network for the classification of
raw EEG data (cleaned and pre-processed) is explored. The performance of
transformer networks was evaluated on a local (age and gender data) and a
public dataset (STEW). First, a classifier using a transformer network is built
to classify the age and gender of a person with raw resting-state EEG data.
Second, the classifier is tuned for mental workload classification with open
access raw multi-tasking mental workload EEG data (STEW). The network achieves
an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art accuracy on both the local (Age and
Gender dataset; 94.53% (gender) and 87.79% (age)) and the public (STEW dataset;
95.28% (two workload levels) and 88.72% (three workload levels)) dataset. The
accuracy values have been achieved using raw EEG data without feature

can inform decision-making and control planning during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic and for future disease outbreaks. In this study, we use mathematical
models to evaluate the impact of quarantine measures on COVID-19 spread in four
cities that experienced large-scale outbreaks in the spring of 2020: Wuhan, New
York, Milan, and London. We develop a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed

contain the outbreak; however, the quarantine rates for these populations can
be reduced through faster isolation of confirmed cases. We generate

its middle surface and two stretches normal to the middle surface.
Crystal-elasticity based kinematic rules are employed to express the deformed

continuum hyper-elastic strain energy of the TMD membrane is formulated from
its inter-atomic potential. The relative shifts between two simple lattices of

among the firms is one of the crucial problems to mitigate the credit risk
since the default correlations significantly affect the portfolio loss
distribution and hence play a significant role in allocating capital for
solvency purposes. In this article, we derive a closed-form expression for the
probability of default of a single firm and the probability of the total number
of defaults by any time $t$ in a homogeneous portfolio of firms. We use a
contagion process to model the arrival of credit events that causes the default
and develop a framework that allows firms to have resistance against default
unlike the standard intensity-based models. We assume the point process driving
the credit events to be composed of a systematic and an idiosyncratic
component, whose intensities are independently specified by a mean-reverting
affine jump-diffusion process with self-exciting jumps. The proposed framework
is competent of capturing the feedback effect, an empirically observed
phenomenon in the default events. We further demonstrate how the proposed
framework can be used to price synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
and obtain a closed-form solution for tranche spread. Finally, we present the
sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the effect of different parameters
governing the contagion effect on the spread of tranches and the expected loss
of the CDO.

  Activity",,,,,"physics.med-ph cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a triboelectric nanogenerator-based (TENG) therapeutic
stress ball to provide gesture monitoring and physiological data on patients
requiring physical therapy of various degrees. The device utilizes a 5-layer
stack of silicone and braided silver-coated nylon rope electrodes to create a
sensor network that monitors 40-points across the surface of a semi-spherical
prototype. A modified version of a standard ECG circuit was utilized to provide
proper loading, noise rejection, filtering, and phase of the TENG signals along
with multiplexing of the many electrodes. All system components were selected
with a final embedded system in mind. Testing of the device was conducted
utilizing an Arduino Uno and an EVAL-AD5940BIOZ evaluation board for
electrodermal activity for stress and/or pain after exercise. An accelerometer
was included for device activation and hand tremor detection. Upon testing, the
self-powered TENG sensors produce positive impulses upon contact and negative
impulses upon release of contact from the surface of the ball. Furthermore,
finger removal detection was demonstrated by capturing the associated negative
impulse by maintaining the bipolar signal in our conditioning circuit. EDA
results indicate silver-coated nylon as a potentially good dry-electrode which
can be used with even more electrodes for bio-impedance or ECG capture to
further expand the device functionality. A MATLAB-based GUI was designed to
provide the user with data tracking and visual monitoring of the data via
serial communication from the microcontrollers. Finally, it should be noted
that this provides a means for low-cost low-power gesture tracking without the
use of flexible capacitive grid arrays and provides the user with a pleasant
tactile experience that one expects form a stress ball due to its unique
material design.

presented, which works through the IEEE 802.11b/g/n standard. Due to strong
interaction between the sensor antenna and the body, an innovative robust
system is designed with a small footprint that can serve on- and off-body
healthcare applications. The measured and simulated results are in good
agreement. The design offers a wide range of omnidirectional radiation patterns
in free space, with a reflection coefficient (S11) of -29.30 (-30.97) dB in the
lower (upper) bands. S11 reaches up to -23.07 (-27.07) dB and -30.76 (-31.12)
dB, respectively, on the human body chest and arm. The Specific Absorption Rate
(SAR) values are below the regulatory limitations for both 1-gram (1.6 W/Kg)
and 10-gram tissues (2.0 W/Kg). Experimental tests of the read range validate
the results of a maximum coverage range of 40 meters.

Developing
systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs independently
could make programming more productive and accessible, yet so far incorporating
innovations in AI has proven challenging. Recent large-scale language models
have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate code, and are now able to
complete simple programming tasks. However, these models still perform poorly
when evaluated on more complex, unseen problems that require problem-solving
skills beyond simply translating instructions into code. For example,
competitive programming problems which require an understanding of algorithms
and complex natural language remain extremely challenging. To address this gap,
we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that can create novel
solutions to these problems that require deeper reasoning. In simulated
evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform,
AlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3% in competitions with more
than 5,000 participants. We found that three key components were critical to
achieve good and reliable performance: (1) an extensive and clean competitive
programming dataset for training and evaluation, (2) large and
efficient-to-sample transformer-based architectures, and (3) large-scale model
sampling to explore the search space, followed by filtering based on program
behavior to a small set of submissions.
