commonly observed issue for college students due to study workload as well as
peer and social influence. Understanding its impact and identifying students
with poor sleep habits matters a lot in educational management. Most of the
current research is either based on self-reports and questionnaires, suffering
from a small sample size and social desirability bias, or the methods used are
not suitable for the education system. In this paper, we develop a general
data-driven method for identifying students' sleep patterns according to their
Internet access pattern stored in the education management system and explore
its influence from various aspects. First, we design a Possion-based
probabilistic mixture model to cluster students according to the distribution
of bedtime and identify students who are used to staying up late. Second, we
profile students from five aspects (including eight dimensions) based on
campus-behavior data and build Bayesian networks to explore the relationship
between behavioral characteristics and sleeping habits. Finally, we test the
predictability of sleeping habits. This paper not only contributes to the
understanding of student sleep from a cognitive and behavioral perspective but
also presents a new approach that provides an effective framework for various
educational institutions to detect the sleeping patterns of students.

utilizes a novel pruning strategy based on a sigmoid function that induces
sparsity level globally over the course of one single round of training. The
ASNI algorithm fulfills both tasks that current state-of-the-art strategies can
only do one of them. The ASNI algorithm has two subalgorithms: 1) ASNI-I, 2)
ASNI-II. ASNI-I learns an accurate sparse off-the-shelf network only in one
single round of training. ASNI-II learns a sparse network and an initialization
that is quantized, compressed, and from which the sparse network is trainable.
The learned initialization is quantized since only two numbers are learned for
initialization of nonzero parameters in each layer L. Thus, quantization levels
for the initialization of the entire network is 2L. Also, the learned
initialization is compressed because it is a set consisting of 2L numbers. The
special sparse network that can be trained from such a quantized and compressed
initialization is called amenable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
other algorithm that can learn a quantized and compressed initialization from
which the network is still trainable and is able to solve both pruning tasks.
Our numerical experiments show that there is a quantized and compressed
initialization from which the learned sparse network can be trained and reach
to an accuracy on a par with the dense version. We experimentally show that
these 2L levels of quantization are concentration points of parameters in each
layer of the learned sparse network by ASNI-I. To corroborate the above, we
have performed a series of experiments utilizing networks such as ResNets,
VGG-style, small convolutional, and fully connected ones on ImageNet, CIFAR10,

an unbiased spectral survey at 3mm, 2mm, and 1.3mm. The observed line emission
has been analysed using LTE and non-LTE LVG approaches. The NOEMA/SOLIS images
of CH2DCN show that this species emits in an unresolved area centered towards
the SVS13-A continuum emission peak, suggesting that methyl cyanide and its

ratio is $\sim$9\%. This value is consistent with those measured towards
prestellar cores and a factor 2-3 higher than those measured in Class 0
protostars. Contrarily to what expected for other molecular species, the CH3CN
deuteration does not show a decrease in SVS13-A with respect to measurements in
younger prestellar cores and Class 0 protostars. Finally, we discuss why our
new results suggest that CH3CN was likely synthesised via gas-phase reactions

model without shortages with instantaneous or finite production rate under
fuzzy environment. In the present day scenario, it is difficult to decide the
exact annual demand rate and hence a major difficulty is faced by a decision
maker to forecast the demand. Also, in any inventory system, goods in stock may
subject to deterioration or leakage. Deterioration of goods refers to decrease
in quality whereas quantity remains more or less the same. On the other hand,
leakage refers to loss in quantity whereas the quality remains unchanged for a
certain period of time. Leakages in the inventory system may be considered to
be very small, not detectable by the management immediately and hence it is
difficult to decide the exact leakage rate. The objective of this paper is to
consider these variable parameters and determine the optimal economic order
quantity (EOQ) to maximise the annual total profit. So, fuzzy inventory models
have been proposed considering fuzzy leakage rate and fuzzy annual demand rate
to estimate the total profit per unit time. Signed distance method is used for
defuzzification. Numerical examples are provided to support the results of the
proposed models.

a service to a group of potential buyers. Each buyer $i$ has a private value
$v_i$ for receiving the service and a feasibility constraint restricts which
sets of buyers can be served simultaneously. Recent work in economics
introduced clock auctions as a superior class of auctions for this problem, due
to their transparency, simplicity, and strong incentive guarantees. Subsequent
work focused on evaluating the social welfare approximation guarantees of these
auctions, leading to strong impossibility results: in the absence of prior
information regarding the buyers' values, no deterministic clock auction can
achieve a bounded approximation, even for simple feasibility constraints with
only two maximal feasible sets.
  We show that these negative results can be circumvented by using prior
information or by leveraging randomization. We provide clock auctions that give
a $O(\log\log k)$ approximation for general downward-closed feasibility
constraints with $k$ maximal feasible sets for three different information
models, ranging from full access to the value distributions to complete absence
of information. The more information the seller has, the simpler these auctions
are. Under full access, we use a particularly simple deterministic clock
auction, called a single-price clock auction, which is only slightly more
complex than posted price mechanisms. In this auction, each buyer is offered a
single price and a feasible set is selected among those who accept their
offers. In the other extreme, where no prior information is available, this
approximation guarantee is obtained using a complex randomized clock auction.
In addition to our main results, we propose a parameterization that
interpolates between single-price clock auctions and general clock auctions,
paving the way for an exciting line of future research.

accidents and harm in safety-critical systems governed by varying degrees of
software-based automation and decision-making. This field embraces the core
assumption of systems and control that AI systems cannot be safeguarded by
technical design choices on the model or algorithm alone, instead requiring an
end-to-end hazard analysis and design frame that includes the context of use,
impacted stakeholders and the formal and informal institutional environment in
which the system operates. Safety and other values are then inherently
socio-technical and emergent system properties that require design and control
measures to instantiate these across the technical, social and institutional
components of a system. This chapter honors system safety pioneer Nancy
Leveson, by situating her core lessons for today's AI system safety challenges.
For every lesson, concrete tools are offered for rethinking and reorganizing
the safety management of AI systems, both in design and governance. This

is the establishment of quantum nonlocal correlations over a realistic channel.
While loophole-free tests of Bell nonlocality allow for entanglement
certification in such a device-independent setting, they are extremely
sensitive to loss and noise, which naturally arise in any practical
communication scenario. Quantum steering relaxes the strict technological
constraints of Bell nonlocality by re-framing it in an asymmetric manner, thus
providing the basis for one-sided device-independent quantum networks that can
operate under realistic conditions. Here we introduce a noise-robust and
loss-tolerant test of quantum steering designed for single detector
measurements that harnesses the advantages of high-dimensional entanglement. We
showcase the improvements over qubit-based systems by experimentally
demonstrating detection loophole-free quantum steering in 53 dimensions through
simultaneous loss and noise conditions corresponding to 14.2 dB loss equivalent
to 79 km of telecommunication fibre, and 36% of white noise. We go on to show
how the use of high dimensions counter-intuitively leads to a dramatic
reduction in total measurement time, enabling a quantum steering violation
almost two orders of magnitude faster obtained by simply doubling the Hilbert
space dimension. By surpassing the constraints imposed upon the
device-independent distribution of entanglement, our loss-tolerant,
noise-robust, and resource-efficient demonstration of quantum steering proves
itself a critical ingredient for making device-independent quantum

challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the harvested energy and the

utilization of the target device under dynamic energy harvesting patterns and
battery constraints. Moreover, tinyMAN does not rely on forecasts of the
harvested energy which makes it a prediction-free approach. We deployed tinyMAN
on a wearable device prototype using TensorFlow Lite for Micro thanks to its
small memory footprint of less than 100 KB. Our evaluations show that tinyMAN

for the extraction of information from multi-channel physiological time-series.
However, in the analysis of physiological signals from heterogeneous organ

information loss. Here, we introduce the framework of Stratified Entropy to
prioritize each channels' dynamics based on their allocation to respective
strata, leading to a richer description of the multi-channel time-series. As an
implementation of the framework, three algorithmic variations of the Stratified
Multivariate Multiscale Dispersion Entropy are introduced. These variations and
the original algorithm are applied to synthetic time-series, waveform
physiological time-series, and derivative physiological data. Based on the
synthetic time-series experiments, the variations successfully prioritize
channels following their strata allocation while maintaining the low
computation time of the original algorithm. In experiments on waveform
physiological time-series and derivative physiological data, increased
discrimination capacity was noted for multiple strata allocations in the
variations when benchmarked to the original algorithm. This suggests improved
physiological state monitoring by the variations. Furthermore, our variations
can be modified to utilize a priori knowledge for the stratification of
channels. Thus, our research provides a novel approach for the extraction of
previously inaccessible information from multi-channel time series acquired
from heterogeneous systems.

conventional AT requires ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples

empirical (though mostly the latter), have largely focused on recovering good

intricately tied to the downstream task itself. This lens is undoubtedly very
interesting, but suffers from the problem that there isn't a ""canonical"" set of
downstream tasks to focus on -- in practice, this problem is usually resolved
by competing on the benchmark dataset du jour.
  In this paper, we present an alternative lens: one of parameter
identifiability. More precisely, we consider data coming from a parametric
probabilistic model, and train a self-supervised learning predictor with a
suitably chosen parametric form. Then, we ask whether we can read off the
ground truth parameters of the probabilistic model from the optimal predictor.
We focus on the widely used self-supervised learning method of predicting
masked tokens, which is popular for both natural languages and visual data.
  While incarnations of this approach have already been successfully used for
simpler probabilistic models (e.g. learning fully-observed undirected graphical
models), we focus instead on latent-variable models capturing sequential
structures -- namely Hidden Markov Models with both discrete and conditionally
Gaussian observations. We show that there is a rich landscape of possibilities,
out of which some prediction tasks yield identifiability, while others do not.
Our results, borne of a theoretical grounding of self-supervised learning,
could thus potentially beneficially inform practice. Moreover, we uncover close
connections with uniqueness of tensor rank decompositions -- a widely used tool

robot here describes technologies that can physically affect and in turn be
affected by their environments which includes humans. This chapter delves into
issues of cyber human interaction from the perspective of humans interacting
with a subset of robots known as assistive robots. Assistive robots are robots
designed to assist individuals with mobility or capacity limitations in
completing everyday activities, commonly called instrumental activities of
daily living. These range from household chores, eating or drinking to any
activity with which a user may need the daily assistance of a caregiver to
complete. One common type of assistive robot is the wheelchair mounted robotic
arm. This device is designed to attach to a user's wheelchair to allow him or
her to complete their activities independently. In short, these devices have
sensors that allow them to sense and process their environment with varying
levels of autonomy to perform actions that benefit and improve the well-being
of people with capability limitations or disabilities. While human robot
interaction is a popular research topic, not much research has been dedicated
with regard to individual with limitations. In this chapter, we provide an
overview of assistive robotic devices, discuss common methods of user

swarm of underwater vehicles that is tasked with the indirect control of an
advection-diffusion environmental field. The microscopic vehicle dynamics are
governed by a stochastic differential equation with drift. The drift terms
model the self-propelled velocity of the vehicle and the velocity field of the
currents. In the mean-field setting, the macroscopic vehicle dynamics are
governed by a Kolmogorov forward equation in the form of a linear parabolic
advection-diffusion equation. The environmental field is governed by an
advection-diffusion equation in which the advection term is defined by the
fluid velocity field. The vehicles are equipped with on-board actuators that
enable the swarm to act as a distributed source in the environmental field,
modulated by a scalar control parameter that determines the local source
intensity. In this setting, we formulate an optimal control problem to compute
the vehicle velocity and actuator intensity fields that drive the environmental
field to a desired distribution within a specified amount of time. In other
words, we design optimal vector and scalar actuation fields to indirectly
control the environmental field through a distributed source, produced by the
swarm. After proving an existence result for the solution of the optimal
control problem, we discretize and solve the problem using the Finite Element
Method (FEM). The FEM discretization naturally provides an operator that
represents the bilinear way in which the controls enter into the dynamics of
the vehicle swarm and the environmental field. Finally, we show through
numerical simulations the effectiveness of our control strategy in regulating
the environmental field to zero or to a desired distribution in the presence of
a double-gyre flow field.

information about the structure (the radial distribution function and the
static structure factor) and the thermodynamics of the system is sufficient to
describe collective dynamics over a wide range of spatial ranges, namely, from
the extended hydrodynamic to the microscopic dynamics scale. The main
experimentally measurable characteristics of the equilibrium collective
dynamics of ions -- the spectrum of the dynamic structure factor, the
dispersion parameters, the speed of sound and the sound attenuation -- are
determined within the framework of the theory without using any adjustable

uses two key components -- 1) a multiplexing layer that performs a fixed linear

  Aims. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of heavy elements on
the $\Gamma_1$ profile. We calculated $\Gamma_1$ with the SAHA-S equation of
state for different chemical compositions of plasma, and we analyzed
contributions of individual elements to $\Gamma_1$.
  Methods. We studied the decrease in $\Gamma_1$ due to the ionization of heavy
elements in comparison with the value obtained for a pure hydrogen-helium
plasma. These types of differences are denoted as ""Z contributions"", and we
analyzed them for eight elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe) as well as
for a mixture of elements corresponding to the solar chemical composition. We
compared linear combinations of individual Z contributions with the exact Z
contribution. Applying a least-squares technique to the decomposition of the
full Z contribution to a basis of individual-element contributions, we obtained
the mass fractions of the heavy elements.
  Results. The Z contribution of heavy elements can be described by a linear
combination of individual-element Z contributions with a high level of accuracy
of 5e-6 . The inverse problem of estimating the mass fractions of heavy
elements from a given $\Gamma_1$ profile was considered for the example of
solar-type mixtures. In ideal numerical simulations, the mass fractions of the
most abundant elements could be determined with a relative accuracy better than
a few tenths of a percent. In the presence of random or systematic errors in
the $\Gamma_1$ profile, abundance estimations become remarkably less accurate.
If the amplitude of the errors does not exceed 1e-4, we can expect a
determination of at least the oxygen abundance with a relative error of about
10%.

allows the study of the key plasma parameters as functions of space and time.
Quantities that help in understanding the dynamics of the plasma, e.g. Lorentz

that, while density and pressure have a rather global behaviour, the other
physical quantities undergo local changes, with their magnitude and orientation
changing in space and time. At the surface, the mixing in the horizontal
direction is not efficient, leading to appearance of localized regions with
higher/colder temperatures. In addition, the analysis of the MHD Poynting flux
confirms that the majority of the energy is directed in the horizontal
direction. Our findings also indicate that the pressure and magnetic forces
that drive the dynamics of the plasma on vortex surfaces are unbalanced and

for the potential to learn molecular representations that generalize to the
gigantic chemical space. Unlike supervised learning, SSL can directly leverage
large unlabeled data, which greatly reduces the effort to acquire molecular
property labels through costly and time-consuming simulations or experiments.
However, most molecular SSL methods borrow the insights from the machine
learning community but neglect the unique cheminformatics (e.g., molecular
fingerprints) and multi-level graphical structures (e.g., functional groups) of
molecules. In this work, we propose iMolCLR: improvement of Molecular
Contrastive Learning of Representations with graph neural networks (GNNs) in
two aspects, (1) mitigating faulty negative contrastive instances via
considering cheminformatics similarities between molecule pairs; (2)
fragment-level contrasting between intra- and inter-molecule substructures
decomposed from molecules. Experiments have shown that the proposed strategies
significantly improve the performance of GNN models on various challenging
molecular property predictions. In comparison to the previous CL framework,
iMolCLR demonstrates an averaged 1.3% improvement of ROC-AUC on 7
classification benchmarks and an averaged 4.8% decrease of the error on 5
regression benchmarks. On most benchmarks, the generic GNN pre-trained by
iMolCLR rivals or even surpasses supervised learning models with sophisticated
architecture designs and engineered features. Further investigations
demonstrate that representations learned through iMolCLR intrinsically embed
scaffolds and functional groups that can reason molecule similarities.

computer-based painting analysis exploiting inexplicable learned features, our
framework assesses realism by measuring the similarity between clouds painted
by exceptionally skillful 19th-century landscape painters like John Constable
and photographs of clouds. The experimental results of cloud classification
show that Constable approximates more consistently than his contemporaries the
formal features of actual clouds in his paintings. Our analyses suggest that
artists working in the decades leading up to the invention of photography
worked in a mode that anticipated some of the stylistic features of
photography. The study is a springboard for deeper analyses of pictorial

estimation. We present two interdisciplinary approaches for surrogate-based
model calibration of expensive simulations using evolutionary neural networks

methods show a very good agreement for the solid mechanics simulation of the
mercury spallation target. The proposed methods are used to calibrate the
tensile cutoff threshold, mercury density, and mercury speed of sound during
intense proton pulse experiments. Using strain experimental data from the
mercury target sensors, the newly calibrated simulations achieve 7\% average
improvement on the signal prediction accuracy and 8\% reduction in mean
absolute error compared to previously reported reference parameters, with some
sensors experiencing up to 30\% improvement. The proposed calibrated
simulations can significantly aid in fatigue analysis to estimate the mercury
target lifetime and integrity, which reduces abrupt target failure and saves a
tremendous amount of costs. However, an important conclusion from this work
points out to a deficiency in the current constitutive model based on the
equation of state in capturing the full physics of the spallation reaction.
Given that some of the calibrated parameters that show a good agreement with
the experimental data can be nonphysical mercury properties, we need a more
advanced two-phase flow model to capture bubble dynamics and mercury

effective gravitational constant) on cosmological scales prior to
recombination. We employ CMB, BAO, and SNIa data and find they are sufficient
to strongly constrain our implementation of the Effective Field Theory of Dark
Energy and Modified Gravity, used to model the transition, to a limited
parameter space. The data prefer a $\sim 5\%$ shift in the value of the
effective Planck mass ($<10 \%$ at $2 \sigma$) prior to recombination. This
Transitional Planck Mass (TPM) model is free to undergo its transition at any
point over multiple decades of scale factor prior to recombination,
$\log_{10}(a) = -5.32^{+0.96}_{-0.72}$ (68\% CL). This lowers the sound horizon
at last scattering, which increases the Hubble constant to $71.09 \pm 0.75$ km
$\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a combination of local measurements as
prior and to $69.22^{+0.67}_{-0.86}$ km $\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when
the prior is excluded. The TPM model improves $\chi^2$ with respect to
$\Lambda$CDM by $\Delta \chi^2 = -23.72$ with the $H_0$ prior and $\Delta
\chi^2 = -4.8$ without the prior. The model allows for both $H_0 > 70$
km$\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $S_8 < 0.80$ simultaneously with lower
values of $S_8$ due to a reduction in the matter density $\Omega_m$ to offset
the increase in $H_0$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM. While this is a particular
modified gravity model, studying other variants of modified gravity may be a
productive path for potentially resolving cosmological tensions, while avoiding
the need for a cosmological constant.

  Acceleration! Finally!","20 pages, 5 algorithms, 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce ProxSkip -- a surprisingly simple and provably efficient method
for minimizing the sum of a smooth ($f$) and an expensive nonsmooth proximable
($\psi$) function. The canonical approach to solving such problems is via the
proximal gradient descent (ProxGD) algorithm, which is based on the evaluation
of the gradient of $f$ and the prox operator of $\psi$ in each iteration. In
this work we are specifically interested in the regime in which the evaluation
of prox is costly relative to the evaluation of the gradient, which is the case
in many applications. ProxSkip allows for the expensive prox operator to be
skipped in most iterations: while its iteration complexity is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\kappa \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$, where $\kappa$ is
the condition number of $f$, the number of prox evaluations is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\kappa} \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ only. Our
main motivation comes from federated learning, where evaluation of the gradient
operator corresponds to taking a local GD step independently on all devices,
and evaluation of prox corresponds to (expensive) communication in the form of
gradient averaging. In this context, ProxSkip offers an effective acceleration
of communication complexity. Unlike other local gradient-type methods, such as
FedAvg, SCAFFOLD, S-Local-GD and FedLin, whose theoretical communication
complexity is worse than, or at best matching, that of vanilla GD in the
heterogeneous data regime, we obtain a provable and large improvement without
any heterogeneity-bounding assumptions.

generate complete point clouds. SPD models the generation of point clouds as
the snowflake-like growth of points, where child points are generated
progressively by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our insight into
the detailed geometry is to introduce a skip-transformer in the SPD to learn
the point splitting patterns that can best fit the local regions. The
skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting
patterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current
layer. The locally compact and structured point clouds generated by SPD
precisely reveal the structural characteristics of the 3D shape in local
patches, which enables us to predict highly detailed geometries. Moreover,
since SPD is a general operation that is not limited to completion, we explore
its applications in other generative tasks, including point cloud
auto-encoding, generation, single image reconstruction, and upsampling. Our
experimental results outperform state-of-the-art methods under widely used

Instead of letting tokens select the top-k experts, we have experts selecting

experts and each expert can have a fixed bucket size. We systematically study
pre-training speedups using the same computational resources of the Switch

debated open question beyond the mean-field approximation. Quantum fluctuations

bistability present on the mean-field level. Here, by identifying and using
exact modulated semi-local dynamical symmetries in a certain quantum optical
models of driven-dissipative fermionic chains we exactly prove bistability in
precisely the quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, rather than destroying
bistability, the quantum fluctuations themselves exhibit bistability, even
though it is absent on the mean-field level for our systems. Moreover, the
models studied acquire additional thermodynamic dynamical symmetries that imply
persistent periodic oscillations in the quantum fluctuations, constituting
pseudo-variants of boundary time crystals. Physically, these emergent operators
correspond to finite-frequency and finite-momentum semi-local Goldstone modes.
Our work therefore provides to the best of our knowledge the first example of a

include the timescale of core collapse, the electron fraction and mass of the
inner core at bounce, the accretion rate through the shock, the success or

compare the observable neutrino signal of the neutronization burst in a

show that the ratio of energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic

in the MiniBooNE (MB) experiment, along with an earlier similar excess seen in
the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND), when interpreted in
conjunction with recent MicroBooNE results may have brought us to the cusp of
new physics discoveries. This has led to many attempts to understand these
observations, both for each experiment individually and in conjunction, via
physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). We provide an overview of the current
situation, and discuss three major categories under which the many proposals
for new physics fall. The possibility that the same new, non-oscillation
physics explains both anomalies leads to new restrictions and requirements. An
important class of such common solutions, which we focus on in this work,
consists of a heavy ${\cal O}$(MeV$-$sub-GeV) sterile neutral fermion produced
in the detectors, (via up-scattering of the incoming muon neutrinos), and
subsequently decaying to photons or $e^+e^-$ pairs which mimic the observed
signals. Such solutions are subject to strong demands from a) cross section
requirements which would yield a sufficient number of total events in both LSND
and MB, b) requirements imposed by the measured energy and angular
distributions in both experiments and finally, c) consistency and compatibility
of the new physics model and its particle content with other bounds from a
diverse swathe of particle physics experiments. We find that these criteria
often pull proposed solutions in different directions, and stringently limit
the viable set of proposals which could resolve both anomalies. Our conclusions
are relevant for both the general search for new physics and for the ongoing

obstacle, towards better and more efficient representations. Specifically, we
propose a natural aggregation method generalizing attribution maps between any
two (convolutional) layers of a neural network. Additionally, we employ such
attributions to define two novel scores for evaluating the informativeness and
the disentanglement of latent embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed scores do correlate with the desired properties. We also confirm and
extend previously known results concerning the independence of some common
saliency strategies from the model parameters. Finally, we show that adopting

Learning techniques applied to real and simulated images of galaxies to
discriminate between different values of these parameters by making use of the
full information content of an astronomical image instead of collapsing it into
a limited set of values like size, or stellar/ gas masses. In this work we
apply our method to the NIHAO simulations and the THINGS and VLA-ANGST
observations of HI maps in nearby galaxies to test the ability of different
values of the star formation density threshold $n$ to reproduce observed HI
maps. We show that observations indicate the need for a high value of $n

underconstrained problem, even when the degrees of freedom are low, due to
degeneracies, particularly when potential perturbations superimposed on a
smooth lens are included. Regularization has traditionally been used to
constrain the solutions where the data failed to do so, e.g. in unlensed parts
of the source. In this exploratory work, we go beyond the usual choices of
regularization and adopt observationally motivated priors for the source
brightness. We also perform a similar comparison when reconstructing lens
potential perturbations, which are assumed to be stationary, i.e. permeate the
entire field of view. We find that physically motivated priors lead to lower
residuals, avoid overfitting, and are decisively preferred within a Bayesian
quantitative framework in all the examples considered. For the perturbations,
choosing the wrong regularization can have a detrimental effect that even
high-quality data cannot correct for, while using a purely smooth lens model
can absorb them to a very high degree and lead to biased solutions. Finally,
our new implementation of the semi-linear inversion technique provides the
first quantitative framework for measuring degeneracies between the source and

maximum fractional energy density of $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)=0.163^{+0.047}_{-0.04}$
at a redshift $z_c=3357\pm200$ and leads to a CMB inferred value of the Hubble

inclusion of SPT-3G pulls the posterior of $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$ away from
$\Lambda$CDM. This is the first time that a moderate preference for EDE has
been reported for these three combined CMB data sets. We find that including
measurements of supernovae luminosity distances and the baryon acoustic
oscillation standard ruler only minimally affects the preference ($3.0\sigma$),
while measurements that probe the clustering of matter at late times - the
lensing potential power spectrum from Planck and $f \sigma_8$ from BOSS -
decrease the significance of the preference to 2.6$\sigma$. Conversely, adding
a prior on the $H_0$ value as reported by the SH0ES collaboration increases the
preference to the $4-5\sigma$ level. In the absence of this prior, the
inclusion of Planck TT data at $\ell>1300$ reduces the preference from
$3.0\sigma$ to $2.3\sigma$ and the constraint on $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$ becomes
compatible with $\Lambda$CDM at $1\sigma$. We explore whether systematic errors
in the Planck polarization data may affect our conclusions and find that
changing the TE polarization efficiencies significantly reduces the Planck
preference for EDE. More work will be necessary to establish whether these
hints for EDE within CMB data alone are the sole results of systematic errors

binary mergers use matched filters to extract signals from the noisy data

require banks of template waveforms covering the physical parameter space of
the binary system. Unfortunately, template bank construction can be a
time-consuming task. Here we present a new method for efficiently generating
template banks that utilizes automatic differentiation to calculate the
parameter space metric. Principally, we demonstrate that automatic
differentiation enables accurate computation of the metric for waveforms
currently used in search pipelines, whilst being computationally cheap.
Additionally, by combining random template placement and a Monte Carlo method
for evaluating the fraction of the parameter space that is currently covered,
we show that search-ready template banks for frequency-domain waveforms can be
rapidly generated. Finally, we argue that differentiable waveforms offer a
pathway to accelerating stochastic placement algorithms. We implement all our
methods into an easy-to-use Python package based on the jax framework,
diffbank, to allow the community to easily take advantage of differentiable
waveforms for future searches.

synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition,
where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available
to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing
evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered. Our

stars carries information about the stars' internal structure. During the long
inspiral phase the main matter observable is the tidal interaction between the
binary components, an effect that can be parametrically modeled with
compact-binary solutions to General Relativity. After the binary merger the
main observable is frequency modes of the remnant, most commonly giving rise to
a short-duration signal accessible only through numerical simulations. The
complicated morphology and the decreasing detector sensitivity in the relevant
frequencies currently hinder detection of the post-merger signal and motivate
separate analyses for the pre-merger and post-merger data. However, planned and
ongoing detector improvements could soon put the post-merger signal within
reach. In this study we target the whole pre-merger and post-merger signal
without an artificial separation at the binary merger. We construct a hybrid
analysis that models the inspiral with templates based on analytical
calculations and calibrated to numerical relativity and the post-merger signal
with a flexible morphology-independent analysis. Applying this analysis to
GW170817 we find, as expected, that the post-merger signal remains undetected.
We further study simulated signals and find that we can reconstruct the full
signal and simultaneously estimate both the pre-merger tidal deformation and
the post-merger signal frequency content. Our analysis allows us to study
neutron star physics using all the data available and directly test the
pre-merger and post-merger signal for consistency thus probing effects such as
the onset of the hadron-quark phase transition.

reconstruct the hydroclimate back through time. We present case studies for
Brisbane and Fitzroy catchments focusing on two hydroclimate indices, the
Rainfall Index (RFI) and the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration

estimate the probability that a hydroclimate index in any reconstruction year
was lower (higher) than the minimum (maximum) value observed over the
instrumental period. In Brisbane, the RFI is unlikely (probabilities < 20%) to
have exhibited extremes beyond the minimum/maximum values observed between 1889

in structural biology, e.g., it is the basis for sharpening steps used in
cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). A recent paper gave the first rigorous
proof of Wilson statistics based on a formalism of Wilson's original argument.
This new analysis also leads to statistical estimates of the scattering
potential of proteins that reveal a correlation between neighboring Fourier
coefficients. Here we exploit these estimates to craft a novel prior that can
be used for Bayesian inference of molecular structures. Methods: We describe
the properties of the prior and the computation of its hyperparameters. We then
evaluate the prior on two synthetic linear inverse problems, and compare
against a popular prior in cryo-EM reconstruction at a range of SNRs. Results:
We show that the new prior effectively suppresses noise and fills-in low SNR
regions in the spectral domain. Furthermore, it improves the resolution of
estimates on the problems considered for a wide range of SNR and produces
Fourier Shell Correlation curves that are insensitive to masking effects.
Conclusions: We analyze the assumptions in the model, discuss relations to
other regularization strategies, and postulate on potential implications for
structure determination in cryo-EM.

summarize the amount of information contained in the interaction of several

mutual information, and higher interaction information functions relate to each
other. This is formally answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the
form of information diagrams: it relates disjoint unions of shapes in a Venn
diagram to summation rules of information functions; this establishes a bridge
from set theory to information theory. While a proof of this theorem is known,
to date it was not analyzed in detail in what generality it could be
established. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint
operation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and
entropy as the unique function satisfying the chain rule of information. This
allows us to abstract away from Shannon's theory and to prove a generalization
of Hu's theorem, which applies to Shannon entropy of countably infinite
discrete random variables, Kolmogorov complexity, Tsallis entropy, (Tsallis)
Kullback-Leibler Divergence, cross-entropy, submodular information functions,
and the generalization error in machine learning. Our result implies for
Chaitin's prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity that the higher-order interaction
complexities of all degrees are in expectation close to Shannon interaction
information. For well-behaved probability distributions on increasing sequence
lengths, this shows that asymptotically, the per-bit expected interaction
complexity and information coincide, thus showing a strong bridge between
algorithmic and classical information theory.

Hermitian self-energy matrix usually given in the basis set of the DFT
eigenstates. By expanding these into an atom-centered basis set (specifically
here the linearized muffin-tin orbitals) a real space representation of the
self-energy corrections becomes possible. We show that this representation is
relatively short-ranged. This offers new opportunities to construct the
self-energy of a complex system from parts of the system by a cut-and-paste
method. Specifically for a point defect, represented in a large supercell, the
self-eneregy can be constructed from those of the host and a smaller defect
containing cell. The self-energy of the periodic host can be constructed simply
from a $GW$ calculation for the primitive cell. We show for the case of the
As$_\mathrm{Ga}$ in GaAs that the defect part can already be well represented
by a minimal 8 atom cell and allows us to construct the self-energy for a 64

Using this approach to an even larger 216 atom cell shows the defect band
approaches an isolated defect level. The calculations also allow to identify a
second defect band which appears as a resonance near the conduction band
minimum. The results on the extracted defect levels agree well with Green's

is a classic problem that has been extensively studied and its convergence
characteristics are well-known. Alas, state-of-the-art consensus methods build
on the idea of exchanging local information with neighboring nodes which leaks
information about the users' local values. We propose an algorithmic framework
that is capable of achieving the convergence limit and rate of classic
consensus algorithms while keeping the users' local values private. The key
idea of our proposed method is to carefully design noisy messages that are
passed from each node to its neighbors such that the consensus algorithm still
converges precisely to the average of local values, while a minimum amount of
information about local values is leaked. We formalize this by precisely
characterizing the mutual information between the private message of a node and
all the messages that another adversary collects over time. We prove that our
method is capable of preserving users' privacy for any network without a
so-called ""generalized leaf"", and formalize the trade-off between privacy and
convergence time. Unlike many private algorithms, any desired accuracy is
achievable by our method, and the required level of privacy only affects the

able to learn good manipulation policies from a very few expert demonstrations.
A key reason why Transporter Net is so sample efficient is that the model
incorporates rotational equivariance into the pick module, i.e. the model
immediately generalizes learned pick knowledge to objects presented in
different orientations. This paper proposes a novel version of Transporter Net
that is equivariant to both pick and place orientation. As a result, our model
immediately generalizes place knowledge to different place orientations in
addition to generalizing pick knowledge as before. Ultimately, our new model is
more sample efficient and achieves better pick and place success rates than the
baseline Transporter Net model.

that the available resources are properly allocated. Furthermore, an efficient
way for incorporating network constraints in the formulation is proposed, where
network decomposition is applied to a linear power flow formulation together
with network reduction. In addition, different timescale dynamics of the
employed DERs and their capability curves are included. The performance of the
proposed controller is evaluated on several case studies via dynamic

microresonators offer the prospect of attaining frequency combs in miniaturized
systems by capitalizing on advances in photonic integration. Most of the
applications based on soliton microcombs rely on tuning a continuous-wave laser
into a longitudinal mode of a microresonator whose dimensions are engineered to
display anomalous dispersion at the pump laser frequency. In this
configuration, however, nonlinear physics precludes from attaining dissipative
Kerr solitons with high power conversion efficiency, with typical comb powers
amounting to ~1% of the available laser power. Here, we demonstrate that this
fundamental limitation can be overcome by inducing a controllable frequency
shift to a selected cavity resonance. Experimentally, we realize this shift
using two linearly coupled anomalous-dispersion microresonators (a photonic
molecule), resulting in a coherent dissipative Kerr soliton with a conversion
efficiency exceeding 50% and excellent line spacing stability. We describe the
physical soliton dynamics in this configuration, and discover the system
displays unusual characteristics, such as the possibility to backwards initiate
solitons and stable operation with a blue detuned pump laser. By optimizing the

the presence of stable $^{58}$Ni feature at 7378 \r{A}, in the nebular phase.

fueled by the presence of a circumstellar disk comprised of dust and gas.
Accretion produces a UV and optical excess, while re-radiated emission at the
inner edge of the dust component of the disk produces a near-infrared (NIR)
excess. The interplay between stars and their disks helps regulate
protoplanetary disk evolution and dispersal, which is key to a full
understanding of planet formation. To investigate the relations between NIR
excess and optical excess in both single and binary stars, we used an archival

optical veiling. We combined the archival sample with 2MASS and WISE NIR
photometry and high-resolution imaging surveys. We found that NIR and optical
excesses are correlated in multiple NIR photometric bands, suggesting that they
are closely related, likely because more massive disks have higher inner dust
disk walls and are also associated with higher accretion rates. We also found
that multiplicity has no impact on accretion or inner disk properties in a

specifically investigate close binaries, where the effects of multiplicity on

overcome the limitations of uniform post-heat treatment, this study proposes an
in-situ heat treatment strategy that is integrated into the directed energy

manufacturing capabilities to achieve location-dependent performance or
property manipulation. The influences of in-situ heat treatment on the thermal

investigations were carried out in terms of thermal cycling, microstructure

experimental characterizations. A low-power laser beam was adopted to localize
the in-situ heat treatment only to the current printed layer, facilitating a
reverse peritectic reaction and a transient high solution treatment
successively. The proposed in-situ heat treatment on the specimen results in a
more obvious phase transformation peak in the differential scanning calorimetry

representative of van der Waals 2D semiconductors, which are currently being

initio density-functional theory calculations, we investigate the spin texture
in momentum space of the states of the (doubly degenerate) highest valence band
of the AFM CrI$_3$ bilayer with Cr-spin moments perpendicular to the layers. We
find the existence, in the main central part of the Brillouin zone, of a Rashba
in-plane spin texture of opposite signs on the two layers, resulting from the
intrinsic local electric fields acting on each layer. To study the layer
segregation of the wavefunctions, we apply a small electric field that splits
the degenerate states according to their layer occupancy. We find that the
wavefunctions of the highest valence band are layer-segregated, belonging to
only one of the two layers with opposite in-plane spin textures, and the
segregation occurs over nearly the whole Brillouin zone. The corresponding
layer locking of the in-plane-canted spin is related to the separation in
energy of the highest AFM band from the rest of the valence bands. We explain
how the band interactions destroy the layer locking at the $K$, $K'$, and
$\Gamma$ points. Furthermore, we compare the layer locking of the
in-plane-canted spin in our AFM bilayer system with the hidden spin
polarization in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic materials, pointing out the
differences in segregation mechanisms and their consequences for the layer
locking. We note that a similar Rashba effect with layer locking of
in-plane-canted spin could occur in other van der Waals AFM bilayers with
strong spin-orbit coupling and an isolated energy band.

show how various properties, such as the density and ionization fraction,

Hydrodynamic instabilities at the interfaces lead to the formation of filaments

density interior. Even though the winds start out as completely radial, the
spherical symmetry is quickly destroyed, and the shocked wind region is
manifestly asymmetrical. The simulations demonstrate that it is important to

new leader when the current leader fails. The new leader is often decided upon
a candidate server that collects votes from a quorum of servers. However,
voting-based election mechanisms intrinsically cause competition in leadership
candidacy when each candidate collects only partial votes. This split-vote
scenario can result in no leadership winner and prolong the undesired
view-change period. In this paper, we investigate a case study of Raft's leader
election mechanism and propose a new leader election protocol, called ESCAPE,
that fundamentally solves split votes by prioritizing servers based on their
log responsiveness. ESCAPE dynamically assigns servers with a configuration
that offers different priorities through Raft's periodic heartbeat. In each
assignment, ESCAPE keeps track of server log responsiveness and assigns
configurations that are inclined to win an election to more up-to-date servers,
thereby preparing a pool of prioritized candidates. Consequently, when the next
election takes place, the candidate with the highest priority will defeat its
counterparts and becomes the next leader without competition. The evaluation
results show that ESCAPE progressively reduces the leader election time when
the cluster scales up, and the improvement becomes more significant under
message loss.

of the setup, most percolative systems undergo a phase transition from a
disconnected state with many disjoint clusters to a state where a finite
fraction of the lattice sites are connected to a single cluster. As in the case
of thermodynamic phase transitions, power law dependencies generically near the
critical percolation threshold. The origin of these dependencies can be
understood through the lens of scaling and renormalization, and indeed many
quantitative results can be acquired using these tools. In this paper we study
the percolation problem on a hierarchical lattice, where exact results for the
critical exponents can be obtained from a decimation procedure. We calculate
analytic results for the full set of geometric critical exponents and confirm
their consistency with simulation. Finally, we set up an interesting
renormalization group for the conductivity of the system and use it to
computationally extract the conductivity exponent t.

(HP) architecture with three stages: (i) radio frequency (RF) beamformer, (ii)
baseband (BB) precoder, (iii) resource allocation (RA) block. First, a single
RF beamformer block is built for all subcarriers via the slow time-varying
angle-of-departure (AoD) information. For enhancing the energy efficiency, the
RF beamformer aims to reduce the hardware cost/complexity and total power
consumption via a low number of RF chains. Afterwards, the reduced-size
effective channel state information (CSI) is utilized in the design of a
distinct BB precoder and RA block for each subcarrier. The BB precoder is
developed via regularized zero-forcing technique. Finally, the RA block is
built via the proposed GA-RA technique for throughput maximization by
allocating the power and subcarrier resources. The illustrative results show
that the throughput performance in the MU-mMIMO-OFDM systems is greatly
enhanced via the proposed GA-RA technique compared to both equal RA (EQ-RA) and
particle swarm optimization based RA (PSO-RA). Moreover, the performance gain
ratio increases with the increasing number of subcarriers, particularly for low

operation time without maintenance and are expected to be more prevalent in the
era of Internet of Things. However, due to the batteryless nature, they suffer
unpredictable frequent power outages. They thus require a lightweight mechanism
for crash consistency since saving/restoring checkpoints across the outages can
limit forward progress by consuming hard-won energy. For the reason, energy
harvesting systems have been designed with a non-volatile memory (NVM) only.
The use of a volatile data cache has been assumed to be not viable or at least
challenging due to the difficulty to ensure cacheline persistence. In this
paper, we propose ReplayCache, a software-only crash consistency scheme that
enables commodity energy harvesting systems to exploit a volatile data cache.
ReplayCache does not have to ensure the persistence of dirty cachelines or
record their logs at run time. Instead, ReplayCache recovery runtime
re-executes the potentially unpersisted stores in the wake of power failure to
restore the consistent NVM state, from which interrupted program can safely
resume. To support store replay during recovery, ReplayCache partitions program
into a series of regions in a way that store operand registers remain intact
within each region, and checkpoints all registers just before power failure
using the crash consistency mechanism of the commodity systems. For
performance, ReplayCache enables region-level persistence that allows the
stores in a region to be asynchronously persisted until the region ends,
exploiting ILP. The evaluation with 23 benchmark applications show that
compared to the baseline with no caches, ReplayCache can achieve about 10.72x
and 8.5x-8.9x speedup (on geometric mean) for the scenarios without and with
power outages, respectively.

a compiler/architecture co-design scheme that can achieve lightweight yet

realizing the idea, Turnpike leverages compiler optimizations to further reduce
the performance overhead. Experimental results with 36 benchmarks demonstrate
that Turnpike only incurs a 0-14% run-time overhead on average while the

The coordination integrates lane-change rules between mainstream lanes,
proactive creation of large merging gaps, and platooning of ramp vehicles for
enhanced benefits in traffic flow stability and efficiency. The strategy is
formulated under an optimization framework, where the optimal control plan is
determined based on real-time traffic conditions. The impacts of tunable model

livelihood in many urban systems. Ensuring that these services are resilient
(that is, exhibiting efficient response to and recovery from disruptions) is a
key economic and social priority. Increasingly, the ability of urban rail
systems to cope with disruptions is a function of a complex patchwork of
mobility options, wherein alternative modes can complement and fill service
gaps. This study analyzes the role of ridesourcing in providing adaptive
mobility capacity that could be leveraged to fill no-notice gaps in rail
transit services, addressing the question of distributional impacts of
resilience. Using a natural experiment, we systematically identify 28 major
transit disruptions over the period of one year in Chicago and match them, both
temporally and spatially, with ridesourcing trip data. Using multilevel mixed
modeling, we quantify variation in the adaptive use of on-demand mobility
across the racially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Our findings show
that the gap-filling potential of adaptive ridesourcing during rail transit
disruptions is significantly influenced by station-, community-, and
district-level factors. Specifically, greater shifts to ridesourcing occur
during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe disruptions, in community areas
that have higher percentages of White residents and transit commuters, and in
the more affluent North district of the city. These findings suggest that while
ridesourcing appears to provide adaptive capacity during rail disruptions, its
benefits do not appear to be equitable for lower-income communities of color
that already experience limited mobility options.

model-based fuzzing, provide powerful ways to ensure network protocols operate
correctly and securely. Such techniques, in general, require a formal
representation of the protocol, often in the form of a finite state machine
(FSM). Unfortunately, many protocols are only described in English prose, and
implementing even a simple network protocol as an FSM is time-consuming and
prone to subtle logical errors. Automatically extracting protocol FSMs from
documentation can significantly contribute to increased use of these techniques
and result in more robust and secure protocol implementations.
  In this work we focus on attacker synthesis as a representative technique for
protocol security, and on RFCs as a representative format for protocol prose
description. Unlike other works that rely on rule-based approaches or use
off-the-shelf NLP tools directly, we suggest a data-driven approach for
extracting FSMs from RFC documents. Specifically, we use a hybrid approach
consisting of three key steps: (1) large-scale word-representation learning for
technical language, (2) focused zero-shot learning for mapping protocol text to
a protocol-independent information language, and (3) rule-based mapping from
protocol-independent information to a specific protocol FSM. We show the
generalizability of our FSM extraction by using the RFCs for six different
protocols: BGPv4, DCCP, LTP, PPTP, SCTP and TCP. We demonstrate how automated
extraction of an FSM from an RFC can be applied to the synthesis of attacks,
with TCP and DCCP as case-studies. Our approach shows that it is possible to
automate attacker synthesis against protocols by using textual specifications
such as RFCs.

its kinetics in the overdamped limit, following a quench from good to poor

Interestingly, for higher activities when self-propulsion dominates over
interaction energy, the polymer becomes more extended. In its steady state, the

Then, we study the potential of simultaneous observations by Roman and Euclid

show that within one year Roman-Euclid observations will be at least an order

on the exact distribution of FFP, a joint Roman-Euclid campaign should detect
around 130 FFP events within a year, including 110 with measured parallax that
strongly constrain the FFP mass, and around 30 FFP events with direct mass and
distance measurements. The ability of the joint survey to completely break the
microlens mass-distance-velocity degeneracy for a significant subset of events
provides a unique opportunity to verify unambiguously the FFP hypothesis or
else place abundance limits for FFPs between Earth and Jupiter masses that are
up to two orders of magnitude stronger than provided by ground-based surveys.

because incoming planetesimals can fully vaporize. Supersaturation of vaporized
silicates causes the excess to sink as droplets, but water remains at higher
altitudes. Because the mean molecular weight decreases rapidly outward, some of
the compositional inhomogeneities produced during formation can survive for
billions of years. After 4.57 Gyr, our Jupiter model retains compositional
gradients; proceeding outwards one finds: i) an inner heavy-element core, the
outer part derived from hot supersaturated rain-out; ii) a composition-gradient
region, containing most of the heavy elements, where H-He abundance increases
outward, reaching about 0.9 mass fraction at 0.3 of the radius, with silicates
enhanced relative to water in the lower parts and depleted in the upper parts;
iii) a uniform composition region (neglecting He immiscibility) that is
enriched over protosolar and contains most of the planet's mass; and iv) an

many bus operation applications, such as timetable scheduling, travel time
forecasting and transit service assessment/improvement. Most previous studies
rely on either independent assumptions or simplified local spatial correlation
structures. In the real world, however, link travel time on a bus route could
exhibit complex correlation structures, such as long-range correlations,
negative correlations, and time-varying correlations. Therefore, before
introducing strong assumptions, it is essential to empirically quantify and
examine the correlation structure of link travel time from real-world bus
operation data. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian Gaussian model to
estimate the link travel time correlation matrix of a bus route using
smart-card-like data. Our method overcomes the small-sample-size problem in
correlation matrix estimation by borrowing/integrating those incomplete
observations (i.e., with missing/ragged values and overlapped link segments)
from other bus routes. Next, we propose an efficient Gibbs sampling framework
to marginalize over the missing and ragged values and obtain the posterior
distribution of the correlation matrix. Three numerical experiments are
conducted to evaluate model performance. We first conduct a synthetic
experiment and our results show that the proposed method produces an accurate
estimation for travel time correlations with credible intervals. Next, we
perform experiments on a real-world bus route with smart card data; our results
show that both local and long-range correlations exist on this bus route.
Finally, we demonstrate an application of using the estimated covariance matrix
to make probabilistic forecasting of link and trip travel time.

complete tasks. When rewards provided by the environment are sparse, agents may
not receive immediate feedback on the quality of actions that they take,
thereby affecting learning of policies. In this paper, we propose to methods to
augment the reward signal from the environment with an additional reward termed
shaping advice in both single and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The
shaping advice is specified as a difference of potential functions at
consecutive time-steps. Each potential function is a function of observations
and actions of the agents. The use of potential functions is underpinned by an
insight that the total potential when starting from any state and returning to
the same state is always equal to zero. We show through theoretical analyses
and experimental validation that the shaping advice does not distract agents
from completing tasks specified by the environment reward. Theoretically, we
prove that the convergence of policy gradients and value functions when using
shaping advice implies the convergence of these quantities in the absence of
shaping advice. We design two algorithms- Shaping Advice in Single-agent
reinforcement learning (SAS) and Shaping Advice in Multi-agent reinforcement
learning (SAM). Shaping advice in SAS and SAM needs to be specified only once
at the start of training, and can easily be provided by non-experts.
Experimentally, we evaluate SAS and SAM on two tasks in single-agent
environments and three tasks in multi-agent environments that have sparse
rewards. We observe that using shaping advice results in agents learning
policies to complete tasks faster, and obtain higher rewards than algorithms
that do not use shaping advice.

lines changing on a timescale that is approximately an order of magnitude
longer than the topology-conserving ideal-evolution timescale. Fast
reconnection is an intrinsic property of Faraday's law when the evolving
magnetic field depends non-trivially on all three spatial coordinates and is
commonly observed -- even when the effects that allow topology breaking are
arbitrarily small. The associated current density need only be enhanced by a
factor of approximately ten and flows in thin but broad ribbons along the
magnetic field. These results follow from the variation in the separation of
neighboring pairs of magnetic field lines, which in an ideal evolution
typically increases exponentially with time, and the existence of a spatial
scale below which magnetic field lines freely change their identities due to
non-ideal effects such as resistivity. Traditional reconnection theory ignores
exponentially large variations and relies on the current density reaching a
magnitude that is exponentially larger than is actually required. Here, an
analysis of the behavior of magnetic field lines in the neighborhood of an
arbitrarily chosen line is used to obtain more precise and rigorous results on
intrinsic reconnection. The maximum parallel kinetic energy of collisionless

  Recommendation","13 pages",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims at predicting the next item for an
ongoing anonymous session. The major challenge of SBR is how to capture richer
relations in between items and learn ID-based item embeddings to capture such
relations. Recent studies propose to first construct an item graph from
sessions and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode item embedding from
the graph. Although such graph-based approaches have achieved performance
improvements, their GNNs are not suitable for ID-based embedding learning for
the SBR task. In this paper, we argue that the objective of such ID-based
embedding learning is to capture a kind of \textit{neighborhood affinity} in
that the embedding of a node is similar to that of its neighbors' in the
embedding space. We propose a new graph neural network, called Graph Spring
Network (GSN), for learning ID-based item embedding on an item graph to
optimize neighborhood affinity in the embedding space. Furthermore, we argue
that even stacking multiple GNN layers may not be enough to encode potential
relations for two item nodes far-apart in a graph. In this paper, we propose a
strategy that first selects some informative item anchors and then encode
items' potential relations to such anchors. In summary, we propose a GSN-IAS
model (Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task.
We first construct an item graph to describe items' co-occurrences in all
sessions. We design the GSN for ID-based item embedding learning and propose an
\textit{item entropy} measure to select informative anchors. We then design an
unsupervised learning mechanism to encode items' relations to anchors. We next
employ a shared gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to learn two session
representations and make two next item predictions. Finally, we design an
adaptive decision fusion strategy to fuse two predictions to make the final
recommendation.

The network learns a strict and unique correspondence on point-level, and thus
improves quality of predicted complete shape. Moreover, since moving points
heavily relies on per-point features learned by network, we further introduce a
transformer-enhanced representation learning network, which significantly
improves completion performance of PMP-Net++. We conduct comprehensive

due to thickness inconsistencies and blurry boundaries. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep neural network for retinal vessel segmentation based on

Specifically, we introduce a decoder-sharing mechanism to capture multi-scale
semantic information, where feature maps at diverse scales are decoded through
a sequence of weight-sharing decoder modules. Also, to strengthen
characterization on the capillaries and the edges of blood vessels, we define a
residual pyramid architecture which decomposes the spatial information in the
decoding phase. A pyramid-like loss function is designed to compensate possible
segmentation errors progressively. Experimental results on public benchmarks
show that the proposed method outperforms the backbone network and the
state-of-the-art methods, especially in the regions of the capillaries and the

while learning, including, at least occasionally, some that lead to
catastrophic consequences. When humans make catastrophic mistakes, they are
expected to learn never to repeat them, such as a toddler who touches a hot
stove and immediately learns never to do so again. In this work we consider a
novel class of POMDPs, called POMDP with Catastrophic Actions (POMDP-CA) in
which pairs of states and actions are labeled as catastrophic. Agents that act
in a POMDP-CA do not have a priori knowledge about which (state, action) pairs
are catastrophic, thus they are sure to make mistakes when trying to learn any
meaningful policy. Rather, their aim is to maximize reward while never
repeating mistakes.
  As a first step of avoiding mistake repetition, we leverage the concept of a
shield which prevents agents from executing specific actions from specific
states.
  In particular, we store catastrophic mistakes (unsafe pairs of states and
actions) that agents make in a database. Agents are then forbidden to pick
actions that appear in the database. This approach is especially useful in a
continual learning setting, where groups of agents perform a variety of tasks
over time in the same underlying environment. In this setting, a task-agnostic
shield can be constructed in a way that stores mistakes made by any agent, such
that once one agent in a group makes a mistake the entire group learns to never
repeat that mistake. This paper introduces a variant of the PPO algorithm that
utilizes this shield, called ShieldPPO, and empirically evaluates it in a
controlled environment.
  Results indicate that ShieldPPO outperforms PPO, as well as baseline methods
from the safe reinforcement learning literature, in a range of settings.

present in labor conditions: a high degree exists on one side of the continuum

human trafficking. Organizations across North America perform outreach to sex
industry workers to offer assistance in the form of services (e.g., healthcare,
financial assistance, housing), prayer, and intervention. Increasingly,
technology is used to look for trafficking victims or facilitate the provision
of assistance or services, for example through scraping and parsing sex

can be used by outreach organizations. However, little is known about the
efficacy of anti-trafficking outreach technology, nor the potential risks of
using it to identify and contact the highly stigmatized and marginalized
population of those working in the sex industry.
  In this work, we investigate the use, context, benefits, and harms of an
anti-trafficking technology platform via qualitative interviews with multiple
stakeholders: the technology developers (n=6), organizations that use the
technology (n=17), and sex industry workers who have been contacted or wish to
be contacted (n=24). Our findings illustrate misalignment between developers,
users of the platform, and sex industry workers they are attempting to assist.
In their current state, anti-trafficking outreach tools such as the one we

worst, scale and exacerbate harm against the population they aim to serve. We
conclude with a discussion of best practices for technology-facilitated
outreach efforts to minimize risk or harm to sex industry workers while

well-aligned noisy and clean images are given, or samples are synthesized from

modeling methods aim to simulate the unknown distribution of real-world noise,
several limitations still exist. In a practical scenario, a noise generator
should learn to simulate the general and complex noise distribution without
using paired noisy and clean images. However, since existing methods are
constructed on the unrealistic assumption of real-world noise, they tend to
generate implausible patterns and cannot express complicated noise maps.
Therefore, we introduce a Clean-to-Noisy image generation framework, namely
C2N, to imitate complex real-world noise without using any paired examples. We
construct the noise generator in C2N accordingly with each component of
real-world noise characteristics to express a wide range of noise accurately.
Combined with our C2N, conventional denoising CNNs can be trained to outperform
existing unsupervised methods on challenging real-world benchmarks by a large

mathematical analysis for establishing validity of approximation schemes. Our
proofs are based on the theory of the RT-equations for connections with $L^p$

transformations which give a non-optimal connection a gain of one derivative
over its Riemann curvature, (i.e., to optimal regularity). The RT-equations are
elliptic regardless of metric signature, and regularize singularities in
solutions of the hyperbolic Einstein equations. As an application,
singularities at GR shock waves are removable, implying geodesic curves,
locally inertial coordinates and the Newtonian limit all exist. By the extra
derivative we extend Uhlenbeck compactness from Uhlenbeck's setting of vector
bundles with compact gauge groups over Riemannian manifolds, to the case of
compact and non-compact gauge groups over non-Riemannian manifolds. Our version
of Uhlenbeck compactness can also be viewed as a ""geometric"" improvement of the

this steady state radius can be arrived at using independent considerations of
vanishing extrinsic curvature. We show that the volume of this segment of the
maximal hypersurface, the CR volume, depends on mass, AdS length scale and

Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based methods are widely used owing to their fast

much time to carry out the millions of forward calculations in a huge sampling

developed unscented Kalman method in computational mathematics, we extend an
iterative gradient-free Bayesian joint inversion framework, i.e., Multi-task
unscented Kalman inversion (MUKI). In this new framework, information from
various observations is incorporated, the model is iteratively updated in a
derivative-free way, and a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution
of the model parameters is obtained. We apply the MUKI to the joint inversion
of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion, which is well-established
and widely used to construct the crustal and upper mantle structure of the
earth. Based on synthesized and real data, the tests demonstrate that MUKI can
recover the model more efficiently than the gradient-based method and the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and it would be a promising approach to
resolve the geophysical joint inversion problems.

broader disease mapping literature, but may need to address specific features
of spatio-temporal infection data including considerable time fluctuations
(with epidemic phases) and spatial diffusion. Low order autoregression is a
feature of several recent spatio-temporal studies of infection data, possibly
with lags on both within area infections and on infections in adjacent areas.
Many epidemic time series show a period of relatively stable infection levels
(possibly characterized as endemicity), followed by a sudden sharp phase of
increasing infection levels. After the epidemic peak there is a period of
descending rates and return to stability. Hence one may seek to adapt the
autoregressive scheme to these pronounced fluctuations, with temporary
departures from stationarity, but returning to stationarity as rates descend
and infections resume endemic levels. We consider a mixture link model for
infection counts that allows adaptivity to both explosive phases and static
endemicity. Two case study applications involve COVID area-time data, one for
32 London boroughs since the start of the COVID epidemic, the other focusing on

family consists of localised singularities which can occupy an arbitrarily
large domain but which are, nevertheless, always confined. The second family
consists of one or more lines extending all the way from the south-west to the
north-east on the plane, involving a single finite value that depends on the
parameter that appears in the equation. We argue that the infinite extent of
this singularity is not incompatible with the confinement property or with the
integrability of the equation. The third family consists of horizontal strips
in which the product of values on vertically adjacent lattice sites is equal to
1. In the case of the lattice KdV equation this type of singularity was dubbed
`taishi'. The taishi for the modified lattice KdV equation can interact with
singularities of the other two families, giving rise to very rich {and quite
intricate} singularity structures. Nonetheless, these interactions can be
described in a compact way through the formulation of a symbolic representation
of the dynamics that is similar to, but in a sense, simpler than that for the
KdV case. We give an interpretation of this symbolic representation in terms of
a Box&Ball system related to the ultradiscrete mKdV equation. These results
show that taishi-type singularities are not limited to the lattice KdV

generative adversarial network, called quad-path cycle consistent adversarial

Fog2Fogfree block and a Fogfree2Fog block. In each block, there are three
learning-based modules, namely, fog removal, color-texture recovery, and fog
synthetic, which sequentially compose dual-path that constrain each other to
generate high quality images. Specifically, the color-texture recovery model is
designed to exploit the self-similarity of texture and structure information by
learning the holistic channel-spatial feature correlations between the foggy
image with its several derived images. Moreover, in the fog synthetic module,
we utilize the atmospheric scattering model to guide it to improve the
generative quality by focusing on an atmospheric light optimization with a
novel sky segmentation network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and

dataset specifically collected and annotated for the construction site, called

categorized by workers, materials, machines, and layout. Firstly, more than
20,000 images were collected from multiple construction sites in different site
conditions, weather conditions, and construction phases, which covered
different angles and perspectives. After careful screening and processing,
19,846 images including 286,201 objects were then obtained and annotated with
labels in accordance with predefined categories. Statistical analysis shows
that the developed dataset is advantageous in terms of diversity and volume.
Further evaluation with two widely-adopted object detection algorithms based on
deep learning (YOLO v3/ YOLO v4) also illustrates the feasibility of the
dataset for typical construction scenarios, achieving a maximum mAP of 81.47%.
In this manner, this research contributes a large-scale image dataset for the

enhance convolutional neural networks. Most attention mechanisms are bound to
the convolutional layer and use local or global contextual information to
recalibrate the input. This is a popular attention strategy design method.
Global contextual information helps the network to consider the overall
distribution, while local contextual information is more general. The
contextual information makes the network pay attention to the mean or maximum
value of a particular receptive field. Different from the most attention
mechanism, this article proposes a novel attention mechanism with the heuristic
difference attention module, HDAM. HDAM's input recalibration is based on the
difference between the local and global contextual information instead of the
mean and maximum values. At the same time, to make different layers have a more
suitable local receptive field size and increase the exibility of the local
receptive field design, we use genetic algorithm to heuristically produce local
receptive fields. First, HDAM extracts the mean value of the global and local
receptive fields as the corresponding contextual information. Then the
difference between the global and local contextual information is calculated.
Finally HDAM uses this difference to recalibrate the input. In addition, we use
the heuristic ability of genetic algorithm to search for the local receptive
field size of each layer. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that
HDAM can use fewer parameters than other attention mechanisms to achieve higher
accuracy. We implement HDAM with the Python library, Pytorch, and the code and
models will be publicly available.

adaptation (SDDA) framework for cross-session MI classification based on
mathematical models in domain adaptation theory. The proposed framework can be
easily applied to most existing artificial neural networks without altering the
network structure, which facilitates our method with great flexibility and
transferability. In the proposed framework, domain invariants were firstly
constructed jointly with channel normalization and Euclidean alignment. Then,
embedding features from source and target domain were mapped into the
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and aligned accordingly. A cosine-based
center loss was also integrated into the framework to improve the
generalizability of the SDDA. The proposed framework was validated with two
classic and popular convolutional neural networks from BCI research field

Accompanying these states, fractional charges appear on peripheral unit cells.
Recently, topologically bound states and fractional charges at disclinations of

bulk-disclination correspondence has been experimentally confirmed in
artificial crystalline structures, such as microwave-circuit arrays and
photonic crystals. Here, we demonstrate an additive rule between the real-space
topological invariant $\mathbf{s}$ (related to the Burgers vector $\mathbf{B}$)
and the reciprocal-space topological invariant $\mathbf{p}$ (vectored Zak's
phase of bulk wave functions). The bound states and fractional charges concur
at a disclination center only if $\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{p}/2\pi$ is topologically
nontrivial; otherwise, no bound state forms even if fractional charges are
trapped. Besides the dissociation of fractional charges from bound states, the
additive rule also dictates the existence of half-bound states extending over
only half of a sample and ultra-stable bound states protected by both
real-space and reciprocal-space topologies. Our results add another dimension

digitization and offline pulse analysis. The LIDAR return signals have been
extensively quality checked and absolutely calibrated. We analyze seven years
of quasi-continuous LIDAR data taken during those nights when the MAGIC
telescopes were operating. Characterization of the nocturnal ground layer
yields zenith and azimuth angle dependent aerosol extinction scale heights for
clear nights. We derive aerosol transmission statistics for light emitted from
various altitudes throughout the year and separated by seasons. We find further
seasonal dependencies of cloud base and top altitudes, but none for the LIDAR
ratios of clouds. Finally, the night sky background light is characterized
using the LIDAR photon backgrounds. abstract.txt

the film surface normal. By systematic variation of these two parameters, we
demonstrate that remanent bubble density and mean bubble diameter can be
carefully tuned and optimized for each sample. Our protocol based on
magnetometry only reveals the densest remanent bubble states at $H_\mathrm{m} =

called trajectory vorticity (TRV) -- we show that it is objective and that it

manipulation because it only requires demonstration samples for learning
manipulation skills. In this paper, deep imitation learning is applied to tasks
that require force feedback, such as bottle opening. However, simple visual
feedback systems, such as teleoperation, cannot be applied because they do not
provide force feedback to operators. Bilateral teleoperation has been used for
demonstration with force feedback; however, this requires an expensive and
complex bilateral robot system. In this paper, a new master-to-robot (M2R)
transfer learning system is presented that does not require robots but can
still teach dexterous force feedback-based manipulation tasks to robots. The
human directly demonstrates a task using a low-cost controller that resembles
the kinematic parameters of the robot arm. Using this controller, the operator
can naturally feel the force feedback without any expensive bilateral system.
Furthermore, the M2R transfer system can overcome domain gaps between the
master and robot using the gaze-based imitation learning framework and a simple
calibration method. To demonstrate this, the proposed system was evaluated on a
bottle-cap-opening task that requires force feedback only for the master
demonstration.

Deep Neural Networks can easily over-fit to the noisy label data. To tackle
this problem, the key point is to alleviate the harm of these noisy labels.
Many existing methods try to divide training data into clean and noisy subsets
in terms of loss values, and then process the noisy label data varied. One of
the reasons hindering a better performance is the hard samples. As hard samples
always have relatively large losses whether their labels are clean or noisy,
these methods could not divide them precisely. Instead, we propose a Tripartite
solution to partition training data more precisely into three subsets: hard,
noisy, and clean. The partition criteria are based on the inconsistent
predictions of two networks, and the inconsistency between the prediction of a
network and the given label. To minimize the harm of noisy labels but maximize
the value of noisy label data, we apply a low-weight learning on hard data and
a self-supervised learning on noisy label data without using the given labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tripartite can filter out noisy label
data more precisely, and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on five
benchmark datasets, especially on real-world datasets.

the phenomenon of asymptotic trapping -- there can be non-zero probability of
the quantum walker being localised in a finite part of the underlying graph
indefinitely even though locally all directions of movement are assigned
non-zero amplitudes at each step. We study quantum walks with the flip-flop
shift operator and the Grover coin, where this effect has been identified
previously. For the version of the walk further modified by a random dynamical
disruption of the graph (percolated quantum walks) we provide a recipe for the
construction of a complete basis of the subspace of trapped states allowing to
determine the asymptotic probability of trapping for arbitrary finite connected
simple graphs, thus significantly generalizing the previously known result
restricted to planar 3-regular graphs. We show how the position of the source
and sink together with the graph geometry and its modifications affect the
excitation transport. This gives us a deep insight into processes where
elongation or addition of dead-end subgraphs may surprisingly result in
enhanced transport and we design graphs exhibiting this pronounced behavior. In
some cases this even provides closed-form formulas for the asymptotic transport
probability in dependence on some structure parameters of the graphs.

to understanding the structure formation and its evolution during the

magnitude larger foregrounds in the observed frequency range, the instrumental
effects of the interferometers combined with the ionospheric effects present a
considerable challenge in the extraction of 21-cm signals from strong
foregrounds. The systematic effects of time and frequency correlated residual
gain errors originating from the measurement process introduce a bias and
enhance the variance of the power spectrum measurements. In this work, we study
the effect of time-correlated residual gain errors in the presence of strong
foreground. We present a method to produce analytic estimates of the bias and
vari ance in the power spectrum. We use simulated observations to confirm the
efficacy of this method and then use it to understand various effects of the
gain errors. We find that as the standard deviation in the residual gain errors
increases, the bias in the estimation supersedes the variance. It is observed
that an optimal choice of the time over which the gain solutions are estimated
minimizes the risk. We also find that the interferometers with higher baseline
densities are preferred instruments for these studies.

waves in fusion devices is revisited with considerations of phase and amplitude
dynamics of its triadic interactions. It is observed that a single resonant
triad can saturate via three way phase locking where the phase differences
between dominant modes converge to constant values as individual phases
increase in time. This allows the system to have approximately constant
amplitude solutions. Non-resonant triads show similar behavior only when one of
its legs is a zonal wave number. However when an additional triad, which is a
reflection of the original one with respect to the $y$ axis is included, the
behavior of the resulting triad pair is shown to be more complex. In
particular, it is found that triads involving small radial wave numbers (large
scale zonal flows) end up transferring their energy to the subdominant mode
which keeps growing exponentially, while those involving larger radial wave
numbers (small scale zonal flows) tend to find steady chaotic or limit cycle
states (or decay to zero). In order to study the dynamics in a connected
network of triads, a network formulation is considered including a pump mode,
and a number of zonal and non-zonal subdominant modes as a dynamical system. It
was observed that the zonal modes become clearly dominant only when a large
number of triads are connected. When the zonal flow becomes dominant as a
'collective mean field', individual interactions between modes become less
important, which is consistent with the inhomogeneous wave-kinetic picture.
Finally, the results of direct numerical simulation is discussed for the same
parameters and various forms of the order parameter are computed. It is
observed that nonlinear phase dynamics results in a flattening of the large
scale phase velocity as a function of scale in direct numerical simulations.

the second level of communication based on Shannon and Weaver\cite{6197583},
which retains the semantic features of the transmitted information and recovers
the signal at the receiver, thus compressing the communication traffic without
losing important information. Different from other semantic communication
systems, the proposed system not only transmits semantic information but also
transmits semantic decoder. In addition, a general semantic metrics is proposed
to measure the quality of semantic communication system. In particular, the
semantic communication system for image, namely AESC-I, is designed to verify
the feasibility of the new paradigm. Simulations are conducted on our system

intermediate confinement with physical observables often strongly renormalized
by correlation (e.g., radiative decay rate enhanced by a factor of about 7
relative to a mean-field approach, for a NC of edge length 11 nm). The
many-body methods considered include the particle-hole Bethe-Salpeter equation,
configuration interaction with single excitations, and the random-phase

each other but to treat $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ corrections differently,

the correlation energy, the radiative lifetime, and the long-range Coulomb
contribution to the fine structure of the ground-state exciton. In the limit of

results for this limit, where these are known. Correlated excited states of the

behaviors, including frequency-dependent depolarization, variation of rotation
measure (RM), and oscillating spectral structures of polarized components. Very
recently, Feng et al. (2022) reported that active repeaters exhibit conspicuous
frequency-dependent depolarization and a strong correlation between RM scatter
($\sigma_{\rm RM}$) and the temporal scattering time ($\tau_{\rm s}$),
$\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{1.0\pm0.2}$, both of which can be well
described by multi-path propagation through a magnetized inhomogeneous plasma
screen. This observation strongly suggests that the temporal scattering and RM
scatter originate from the same region. Besides, a particular finding of note
in Feng et al. (2022) is that the FRBs with compact persistent radio sources
(PRS) tend to have extreme $\sigma_{\rm RM}$. In this work, we focus on some
theoretical predictions on the relations among temporal scattering,
depolarization by RM scatter, and PRS contributed by the magnetized plasma
environment close to a repeating FRB source. The behaviors of the RM scatter
imply that the magnetized plasma environment is consistent with a supernova
remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, and the predicted $\sigma_{\rm RM}$-$\tau_{\rm
s}$ relation is $\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{(0.54-0.83)}$ for
different astrophysical scenarios. We further make a general discussion on PRS
that does not depend on specific astrophysical scenarios. We show that the
specific luminosity of a PRS should have a positive correlation with the RM
contributed by the plasma screen. This is consistent with the observations of
FRB 121102 and FRB 190520B.

mean-field potentials, and evaluate the evolution of their associated Raman
spectra with field strength. We demonstrate that dramatic changes in the
appearance of the Raman spectrum for a diatomic molecule occur without any
associated change in the symmetry of the surrounding potential. The limiting
cases of the quantum eigenstates correspond, in the classical sense, to free
rotation, and libration of well-oriented molecules. However, there are also
many mixed modes which are neither rotons nor librons. The consequence for
Raman spectroscopy is a series of complications - the non-harmonic potential
splits the Raman active modes, and breaks the selection rules on forbidden
modes. The mass-dependence of the various states is different - rotors,
oscillators and reorientations have $1/m$, $1/\sqrt{m}$ and weaker mass
dependence respectively. This may allow one to identify the character of the
mode with isotope spectroscopy. However it is complicated by mixed modes and
transitions between two different eigenstates with different character. We
conclude that significant changes in the Raman spectrum of molecular systems
are insufficient to demonstrate a phase transition since such changes can also
occur in a fixed symmetry potential upon increasing field strength.

a vector taken from a specific discrete lattice. The quantization error is the
difference between the source vector and the lattice vector. In a classic 1996
paper, Zamir and Feder show that the globally optimal lattice quantizer (which
minimizes the mean square error) has white quantization noise: for a uniformly
distributed source, the covariance of the error is the identity matrix,
multiplied by a positive real factor. We generalize the theorem, showing that
the same property holds (i) for any locally optimal lattice quantizer and (ii)
for an optimal product lattice, if the component lattices are themselves
locally optimal. We derive an upper bound on the normalized second moment (NSM)
of the optimal lattice in any dimension, by proving that any lower- or
upper-triangular modification to the generator matrix of a product lattice
reduces the NSM. Using these tools and employing the best currently known
lattice quantizers to build product lattices, we construct improved lattice
quantizers in dimensions 13 to 15, 17 to 23, and 25 to 48. In some dimensions,
these are the first reported lattices with normalized second moments below the
Zador upper bound.

low-dimensional vectors for many real-world applications. The representations
of entities and relations are learned via contrasting the positive and negative
triplets. Thus, high-quality negative samples are extremely important in KGE.
However, the present KGE models either rely on simple negative sampling
methods, which makes it difficult to obtain informative negative triplets; or
employ complex adversarial methods, which requires more training data and
strategies. In addition, these methods can only construct negative triplets
using the existing entities, which limits the potential to explore harder
negative triplets. To address these issues, we adopt mixing operation in
generating harder negative samples for knowledge graphs and introduce an
inexpensive but effective method called MixKG. Technically, MixKG first
proposes two kinds of criteria to filter hard negative triplets among the
sampled negatives: based on scoring function and based on correct entity
similarity. Then, MixKG synthesizes harder negative samples via the convex
combinations of the paired selected hard negatives. Experiments on two public
datasets and four classical KGE methods show MixKG is superior to previous
negative sampling algorithms.

Here we performed a radial velocity (RV) variability study of a sample of 646
hot subdwarfs with multi-epoch radial velocities from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)
spectra [...] As diagnostics we used the fraction of RV-variable stars and the
distribution of the maximum RV variations $\Delta RV_{\rm max}$. Both
indicators turned out to be quite inhomogeneous across the studied parameter
ranges. A striking feature is the completely different behaviour of He-poor and
He-rich hot subdwarfs. While the former have a high fraction of close binaries,
almost no significant RV variations could be detected for the latter. This led
us to the conclusion that there likely is no evolutionary connection between
these subtypes. Intermediate He-rich- and extreme He-rich sdOB/Os on the other
hand are likely related. We conclude further that the vast majority of this
population is formed via one or several binary merger channels. Hot subdwarfs
with temperatures cooler than $\sim24\,000\,{\rm K}$ tend to show less and
smaller RV-variations. These objects might constitute a new subpopulation of
binaries with longer periods and late-type or compact companions. The
RV-variability properties of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and
corresponding post-EHB populations of the He-poor hot subdwarfs match and
confirm the predicted evolutionary connection between them. Stars found below
the canonical EHB at somewhat higher surface gravities show large RV-variations

With the popularity of mobile devices, the requirements for lightweight and

auto-encoder, combining the Coordinate Attention unit, which preserves the
spatial information of features. Also, the application of Shuffle Blocks
reduces the parameters by a quarter without sacrificing its performance. In the
Radon domain, the CAGAN learns the mapping between the interpolated data and
fringe-free projection data. After the restored Radon data is reconstructed to
an image, the image is sent into the second CAGAN trained for recovering the
details, so that a high-quality image is obtained. Experiments indicate that
the CAGAN strikes an excellent balance between model complexity and

a pool of circulating fragments called cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Identifying the
tissue origin of these DNA fragments from their epigenetic features has
implications in various clinical contexts. Open chromatin regions (OCRs) are
important epigenetic features of DNA that reflect cell types of origin.
Profiling these features by DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq provides
insights into tissue-specific and disease-specific regulatory mechanisms.
Integration of genomic and epigenomic features for cancer detection by liquid
biopsy has previously been reported. However, many multimodal analyses require
large amounts of cfDNA input and/or multiple types of experiments to cover the

Predicting OCRs from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is one such approach.
Here, we applied a correlation clustering algorithm to predict OCRs. We used
local sequencing depth as input to our algorithm. Multiple processing steps
were then applied as follows: count normalization, discrete Fourier transform
conversion, graph construction, graph cut optimization by linear programming,
and clustering. To validate the proposed method, we compared the output of our

technology for monolithic integration of dual-comb spectrometers. However, the
stabilization of the offset frequency fceo remains a challenging feat due the
lack of octave-spanning spectra. In a dual-comb configuration, the uncorrelated
jitter of the offset frequencies leads to a non-periodic signal resulting in
broadened beatnotes with a limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence,
expensive data acquisition schemes and complex signal processing are currently
required. Here, we show that the offset frequencies of two frequency combs can
be synchronized by optical injection locking, which allows full
phase-stabilization when combined with electrical injection. A single comb line
isolated via an optical Vernier filter serves as Master oscillator for
injection locking. The resulting dual-comb signal is periodic and stable over
thousands of periods. This enables coherent averaging using analog electronics,
which increases the SNR and reduces the data size by one and three orders of

However, computing the FFT of multiple channels in a systematic manner has not

multi-channel FFT architectures using {\em folding} and {\em interleaving}.
Three distinct multi-channel FFT architectures are presented in this paper.
These architectures differ in the input and output preprocessing steps and are
based on different folding sets, i.e., different orders of execution.

approaches, so that bugs and unexpected behavior can be quickly identified and
fixed. Tools for data validation may save the day of computer programmers. In
fact, processing invalid data is a waste of resources at best, and a drama at
worst if the problem remains unnoticed and wrong results are used for business.
Answer Set Programming (ASP) is not an exception, but the quest for better and
better performance resulted in systems that essentially do not validate data.
Even under the simplistic assumption that input/output data are eventually
validated by external tools, invalid data may appear in other portions of the
program, and go undetected until some other module of the designed software
suddenly breaks. This paper formalizes the problem of data validation for ASP
programs, introduces a language to specify data validation, and presents
\textsc{valasp}, a tool to inject data validation in ordinary programs. The
proposed approach promotes fail-fast techniques at coding time without imposing
any lag on the deployed system if data are pretended to be valid. Validation
can be specified in terms of statements using YAML, ASP and Python.
Additionally, the proposed approach opens the possibility to use ASP for

equation $$ (-\Delta + a)u = f(u) + \xi u $$ with a potential $a\in L^p(S)$ and
$p>1$, and $f$ subject to growth conditions. Under an additional parity

$\ell$ an even innteger, we further prove that this equation has infinitely
many solutions, in stark contrast with all the well-posedness results that have
been proved so far for singular stochastic PDEs under a small parameter

characterizing the critical points of an energy functional based on the
Anderson operator $H=\Delta + \xi$ and by resorting to variants of the mountain

stability, foam formation or liquid evaporation, are closely related to the
dynamics of adsorbing colloidal particles. Elucidation of the mechanisms

  Experiments: Microspheres forced to rotate near a fluid interface exhibit a
roto-translational hydrodynamic mechanism that is hindered by capillary torques
as soon as the particles protrude the interface. Under these conditions, the
time evolution in the ratio of moving spheres provides a direct description of
the adsorption kinetics, while microscopy monitoring of particle
acceleration\deceleration informs about the adsorption\desorption dynamics. In
this work, the proposed strategy is applied at an air/water interface loaded
with spherical magnetic particles negatively charged, forced to rotate by the
action of a rotating magnetic field.
  Findings: The proposed method enables the adsorption/desorption dynamics to
be followed during the earliest phase of the process, when desorption of a
small fraction of particles is detected, as well as to estimate approximated
values of the adsorption/desorption constants. The results obtained show that
the addition of a monovalent salt or a cationic (anionic) surfactant promotes

we propose an AutoML technique SapientML, that can learn from a corpus of
existing datasets and their human-written pipelines, and efficiently generate a
high-quality pipeline for a predictive task on a new dataset. To combat the
search space explosion of AutoML, SapientML employs a novel divide-and-conquer
strategy realized as a three-stage program synthesis approach, that reasons on
successively smaller search spaces. The first stage uses a machine-learned
model to predict a set of plausible ML components to constitute a pipeline. In
the second stage, this is then refined into a small pool of viable concrete
pipelines using syntactic constraints derived from the corpus and the
machine-learned model. Dynamically evaluating these few pipelines, in the third
stage, provides the best solution. We instantiate SapientML as part of a fully
automated tool-chain that creates a cleaned, labeled learning corpus by mining
Kaggle, learns from it, and uses the learned models to then synthesize
pipelines for new predictive tasks. We have created a training corpus of 1094

the temporal and spatial features of wireless sensor network (WSN) data
streams; it is one of critical technique that ensures the reliability of WSNs.
Currently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become popular state-of-the-art
methods for conducting anomaly detection on WSN data streams. However, the
existing anomaly detection methods based on GNNs do not consider the temporal
and spatial features of WSN data streams simultaneously, such as multi-node,
multi-modal and multi-time features, seriously impacting their effectiveness.
In this paper, a novel anomaly detection model is proposed for multimodal WSN
data flows, where three GNNs are used to separately extract the temporal
features of WSN data flows, the correlation features between different modes
and the spatial features between sensor node positions. Specifically, first,
the temporal features and modal correlation features extracted from each sensor
node are fused into one vector representation, which is further aggregated with
the spatial features, i.e., the spatial position relationships of the nodes;
finally, the current time-series data of WSN nodes are predicted, and abnormal
states are identified according to the fusion features. The simulation results
obtained on a public dataset show that the proposed approach is able to
significantly improve upon the existing methods in terms of its robustness, and
its F1 score reaches 0.90, which is 14.2% higher than that of the graph

this gap, we are the first to conduct a systematic investigation on the EOSIO
token ecosystem by conducting a comprehensive graph analysis on the entire
on-chain EOSIO data (nearly 135 million blocks). We construct token creator
graphs, token-contract creator graphs, token holder graphs, and token transfer
graphs to characterize token creators, holders, and transfer activities.
Through graph analysis, we have obtained many insightful findings and observed
some abnormal trading patterns. Moreover, we propose a fake-token detection
algorithm to identify tokens generated by fake users or fake transactions and
analyze their corresponding manipulation behaviors. Evaluation results also
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

backdoor attacks aim to make the victim model produce designed outputs on any
input injected with pre-designed backdoors. In order to achieve a high attack
success rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing
attack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class.
This practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the
backdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be
identified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms.
  In this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the
over-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a
\textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the
poisoned sample $\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability
of $p_n(\bm{x})$ instead of 100\%, and the value of $p_n(\bm{x})$ is
specifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be
only slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on
several existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably
improve the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high
attack success rate. In addition, our strategy makes it able to manually
control the prediction probability of the design output through manipulating
the applied and activated number of LSBAs\footnote{Source code will be

a new formulation for the LDA model which incorporates covariates. In this

straight-forward interpretation of the regression coefficients and the analysis
of the quantity of cluster-specific elements in each sampling units (instead of
the analysis being focused on modeling the proportion of each cluster, as in
Structural Topic Models). We use slice sampling within a Gibbs sampling
algorithm to estimate model parameters. We rely on simulations to show how our
algorithm is able to successfully retrieve the true parameter values and the
ability to make predictions for the abundance matrix using the information
given by the covariates. The model is illustrated using real data sets from
three different areas: text-mining of Coronavirus articles, analysis of grocery

discrete data and provides inference on the relationship between covariates and
the abundance of these clusters.

of trainable parameters is considered for reducing the computational cost
making the system faster and more compatible for a real-time application. With
a Computational Neural Network (CNN)based new Bengali OCR engine and

demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban
continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at
relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United
States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial
resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly
localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into
encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications
are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data
(e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the
longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. Here, we develop a set of
distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the
remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods
of time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by constructing indices of
urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018 and further
test the plausibility of our results against a variety of evaluation datasets.
We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL) and make the
resulting datasets publicly available (https://doi.org/10.3886/E162941) so that
other researchers can conduct long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and
rural change. In addition, due to the simplistic nature of the input data,
these methods can be generalized to other time periods or regions of the world,

historical records of high-risk cryptocurrency coins to train a prediction
model that guesses their price. This paper's code contains Jupyter notebooks,
one of which outputs a timeseries graph of any cryptocurrency price once a CSV
file of the historical data is inputted into the program. Another Jupyter
notebook trains an LSTM, or a long short-term memory model, to predict a
cryptocurrency's closing price. The LSTM is fed the close price, which is the
price that the currency has at the end of the day, so it can learn from those
values. The notebook creates two sets: a training set and a test set to assess
the accuracy of the results.
  The data is then normalized using manual min-max scaling so that the model
does not experience any bias; this also enhances the performance of the model.
Then, the model is trained using three layers -- an LSTM, dropout, and dense
layer-minimizing the loss through 50 epochs of training; from this training, a
recurrent neural network (RNN) is produced and fitted to the training set.
Additionally, a graph of the loss over each epoch is produced, with the loss
minimizing over time. Finally, the notebook plots a line graph of the actual
currency price in red and the predicted price in blue. The process is then
repeated for several more cryptocurrencies to compare prediction models. The
parameters for the LSTM, such as number of epochs and batch size, are tweaked
to try and minimize the root mean square error.

is important to tease apart genuine symbolic rules from merely associative
input-output patterns. However, we identify several inconsistencies in how
``symbolicity'' has been construed in recent NLP literature. To mitigate this
problem, we propose two criteria to be the most relevant, one pertaining to a
system's internal architecture and the other to the dissociation between
abstract rules and specific input identities. From this perspective, we
critically examine prior work on the symbolic capacities of Transformers, and
deem the results to be fundamentally inconclusive for reasons inherent in
experiment design. We further maintain that there is no simple fix to this
problem, since it arises -- to an extent -- in all end-to-end settings.
Nonetheless, we emphasize the need for more robust evaluation of whether
non-symbolic explanations exist for success in seemingly symbolic tasks. To
facilitate this, we experiment on four sequence modelling tasks on the T5
Transformer in two experiment settings: zero-shot generalization, and
generalization across class-specific vocabularies flipped between the training
and test set. We observe that T5's generalization is markedly stronger in
sequence-to-sequence tasks than in comparable classification tasks. Based on
this, we propose a thus far overlooked analysis, where the Transformer itself
does not need to be symbolic to be part of a symbolic architecture as the
processor, operating on the input and output as external memory components.

getting enough sleep at any stage may lead to sleep disorder like parasomnia,

Convolutional Neural Network Classifier. However, this classifier has not been
successfully implemented into sleep stage classification systems due to high
complexity and low accuracy of classification. The aim of this research is to
increase the accuracy and reduce the learning time of Convolutional Neural
Network Classifier. Methodology: The proposed system used a modified Orthogonal
Convolutional Neural Network and a modified Adam optimisation technique to
improve the sleep stage classification accuracy and reduce the gradient
saturation problem that occurs due to sigmoid activation function. The proposed
system uses Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) instead of sigmoid activation
function as an activation function. Results: The proposed system called
Enhanced Sleep Stage Classification system (ESSC) used six different databases
for training and testing the proposed model on the different sleep stages.
These databases are University College Dublin database (UCD), Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center MIT database (MIT-BIH), Sleep European Data Format
(EDF), Sleep EDF Extended, Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS), and Sleep
Heart Health Study (SHHS). Our results show that the gradient saturation
problem does not exist anymore. The modified Adam optimiser helps to reduce the
noise which in turn result in faster convergence time. Conclusion: The
convergence speed of ESSC is increased along with better classification
accuracy compared to the state of art solution.

coupling between thermal and electric phenomena. The dissipationless quantum

formulas for thermomagnetic coefficients. The magnetization energy flux, eM X
E, in crossed electric and magnetic fields strongly modifies the Poynting
vector in magnetic materials and metamaterials, but do not contribute to the
heat current. Calculating entropy fluxes of fluctuating Cooper pairs, we find
the fluctuation Nernst coefficient in pure superconductors. To account electron
scattering, we generalize the gauge-invariant Kubo formalism developed for the
Hall effect to thermomagnetic entropy transfer. We also introduce the
thermomagnetic entropy per unit charge and derive the Nernst coefficient
proportional to the difference of the thermoelectric and thermomagnetic
entropies. This explains the Sondheimer cancellation and high sensitivity of
thermomagnetic phenomena to correlations. In 2D superconductors, the transport
entropy transferred by a vortex moving through the background formed by
vortex-antivortex pairs is the configuration entropy of kB ln 2, which strongly
exceeds the intrinsic entropy of vortex core. Beyond the linear response, the
non-entropic forces can lead to phenomena unexpected from thermodynamics, such
as vortex attraction to the moving hot spot. Quantum currents do not transfer
entropy and may be used as ideal connectors to quantum nanodetectors.
