becomes imperative to have mechanisms that enable an affected entity to verify

particularly on future singularities with the discovery of late-time
acceleration of the universe and dark energy. Recent work has seen a proper
classification of such singularities into strong and weak based on their
strength, with weak singularities being the likes of sudden, w and big freeze
singularities and strong singularities like the big rip. While there has been
an expansive literature which has discussed the occurrence of Type I-IV in many
non-standard cosmologies, w-singularities have not yet been explored in exotic
cosmological settings. So in this work we pursue the same and discuss the
status quo of w-singularities in a variety of non-standard cosmologies. We
consider the RS-II Braneworld cosmology, an F(R) gravity cosmology which gives
viable late time acceleration. We also consider cosmologies due to modified
area-entropy relations, generalized uncertainty principles, holographic
renormalization and Chern-Simons gravity( all of which can be coincidentally
described by the same form of the modified Friedmann equation). We show that
w-singularities will occur in exactly the same conditions in all these vividly
different cosmological settings as they do in the usual general relativistic
cosmology if one considers a power series expansion ansatz for the scale
factor. We also show that if one considers an exponential form of the scale
factor then while Type V singularities in the RS-II Braneworld and Chern-Simons
cosmologies occur in the same conditions as in the standard cosmology case,
there is a significant difference in the conditions when one considers the f(R)
gravity case. These results are surprising overall, as one would usually not
expect cosmological singularities to occur in almost the same conditions in
non-standard cosmologies as they do in the usual standard cosmology.

  Series: A Fourier-based Method","Submitted to ApJ, comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tens of thousands of solar-like oscillating stars have been observed by space
missions. Their photometric variability in the Fourier domain can be
parameterized by a sum of two super-Lorentizian functions for granulation and a
Gaussian-shaped power excess for oscillation. The photometric
granulation/oscillation parameters scale with stellar parameters and they can
also make predictions for corresponding parameters in radial velocity
measurements. Based on scaling relations, we simulate realistic radial velocity
time series and examine how the root-mean-square scatter of radial velocity
measurements varies with stellar parameters and different observation
strategies such as the length of integration time and gaps in the time series.
Using stars with extensive spectroscopic observations from the spectrographs
(SONG and HARPS), we measure the granulation amplitude and timescale from the
power spectrum of the radial velocity time series. We compare these
measurements with literature values based on Kepler photometry. We find that
the granulation amplitude in radial velocity can be well predicted from the
photometry and scaling relations. Both granulation timescales in radial
velocity agree with those predicted from photometry for giants and sub-giants.
However, for main-sequence stars, only one granulation timescale in radial
velocity is in agreement with the photometric-based values, while the other
timescale generally lies at lower frequencies compared to the result of
photometry. In conclusion, we show the photometric scaling relations from
Kepler photometry and the scaling relationship to Doppler observations can be
very useful for predicting the photometric and radial velocity stellar
variabilities due to stellar granulation and oscillation.

detection tasks, where fraudulent nodes are identified by aggregating neighbor
information via different relations. To get around such detection, crafty
fraudsters resort to camouflage via connecting to legitimate users (i.e.,
relation camouflage) or providing seemingly legitimate feedbacks (i.e., feature
camouflage). A wide-spread solution reinforces the GNN aggregation process with
neighbor selectors according to original node features. This method may carry
limitations when identifying fraudsters not only with the relation camouflage,
but with the feature camouflage making them hard to distinguish from their
legitimate neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-based
Graph Neural Network (HA-GNN) for fraud detection, which incorporates weighted
adjacency matrices across different relations against camouflage. This is
motivated in the Relational Density Theory and is exploited for forming a
hierarchical attention-based graph neural network. Specifically, we design a
relation attention module to reflect the tie strength between two nodes, while
a neighborhood attention module to capture the long-range structural affinity
associated with the graph. We generate node embeddings by aggregating
information from local/long-range structures and original node features.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our

fourfold anisotropy are solved in two steps, in order to study the magnetic
transition to paramagnetism in an ultrathin film. First, the equations are
linearized near the critical coupling $K=J/k_BT=2/\pi$. An exact solution of
the linearized equations confirms that a finite-size Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)
transition occurs in the presence of weak fourfold anisotropy, and that an
Ising transition occurs for strong anisotropy. The behaviour of a given system
is determined by the product of an anisotropy parameter and the logarithm of
the system size. The linearized RG equations are not quantitatively reliable
across the full temperature range of the finite-size transition, but they
define the parameter space where a second approach, where the fourfold
anisotropy is treated as a perturbation, is valid. This perturbative treatment
provides a quantitative determination of the renormalized exchange coupling,
vortex density, and anisotropy throughout the transition. In particular, the
coupling has a universal point of inflection where vortex-antivortex pairs
unbind (as opposed to a ""universal jump""), and goes to zero asymptotically in
the paramagnetic state, as is expected for a finite system. These results are
used to calculate the magnetic susceptibility as the system moves from one
dominated by spin waves to one dominated by a free vortex gas. The presence of
anisotropy makes it necessary to include both the susceptibility $\chi_{||}$
due to fluctuations of the magnitude of the magnetization, and $\chi_\perp$ due
to angular fluctuations of the magnetization about a fourfold easy axis. A
comparison to recent measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of ultrathin
Fe/W(001) films is very encouraging.

main-sequence, eccentric binary KOI-54, the prototype of heartbeat stars.
Although the linear tidal response of the star is a series of orbital-harmonic
frequencies which are not stellar eigenfrequencies, we show that the
non-linearly excited non-orbital-harmonic TEOs are eigenmodes. By carefully
choosing the modes which satisfy the mode-coupling selection rules, a period
spacing ($\Delta P$) pattern of quadrupole gravity modes ($\Delta P \approx
2520-2535$ sec) can be discerned in the Fourier spectrum, with a detection
significance level of $99.9\%$. The inferred period spacing value agrees
remarkably well with the theoretical $l=2,m=0$ g modes from a stellar model
with the measured mass, radius and effective temperature. We also find that the
two largest-amplitude TEOs at $N=90, 91$ harmonics are very close to resonance
with $l=2,m=0$ eigenmodes, and likely come from different stars.
  Previous works on tidal oscillations primarily focus on the modeling of TEO
amplitudes and phases, the high sensitivity of TEO amplitude to the frequency
detuning (tidal forcing frequency minus the closest stellar eigenfrequency)
requires extremely dense grids of stellar models and prevents us from
constraining the stellar physical parameters easily. This work, however, opens
the window of real tidal asteroseismology by using the eigenfrequencies of the
star inferred from the non-linear TEOs and possibly very-close-to-resonance
linear TEOs. Our seismic modeling of these identified eigen g-modes shows that
the best-matching stellar models have ($M \approx 2.20, 2.35 M_{\odot}$) and
super-solar metallicity, in good agreement with previous measurements.

brothers. Here we study the effect of uniaxial activity on the dynamics of an
initially crystalline state of spheroidal colloids sedimenting slowly in a
viscous fluid remote from confining boundaries. Despite frictional overdamping
by the fluid, the crystalline lattice admits traveling waves of position and
orientation. At long wavelengths these obey a vector wave equation with Lam\'e
constants determined by the activity. We find that at least one polarization
mode of these waves is always unstable, leading to the melting of the crystal.
These results are elucidated by identifying an odd-dimensional Poisson
structure consisting of a Hamiltonian and an associated Casimir invariant,
where linear combinations of position and orientation are identified as
conjugate variables. Our results suggest that Poisson structures may exist
generally for active particles in slow viscous flow and thereby allow
equilibrium arguments to be applied in the presence of these dissipative

the model training to better exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. In

present an improved and efficient implementation of the GIS algorithm for
general discrete-time controlled nonlinear systems. We first identify the
bottlenecks through extensive analysis, and then provide remedial procedures to
improve the implementation of the GIS algorithm. Specifically, we developed an
adaptive subdivision scheme using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm
to reduce the cell growth rate and parallelize the graph construction step. We
extensively demonstrate the performance of the improved GIS algorithm using a

The results show that the adaptive subdivision and the parallelization improved
the speed of the algorithm by about 8x and 3x respectively, that of the

  is slightly abridged from the version in the PDF",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is often the case in Statistics that one needs to compute sums of infinite
series, especially in marginalising over discrete latent variables. This has
become more relevant with the popularization of gradient-based techniques (e.g.
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) in the Bayesian inference context, for which discrete
latent variables are hard or impossible to deal with. For many commonly used
infinite series, custom algorithms have been developed which exploit specific
features of each problem. General techniques, suitable for a large class of
problems with limited input from the user are less established. We employ basic
results from the theory of infinite series to investigate general,
problem-agnostic algorithms to truncate infinite sums within an arbitrary
tolerance $\varepsilon > 0$ and provide robust computational implementations
with provable guarantees. We compare three tentative solutions to estimating
the infinite sum of interest: (i) a ""naive"" approach that sums terms until the
terms are below the threshold $\varepsilon$; (ii) a `bounding pair' strategy
based on trapping the true value between two partial sums; and (iii) a `batch'
strategy that computes the partial sums in regular intervals and stops when
their difference is less than $\varepsilon$. We show under which conditions
each strategy guarantees the truncated sum is within the required tolerance and
compare the error achieved by each approach, as well as the number of function
evaluations necessary for each one. A detailed discussion of numerical issues
in practical implementations is also provided. The paper provides some
theoretical discussion of a variety of statistical applications, including raw
and factorial moments and count models with observation error. Finally,
detailed illustrations in the form noisy MCMC for Bayesian inference and
maximum marginal likelihood estimation are presented.

behavior and cognition has allowed creation of robots which can better interact
with humans, and not least in road vehicle automation this is a rapidly growing
area of research. Human-robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important
applied setting for human behavior modeling - but given the vast complexity of
human behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we
outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the
suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: A successful
human-robot interaction, in terms of safety, performance, and human
satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused
on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most
sensitive. We emphasise that identifying which those aspects are is a difficult
scientific objective in its own right, distinct for each given HRI context. We
propose and exemplify an approach to formulating a priori hypotheses on this
matter, in cases where robots are to be involved in interactions which
currently take place between humans, such as in automated driving. Our
perspective also highlights some possible risks of overreliance on
machine-learned models of human behavior in HRI, and how to mitigate against
those risks.

history is emerging. Those enriched action records are vital to understand
users' interests and intents. Recently, prior works for user behavior
prediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information.
However, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge
between users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we
explore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user
behavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to
embrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill
this setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users
is scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over
time. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal
Event (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user
representations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in
the whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities
centrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise
propagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate
abundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates
retrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture
evolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction. Empirically,
extensive experiments on both the public benchmark and four real-world
industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETE method.

avoid such obstacles and make the training of physics-informed models less

incorporates the knowledge from low-fidelity auxiliary systems and limited
labeled data from target actual system to significantly improve the performance

designing a complex task-specific network for the problem at hand, the proposed
settings guide the physics-informed model towards a fast and efficient
convergence to a global optimum. An adaptive weighting method is utilized to
further enhance the optimization of the model composite loss function during
the training process. A data-driven strategy is also introduced for maintaining
high performance in subdomains with significant divergence between low- and

underpinning the robot's ability to perform safe and reliable grasps. Using the
robotic hand design from the authors' earlier work, a sensing and control
strategy is proposed here to prevent object slippage. The robotic hand is
cable-driven, single-actuated, has five fingers, and is capable of replicating
most human hand motions. The slip sensing approach utilizes a piezoelectric
vibration sensor, namely, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which is a flexible,
thin, cheap, and highly sensitive material. The power of the filtered PVDF
signal is shown to exhibit identifiable signatures during slip, thus providing
a suitable slip detection mechanism. Using the PVDF feedback, an integral
controller is implemented to prevent the grasped object from falling and ensure
a safe, powerful, and reliable grasp. The extension movement of the robotic
hand is controlled using a bend sensor, through a proportional-integral (PI)
controller. The robotic hand weights 338 gr. The functionality and robustness
of the proposed slip-detection sensory system and control logic implementation

currently regarded as the gold standard for the measurement of CBF in the human

costs, use of ionizing radiation, and logistical challenges, which require a
co-localized cyclotron to deliver the 2 min half-life Oxygen-15 radioisotope.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more readily available and
does not involve ionizing radiation. In this study, we propose a multi-task
learning framework for brain MRI-to-PET translation and disease diagnosis. The
proposed framework comprises two prime networks: (1) an attention-based 3D
encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) that synthesizes
high-quality PET CBF maps from multi-contrast MRI images, and (2) a multi-scale
3D CNN that identifies the brain disease corresponding to the input MRI images.
Our multi-task framework yields promising results on the task of MRI-to-PET
translation, achieving an average structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.94

the software modules by the application of Social Network Analysis (SNA
metrics) have been shown to improve the performance of the Software Defect
prediction (SDP) models. However, the relative effectiveness of these SNA
metrics over code metrics in improving the performance of the SDP models has
been widely debated with no clear consensus. Furthermore, some of the common
SDP scenarios like predicting the number of defects in a module (Defect-count)
in Cross-version and Cross-project SDP contexts remain unexplored. Such lack of
clear directive on the effectiveness of SNA metrics when compared to the widely
used code metrics prevents us from potentially building better performing SDP
models. Therefore, through a case study of 9 open source software projects
across 30 versions, we study the relative effectiveness of SNA metrics when
compared to code metrics across 3 commonly used SDP contexts (Within-project,
Cross-version and Cross-project) and scenarios (Defect-count,
Defect-classification (classifying if a module is defective) and Effort-aware
(ranking the defective modules w.r.t to the involved effort)). We find the SNA
metrics by themselves or along with code metrics improve the performance of SDP
models over just using code metrics on 5 out of the 9 studied SDP scenarios
(three SDP scenarios across three SDP contexts). However, we note that in some
cases the improvements afforded by considering SNA metrics over or alongside
code metrics might only be marginal, whereas in other cases the improvements
could be potentially large. Based on these findings we suggest that the future
work should: consider SNA metrics alongside code metrics in their SDP models;
as well as consider Ego metrics and Global metrics, the two different types of
the SNA metrics separately when training SDP models as they behave differently.

In this paper, we propose a framework to help researchers and practitioners

that: 1) discretization noise affects the different performance measures of a

the classifiers are impacted by the discretization noise on the whole, the top
3 most important features are not affected by the discretization noise.
Therefore, we suggest that practitioners and researchers use our framework to

  for Linear Bandits",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of combining and learning over a set of adversarial
bandit algorithms with the goal of adaptively tracking the best one on the fly.
The CORRAL algorithm of Agarwal et al. (2017) and its variants (Foster et al.,
2020a) achieve this goal with a regret overhead of order
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{MT})$ where $M$ is the number of base algorithms and $T$
is the time horizon. The polynomial dependence on $M$, however, prevents one
from applying these algorithms to many applications where $M$ is poly$(T)$ or
even larger. Motivated by this issue, we propose a new recipe to corral a
larger band of bandit algorithms whose regret overhead has only
\emph{logarithmic} dependence on $M$ as long as some conditions are satisfied.
As the main example, we apply our recipe to the problem of adversarial linear
bandits over a $d$-dimensional $\ell_p$ unit-ball for $p \in (1,2]$. By
corralling a large set of $T$ base algorithms, each starting at a different
time step, our final algorithm achieves the first optimal switching regret
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d S T})$ when competing against a sequence of comparators
with $S$ switches (for some known $S$). We further extend our results to linear
bandits over a smooth and strongly convex domain as well as unconstrained
linear bandits.

This paper provides the first regret bounds on the performance of dual-based PI
controllers for online allocation problems. We do so by first establishing a
fundamental connection between dual-based PI controllers and a new first-order
algorithm for online convex optimization, which, in a special case, recovers
online mirror descent with momentum. We prove the proposed first-order
algorithm attains low regret for general online convex optimization problems
with adversarial inputs. We leverage this new result to give the first regret

and non-defective classes and use them as a target variable when building
defect classifiers (discretized classifiers). However, this discretization of
continuous defect counts leads to information loss that might affect the
performance and interpretation of defect classifiers. Another possible approach
to build defect classifiers is through the use of regression models then
discretizing the predicted defect counts into defective and non-defective
classes (regression-based classifiers).
  In this paper, we compare the performance and interpretation of defect
classifiers that are built using both approaches (i.e., discretized classifiers
and regression-based classifiers) across six commonly used machine learning
classifiers (i.e., linear/logistic regression, random forest, KNN, SVM, CART,
and neural networks) and 17 datasets. We find that: i) Random forest based
classifiers outperform other classifiers (best AUC) for both classifier
building approaches; ii) In contrast to common practice, building a defect
classifier using discretized defect counts (i.e., discretized classifiers) does
not always lead to better performance.
  Hence we suggest that future defect classification studies should consider
building regression-based classifiers (in particular when the defective ratio
of the modeled dataset is low). Moreover, we suggest that both approaches for
building defect classifiers should be explored, so the best-performing
classifier can be used when determining the most influential features.

language of the constrained real fermions. In spite of numerous studies along
special magnetic-field orientations, there is a limited amount of knowledge on
the complete field-angle characterization, which can provide valuable
information on the existence of fractionalized excitations. For this purpose,
we first extend previous studies on the field-angle response of the
ferromagnetic Kitaev model to its antiferromagnetic version. Yet, the realistic
description of the candidate Kitaev materials, within the edge-sharing
octahedra paradigm, require additional coupling terms, including a large
off-diagonal term $\Gamma$ along with possible anisotropic corrections
$\Gamma_p$. It is therefore not sufficient to depend on the topological
properties of the bare Kitaev model as the only source for the observed thermal
Hall conductivity signals and an understanding of these extended Kitaev models
with a complete field response is demanded. Starting from the zero-field phase
diagram of realistic K-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma_p$ models, we identify
antiferromagnetic zig-zag and (partially) polarized phases as well as two
unusual Kitaev(-$\Gamma$) spin-liquid phases. The magnetic field response of
these phases for arbitrary field orientations provides a remarkably rich phase
diagram. A partially polarized phase is revealed between two ordered phases
with a suppressed magnetization, finite fractionalization and finite Chern
number. This phase is characterized as an extended Kitaev-$\Gamma$ spin-liquid.
To comply our findings with experiments, we reproduce the asymmetry in the
extent of the intermediate phases specifically for the two different field
directions $\theta = \pm 60^o$.

low-dimensional despite the observed high dimensionality of data recorded using
multi-electrode arrays. Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population
recordings has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable
models. Over time however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and
different neurons will be recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes.
This means that a decoder trained to predict behaviour on one day performs
worse when tested on a different day. On the other hand, evidence suggests that
the latent dynamics underlying behaviour may be stable even over months and
years. Based on this idea, we introduce a model capable of inferring
behaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen data recorded
from the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration. We show that
unsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational
autoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to
unseen data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail.
Our results further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural
dynamics are low-dimensional and stable over time, and will enable more
effective and flexible use of brain computer interface technologies.

Velocimetry provides velocity fields and vortex properties. We show how in a

formation process more complex than for a complete vortex ring produced by a

a shedding phenomenon occurs on the leading edge, producing secondary vortices.
The Strouhal number related to this shedding process reveals that it comes from

free-form words or phrases that describe the appropriate types of entities
mentioned in sentences. A key challenge for this task lies in the large amount
of types and the scarcity of annotated data per type. Existing systems
formulate the task as a multi-way classification problem and train directly or
distantly supervised classifiers. This causes two issues: (i) the classifiers
do not capture the type semantics since types are often converted into indices;
(ii) systems developed in this way are limited to predicting within a
pre-defined type set, and often fall short of generalizing to types that are
rarely seen or unseen in training. This work presents LITE, a new approach that
formulates entity typing as a natural language inference (NLI) problem, making
use of (i) the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type information
meaningfully represented as textual hypotheses and alleviate the data scarcity
issue, as well as (ii) a learning-to-rank objective to avoid the pre-defining
of a type set. Experiments show that, with limited training data, LITE obtains
state-of-the-art performance on the UFET task. In addition, LITE demonstrates
its strong generalizability, by not only yielding best results on other
fine-grained entity typing benchmarks, more importantly, a pre-trained LITE
system works well on new data containing unseen types.

chiral complex fermions by exact diagonalization, which can have local
interflavor interaction and superconducting pairings (with all irrelevant terms
ignored). Analytically, the model has two solvable (integrable) points in the
parameter space: it is a free fermion model when the fermion interaction is
zero, and is a free boson Luttinger liquid when there is a global
U(1)$^{(\uparrow)}\times$U(1)$^{(\downarrow)}$ symmetry (with nonzero
interaction). When the global symmetry of the interacting model is lowered by
turning on symmetry breaking parameters, the model undergoes a transition from
a quantum integrable model to a fully quantum chaotic model, as we demonstrate
by examining the level spacing statistics (LSS) of the many-body energy
spectrum. In particular, there is a possibly integrable regime with
intermediate global symmetries, where the model is neither free bosons nor free
fermions, but shows Poisson LSS in each global symmetry charge sector. This
implies the existence of hidden (quasi)local conserved quantities. When the
global symmetries are further lowered, the LSS in each charge sector becomes
Wigner-Dyson, implying quantum chaos.

for high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models due to the high
aspect ratio (length over diameter) of the domain. In subsea applications, the
pipe length can be several hundreds of kilometres versus a pipe diameter of
just a few inches. In this paper, we present a new AI-based non-intrusive
reduced-order model within a domain decomposition framework (AI-DDNIROM) which
is capable of making predictions for domains significantly larger than the
domain used in training. This is achieved by using domain decomposition;
dimensionality reduction; training a neural network to make predictions for a
single subdomain; and by using an iteration-by-subdomain technique to converge
the solution over the whole domain. To find the low-dimensional space, we
explore several types of autoencoder networks, known for their ability to
compress information accurately and compactly. The performance of the
autoencoders is assessed on two advection-dominated problems: flow past a
cylinder and slug flow in a pipe. To make predictions in time, we exploit an
adversarial network which aims to learn the distribution of the training data,
in addition to learning the mapping between particular inputs and outputs. This
type of network has shown the potential to produce realistic outputs. The whole
framework is applied to multiphase slug flow in a horizontal pipe for which an
AI-DDNIROM is trained on high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pipe of length 10 m
with an aspect ratio of 13:1, and tested by simulating the flow for a pipe of
length 98 m with an aspect ratio of almost 130:1. Statistics of the flows
obtained from the CFD simulations are compared to those of the AI-DDNIROM
predictions to demonstrate the success of our approach.

routing, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have recently emerged
as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from surgical robotics
to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches for deformable
objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g.,
Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the
environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely
separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing
and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of
planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.
  This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional
objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes
a compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online
routing. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition
of the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the
deformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the
routing problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence
matching method that calculates the next routing move. The proposed method
couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our
simulation and real experiments show the method correctly computing the next
manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing
and manipulation tasks.

visual recognition tasks. However, most existing OSDA approaches are limited
due to three main reasons, including: (1) the lack of essential theoretical
analysis of generalization bound, (2) the reliance on the coexistence of source
and target data during adaptation, and (3) failing to accurately estimate the
uncertainty of model predictions. We propose a Progressive Graph Learning (PGL)
framework that decomposes the target hypothesis space into the shared and
unknown subspaces, and then progressively pseudo-labels the most confident
known samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. Moreover, we
tackle a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA)
setting that makes no assumption about the coexistence of source and target
domains, and introduce a balanced pseudo-labeling (BP-L) strategy in a
two-stage framework, namely SF-PGL. Different from PGL that applies a
class-agnostic constant threshold for all target samples for pseudo-labeling,
the SF-PGL model uniformly selects the most confident target instances from
each category at a fixed ratio. The confidence thresholds in each class are
regarded as the 'uncertainty' of learning the semantic information, which are
then used to weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. We conducted
unsupervised and semi-supervised OSDA and SF-OSDA experiments on the benchmark
image classification and action recognition datasets. Additionally, we find
that balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving
calibration, which makes the trained model less prone to over-confident or
under-confident predictions on the target data. Source code is available at

representations with probabilistic interpretations, has been shown to benefit
both music understanding and generation. However, most models are only
applicable to short-term music, while learning long-term music representations
remains a challenging task. We have seen several studies attempting to learn
hierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models
have not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is
not stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term
symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use
contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining
its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an
off-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a
hierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g.,
an 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones
(e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range). Experiments show that
our method stabilizes the training and the fine-tuning steps. In addition, the
designed contextual constraints benefit both reconstruction and
disentanglement, significantly outperforming the baselines.

The
ratio between fracture toughness and intrinsic fracture energy of a soft

enhancement has been long attributed to their bulk stress-stretch hysteresis
induced by dissipation mechanisms such as Mullins effect and viscoelasticity.
With a combination of experiments and theory, here we show that the bulk
dissipation mechanisms significantly underestimate the toughness enhancement of
soft tough materials. We propose a new mechanism and scaling law to account for
the extreme toughening of diverse soft materials. We show that the toughness
enhancement of soft materials relies on both bulk hysteric dissipation, and
near-crack dissipation due to mechanisms such as polymer-chain entanglement.
Unlike the bulk hysteric dissipation, the near-crack dissipation does not
necessarily induce large stress-stretch hysteresis of the bulk material. The
extreme toughening mechanism can be universally applied to various soft tough

distributions of the sample covariance matrix under the high-dimensional factor
structure. We provide asymptotic distributions for the top eigenvalues of
bootstrapped sample covariance matrix under mild conditions. After bootstrap,
the spiked eigenvalues which are driven by common factors will converge weakly
to Gaussian limits via proper scaling and centralization. However, the largest
non-spiked eigenvalue is mainly determined by order statistics of bootstrap
resampling weights, and follows extreme value distribution. Based on the
disparate behavior of the spiked and non-spiked eigenvalues, we propose
innovative methods to test the number of common factors. According to the
simulations and a real data example, the proposed methods are the only ones
performing reliably and convincingly under the existence of both weak factors
and cross-sectionally correlated errors. Our technical details contribute to
random matrix theory on spiked covariance model with convexly decaying density
and unbounded support, or with general elliptical distributions.

is used to describe inflation and late-time acceleration. This review is
dedicated to the framework of quintessential inflation, with a focus on the
building blocks of formalism. Consistent unification of inflation and late time
acceleration using a single scalar field asks for a shallow field potential
initially followed by steep behaviour thereafter and shallow again around the
present epoch. The requirement of non-interference of scalar field with thermal
history dictates steep nature of potential in the post-inflationary era, with a
further restriction that late time physics be independent of initial
conditions. We describe, in detail the scaling and asymptotic scaling solutions
and the mechanism of exit from the scaling regime to late time acceleration.
Review includes a fresh look at scaling solutions which are central to the
theme of unification of inflation and late time acceleration. As for the exit
mechanism, special attention is paid to the coupling of massive neutrino matter
to the scalar field, which builds up dynamically and can give rise to late time
acceleration. We present a detailed analytical treatment of scalar field
dynamics in the presence of coupling. We briefly discuss the distinguished
feature of quintessential inflation, namely, the blue spectrum of gravity waves
produced during the transition from inflation to the kinetic regime.

of paramount importance. The existing approaches focus on addressing fairness
bugs by either modifying the input dataset or modifying the learning
algorithms. On the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide
finer controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive approach to
influence the fairness. Can hyperparameters amplify or suppress discrimination
present in the input dataset? How can we help programmers in detecting,

fairness?
  We design three search-based software testing algorithms to uncover the
precision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space. We complement these
algorithms with statistical debugging to explain the role of these parameters
in improving fairness. We implement the proposed approaches in the tool
Parfait-ML (PARameter FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its
effectiveness and utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six
social-critical applications. In these applications, our approach successfully
identified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the

Surprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our approach showed
that certain configuration of hyperparameters (e.g., restricting the search
space of attributes) can amplify biases across applications. Upon further
investigation, we found intuitive explanations of these phenomena, and the
results corroborate similar observations from the literature.

effective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over
items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the
influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph
collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods
typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the
neighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the
potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above
issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named
Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly
incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we
introduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and
semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction
graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users
(or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In
implementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors
correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the
potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with
similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate
these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed
NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph
collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17%
performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on
the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively. Our code is available at:

reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail is largely controlled by the
pre-reconnection current sheet configuration. One of the most important thin
current sheet characteristics is the preponderance of electron currents driven
by strong polarized electric fields, which are commonly observed in the Earth's
magnetotail well before the reconnection. We use particle-in-cell simulations
to investigate magnetic reconnection in the 2D magnetotail current sheet with a
finite magnetic field component normal to the current sheet and with the
current sheet polarization. Under the same external driving conditions,
reconnection in a polarized current sheet is shown to occur at a lower rate
than in a nonpolarized current sheet. The reconnection rate in a polarized
current sheet decreases linearly as the electron current's contribution to the
cross-tail current increases. In simulations with lower background temperature
the reconnection electric field is higher. We demonstrate that after
reconnection in such a polarized current sheet, the outflow energy flux is
mostly in the form of ion enthalpy flux, followed by electron enthalpy flux,
Poynting flux, ion kinetic energy flux and electron kinetic energy flux. These
findings are consistent with spacecraft observations. Because current sheet
polarization is not uniform along the magnetotail, our results suggest that it
may slow down reconnection in the most polarized near-Earth magnetotail and
thereby move the location of reconnection onset downtail.

many biomedical applications such as drug design and molecular property
prediction. To meet this challenge, researchers have used optimal transport
(OT) to perform representation alignment between the source and target domains.
Yet existing OT algorithms are mainly designed for classification tasks.
Accordingly, we consider regression tasks in the unsupervised and
semi-supervised settings in this paper. To exploit continuous labels, we
propose novel metrics to measure domain distances and introduce a posterior
variance regularizer on the transport plan. Further, while computationally
appealing, OT suffers from ambiguous decision boundaries and biased local data
distributions brought by the mini-batch training. To address those issues, we
propose to couple OT with metric learning to yield more robust boundaries and
reduce bias. Specifically, we present a dynamic hierarchical triplet loss to
describe the global data distribution, where the cluster centroids are
progressively adjusted among consecutive iterations. We evaluate our method on
both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks in biochemistry.
Experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across various benchmark datasets of small molecules and material
crystals.

contact surface shape and force distribution to estimate the friction

applications. However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other
generic scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving
multiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads,

high-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we
present a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for
Bing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation
and contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the
capability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling
knowledge from the ``relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the
capability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to
discriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes
are jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads
of high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides
the learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline
built upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be
performed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in
high-quality. We make comprehensive offline and online experiments to evaluate
the proposed techniques, whose findings may provide useful insights for the
future development of EBR systems. Uni-Retriever has been mainstreamed as the

2$d$-Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$, close to uniformly rotating Kirchhoff
elliptical vortices, with aspect ratios belonging to a set of asymptotically
full Lebesgue measure. The problem is reformulated into a quasi-linear
Hamiltonian equation for a radial displacement from the ellipse. A major
difficulty of the KAM proof is the presence of a zero normal mode frequency,
which is due to the conservation of the angular momentum. The key novelty to
overcome this degeneracy is to perform a perturbative symplectic reduction of
the angular momentum, introducing it as a symplectic variable in the spirit of
the Darboux-Carath\'eodory theorem of symplectic rectification, valid in finite
dimension. This approach is particularly delicate in a infinite dimensional
phase space: our symplectic change of variables is a nonlinear modification of
the transport flow generated by the angular momentum itself. This is the first
time such an idea is implemented in KAM for PDEs. Other difficulties are the
lack of rotational symmetry of the equation and the presence of
hyperbolic/elliptic normal modes. The latter difficulties -- as well as the
degeneracy of a normal frequency -- are absent in other vortex patches problems

at the end of inflation produces a network of metastable cosmic strings while,
the interaction between $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs field and the neutrinos generate
heavy Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos. The heavy Majorana masses
explain the tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism, a realistic scenario
for reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis. We show that a successful

be achieved for a wide range of reheating temperatures and $U(1)_{B-L}$

media platforms has become paramount due to its widespread usage among all age
groups, races, and ethnicities. Consequently, there have been substantial
research efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no
research has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With
increased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media
platforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as text data.
Nevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and
offensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities,
i.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the
most essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker's
emotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our
current research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal
deep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion
and the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate
that incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over
text-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content. This paper also
presents a new Hate Speech Detection Video Dataset (HSDVD) collected for the
purpose of multimodal learning as no such dataset exists today.

  Learning-Based Approach","20 Pages, 5 figures, 6 tables. Submitted to Expert Systems with
  Applications",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Vital node identification is the problem of finding nodes of highest
importance in complex networks. This problem has crucial applications in
various contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of
virus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node
identification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a
mathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the
node to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good
performance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is
limited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of
machine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns
and relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for
vital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small
portion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest
of the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by
simulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use
collective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by
incorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness.
Several machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but
the best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF
kernel. The empirical results confirms that the proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art models on a selection of datasets, while it also shows more
adaptability to changes in the dynamics parameters.

Existing graph representation learning methods (e.g., based on random walk and

connected nodes. Such pair-wise learning schemes could fail to capture the
global distribution of representations, since it has no explicit constraints on
the global geometric properties of representation space. To this end, we
propose Geometric Graph Representation Learning (G2R) to learn node
representations in an unsupervised manner via maximizing rate reduction. In
this way, G2R maps nodes in distinct groups (implicitly stored in the adjacency
matrix) into different subspaces, while each subspace is compact and different
subspaces are dispersedly distributed. G2R adopts a graph neural network as the
encoder and maximizes the rate reduction with the adjacency matrix.
Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that rate reduction
maximization is equivalent to maximizing the principal angles between different
subspaces. Experiments on real-world datasets show that G2R outperforms various
baselines on node classification and community detection tasks.

the implication of the same arguments to systems on the infinite cylinder, both

title suggests we take a modern topological point of view and prove the
generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by making use of a topological index

index that characterizes a locally-unique gapped ground state and is invariant
under continuous (or smooth) modification of the ground state.

metal dichalcogenide 1T-TiSe2 exhibits superconductivity in proximity to a

avenue to study the correlation between the two symmetry-breaking exotic
quantum electronic states. We report herein that, in addition to the well-known
superconducting dome that emerges within the low pressure range of 2 - 4 GPa
and peaks with the maximal Tc of about 1.8 K, the pressure induces another
separate superconducting transition starting around 15 GPa with a substantially
higher Tc that reaches 5.6 K at about 21.5 GPa. The high-pressure X-ray
diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements unveil that the
superconductivity reentrant is caused by a first-order structural phase
transition (from P-3m1 space group to Pnma space group), which is also
supported by the density functional theory calculation. A comparative
theoretical calculation also reveals that the conventional phonon-mediated
mechanism can account for the superconductivity of 1T-TiSe2 under low pressure,
while the electron-phonon coupling of 4O-TiSe2 under high pressure is too weak
to induce the superconductivity with a Tc as high as 5.6 K. This implies that
the emergent superconductivity in the 4O-TiSe2 may have an unconventional
origin. Our finding would open a new window toward the discovery of more exotic
quantum states in transition metal dichalcogenides via high pressure.

static and dynamic obstacles and resistive forces (like linear drag, angular
drag, and gravity) are modeled to track multiple dynamic targets. Moreover,
reward functions for robust swarm formation and target tracking are devised for
learning complex swarm behaviors. Since the number of agents is not fixed and
has only the partial observance of the environment, swarm formation and
navigation become challenging. In this regard, the proposed strategy consists
of three main phases to tackle the aforementioned challenges: 1) A methodology
for dynamic swarm management, 2) Avoiding obstacles, Finding the shortest path
towards the targets, 3) Tracking the targets and Island modeling. The dynamic
swarm management phase translates basic sensory input to high level commands to
enhance swarm navigation and decentralized setup while maintaining the swarms
size fluctuations. While, in the island modeling, the swarm can split into
individual subswarms according to the number of targets, conversely, these
subswarms may join to form a single huge swarm, giving the swarm ability to
track multiple targets. Customized state of the art policy based deep
reinforcement learning algorithms are employed to achieve significant results.
The promising results show that our proposed strategy enhances swarm navigation

flow conservation into attention and propose the Flow-Attention mechanism of
linear complexity. By respectively conserving the incoming flow of sinks for

Flow-Attention inherently generates informative attentions without using
specific inductive biases. Empowered by the Flow-Attention, Flowformer yields
strong performance in linear time for wide areas, including long sequence, time

pulmonary diseases, which requires an accurate and topological complete airway
map for its localization and guidance. The airway map could be extracted from
chest computed tomography (CT) scans automatically by airway segmentation
methods. Due to the complex tree-like structure of the airway, preserving its
topology completeness while maintaining the segmentation accuracy is a
challenging task.
  Methods: In this paper, a long-term slice propagation (LTSP) method is
proposed for accurate airway segmentation from pathological CT scans. We also
design a two-stage end-to-end segmentation framework utilizing the LTSP method
in the decoding process. Stage 1 is used to generate a coarse feature map by an
encoder-decoder architecture. Stage 2 is to adopt the proposed LTSP method for
exploiting the continuity information and enhancing the weak airway features in
the coarse feature map. The final segmentation result is predicted from the
refined feature map.
  Results: Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of
the proposed method on 70 clinical CT scans. The results demonstrate the
considerable improvements of the proposed method compared to some
state-of-the-art methods as most breakages are eliminated and more tiny bronchi
are detected. The ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the
constituents of the proposed method.
  Conclusion: Slice continuity information is beneficial to accurate airway
segmentation. Furthermore, by propagating the long-term slice feature, the
airway topology connectivity is preserved with overall segmentation accuracy
maintained.

middle or high latitudes, and are observed on most of the solar systems'
planetary atmospheres. The polar vortices on Earth, Mars, and Titan are
dynamically related to the mean meridional circulation and exhibits a
significant seasonal cycle. However, the polar vortex's characteristics vary
between the three planets. To understand the mechanisms that influence the
polar vortex's dynamics and dependence on planetary parameters, we use an
idealized general circulation model with a seasonal cycle in which we varied
the obliquity, rotation rate, and orbital period. We find that there are
distinct regimes for the polar vortex seasonal cycle across the parameter
space. Some regimes have similarities to the observed polar vortices, including
a weakening of the polar vortex during midwinter at slow rotation rates,
similar to Titan's polar vortex. However, other regimes found within the
parameter space have no counterpart in the solar system. In addition, we show
that for a significant fraction of the parameter space, the vortex's potential
vorticity latitudinal structure is annular, similar to the observed structure
of the polar vortex on Mars and Titan. We also find a suppression of storm
activity during midwinter that resembles the suppression observed on Mars and
Earth, which occurs in simulations where the jet speed is greater than ~60
ms$^{-1}$. This wide variety of polar vortex dynamical regimes that shares
similarities to observed polar vortices suggests that among exoplanets, there
can be a wide variability of polar vortices.

Scratch, where block-based commands are assembled visually in order to control
the interactions of graphical sprites. Automated testing of such programs is an
important prerequisite for supporting debugging, providing hints, or assessing
learning outcomes. However, writing tests for Scratch programs can be
challenging: The game-like and randomised nature of typical Scratch programs
makes it difficult to identify specific timed input sequences used to control
the programs. Furthermore, precise test assertions to check the resulting
program states are incompatible with the fundamental principle of creative
freedom in programming in Scratch, where correct program behaviour may be
implemented with deviations in the graphical appearance or timing of the
program. The event-driven and actor-oriented nature of Scratch programs,
however, makes them a natural fit for describing program behaviour using finite
state machines. In this paper, we introduce a model-based testing approach by
extending Whisker, an automated testing framework for Scratch programs. The
model-based extension describes expected program behaviour in terms of state
machines, which makes it feasible to check the abstract behaviour of a program
independent of exact timing and pixel-precise graphical details, and to
automatically derive test inputs testing even challenging programs. A video

flows encounter critical levels where the phase velocity relative to the basic
flow $c-U(y)$ matches the Alfv\'en wave velocities $\pm B(y)/\sqrt{\mu\rho}$,
based on the local magnetic field $B(y)$, the magnetic permeability $\mu$ and
the mass density of the fluid $\rho$. It is shown that when the two critical
levels are close to each other, the critical layer can generate an instability.
The instability problem is solved, combining asymptotic solutions at large
wavenumbers and numerical solutions, and the mechanism of instability explained
using the conservation of momentum. For the shallow water MHD system, the paper
gives the general form of the local differential equation governing such
coalescing critical layers for any generic field and flow profiles, and
determines precisely how the magnetic field modifies the purely hydrodynamic
stability criterion based on the potential vorticity gradient in the critical
layer. The curvature of the magnetic field profile, or equivalently the
electric current gradient, $J' = - B''/\mu$ in the critical layer is found to
play a complementary role in the instability.

in dynamic environments. Among these maps, the particle-based map offers a
solid theoretical basis and the ability to model complex-shaped obstacles.
Current particle-based maps describe the occupancy status in discrete grid form
and suffer from the grid size problem, namely: large grid size is unfavorable
for path planning while small grid size lowers efficiency and causes gaps and
inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, this paper generalizes the
particle-based map into continuous space and builds an efficient 3D local map.
A dual-structure subspace division paradigm, composed of a voxel subspace
division and a novel pyramid-like subspace division, is proposed to propagate
particles and update the map efficiently with the consideration of occlusions.
The occupancy status of an arbitrary point can then be estimated with the
cardinality expectation. To reduce the noise in modeling static and dynamic
obstacles simultaneously, an initial velocity estimation approach and a mixture
model are utilized. Experimental results show that our map can effectively and
efficiently model both dynamic obstacles and static obstacles. Compared to the
state-of-the-art grid-form particle-based map, our map enables continuous
occupancy estimation and substantially improves the performance in different
resolutions. We also deployed the map on a quadrotor to demonstrate the bright
prospect of using this map in obstacle avoidance tasks of small-scale robotics
systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel NIS method using depth maps, which generates

filter out the outliers in feature matches and estimate the epipolar geometry
between input images. Then, we draw a triangulation of the target image and
estimate multiple local homographies, one per triangle, based on the locations
of their vertices, the rectified depth values and the epipolar geometry.
Finally, the warping image is rendered by the backward mapping of piece-wise
homographies. Panorama is then produced via average blending and image
inpainting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only
provides accurate alignment in the overlapping regions but also virtual
naturalness in the non-overlapping region.

in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and appears as a diffuse light extending
megaparsecs from the source. We investigate how to probe the properties of the
early galaxies and their surrounding IGM using this scattered light. We create
a Monte Carlo algorithm to track individual photons and reproduce several test
cases from previous literature. Then, we run our code on the simulated IGM of
the CoDaII simulation. We find that the scattered light can leave an observable
imprint on the emergent spectrum if collected over several square arcminutes.
Scattering can redden the emission by increasing the path lengths of photons,
but it can also make the photons bluer by upscattering them according to the
peculiar motion of the scatterer. The photons emitted on the far blue side of
the resonance appear more extended in both frequency and space compared to
those emitted near the resonance. This provides a discriminating feature for
the blueward emission, which cannot be constrained from the unscattered light
coming directly from the source. The ionization state of the IGM also affects
the scattered light spectrum. When the source is in a small HII region, the
emission goes through more scatterings in the surrounding HI region regardless
of the initial frequency and ends up more redshifted and spatially extended.
This can result in a weakening of the scattered light toward high $z$ during
reionization. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the scattered
light to be measured by high-$z$ integral-field-unit surveys.

generated voices' diversity, word error rate, perceived speech quality and the
success of attackers under privacy compromise and authentication compromise

traditional convolution to learning on non-Euclidean data. The key to the GNNs
is adopting the neural message-passing paradigm with two stages: aggregation
and update. The current design of GNNs considers the topology information in
the aggregation stage. However, in the updating stage, all nodes share the same
updating function. The identical updating function treats each node embedding
as i.i.d. random variables and thus ignores the implicit relationships between
neighborhoods, which limits the capacity of the GNNs. The updating function is
usually implemented with a linear transformation followed by a non-linear
activation function. To make the updating function topology-aware, we inject
the topological information into the non-linear activation function and propose
Graph-adaptive Rectified Linear Unit (GReLU), which is a new parametric
activation function incorporating the neighborhood information in a novel and
efficient way. The parameters of GReLU are obtained from a hyperfunction based
on both node features and the corresponding adjacent matrix. To reduce the risk
of overfitting and the computational cost, we decompose the hyperfunction as
two independent components for nodes and features respectively. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that our plug-and-play GReLU method is

While
its high expressive power, underpinned by a simple syntax and the support for

undecidable in general. For this reason, different fragments have emerged,
introducing syntactic limitations to Datalog^E that strike a balance between
its expressive power and the computational complexity of QA, to achieve
decidability. In this short paper, we focus on two promising tractable
candidates, namely Shy and Warded Datalog+/-. Reacting to an explicit interest

(APMV) and cars can perform non-driving tasks, such as reading books and
smartphones, while driving. It has been pointed out that such activities may
increase motion sickness. Many studies have been conducted to build
countermeasures, of which various computational motion sickness models have
been developed. Many of these are based on subjective vertical conflict (SVC)
theory, which describes vertical changes in direction sensed by human sensory
organs vs. those expected by the central nervous system. Such models are
expected to be applied to autonomous driving scenarios. However, no current
computational model can integrate visual vertical information with vestibular
sensations.
  We proposed a 6 DoF SVC-VV model which add a visually perceived vertical
block into a conventional six-degrees-of-freedom SVC model to predict VV
directions from image data simulating the visual input of a human. Hence, a
simple image-based VV estimation method is proposed.
  As the validation of the proposed model, this paper focuses on describing the
fact that the motion sickness increases as a passenger reads a book while using
an AMPV, assuming that visual vertical (VV) plays an important role. In the
static experiment, it is demonstrated that the estimated VV by the proposed
method accurately described the gravitational acceleration direction with a low
mean absolute deviation. In addition, the results of the driving experiment
using an APMV demonstrated that the proposed 6 DoF SVC-VV model could describe
that the increased motion sickness experienced when the VV and gravitational
acceleration directions were different.

because of the complexity of indoor luminaires and the limited information
involved in 2D images. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based
framework for indoor lighting estimation. At its core is a new lighting model
(dubbed DSGLight) based on depth-augmented Spherical Gaussians (SG) and a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) that infers the new lighting representation from a
single LDR image of limited field-of-view. Our lighting model builds 128 evenly
distributed SGs over the indoor panorama, where each SG encoding the lighting
and the depth around that node. The proposed GCN then learns the mapping from
the input image to DSGLight. Compared with existing lighting models, our
DSGLight encodes both direct lighting and indirect environmental lighting more
faithfully and compactly. It also makes network training and inference more
stable. The estimated depth distribution enables temporally stable shading and
shadows under spatially-varying lighting. Through thorough experiments, we show
that our method obviously outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and

technique when attempting to detect Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of
solar-type stars. This is due to a smaller number of physical processes
affecting the signal, and a larger ratio of the amplitude of the planetary
signal to the stellar signal. A few high-precision astrometric missions have
therefore been proposed over the past two decades. We aim to re-estimate the
detection limits in astrometry for the nearby stars which are the main targets
proposed for the THEIA astrometric mission, the most elaborate mission to
search for planets, and to characterise its performance. This analysis is
performed for the 55 F-G-K stars in the THEIA sample. We used realistic
simulations of stellar activity and selected those that correspond best to each
star in terms of spectral type and average activity level. Then, we performed
blind tests to estimate the performance. We find worse detection limits
compared to those previously obtained for that sample based on a careful
analysis of the false positive rate, with values in the Earth-mass regime for
most stars of the sample. The difference is attributed to the fact that we
analysed full time series, adapted to each star in the sample, rather than
using the expected solar jitter only. Although these detection limits have a
relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the fitted parameters have small
uncertainties. We confirm the low impact of stellar activity on exoplanet
detectability for solar-type stars, although it plays a significant role for
the closest stars such as alpha Cen A and B. However, for the few stars in the
sample with a habitable zone corresponding to long periods, namely subgiants,
the THEIA observational strategy is not well adapted and should prevent the
detection of planets in the habitable zone, unless a longer mission can be
proposed.

shows that the convex optimization model will share the same optimization
results with the initial model on which the convex relaxations are conducted.
We first show how the relaxation on the initial non-convex model is conducted
and provide analysis to show that the relaxations are convex constraints and
the relaxed model is thus a convex model. Subsequently, we prove that the
relaxed convex model will always achieve its optimal solution on the initial
equality constraints and the optimal solution achieved by convex optimization
will be the same as the one obtained by the initial non-convex model and the
relaxations applied are exact. A numerical verification has been conducted
based on a typical urban rail system with a steep gradient. The results of this
paper shed lights on further applications of convex optimization on
energy-efficient train control and relevant areas related to operation and
control of low-carbon transportation systems.

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A query performance predictor estimates the retrieval effectiveness of an IR
system for a given query. An important characteristic of QPP evaluation is
that, since the ground truth retrieval effectiveness for QPP evaluation can be
measured with different metrics, the ground truth itself is not absolute, which
is in contrast to other retrieval tasks, such as that of ad-hoc retrieval.
Motivated by this argument, the objective of this paper is to investigate how
such variances in the ground truth for QPP evaluation can affect the outcomes
of QPP experiments. We consider this not only in terms of the absolute values
of the evaluation metrics being reported (e.g. Pearson's $r$, Kendall's
$\tau$), but also with respect to the changes in the ranks of different QPP
systems when ordered by the QPP metric scores. Our experiments reveal that the
observed QPP outcomes can vary considerably, both in terms of the absolute
evaluation metric values and also in terms of the relative system ranks.
Through our analysis, we report the optimal combinations of QPP evaluation
metric and experimental settings that are likely to lead to smaller variations
in the observed results.

advantages in facilitating network computation tasks such as link prediction,
node classification and node clustering. The objective of network embedding is
to represent network nodes in a low-dimensional vector space while retaining as
much information as possible from the original network including structural,
relational, and semantic information. However, asymmetric nature of directed
networks poses many challenges as how to best preserve edge directions in the
embedding process. Here, we propose a novel deep asymmetric attributed network
embedding model based on convolutional graph neural network, called AAGCN. The
main idea is to maximally preserve the asymmetric proximity and asymmetric
similarity of directed attributed networks. AAGCN introduces two neighbourhood
feature aggregation schemes to separately aggregate the features of a node with
the features of its in- and out- neighbours. Then, it learns two embedding
vectors for each node, one source embedding vector and one target embedding
vector. The final representations are the results of concatenating source and
target embedding vectors. We test the performance of AAGCN on three real-world
networks for network reconstruction, link prediction, node classification and
visualization tasks. The experimental results show the superiority of AAGCN
against state-of-the-art embedding methods.

attacks as well as adversarial attacks. In the literature, these two types of
attacks are commonly treated as distinct problems and solved separately, since
they belong to training-time and inference-time attacks respectively. However,
in this paper we find an intriguing connection between them: for a model
planted with backdoors, we observe that its adversarial examples have similar
behaviors as its triggered images, i.e., both activate the same subset of DNN
neurons. It indicates that planting a backdoor into a model will significantly
affect the model's adversarial examples. Based on these observations, a novel
Progressive Backdoor Erasing (PBE) algorithm is proposed to progressively
purify the infected model by leveraging untargeted adversarial attacks.
Different from previous backdoor defense methods, one significant advantage of
our approach is that it can erase backdoor even when the clean extra dataset is

element approaches based upon homogenised representations are widely employed
to assess the nonlinear behaviour up to collapse, as they are generally

are determined by an advanced multi objective strategy with genetic algorithms
from the results of mesoscale virtual tests through the minimisation of

which are costly and not universally accessible. Here, we have developed a
computational method that enables autofluorescence subtraction without
requiring dedicated measurement resources. The method uses a non-parametric
Bayesian approach to deconvolve the target signal distribution from independent
measurements of labeled and unlabeled cells readily available in a typical
experiment. The distributions are approximated by mixtures of gamma functions,
and the target distribution is obtained by sampling the posterior distribution
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We tested the method systematically
using synthetic data, and validated it using experimental data from mouse
embryonic stem cells.

non-linear activation function and maximum pooling computations are intensively
invoked. As such, to design and implement privacy-preserving, high efficiency
machine learning mechanisms, one highly demands a practical crypto tool for
secure arithmetic computations. SPDZ, an interesting framework of secure
multi-party computations is a promising technique deployed for industry-scale
machine learning development if one is able to generate Beaver (multiplication)
triple offline efficiently. This paper studies secure yet efficient Beaver
triple generators leveraging privacy-preserving scalar product protocols which
in turn can be constructed from additive-only homomorphic encryptions(AHEs).
Different from the state-of-the-art solutions, where a party first splits her
private input into a shared vector and then invokes an AHE to compute scalar
product of the shared vectors managed by individual MPC server, we formalize
Beaver triple generators in the context of 2-party shared scalar product
protocol and then dispense the generated shares to MPC servers. As such, the
protocol presented in this paper can be viewed as a dual construction of the
state-of-the-art AHE based solutions. Furthermore, instead of applying the
Paillier encryption as a basis of our previous constructions or inheriting from
somewhat homomorphic encryptions, we propose an alternative construction of AHE
from polynomial ring learning with error (RLWE) which results in an efficient
implementation of Beaver triple generators.

the shock regions are not self-similar altogether. In a milestone work [J.
Garnier et al., Phys. Plas., 13, 092703 (2006)], it was found that for a
specific power law dependency temperature profile, a unique exact self-similar
solution exists, that is valid for all physical regimes. In this work we
approximate Garnier's exact solution for a general power-law
temperature-dependency, using simple analytical considerations. This
approximate solution yields a good agreement compared to numerical simulations
for the different thermodynamic profiles within the expected range of validity.
In addition, we offer an approximate solution for the energies absorbed in the
matter, again, for a general power-law temperature profile. Our approximate
self-similar solution for the energy yields very good results comparing to
exact numerical simulations for both gold and $\mathrm{Ta_2O_5}$. We also set a
comparison of our self-similar solutions with the results of an experiment for
radiation temperature measurement in a hohlraum in low-density foams that is
addressed directly, to the intermediate regime, yielding a good agreement and
similar trends. The different models as well as the numerical simulations are
powerful tools to analyze the supersonic-subsonic transition region.

superconductors as a unique function of the reduced applied field, $B/B_{c2}$
(where $B_c2$ is the upper critical field), $|F_p|$ has been scaled based on
B/B_c2 ratio, for which there is widely used scaling law of
$|F_p(B)|=F_{p,max}((B/B_{c2})^p)((1-B/B_{c2})^q)$, where $F_{p,max}$,

was modified by (a) an assumption of the angular dependence of all free-fitting

that the pinning force density is also a function of critical current density

three distinctive characteristic ranges of $(B/B_{c2}, J_c/(J_c(sf)))$ (where

presented in the form of serial rows of data points. In general, the number of
data points varies from row to row. Lofted or skinned B-spline surface
interpolation is a technique that generates a B-spline surface that passes
through these data points precisely. The traditional process often causes a
large increase in the number of control points of the resulting B-spline
surface. Much of the work to date in mitigating the effects of this increase
has been restricted to open section-curves. The lofting of sequential closed
contours using the interpolation technique has not been addressed in the
existing literature. In this paper, we present two novel conjectures relating
to closed B-spline curve interpolation. We derive the equivalent closed
B-spline interpolation condition of the well-established Schoenberg-Whitney
condition for open B-spline interpolation, a condition that the parameter
values and the domain knots should satisfy to guarantee the system matrix is
always invertible or full-rank. We then apply the interpolation condition to
the problem of lofted B-spline surface interpolation to serial closed contours.
The correctness of these conjectures is validated via numerical results and
several practical experiments. Github repository

phase shift of $\pi/2$. This phase shift can introduce additional distortions
in the strains produced by the Type-II image of the binary black hole signals
depending on the morphology of the signals, e.g., when they have contributions
from higher harmonics, precession, eccentricity etc. The optical depth to the
Type-II images is nearly the same as the strong lensing (from galaxies) and
thus are very likely to be observed in the near future. In this work, we
investigate the potential applicability of these distortions in helping
identify Type-II signals from a single detection, and also the systematic
biases that could arise in the inference of their parameters if they are
unknowingly recovered with unlensed gravitational-wave templates. We show that
at total network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\rho=20(50)$, individual Type-II
images should be identifiable with log Bayes factor $\ln \mathcal{B} > 2$ for
inclinations $ \iota > 5 \pi/12 (\pi/3) $. Furthermore, based on the trends we
observe in these results we predict that, at high SNRs ($\gtrsim 100$),
individual Type-II images would be identifiable even when the inclination angle
is much lower ($\sim \pi/6$). We then show that neglecting physical effects
arising from these identifiable Type-II images can significantly bias estimates
of parameters (such as sky location, distance, inclination, etc.), and
sometimes lead to fully inaccurate measurement of these parameters. Thus, in
the future, using Type-II lensed template for such signals would be necessary.

orthonormal basis. The case of Gabor orthonormal bases generated by
characteristic functions $g=\chi_\Omega$ has been solved by Han and Wang. In
this paper, we build on these results and obtain a full characterization of
Riesz Gabor systems of the form $\mathcal G(\chi_\Omega, \Lambda\times \Gamma)$
when $\Omega$ is a tiling of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to $\Lambda$.
Furthermore, for a certain class of lattices $\Lambda\times \Gamma$, we prove
that a necessary condition for the characteristic function of a multi-tiling
set to serve as a window function for a Riesz Gabor basis is that the set must
be a tiling set. To prove this, we develop new results on the zeros of the Zak
transform and connect these results to Gabor frames.

augmentation method, called TensorMixup, was proposed and applied to the three
dimensional U-Net architecture for brain tumor segmentation. The main ideas
included that first, two image patches with size of 128 in three dimensions
were selected according to glioma information of ground truth labels from the
magnetic resonance imaging data of any two patients with the same modality.
Next, a tensor in which all elements were independently sampled from Beta
distribution was used to mix the image patches. Then the tensor was mapped to a
matrix which was used to mix the one-hot encoded labels of the above image
patches. Therefore, a new image and its one-hot encoded label were synthesized.
Finally, the new data was used to train the model which could be used to
segment glioma. The experimental results show that the mean accuracy of Dice
scores are 91.32%, 85.67%, and 82.20% respectively on the whole tumor, tumor
core, and enhancing tumor segmentation, which proves that the proposed
TensorMixup is feasible and effective for brain tumor segmentation.

networks (DNNs) have captured increasing public concern about their security
problems, due to their frequently occurred erroneous behaviors. Therefore, it
is necessary to conduct a systematical testing for DNNs before they are
deployed to real-world applications. Existing testing methods have provided
fine-grained metrics based on neuron coverage and proposed various approaches
to improve such metrics. However, it has been gradually realized that a higher
neuron coverage does \textit{not} necessarily represent better capabilities in
identifying defects that lead to errors. Besides, coverage-guided methods
cannot hunt errors due to faulty training procedure. So the robustness
improvement of DNNs via retraining by these testing examples are
unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of
excitable neurons based on Shapley value and design a novel white-box testing
framework for DNNs, namely DeepSensor. It is motivated by our observation that
neurons with larger responsibility towards model loss changes due to small
perturbations are more likely related to incorrect corner cases due to
potential defects. By maximizing the number of excitable neurons concerning
various wrong behaviors of models, DeepSensor can generate testing examples
that effectively trigger more errors due to adversarial inputs, polluted data

superiority of DeepSensor.

working with information. In this paper, for the description and modeling of
Brain Principles Programming, it is proposed to apply mathematical models and
algorithms developed by us earlier that model cognitive functions, which are
based on well-known physiological, psychological and other natural science
theories. The paper uses mathematical models and algorithms of the following
theories: P.K.Anokhin's Theory of Functional Brain Systems, Eleonor Rosh's
prototypical categorization theory, Bob Rehter's theory of causal models and
natural classification. As a result, the formalization of the BPP is obtained
and computer examples are given that demonstrate the algorithm's operation.

research arena backed by concrete multilingual and multicultural works, still
suffer from two key shortcomings. Firstly, all epic ontological models
developed till date have been designed following ad-hoc methodologies, most
often, combining existing general purpose ontology development methodologies.
Secondly, none of the ad-hoc methodologies consider the potential reuse of
existing epic ontological models for enrichment, if available. The paper
presents, as a unified solution to the above shortcomings, the design and
development of GENOME - the first dedicated methodology for iterative
ontological modelling of epics, potentially extensible to works in different
research arenas of digital humanities in general. GENOME is grounded in
transdisciplinary foundations of canonical norms for epics, knowledge modelling
best practices, application satisfiability norms and cognitive generative
questions. It is also the first methodology (in epic modelling but also in
general) to be flexible enough to integrate, in practice, the options of
knowledge modelling via reuse or from scratch. The feasibility of GENOME is
validated via a first brief implementation of ontological modelling of the
Indian epic - Mahabharata by reusing an existing ontology. The preliminary
results are promising, with the GENOME-produced model being both ontologically
thorough and performance-wise competent

machine learning has a huge potential of speeding up access to evidence
necessary in healthcare decision-making. Prior research has however
acknowledged inadequate training corpora as a challenge for the Outcome
detection (OD) task. Additionally, several contextualized representations like
BERT and ELMO have achieved unparalleled success in detecting various diseases,
genes, proteins, and chemicals, however, the same cannot be emphatically stated
for outcomes, because these models have been relatively under-tested and
studied for the OD task. We introduce ""EBM-COMET"", a dataset in which 300
PubMed abstracts are expertly annotated for clinical outcomes. Unlike prior
related datasets that use arbitrary outcome classifications, we use labels from
a taxonomy recently published to standardize outcome classifications. To
extract outcomes, we fine-tune a variety of pre-trained contextualized
representations, additionally, we use frozen contextualized and
context-independent representations in our custom neural model augmented with
clinically informed Part-Of-Speech embeddings and a cost-sensitive loss
function. We adopt strict evaluation for the trained models by rewarding them
for correctly identifying full outcome phrases rather than words within the
entities i.e. given an outcome ""systolic blood pressure"", the models are
rewarded a classification score only when they predict all 3 words in sequence,
otherwise, they are not rewarded. We observe our best model (BioBERT) achieve
81.5\% F1, 81.3\% sensitivity and 98.0\% specificity. We reach a consensus on
which contextualized representations are best suited for detecting outcomes
from clinical-trial abstracts. Furthermore, our best model outperforms scores
published on the original EBM-NLP dataset leader-board scores.

research where it aims to come up with a solution on how we are going to
prevent, troubleshoot, and give insight for possible business impact to those
everyday issues. Researchers used data collection to gather data from
management, support workers, and Service Now open-source ticketing system to
visualize the ticketing system application. Critical ticket gives a lot of
pressure to the resources as they needed to resolve the incident in accordance
with the service level agreement. Having knowledge management helps resource to
find references on how to deal with the incident. It helps them to execute
workaround quickly and think of a way on how to resolve it permanently. It is
concluded that critical and auto ticket affects the everyday productivity of
the worker especially teaching new employees despite ongoing critical
incidents. Researchers provided solutions such as knowledge Management and
Dashboard to document all the solutions encountered and monitor the SLA and
incoming tickets. It is recommended to have further research on how critical
and auto ticket affects the mental health of resources and its direct impact to
businesses. It is also recommended to have a study on how knowledge management
work and help resources to identify correct workaround despite of having a lot
of troubleshooting guides.

We develop a
reduced-order model (ROM) for multi-symplectic Hamiltonian partial differential
equations (PDEs) that preserves the global energy. The full-order solutions are
obtained by finite difference discretization in space and the global energy
preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The ROM is constructed in the
same way as the full-order model (FOM) applying proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) with the Galerkin projection. The reduced-order system has the same
structure as the FOM, and preserves the discrete reduced global energy.
Applying the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), the reduced-order
solutions are computed efficiently in the online stage. A priori error bound is
derived for the DEIM approximation to the nonlinear Hamiltonian. The accuracy
and computational efficiency of the ROMs are demonstrated for the Korteweg de
Vries (KdV) equation, Zakharov-Kuznetzov (ZK) equation, and nonlinear
Schr{\""o}dinger (NLS) equation in multi-symplectic form. Preservation of the
reduced energies shows that the reduced-order solutions ensure the long-term

  Portfolio Management",,,,,"q-fin.PM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Traditional portfolio management methods can incorporate specific investor
preferences but rely on accurate forecasts of asset returns and covariances.
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods do not rely on these explicit forecasts and
are better suited for multi-stage decision processes. To address limitations of
the evaluated research, experiments were conducted on three markets in
different economies with different overall trends. By incorporating specific
investor preferences into our RL models' reward functions, a more comprehensive
comparison could be made to traditional methods in risk-return space.
Transaction costs were also modelled more realistically by including nonlinear
changes introduced by market volatility and trading volume. The results of this
study suggest that there can be an advantage to using RL methods compared to
traditional convex mean-variance optimisation methods under certain market
conditions. Our RL models could significantly outperform traditional
single-period optimisation (SPO) and multi-period optimisation (MPO) models in
upward trending markets, but only up to specific risk limits. In sideways
trending markets, the performance of SPO and MPO models can be closely matched
by our RL models for the majority of the excess risk range tested. The specific
market conditions under which these models could outperform each other
highlight the importance of a more comprehensive comparison of Pareto optimal
frontiers in risk-return space. These frontiers give investors a more granular
view of which models might provide better performance for their specific risk
tolerance or return targets.

  and Correlated Perspective",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An emerging computational paradigm, named federated edge learning (FEL),
enables intelligent computing at the network edge with the feature of
preserving data privacy for edge devices. Given their constrained resources, it
becomes a great challenge to achieve high execution performance for FEL. Most
of the state-of-the-arts concentrate on enhancing FEL from the perspective of
system operation procedures, taking few precautions during the composition step
of the FEL system. Though a few recent studies recognize the importance of FEL
formation and propose server-centric device selection schemes, the impact of
data sizes is largely overlooked. In this paper, we take advantage of game
theory to depict the decision dilemma among edge devices regarding whether to
participate in FEL or not given their heterogeneous sizes of local datasets.
For realizing both the individual and global optimization, the server is
employed to solve the participation dilemma, which requires accurate
information collection for devices' local datasets. Hence, we utilize mechanism
design to enable truthful information solicitation. With the help of correlated
equilibrium, we derive a decision making strategy for devices from the global
perspective, which can achieve the long-term stability and efficacy of FEL. For
scalability consideration, we optimize the computational complexity of the
basic solution to the polynomial level. Lastly, extensive experiments based on
both real and synthetic data are conducted to evaluate our proposed mechanisms,
with experimental results demonstrating the performance advantages.
