simulated BKS silica from the perspective of microscopic dynamics in an effort
to elucidate the dynamical behaviors of fragile and strong glass-forming
liquids. Softness, which is a machine-learned feature from local atomic
structures, is used to predict the microscopic activation energetics and
long-term dynamics. The FTS is found to originate from a change in the
temperature dependence of the microscopic activation energetics. Furthermore,
results suggest there are two diffusion channels with different energy barriers
in BKS silica. The fast dynamics at high temperatures is dominated by the
channel with small energy barriers ($<\sim$1 eV), which is controlled by the
short-range order. The rapid closing of this diffusion channel when lowering
temperature leads to the fragile behavior. On the other hand, the slow dynamics
at low temperatures is dominated by the channel with large energy barriers
controlled by the medium-range order. This slow diffusion channel changes only
subtly with temperature, leading to the strong behavior. The distributions of
barriers in the two channels show different temperature dependences, causing a
crossover at $\sim$3100 K. This transition temperature in microscopic dynamics
is consistent with the inflection point in the configurational entropy,
suggesting there is a fundamental correlation between microscopic dynamics and
thermodynamics.

open challenge in medical image analysis. Most existing methods have two key
shortcomings: first, they require extensive up-front parameter tuning to each
specific registration problem, and second, they have difficulty capturing large
deformations and content mismatches between images. There have however been
developments that have laid the foundation for potential solutions to both
shortcomings. Towards the first shortcoming, a multi-objective optimization
approach using the Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm
(RV-GOMEA) has been shown to be capable of producing a diverse set of
registrations for 2D images in one run of the algorithm, representing different
trade-offs between conflicting objectives in the registration problem. This
allows the user to select a registration afterwards and removes the need for
up-front tuning. Towards the second shortcoming, a dual-dynamic grid
transformation model has proven effective at capturing large differences in 2D
images. These two developments have recently been accelerated through GPU
parallelization, delivering large speed-ups. Based on this accelerated version,
it is now possible to extend the approach to 3D images. Concordantly, this work
introduces the first method for multi-objective 3D deformable image
registration, using a 3D dual-dynamic grid transformation model based on
simplex meshes while still supporting the incorporation of annotated guidance
information and multi-resolution schemes. Our proof-of-concept prototype shows
promising results on synthetic and clinical 3D registration problems, forming
the foundation for a new, insightful method that can include bio-mechanical
properties in the registration.

Features from each set are compared by their ANOVA F-Scores and p-values,
arranged into bins grown by 10 features per step to a limit of the 250

a tumor mass under the effects of a chemical substance (e.g., a nutrient or a
drug). The process is described by utilizing the variables $\varphi$, an order
parameter representing the local proportion of tumor cells, and $\sigma$,
representing the concentration of the chemical. The order parameter $\varphi$
is assumed to satisfy a suitable form of the Cahn-Hilliard equation with mass
source and logarithmic potential of Flory-Huggins type (or generalizations of
it). The chemical concentration $\sigma$ satisfies a reaction-diffusion
equation where the cross-diffusion term has the same expression as in the
celebrated Keller-Segel model. In this respect, the model we propose represents
a new coupling between the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a subsystem of the
Keller-Segel model. We believe that, compared to other models, this choice is
more effective in capturing the chemotactic effects that may occur in tumor
growth dynamics (chemically induced tumor evolution and consumption of
nutrient/drug by tumor cells). Note that, in order to prevent finite time
blowup of $\sigma$, we assume a chemical source term of logistic type. Our main
mathematical result is devoted to proving existence of weak solutions in a
rather general setting that covers both the two- and three- dimensional cases.
Under more restrictive assumptions on coefficients and data, and in some cases
on the spatial dimension, we prove various regularity results. Finally, in a
proper class of smooth solutions we show uniqueness and continuous dependence
on the initial data in a number of significant cases.

measured, since Ptolemy, by knowing the exact timing of the solstices and the
equinoxes. The dates of 1703 equinoxes and solstices have been published by
Francesco Bianchini in local roman mean time, referred to the local (roman)
mean noon, i.e. after the solar meridian mean transit time. By using the
observations of the three lunar eclipses of 1703 we found the equation of time
for that year, and the UTC corresponding timings of the beginning of the
seasons. This operation lead to find the contribution of the Sirius aberration
to the instant calculated by Bianchini with respect to the current celestial
mechanical models of IMCCE.

go through as usual. We introduce a density-based definition for the obstacle
based on a new normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW) distance and the density

With this definition, we introduce a novel framework \textsf{DIOT} that

extensive experiments over two real-life data sets. The experimental results

which contain at least one subsolar mass component using data from the LIGO and
Virgo observatories through the completion of their third observing run. The
observation of a merger with a component below $1\,M_{\odot}$ would be a clear
sign of either new physics or the existence of a primordial black hole
population; these black holes could also contribute to the dark matter
distribution. Our search targets binaries where the primary has mass $M_1$
between 0.1-100$\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary has mass $M_2$ from
0.1-1$\,M_{\odot}$ for $M_1 < 20\,M_\odot$ and 0.01-1$\,M_{\odot}$ for $M_1 \ge
20\,M_\odot$. Sources with $M_1 < 7\,M_\odot, M_2 > 0.5\,M_\odot$ are also
allowed to have orbital eccentricity up to $e_{10} \sim 0.3$. This search
region covers from comparable to extreme mass ratio sources up to $10^4:1$. We
find no statistically convincing candidates and so place new upper limits on
the rate of mergers; our analysis sets the first limits for most subsolar
sources with $7\,M_{\odot}< M_1 < 20\,M_{\odot}$ and tightens limits by $\sim
8\times$ $(1.6\times)$ where $M_1 > 20\,M_{\odot}$ ($M_1 < 7\,M_{\odot}$).
Using these limits, we constrain the dark matter fraction to below 0.3
(0.7)$\%$ for 1 (0.5)$\,M_{\odot}$ black holes assuming a monochromatic mass
function. Due to the high merger rate of primordial black holes beyond the
individual source horizon distance, we also use the lack of an observed
stochastic background as a complementary probe to limit the dark matter
fraction. We find that although the limits are in general weaker than those
from the direct search they become comparable at $0.1 \,M_{\odot}$.

lacked optical progenitors in deep pre-outburst HST images; however, one was

were warm enough to be detected in deep HST frames, but most are too cool. Out
of six irregular variables, two were red supergiants with optical counterparts

average treatment effects (CATE) with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
meta-algorithm can work with simple, single-stage CATE estimators such as
S-learner and more complex multi-stage estimators such as DR and R-learner. We
perform a tight privacy analysis by taking advantage of sample splitting in our

In this paper, we implement our approach using DP-EBMs as the base learner.
DP-EBMs are interpretable, high-accuracy models with privacy guarantees, which
allow us to directly observe the impact of DP noise on the learned causal
model. Our experiments show that multi-stage CATE estimators incur larger
accuracy loss than single-stage CATE or ATE estimators and that most of the
accuracy loss from differential privacy is due to an increase in variance, not

severe limitations for global rotation, as already known from classical theory
(e.g. impossibility of confocal and coelliptical solutions, gradient of

recognizing the worst condition of wastewater pipes that need to be replaced
immediately. This comprehensive model is built according to the

Finally, for validation purposes, the proposed model is applied to a small

(SFRs) have provided important information on their demographics, but due to
their sample sizes, they cannot be used to study how disk properties vary with
the environment. We conduct a survey of the unresolved millimeter continuum
emission of 873 protoplanetary disks identified by Spitzer in the L1641 and
L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud. This is the largest such survey yet,
allowing us to identify even weak trends in the median disk mass as a function
of position in the cloud and cluster membership. The sample detection rates and
median masses are also compared to those of nearby (<300 pc) SFRs. The sample
was observed with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 0.08 mJy/beam (1.5
M$_{\oplus}$). The data were reduced and imaged using an innovative parallel
data processing approach. We detect 58% (502/873) of the observed disks. This
includes 20 disks with dust masses >100 M$_{\oplus}$, and two objects
associated with extended dust emission. We infer a median disk dust mass in the
full sample of $2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ M$_{\oplus}$. In L1641 and L1647 median dust
masses are $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$
M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. The disk mass distribution of the full sample is
similar to that of nearby low-mass SFRs at similar ages of 1-3 Myr. We find
only weak trends in disk (dust) masses with galactic longitude and between the
YSO clusters identified in the sample, with median masses varying by $\lesssim$
50%. Age differences may explain these median disk mass variations. Apart from
this, disk masses are essentially constant at scales of ~100 pc. This also
suggests that the majority of disks, even in different SFRs, are formed with
similar initial masses and evolve at similar rates, assuming no external
irradiation, with disk mass loss rates of $\sim 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr.

suggested to apportion seats in a randomized way such that each state receives
exactly their proportional share $q_i$ of seats in expectation (ex ante
proportionality) and receives either $\lfloor q_i \rfloor$ or $\lceil q_i

randomized apportionment methods satisfying these two axioms, and so we
additionally consider prominent axioms from the apportionment literature. Our

cumulative rounding and which might be of independent interest, as we

alpha_1.4-3.0 = -0.63 +/- 0.16. A parabolic fit suggests a median spectral
turnover of ~ 1 GHz, which implies synchrotron self-absorption in a source with
a size of only a fraction of 1 pc, possibly a compact wind or a weak jet. Two
objects show significant spectral steepening to alpha < -2 above 3 GHz or 5

installed immediately after the discharge channel of the Arrocampo dam (Almaraz

the single detection modules, the system requires radioactive background
mitigation techniques through the use of active and passive shielding. We have
extrapolated a MDA of 3.6\,kBq/L for a single module being this value limited
by the cosmic background. The obtained value for a single module is already
compatible with a real-time pre-alert system for a nuclear power plant

interior of a rigid tube, which is a simple model for an airway that takes into
account the yield stress of mucus. An evolution equation for the thickness of
the liquid layer is derived using long-wave theory, from which we also derive a
simpler thin-film evolution equation. In the thin-film case, we show that two
branches of marginally-yielded static solutions of the evolution equation can
be used to both predict the size of initial perturbation required to trigger
instability and quantify how increasing the capillary Bingham number (a
parameter measuring yield stress relative to surface tension) reduces the final
deformation of the layer. Using numerical solutions of the long-wave evolution
equation, we quantify how the critical layer thickness required to form a
liquid plug in the tube increases as the capillary Bingham number is increased.
We discuss the significance of these findings for modelling airway closure in
obstructive conditions such as cystic fibrosis, where the mucus layer is often
thicker and has a higher yield stress.

develop simple stochastic direct-search and trust-region methods for the

estimated via stochastic observations. For trial points to be accepted, these
algorithms require the estimated function values to yield a sufficient decrease
measured in terms of a power larger than 1 of the algoritmic stepsize.
  Our new tail-bound condition is precisely imposed on the reduction estimate
used to achieve such a sufficient decrease. This condition allows us to select
the stepsize power used for sufficient decrease in such a way to reduce the
number of samples needed per iteration. In previous works, the number of
samples necessary for global convergence at every iteration k of this type of
algorithms was O(Delta_k^{-4}), where Delta_k is the stepsize or trust region
radius. However, using the new tail-bound condition, and under mild assumptions
on the noise, one can prove that such a number of samples is only O(Delta_k^{-2
- eps}), where eps > 0 can be made arbitrarily small by selecting the power of
the stepsize in the sufficient decrease test arbitrarily close to 1. The global
convergence properties of the stochastic direct-search and trust-region

Zel'dovich trajectories asymptotically fall off with wave number $k$ like
$k^{-3}$ for $k\to\infty$, irrespective of the cosmological model and the type
of dark matter assumed, with the exponent set only by the number of spatial
dimensions. This conclusion remains valid for density-fluctuation power spectra
if particle interactions are taken into account in a mean-field approximation.
We also show that the bispectrum of freely-streaming particles falls off
asymptotically like $k^{-11/2}$ under the same general conditions.

interacting with an environment into an infinite set of policies, the policy
space, typically represented by a family of parametric functions. Dealing with
such a policy space is a hefty challenge, which often causes sample and
computation inefficiencies. However, we argue that a limited number of policies
are actually relevant when we also account for the structure of the environment
and of the policy parameterization, as many of them would induce very similar
interactions, i.e., state-action distributions. In this paper, we seek for a
reward-free compression of the policy space into a finite set of representative
policies, such that, given any policy $\pi$, the minimum R\'enyi divergence
between the state-action distributions of the representative policies and the
state-action distribution of $\pi$ is bounded. We show that this compression of
the policy space can be formulated as a set cover problem, and it is inherently
NP-hard. Nonetheless, we propose a game-theoretic reformulation for which a
locally optimal solution can be efficiently found by iteratively stretching the
compressed space to cover an adversarial policy. Finally, we provide an
empirical evaluation to illustrate the compression procedure in simple domains,
and its ripple effects in reinforcement learning.

massive stars, including the most massive stars known. The strong stellar winds
of these very luminous stars impact their evolution and the surrounding
environment. We currently lack detailed knowledge of the wind structure that is
needed to quantify this impact. Aims: To observationally constrain the stellar
and wind properties of the massive stars in R136, in particular the parameters
related to wind clumping. Methods: We simultaneously analyse optical and UV
spectroscopy of 53 O-type and 3 WNh-stars using the FASTWIND model atmosphere
code and a genetic algorithm. The models account for optically thick clumps and
effects related to porosity and velocity-porosity, as well as a non-void
interclump medium. Results: We obtain stellar parameters, surface abundances,
mass-loss rates, terminal velocities and clumping characteristics and compare
these to theoretical predictions and evolutionary models. The clumping
properties include the density of the interclump medium and the
velocity-porosity of the wind. For the first time, these characteristics are
systematically measured for a wide range of effective temperatures and
luminosities. Conclusions: We confirm a cluster age of 1.0-2.5 Myr and derive
an initial stellar mass of $\geq 250 {\rm M}_\odot$ for the most massive star
in our sample, R136a1. The winds of our sample stars are highly clumped, with
an average clumping factor of $f_{\rm cl}=29\pm15$. We find tentative trends in
the wind-structure parameters as a function of mass-loss rate, suggesting that
the winds of stars with higher mass-loss rates are less clumped. We compare
several theoretical predictions to the observed mass-loss rates and terminal
velocities and find that none satisfactorily reproduces both quantities. The
prescription of Krti\v{c}ka & Kub\'at (2018) matches best the observed
mass-loss rates.

area networks (WANs) on unlicensed frequency bands. Despite its modest data
rates, it provides extensive coverage for low-power devices, making it an ideal
communication system for many internet of things (IoT) applications. In
general, LoRa is considered as the physical layer, whereas LoRaWAN is the
medium access control (MAC) layer of the LoRa stack that adopts a star topology
to enable communication between multiple end devices (EDs) and the network
gateway. The chirp spread spectrum modulation deals with LoRa signal
interference and ensures long-range communication. At the same time, the
adaptive data rate mechanism allows EDs to dynamically alter some LoRa
features, such as the spreading factor (SF), code rate, and carrier frequency
to address the time variance of communication conditions in dense networks.
Despite the high LoRa connectivity demand, LoRa signals interference and
concurrent transmission collisions are major limitations. Therefore, to enhance
LoRaWAN capacity, the LoRa Alliance released many LoRaWAN versions, and the
research community has provided numerous solutions to develop scalable LoRaWAN
technology. Hence, we thoroughly examine LoRaWAN scalability challenges and
state-of-the-art solutions in both the physical and MAC layers. These solutions
primarily rely on SF, logical, and frequency channel assignment, whereas others
propose new network topologies or implement signal processing schemes to cancel
the interference and allow LoRaWAN to connect more EDs efficiently. A summary
of the existing solutions in the literature is provided at the end of the
paper, describing the advantages and disadvantages of each solution and
suggesting possible enhancements as future research directions.

a prediction interval or prediction set of the label given the input. Two
commonly desired properties for learned prediction sets are \emph{valid
coverage} and \emph{good efficiency} (such as low length or low cardinality).
Conformal prediction is a powerful technique for learning prediction sets with
valid coverage, yet by default its conformalization step only learns a single
parameter, and does not optimize the efficiency over more expressive function
classes.
  In this paper, we propose a generalization of conformal prediction to
multiple learnable parameters, by considering the constrained empirical risk
minimization (ERM) problem of finding the most efficient prediction set subject
to valid empirical coverage. This meta-algorithm generalizes existing conformal
prediction algorithms, and we show that it achieves approximate valid
population coverage and near-optimal efficiency within class, whenever the
function class in the conformalization step is low-capacity in a certain sense.
Next, this ERM problem is challenging to optimize as it involves a
non-differentiable coverage constraint. We develop a gradient-based algorithm
for it by approximating the original constrained ERM using differentiable
surrogate losses and Lagrangians. Experiments show that our algorithm is able
to learn valid prediction sets and improve the efficiency significantly over
existing approaches in several applications such as prediction intervals with
improved length, minimum-volume prediction sets for multi-output regression,

introduce the Dichotomous Affiliate Stable Matching (DASM) Problem, where

generated in binaries between a neutron star and an axion-clouded black hole.
Encouragingly, such binaries are found to be within the reach of ongoing and
upcoming experiments (e.g., the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope
and the future Square Kilometer Array) for certain parameter regions. They thus
provide a promising astronomical laboratory for detecting axions and axion dark
matter.

as time-delay cosmography, is highlighted by the recent Hubble tension. It is
paramount to thoroughly investigate and rule out systematic biases in all
measurement methods before we can accept new physics as the source of this
tension. In this study, we perform a check for systematic biases in the lens
modelling procedure of time-delay cosmography by comparing independent and
blind time-delay predictions of the system WGD 2038-4008 from two teams using
two different software programs: GLEE and LENSTRONOMY. The predicted time
delays from the two teams incorporate the stellar kinematics of the deflector
and the external convergence from line-of-sight structures. The un-blinded
time-delay predictions from the two teams agree within $1.2\sigma$, implying
that once the time delay is measured the inferred Hubble constant will also be
mutually consistent. However, there is a $\sim$4$\sigma$ discrepancy between
the power-law model slope and external shear, which is a significant
discrepancy at the level of lens models before the stellar kinematics and the
external convergence are incorporated. We identify the difference in the
reconstructed point spread function (PSF) to be the source of this discrepancy.
When the same reconstructed PSF was used by both teams, we achieved excellent
agreement, within $\sim$0.6$\sigma$, indicating that potential systematics
stemming from source reconstruction algorithms and investigator choices are
well under control. We recommend that future studies supersample the PSF as
needed and marginalize over multiple algorithms or realizations for the PSF
reconstruction to mitigate the systematics associated with the PSF. A future
study will measure the time delays of the system WGD 2038-4008 and infer the
Hubble constant based on our mass models.

determine the saddle point solutions which describe the tunnelling process we

a concentrated component that is dense ($10^7\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warm
($>$200\,K) and has a large column density
($N_\mathrm{H_2}>10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). The AKARI spectrum shows deep and
broad CO ro-vibrational absorption at 4.67\,\micron. Its band profile is well
reproduced with a similarly dense and large column but hotter ($\sim$1000\,K)
gas. The region observed through absorption in the near-infrared is highly
likely in the nuclear direction, as in the sub-millimeter, but with a narrower
beam including a region closer to the nucleus. The central component is

originates. The most plausible heating source for the gas is X-rays from the

clusters using data products from the $XMM$ Cluster Survey (XCS). In total,
1189 SDSSRM clusters fall within the $XMM$-Newton footprint. This has yielded
456 confirmed detections accompanied by X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}$)
measurements. Of the detected clusters, 382 have an associated X-ray
temperature measurement ($T_{X}$). This represents one of the largest samples
of coherently derived cluster $T_{X}$ values to date. Our analysis of the X-ray
observable to richness ($\lambda$) scaling relations has demonstrated that
scatter in the $T_{X}-\lambda$ relation is roughly a third of that in the
$L_{X}-\lambda$ relation, and that the $L_{X}-\lambda$ scatter is intrinsic,
i.e. will not be significantly reduced with larger sample sizes. Our analysis
of the scaling relation between $L_{X}$ and $T_{X}$ has shown that the fits are
sensitive to the selection method of the sample, i.e. whether the sample is
made up of clusters detected ""serendipitously"" compared to those deliberately
targeted by $XMM$. These differences are also seen in the $L_{X}-\lambda$
relation and, to a lesser extent, in the $T_{X}-\lambda$ relation. Exclusion of
the emission from the cluster core does not make a significant impact to the
findings. A combination of selection biases is a likely, but as yet unproven,
reason for these differences. Finally, we have also used our data to probe
recent claims of anisotropy in the $L_{X}-T_{X}$ relation across the sky. We
find no evidence of anistropy, but stress that this may be masked in our
analysis by the incomplete declination coverage of the SDSS DR8 sample.

partially constrain the luminosity function from other galaxies similar to the

The reduced density matrix is characterized by the modular energy and modular

perturbatively in the spin 3 modular chemical potential, by computing the
corresponding connected correlation functions of the modular charge operator up

charged moments without using charged twist fields. Our result matches known

geometry-independent, but holds only for a small number of holes in an
otherwise filled band. The second phenomenon is a peculiar example where the
intuition fails that particles prefer to doubly occupy low-energy states before
filling higher-energy states. Lastly, we show a pattern of ferromagnetism which

correlating 15 catalogs of radio galaxies with the desired characteristics from
the literature with XMM Newton and Swift X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) source

for separation of populations and analogies with the XRB spectral state HID. We
find that (a) FR Is and IIs, (b) HERGs and LERGs, (c) FR I-LERGs and FR

susceptibilities are critical for both classical and quantum technologies.
Inversion symmetry, however, prevents nonlinear optical responses mediated by
even-order susceptibilities in several material systems pertinent for
applications in nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate induced nonlinear optical
processes, namely second- and fourth-harmonic generation that are naturally
forbidden in an inversion symmetric system, by strongly coupling to a photon
mode of a high-Q optical cavity. As an illustrative system with an inversion
symmetry, we consider a semiconductor quantum ring of GaAs that features a
single effective electron. For the coupled system, we control the inversion
symmetry breaking by changing the light-matter coupling strength which at the
same time allows to tune the nonlinear conversion efficiency. We find that the
harmonic generation yield can be significantly increased by increasing the
light-matter coupling strength in an experimentally feasible way. In the
few-photon limit where the incident pump field is a coherent state with just a
few photons, we find that the harmonic conversion efficiency is increased for
strong coupling as opposed to using intense pump fields. This new approach is
applicable to a wide variety of centrosymmetric systems as the symmetry
breaking rest on the properties of the photonic environment used to achieve
strong light-matter interaction. Our work constitutes a step forward in the
direction of realizing physically forbidden nonlinear optical processes in
centrosymmetric materials widely adopted for applications in integrated
photonics.

$M_d$, is regulated by the combination of SNII dust production, astration,
shock destruction, and ejection in outflows; grain growth (with a standard
timescale $\tau_0= 30$ Myr) plays a negligible role. The model predicts a
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $\sim 0.07-0.1\%$ and a UV-to-total star
formation rate relation such that $log (\psi_{\rm UV}) = -0.05 ~[log
(\psi)]^{2} + 0.86 ~log(\psi) -0.05$ (implying that 55-80\% of the star
formation is obscured) for REBELS galaxies with stellar mass $M_* = 10^{9-10}
M_\odot$. This relation reconciles the intrinsic UV luminosity of LBGs with
their observed luminosity function at $z=7$. However, 2 out of the 13 systems
show dust-to-stellar mass ratios ($\sim 0.94-1.1\%$) that are up to $18\times$
larger than expected from the fiducial relation. Due to the physical coupling
between dust and metal enrichment, even decreasing $\tau_0$ to very low values
(0.3 Myr) only increases the dust-to-stellar mass ratio by a factor $ \sim 2$.
Given that grain growth is not a viable explanation for such high observed
ratios of the dust-to-stellar mass, we propose alternative solutions.

winds driven by the hot companion star in the vicinity of the compact object is
fundamental to understand the jet dynamics, non-thermal emission and long-term
stability. However, the role of the jet magnetic field in this process is
unclear. We study the dynamical role of weak and moderate-to-strong toroidal
magnetic fields during the first hundreds of seconds of jet propagation,
focusing on the magnetized flow dynamics and the mechanisms of energy
conversion. We have developed the code L\'ostrego v1.0, a new 3D RMHD code to
simulate astrophysical plasmas in Cartesian coordinates. Using this tool, we
performed the first 3D RMHD numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized
jets propagating through the clumpy stellar wind in a HMXB. The overall
morphology and dynamics of weakly magnetized jet models is similar to previous
hydrodynamical simulations, where the jet head generates a strong shock in the
ambient medium and the initial over-pressure with respect to the stellar wind
drives one or more recollimation shocks. In the time scales of our simulations,
these jets are ballistic and seem to be more stable against internal
instabilities than jets with the same power in the absence of fields. However,
moderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic fields favour the development of
current-driven instabilities and the disruption of the jet within the binary. A
detailed analysis of the energy distribution in the relativistic outflow and
the ambient medium reveals that both magnetic and internal energies can
contribute to the effective acceleration of the jet. We certify that the jet
feedback into the ambient medium is highly dependent on the jet energy
distribution at injection, where hotter, more dilute and/or more magnetized
jets are more efficient, as anticipated by feedback studies in the case of jets
in active galaxies.

performance of a variety of physics analyses, including sensitivities to
diffuse fluxes of neutrinos and sensitivity to both transient and steady state
point sources. This parameterized approach reduces the need for extensive
simulation studies in order to estimate detector performance, and allows the
user to study the influence of single performance metrics, like the angular

obtained freely from object-centric images, according to two insights: (i) an
object-centric image usually contains one salient object in a simple
background; (ii) objects from the same class often share similar appearances or
similar contrasts to the background. Motivated by these insights, we propose a
simple and scalable framework FreeSeg for extracting and leveraging these

instance segmentation. Concretely, we investigate the similarity among
object-centric images of the same class to propose candidate segments of
foreground instances, followed by a novel ranking of segment quality. The
resulting high-quality object segments can then be used to augment the existing
long-tailed datasets, e.g., by copying and pasting the segments onto the

substantial improvements on top of strong baselines and achieves

non-inertial flow in viscous liquids has been a guiding principle in decades of
research. However, this duality is broken whenever the Gaussian curvature of
viscous films evolves rapidly in time. In such a case the film evolves through
a non-inertial yet geometrically nonlinear surface dynamics, which has remained
largely unexplored. We reveal the driver of such dynamics as the flow of
currents of Gaussian curvature of the evolving surface, rather than the
existence of an energetically favored target metric, as in the elastic
analogue. Focusing on the prototypical example of a bubble collapsing after
rapid depressurization, we show that the spherically-shaped viscous film
evolves via a topological instability, whose elastic analogue is forbidden by
the existence of an energy barrier. The topological transition brings about
compression within the film, triggering another, symmetry breaking instability
and radial wrinkles that grow in amplitude and invade the flattening film.
Building on an analogy between surface currents of Gaussian curvature and
polarization in electrostatic conductors, we obtain quantitative predictions
for the evolution of the flattening film. We propose that this classical
dynamics has ramifications in the emerging field of viscous hydrodynamics of
strongly correlated electrons in two-dimensional materials.

PARSEC isochrones to the color-magnitude diagrams based on the most likely
member stars. Isochrone fitting distances are $1289 \pm 47$ pc and $1716 \pm

where the aim is to assign labels to sets or bags of instances, as opposed to
traditional supervised learning where each instance is assumed to be

in the MIL setting. Instead of focusing on each instance, these models are
trained in an end-to-end fashion to learn effective bag-level representations
by suitably combining permutation invariant pooling techniques with neural

bags using a graph and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate
end-to-end learning. Since a meaningful graph representing dependencies between
bags is rarely available, we propose to use a Bayesian GNN framework that can
generate a likely graph structure for scenarios where there is uncertainty in
the graph or when no graph is available. Empirical results demonstrate the

While much work has progressed in providing energy-efficient and user comfort

is an aspect that has received lesser attention despite its importance. With a
motivation to monitor airflow from building ventilation systems through
commodity sensing devices, we present FlowSense, a machine learning-based
algorithm to predict airflow rate from sensed audio data in indoor spaces. Our
ML technique can predict the state of an air vent-whether it is on or off-as
well as the rate of air flowing through active vents. By exploiting a low-pass
filter to obtain low-frequency audio signals, we put together a
privacy-preserving pipeline that leverages a silence detection algorithm to
only sense for sounds of air from HVAC air vent when no human speech is
detected. We also propose the Minimum Persistent Sensing (MPS) as a
post-processing algorithm to reduce interference from ambient noise, including
ongoing human conversation, office machines, and traffic noises. Together,
these techniques ensure user privacy and improve the robustness of FlowSense.
We validate our approach yielding over 90% accuracy in predicting vent status
and 0.96 MSE in predicting airflow rate when the device is placed within 2.25
meters away from an air vent. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach as
a mobile audio-sensing platform is robust to smartphone models, distance, and

desired task. Prior research on assistive teleoperation and shared autonomy
explores how robots can determine the desired task based on the human's
joystick inputs. In order to perform this inference the robot relies on an
internal mapping between joystick inputs and discrete tasks: e.g., pressing the
joystick left indicates that the human wants a plate, while pressing the
joystick right indicates a cup. This approach works well after the human
understands how the robot interprets their inputs -- but inexperienced users
still have to learn these mappings through trial and error! Here we recognize
that the robot's mapping between tasks and inputs is a convention. There are
multiple, equally efficient conventions that the robot could use: rather than
passively waiting for the human, we introduce a shared autonomy approach where
the robot actively reveals its chosen convention. Across repeated interactions
the robot intervenes and exaggerates the arm's motion to demonstrate more
efficient inputs while also assisting for the current task. We compare this
approach to a state-of-the-art baseline -- where users must identify the
convention by themselves -- as well as written instructions. Our user study
results indicate that modifying the robot's behavior to reveal its convention
outperforms the baselines and reduces the amount of time that humans spend
controlling the robot. See videos of our user study here:

LLVM-based C++ compiler toolchain to efficiently execute variational hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms on a computational system in which the quantum
device acts as an accelerator. We introduce a set of extensions to the C++
language for programming these algorithms. We define a novel Executable and
Linking Format (ELF) for Quantum and create a quantum device compiler component
in the LLVM framework to compile the quantum part of the C++ source and reuse
the host compiler in the LLVM framework to compile the classical computing part
of the C++ source. A variational algorithm runs a quantum circuit repeatedly,
each time with different gate parameters. We add to the quantum runtime the
capability to execute dynamically a quantum circuit with different parameters.
Thus, programmers can call quantum routines the same way as classical routines.
With these capabilities, a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm can
be specified in a single-source code and only needs to be compiled once for all
iterations. The single compilation significantly reduces the execution latency
of variational algorithms. We evaluate the framework's performance by running
quantum circuits that prepare Thermofield Double (TFD) states, a
quantum-classical variational algorithm.

classification using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data,
producing important biomarkers. More recently, data pooling has flourished,
making the result generalizable across a large population. But, this success
depends on the population diversity and variability introduced due to the
pooling of the data that is not a primary research interest. Here, we look at
hierarchical Sparse Connectivity Patterns (hSCPs) as biomarkers for major
depressive disorder (MDD). We propose a novel model based on hSCPs to predict
MDD patients from functional connectivity matrices extracted from resting-state
fMRI data. Our model consists of three coupled terms. The first term decomposes
connectivity matrices into hierarchical low-rank sparse components
corresponding to synchronous patterns across the human brain. These components
are then combined via patient-specific weights capturing heterogeneity in the
data. The second term is a classification loss that uses the patient-specific
weights to classify MDD patients from healthy ones. Both of these terms are
combined with the third term, a robustness loss function to improve the
reproducibility of hSCPs. This reduces the variability introduced due to site
and population diversity (age and sex) on the predictive accuracy and pattern
stability in a large dataset pooled from five different sites. Our results show
the impact of diversity on prediction performance. Our model can reduce
diversity and improve the predictive and generalizing capability of the
components. Finally, our results show that our proposed model can robustly
identify clinically relevant patterns characteristic of MDD with high
reproducibility.

non-trivial representation as a $2N-2$ dimensional submanifold of $S^{N^2-2}$
(a generalization of the Bloch sphere for qudits). The argument of the weak
value of a projector on a pure state of an $N$-level quantum system describes a
geometric phase associated to the symplectic area of the geodesic triangle
spanned by the vectors representing the pre-selected state, the projector and
the post-selected state in $\mathbb{C}\textrm{P}^{N-1}$. We then proceed to
show that the argument of the weak value of a general observable is equivalent

related to travel behaviour may influence the uptake of active commuting
interventions but are rarely considered in their design and evaluation. In this
study we develop an agent-based model that incorporates social norms related to
travel behaviour and demonstrate the utility of this through implementing
car-free Wednesdays. A synthetic population of Waltham Forest, London, UK was
generated using a microsimulation approach with data from the UK Census 2011

population which modelled how the actions of peers and neighbours, subculture,
habit, weather, bicycle ownership, car ownership, environmental supportiveness,
and congestion affect the decision to trave. The developed model (MOTIVATE) is
a configurable agent-based model where social norms related to travel behaviour
are used to provide a more realistic representation of the socio-ecological
systems in which active commuting interventions may be deployed. The utility of
this model is demonstrated using car-free days as a hypothetical intervention.

the two-sphere. By the seminal work [53] of Rapha\""el and Rodnianski, there is
an open set of initial data whose forward-in-time development blows up in
finite time with the blow-up rate
$\lambda(t)=(T-t)e^{-\sqrt{|\log(T-t)|}+O(1)}$. In this paper, we show that
this $e^{O(1)}$-factor in fact converges to the universal constant $2e^{-1}$,
and hence these solutions contract at the universal rate
$\lambda(t)=2e^{-1}(T-t)e^{-\sqrt{|\log(T-t)|}}(1+o_{t\to T}(1))$. Our proof is
inspired by recent works on type-II blow-up dynamics for parabolic equations.
The key improvement is in the construction of an explicit invariant subspace
decomposition for the linearized operator perturbed by the scaling generator in
the dispersive case, from which we obtain a more precise ODE system determining
$\lambda(t)$.

(XRB), in particular for Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that are mainly
detected in the X-ray band. For most ULXs the nature of the accretor is
unknown, although a few ULXs have been confirmed to be accreting at
super-Eddington rates onto a neutron star (NS). Monitoring these sources is
particularly useful both to detect transients and to derive periodicities,
linked to orbital and super-orbital modulations. Here we present the results of
our monitoring campaign of the galaxy NGC 925, performed with the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory. We also include archival and literature data obtained with
Chandra, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We have studied spectra, light-curves and
variability properties on days to months time-scales. All the three ULXs
detected in this galaxy show flux variability. ULX-1 is one of the most
luminous ULXs known, since only 10% of the ULXs exceed a luminosity of
$\sim$5$\times$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but despite its high flux variability we
found only weak spectral variability. We classify it as in a hard ultraluminous
regime of super-Eddington accretion. ULX-2 and ULX-3 are less luminous but also
variable in flux and possibly also in spectral shape. We classify them as in
between the hard and the soft ultraluminous regimes. ULX-3 is a transient
source: by applying a Lomb-Scargle algorithm we derive a periodicity of $\sim$
126 d, which could be associated with an orbital or super-orbital origin.

query, is it possible to provide a simple and generic ""representative"" instance
that (1) illustrates how the query can be satisfied, (2) summarizes all
specific instances that would satisfy the query in the same way by abstracting
away unnecessary details? Furthermore, is it possible to find a collection of
such representative instances that together completely characterize all
possible ways in which the query can be satisfied? This paper takes initial
steps towards answering these questions. We design what these representative
instances look like, define what they stand for, and formalize what it means
for them to satisfy a query in ""all possible ways."" We argue that this problem
is undecidable for general domain relational calculus queries, and develop
practical algorithms for computing a minimum collection of such instances

measurement of its average soft gamma-ray spectrum by Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory. We found that this rate approximately equals the flow rate of the

calculated using the extended jet model following Blandford \& Konigl. This
coincidence shows the jet composition is likely to be pair-dominated. We then
calculated the jet power in the bulk motion of ions, and found it greatly
exceeds that achievable by the magnetically arrested disk scenario for the
maximum black hole spin unless the jet contains mostly pairs. Next, we found
that the magnetic flux through the synchrotron-emitting jet equals the maximum
poloidal flux that can thread the black hole. Finally, we compared two
estimates of the magnetization parameter at the onset of the synchrotron
emission and found they are in agreement only if pairs dominate the jet
content.

changes for given pixels with microsecond resolution. The present work explores
the possibilities of harnessing the potentials of event-based vision for fluid
flow measurement. The described implementations of event-based imaging
velocimetry (EBIV) rely on the imaging small particles that are illuminated by
a laser light sheet which is similar to classical two-dimensional,
two-component (2d-2c) PIV with the difference that a continuously operating
laser-light sheet is used without modulation of the laser or camera. The moving
particles generate continuous time-stamped events on the detector that are
later used to infer their velocity using patch-wise processing schemes. Two
flow estimation algorithms are proposed; one uses a ""motion compensation"" that
maximizes the local contrast, the other is based on a sum-of-correlations
approach. The underlying motion detection schemes along with the complete
absence of background signal allows straightforward retrieval of the events
associated with individual particles thereby allowing the reconstruction of
individual particle tracks. Alternatively, the event data can be processed with
conventional PIV algorithms using images reconstructed from the event data
stream. The concepts are demonstrated on simple flows in water and air.

work has provided strong evidence for bistable behavior of the tna operon. The

nanometers. By employing fluorescence techniques, modern microscopic methods
can resolve point scatterers separated much lower than the Rayleigh limit.
Localization-based fluorescence subwavelength imaging techniques such as PALM
and STORM can achieve a spatial resolution of several tens of nanometers.
However, these techniques have limited temporal resolution as they require tens
of thousands of exposures. Employing sparsity-based models and recovery
algorithms is a natural way to reduce the number of exposures and hence obtain
high temporal resolution. Recently, a new multi-illumination imaging technique
called Brownian Excitation Amplitude Modulation microscopy (BEAM) is
introduced. BEAM achieves a threefold resolution improvement by applying a
compressive sensing recovery algorithm over only few frames. Motivated by BEAM,
our aim in this paper is to pioneer the mathematical foundation for
sparsity-based multi-illumination super-resolution. We consider several
diffraction-limited images from samples exposed to different illumination
patterns and recover the source by considering the sparsest solution. We
estimate the minimum separation distance between point scatterers so that they
could be stably recovered. By this estimation, we reveal the dependence of the
resolution on the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, the SNR, the
sparsity of point scatterers, and the incoherence of illumination patterns. Our
theory particularly highlights the importance of the high incoherence of
illumination patterns in enhancing the resolution. It also demonstrates that
super-resolution can be achieved using sparsity-based multi-illumination
imaging with very few frames, whereby the spatio-temporal super-resolution
becomes possible.

learning. However, not much is known about their impact on unsupervised
contrastive learning (CL). This paper is the first to consider indiscriminate
poisoning attacks of contrastive learning. We propose Contrastive Poisoning
(CP), the first effective such attack on CL. We empirically show that
Contrastive Poisoning, not only drastically reduces the performance of CL
algorithms, but also attacks supervised learning models, making it the most
generalizable indiscriminate poisoning attack. We also show that CL algorithms
with a momentum encoder are more robust to indiscriminate poisoning, and
propose a new countermeasure based on matrix completion. Code is available at:

counting under continual observation. Our main insight is that the matrix
mechanism when using lower-triangular matrices can be used in the continual
observation model. More specifically, we give an explicit factorization for the
counting matrix $M_\mathsf{count}$ and upper bound the error explicitly. We
also give a fine-grained analysis, specifying the exact constant in the upper
bound. Our analysis is based on upper and lower bounds of the {\em completely
bounded norm} (cb-norm) of $M_\mathsf{count}$. Along the way, we improve the
best-known bound of 28 years by Mathias (SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and
Applications, 1993) on the cb-norm of $M_\mathsf{count}$ for a large range of
the dimension of $M_\mathsf{count}$. Furthermore, we are the first to give
concrete error bounds for various problems under continual observation such as
binary counting, maintaining a histogram, releasing an approximately
cut-preserving synthetic graph, many graph-based statistics, and substring and
episode counting. Finally, we note that our result can be used to get a
fine-grained error bound for non-interactive local learning {and the first
lower bounds on the additive error for
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially-private counting under continual
observation.} Subsequent to this work, Henzinger et al. (SODA2023) showed that
our factorization also achieves fine-grained mean-squared error.

particles suspended in flow through curved microfluidic ducts. Previous
modelling of particle migration in curved ducts assumed the flow rate was small
enough that a leading order approximation of the background flow with respect
to the Dean number produces a reasonable model. Herein, we extend our model to
situations having a moderate Dean number (in the microfluidics context) while
the particle Reynolds number remains small. This extension allows us to capture
changes in the background flow that occur with increasing flow rate, namely a
shift in local extrema towards the outside wall. The change in the axial
velocity profile of the background flow has an effect on the inertial lift
force, while the change in the cross-sectional components directly affects the
secondary flow drag. In keeping the particle Reynolds number small we
approximate the inertial lift force in a similar manner to previous studies
while capturing subtle effects do to the modified background flow profile.
Capturing and understanding these effects is an important step towards
accurately modelling inertial migration across a wide range of practical
applications. Our results reveal how the changing background flow profile
modifies the inertial focusing of particles. We illustrate enhanced lateral
separation of particles by size in a number of scenarios and find that focusing
times can be roughly separated into two regimes. These results suggest our
model might aid with parameter choices for separation of particles by size.

correlations between their observed and physical properties. Our analysis shows
that explosion energy is the physical property that correlates with the highest
number of parameters. We recover previously suggested relationships between the
hydrogen-rich envelope mass and the plateau duration, and find that more
luminous SNe II with higher expansion velocities, faster declining light
curves, and higher Ni masses are consistent with higher energy explosions. In
addition, faster declining SNe II are also compatible with more concentrated Ni
in the inner regions of the ejecta. Positive trends are found between the
initial mass, explosion energy, and Ni mass. While the explosion energy spans
the full range explored with our models, the initial mass generally arises from
a relatively narrow range. Observable properties were measured from our grid of
models to determine the effect of each physical parameter on the observed SN II
diversity. We argue that explosion energy is the physical parameter causing the
greatest impact on SN II diversity, when assuming standard single-star
evolution as in the models used in this study. The inclusion of pre-SN models
assuming higher mass loss produces a significant increase in the strength of
some correlations, particularly those between the progenitor hydrogen-rich
envelope mass and the plateau and optically thick phase durations. These
differences clearly show the impact of having different treatments of stellar
evolution, implying that changes in the assumption of standard single-star
evolution are necessary for a complete understanding of SN II diversity.

vanilla neural networks. Deep Neural networks (DNNs) tend to generate
over-confident predictions when presented with inputs that are significantly
out-of-distribution (OOD). This can be dangerous when employing machine
learning systems in the wild as detecting attacks can thus be difficult. Recent
advances inference-time out-of-distribution detection help mitigate some of
these problems. However, existing methods can be restrictive as they are often
computationally expensive. Additionally, these methods require training of a
downstream detector model which learns to detect OOD inputs from
in-distribution ones. This, therefore, adds latency during inference. Here, we
offer an information theoretic perspective on why neural networks are
inherently incapable of OOD detection. We attempt to mitigate these flaws by
converting a trained model into a an OOD detector using a handful of steps of
gradient descent. Our work can be employed as a post-processing method whereby
an inference-time ML system can convert a trained model into an OOD detector.
Experimentally, we show how our method consistently outperforms the

reducing computational complexity.

fluid-structure interaction of a freely vibrating hydrofoil section at high
Reynolds numbers. We consider an elastically-mounted NACA66 hydrofoil section
that is free to vibrate in the transverse flow direction. Cavitating flow
dynamics coupled with the transverse vibration are studied at low angles of
attack. For the numerical study, we employ a recently developed unified
variational fluid-structure interaction framework based on homogeneous
mixture-based cavitation with hybrid URANS-LES turbulence modeling. We first
validate the numerical implementation against experimental data for turbulent
cavitating flow. For freely oscillating hydrofoil, we observe large-amplitude
vibrations during unsteady partial cavitating conditions that are absent in the
non-cavitating flow. We identify a frequency lock-in phenomenon as the main
source of sustained large-amplitude vibration whereby the unsteady lift forces
lock into a sub-harmonic of the hydrofoil natural frequency. During cavity
collapse and shedding, we find a periodic generation of clockwise vorticity,
leading to unsteady lift generation. We determine the origin of this flow
unsteadiness near the trailing edge of the hydrofoil via the interplay between
the growing cavity and adverse pressure gradient. The flow-induced structural
vibration is observed to have a consequent impact on the cavity dynamics. In
the frequency lock-in regime, large coherent cavitating structures are seen
over the hydrofoil suction surface undergoing a full cavity
growth-detachment-collapse cycle. For the post-lock-in regime, cavity length is
shorter and the attached cavity is observed to undergo high frequency spatially
localized oscillations. In this regime, cavity shedding is primarily limited to
the cavity trailing end and frequency of a complete cavity detachment and
shedding event is reduced.

MPC. Hierarchical coordination is achieved using adjustable tubes, which are
optimized by the upper-level controller and bound permissible lower-level

upper-level controller. The size of these adjustable tubes determines the
degree of uncertainty between subsystems and directly affects the required
constraint tightening under a tube-based robust MPC framework. Sets are

However, mainstream existing DCNN fusion schemes conduct fusion by directly

critical depinning threshold the soliton moves with a skyrmion Hall angle of
zero. For higher drives, the entire chain depins, and in a 2D system we observe
that both the solitons and chain move at zero skyrmion Hall angle and then
transition to a finite skyrmion Hall angle as the drive increases. In a 2D

can be a reversal of the sign of the skyrmion Hall angle from positive to
negative. Our results suggest that solitons in skyrmion systems could be used

models for the latest trend in serverless computing platforms that use
concurrency value and the rate of requests per second for autoscaling

Abstract shortened to fit arXiv requirements",,,,"cs.CC cs.CG cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The main theme of this paper is using $k$-dimensional generalizations of the
combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) hypothesis and the
closely-related Online Matrix Vector Multiplication (OMv) hypothesis to prove
new tight conditional lower bounds for dynamic problems.
  The combinatorial $k$-Clique hypothesis, which is a standard hypothesis in
the literature, naturally generalizes the combinatorial BMM hypothesis. In this
paper, we prove tight lower bounds for several dynamic problems under the
combinatorial $k$-Clique hypothesis. For instance, we show that:
  * The Dynamic Range Mode problem has no combinatorial algorithms with
$\mathrm{poly}(n)$ pre-processing time, $O(n^{2/3-\epsilon})$ update time and
$O(n^{2/3-\epsilon})$ query time for any $\epsilon > 0$, matching the known
upper bounds for this problem. Previous lower bounds only ruled out algorithms
with $O(n^{1/2-\epsilon})$ update and query time under the OMv hypothesis.
  Other examples include tight combinatorial lower bounds for Dynamic Subgraph
Connectivity, Dynamic 2D Orthogonal Range Color Counting, Dynamic 2-Pattern
Document Retrieval, and Dynamic Range Mode in higher dimensions.
  Furthermore, we propose the OuMv$_k$ hypothesis as a natural generalization
of the OMv hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, we prove tight lower bounds for
various dynamic problems. For instance, we show that:
  * The Dynamic Skyline Points Counting problem in $(2k-1)$-dimensional space
has no algorithm with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ pre-processing time and
$O(n^{1-1/k-\epsilon})$ update and query time for $\epsilon > 0$, even if the
updates are semi-online.
  Other examples include tight conditional lower bounds for (semi-online)
Dynamic Klee's measure for unit cubes, and high-dimensional generalizations of
Erickson's problem and Langerman's problem.

they guarantee asymptotically exact expectations in the infinite-time limit. In
finite time, though, slow mixing often leads to poor performance. Modern
computing environments offer massive parallelism, but naive implementations of
parallel MCMC can exhibit substantial bias. In MCMC samplers of continuous
random variables, Markov chain couplings can overcome bias. But these
approaches depend crucially on paired chains meetings after a small number of
transitions. We show that straightforward applications of existing coupling
ideas to discrete clustering variables fail to meet quickly. This failure
arises from the ""label-switching problem"": semantically equivalent cluster
relabelings impede fast meeting of coupled chains. We instead consider chains
as exploring the space of partitions rather than partitions' (arbitrary)
labelings. Using a metric on the partition space, we formulate a practical
algorithm using optimal transport couplings. Our theory confirms our method is
accurate and efficient. In experiments ranging from clustering of genes or
seeds to graph colorings, we show the benefits of our coupling in the highly

construct a Lorentzian metric on M that depends upon phi. I refer to a field
theory based upon a manifold with such a Lorentzian structure as a
scalar-scalar field theory. We shall study such a field theory when f is chosen
so that the resultant metric on M has the form of a
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, and the Lagrangian has a
particularly simple form. It will be shown that the scalar-scalar theory
determined by this Lagrangian can generate self-inflating universes, which can
be pieced together to form multiverses with non-Hausdorff topologies, in which
the global time function multifurcates at t=0. Some of the universes in these
multiverses begin explosively, and then settle down to a period of much quieter
accelerated expansion, which can be followed by a collapse to its original
pre-expansion state. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how
probabilities can be assigned to the various universes of a multiverse. This is
accomplished by using the action of the universes, with universes having action
closer to zero being more likely than universes with large positive values for
their action. In order to assure that universe models similar to our own
universe are likely to exist I found it necessary to introduce a second scalar
field on M, and to modify the original Lagrangian. In the end my theory has
three scalar fields, two on the manifold M and one on the cotangent bundle of
M.

in the absence of magnetic field. By further imposing moderate magnetic field,
the skyrmion phase can be obtained and is stable within a wide temperature
range. Particularly for single-layer CrInTe3, the size of skyrmions is sub-10

planning, as well as an end-to-end learning problem. However, long-range
navigation requires both planning and reasoning about local traversability, as
well as being able to utilize general knowledge about global geography, in the
form of a roadmap, GPS, or other side information providing important cues. In
this work, we propose an approach that integrates learning and planning, and
can utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and GPS
coordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate.
Our method, ViKiNG, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at
the robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how
easily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks
at overhead maps for hints and attempts to evaluate the appropriateness of
these subgoals in order to reach the goal. These models are used by a heuristic
planner to identify the best waypoint in order to reach the final destination.
Our method performs no explicit geometric reconstruction, utilizing only a
topological representation of the environment. Despite having never seen
trajectories longer than 80 meters in its training dataset, ViKiNG can leverage
its image-based learned controller and goal-directed heuristic to navigate to
goals up to 3 kilometers away in previously unseen environments, and exhibit
complex behaviors such as probing potential paths and backtracking when they
are found to be non-viable. ViKiNG is also robust to unreliable maps and GPS,
since the low-level controller ultimately makes decisions based on egocentric
image observations, using maps only as planning heuristics. For videos of our

hydrological and ecological phenomena. Soil water dynamics is described by
well-established physical laws (Richardson-Richards equation (RRE)). Solving
the RRE is difficult due to the inherent non-linearity of the processes, and
various numerical methods have been proposed to solve the issue. However,
applying the methods to practical situations is challenging because they
require well-defined initial and boundary conditions. Here, we present a
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) method that approximates the solution
to the RRE using neural networks while concurrently matching available soil
moisture data. Although the ability of PINNs to solve partial differential
equations, including the RRE, has been demonstrated previously, its potential
applications and limitations are not fully known. This study conducted a
comprehensive analysis of PINNs and carefully tested the accuracy of the
solutions by comparing them with analytical solutions and accepted traditional
numerical solutions. We demonstrated that the solutions by PINNs with adaptive
activation functions are comparable with those by traditional methods. We
showed that soil moisture dynamics in layered soils with discontinuous
hydraulic conductivities are correctly simulated by PINNs with domain
decomposition. We demonstrated that the unspecified upper boundary condition
can be estimated from sparse soil moisture measurements. Nevertheless, there
remain challenges that require further development. Chiefly, PINNs are
sensitive to the initialization of NNs and are significantly slower than
traditional numerical methods.

The lower and upper bounds together characterize the minimum threshold

deals with the block-structured dense and Toeplitz-like-plus-Cross systems,
including {\em nonsymmetric} indefinite, symmetric positive definite (SPD),
arising from nonlocal diffusion problem and peridynamic problem. The simple
(traditional) restriction operator and prolongation operator are employed in
order to handle such block-structured dense and Toeplitz-like-plus-Cross
systems, which is convenient and efficient when employing a fast AMG. We focus
our efforts on providing the detailed proof of the convergence of the two-grid
method for such SPD situations. The numerical experiments are performed in
order to verify the convergence with a computational cost of only
$\mathcal{O}(N \mbox{log} N)$ arithmetic operations, by using few fast Fourier
transforms, where $N$ is the number of the grid points. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first contribution regarding Toeplitz-like-plus-Cross
linear systems solved by means of a fast AMG.

A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was used to develop a CAE parts classifier.
As many as 866 distinct parts from a representative body model were used as

Element Analysis (FEA) mesh with values of each node in the x, y, z coordinate
system. The GCN based classifier was compared to fully connected neural network

a test set that included parts from the training data, but with additional
holes, rotation, translation, mesh refinement/coarsening, variation of mesh

change in mesh node ordering. The trained GCN model was able to achieve 88.5%

the baseline part. A CAE parts classifier demonstrated in this study could be
very useful for engineers to filter through CAE parts spread across several

unsatisfied registration precision in the partially overlapping problem due to
the lack of effective inlier evaluation. In this paper, we propose a
neighborhood consensus based reliable inlier evaluation method for robust
unsupervised point cloud registration. It is expected to capture the
discriminative geometric difference between the source neighborhood and the
corresponding pseudo target neighborhood for effective inlier distinction.
Specifically, our model consists of a matching map refinement module and an
inlier evaluation module. In our matching map refinement module, we improve the
point-wise matching map estimation by integrating the matching scores of
neighbors into it. The aggregated neighborhood information potentially
facilitates the discriminative map construction so that high-quality
correspondences can be provided for generating the pseudo target point cloud.
Based on the observation that the outlier has the significant structure-wise
difference between its source neighborhood and corresponding pseudo target
neighborhood while this difference for inlier is small, the inlier evaluation
module exploits this difference to score the inlier confidence for each
estimated correspondence. In particular, we construct an effective graph
representation for capturing this geometric difference between the
neighborhoods. Finally, with the learned correspondences and the corresponding
inlier confidence, we use the weighted SVD algorithm for transformation
estimation. Under the unsupervised setting, we exploit the Huber function based
global alignment loss, the local neighborhood consensus loss, and spatial
consistency loss for model optimization. The experimental results on extensive
datasets demonstrate that our unsupervised point cloud registration method can
yield comparable performance.

sequential multi-tasks with the aim of avoiding catastrophic forgetting issue,
which equally poses as a major challenge in multimode dynamic process

this mode can be identified by PSFA and prior knowledge. Then, a regularization

proposed method is denoted as PSFA-EWC, which is updated continually and
capable of achieving excellent performance for successive modes. Different from
traditional multimode monitoring algorithms, PSFA-EWC furnishes backward and

retained while consolidating new information, which may contribute to learning
new relevant modes. Compared with several known methods, the effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated via a continuous stirred tank heater and a

implementing CQSP, with depth $O\left(n+k+\frac{2^{n+k}}{n+k+m}\right)$ and
size $O\left(2^{n+k}\right)$ for any given number $m$ of ancillary qubits.
These bounds, which can also be viewed as a time-space tradeoff for the
transformation, are \optimal for any integer parameters $m,k\ge 0$ and $n\ge
1$. When $k=0$, the problem becomes the canonical quantum state preparation
(QSP) problem with ancillary qubits, which asks for efficient implementations
of the transformation $|0^n\rangle|0^m\rangle \to |\psi\rangle |0^m\rangle$.
This problem has many applications with many investigations, yet its circuit
complexity remains open. Our construction completely solves this problem,
pinning down its depth complexity to $\Theta(n+2^{n}/(n+m))$ and its size
complexity to $\Theta(2^{n})$ for any $m$. Another fundamental problem, unitary
synthesis, asks to implement a general $n$-qubit unitary by a quantum circuit.
Previous work shows a lower bound of $\Omega(n+4^n/(n+m))$ and an upper bound
of $O(n2^n)$ for $m=\Omega(2^n/n)$ ancillary qubits. In this paper, we
quadratically shrink this gap by presenting a quantum circuit of the depth of

and 0.2 km/s, respectively. Several tens of dendrogram structures have been
extracted in the position-position-velocity space of H13CO+, which include 21
small-scale leaves and 20 larger-scale branches. Overall, their gas motions are
supersonic but they exhibit the interesting behavior where leaves tend to be
less dynamically supersonic than the branches. For the larger-scale, branch
structures, the observed velocity-size relation (i.e., velocity
variation/dispersion versus size) are seen to follow the Larson scaling
exponent while the smaller-scale, leaf structures show a systematic deviation
and display a steeper slope. We argue that the origin of the observed
kinematics of the branch structures is likely to be a combination of turbulence
and gravity-driven ordered gas flows. In comparison, gravity-driven chaotic gas
motion is likely at the level of small-scale leaf structures. The results
presented in our previous paper and this current follow-up study suggest that
the main driving mechanism for mass accretion/inflow observed in G34 varies at
different spatial scales. We therefore conclude that a scale-dependent combined
effect of turbulence and gravity is essential to explain the star-formation

practice to reduce dimension. However, convergence properties of the
corresponding ODE are still unknown, including global convergence, stable

gradient ascent (SGA) method proposed by Oja. By regarding the corresponding
ODE as a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation on the Stiefel manifold, we
proved global convergence of the ODE. Moreover, we developed a new technique to
determine stable manifolds. This technique analyzes the rank of the initial
datum. Using this technique, we derived the explicit expression of the stable
manifolds. As a consequence, exponential convergence to stable equilibrium
points was also proved. The success of this new technique should be attributed
to the semi-decoupling property of the SGA method: iteration of previous
components does not depend on that of later ones. As far as we know, our result
is the first complete one on the convergence of an online PCA flow, providing
global convergence, explicit characterization of stable manifolds, and closed
formula of exponential convergence depending on the spectrum gap.

information devices, experience performance limiting noise from materials. In
particular, 1/f (frequency) noise can be a dominant noise mechanism, which
arises from Two-Level System defects (TLSs) in the circuit dielectrics and
material interfaces. Here we present a Dual-Resonator KID (DuRKID), which is
designed for improved signal to noise (or noise equivalent power) relative to
1/f-noise limited KIDs. We first show the DuRKID schematic, fabricated circuit,
and we follow with a description of the intended operation, first measurements,
theory, and discussion. The circuit consists of two superconducting resonators
sharing an electrical capacitance bridge of 4 capacitors, each of which hosts
TLSs. The device is intended to operate using hybridization of the modes, which
causes TLSs to either couple to one mode or the other, depending upon which
capacitor they reside in. In contrast, the intended KID signal is directed to
an inductor, and due to hybridization this causes correlated frequency changes
in both (hybridized) modes. Therefore, one can distinguish photon signal from
TLS frequency noise. To achieve hybridization, a TiN inductor is current biased
to allow tuning of one bare resonator mode into degeneracy with the other and
measurements show that the intended resonator modes frequency tune and
hybridize as expected. The interresonator coupling and unintentional coupling
of the 2 resonators to transmission lines are also characterized in
measurements. In the theory, based on a quantum-information-science modes, we
calculate the 4-port S parameters and simulate the 1/f frequency noise of the
device. The study reveals that the DuRKID can exhibit a large and fundamental
performance advantage over 1/f-noise-limited KID detectors.

previous efforts for quantitative characterization of SLAM datasets. Then, the
problem of perturbation characterization is discussed and the linkage to SLAM

understanding mysterious quantum features such as self-interference of a single

Here, a coherence version of the nonlocal correlation is presented using the
wave nature of photons in space-like separated orthogonally polarized NMZIs.
For this, polarization-basis projections of the pair of NMZI output photons
onto a set of polarizers are measured coincidently, where each output photon
comprises orthogonal polarization bases. Because of the coherence feature of
the output photons via coincidence detection, a phase sensitive nonlocal

two techniques that alleviate distribution mismatch are proposed. Furthermore,
another novel RLfD algorithm based on the MP-DDPG, called Self-Guided

black string from a dust cloud. We analytically obtain two distinct classes of
exact solutions with arbitrary functions responsible for mass distributions of
the dust cloud. The first and second kinds of solutions may describe collapsing
dusts but the first kind is only for inhomogeneous dust distribution while the
second kind has a homogeneous limit. The finite collapse time and the Israel
junction conditions tell us that the first kind solution describes a desired
collapsing phenomenon, whereas the scale factor in the inner spacetime for the
second kind turns out to be trivial. In the first kind solution, specific
collapsing models can be realized by choosing an appropriate inhomogeneous dust
distribution consistent with the Israel junction conditions. Consequently, the
inhomogeneous dust cloud eventually collapses to the black string although the
homogeneous dust cloud does not guarantee the formation of the black string in

the manipulator, in order to plan feasible trajectories that it will be able to
execute in the environment. The latter is based on the interior of a vehicle,
containing a person (which would be the user in this case) for which the
configuration will also be made to be taken into account in the system. To do
this, we first investigated the software's capabilities and options for path
planning, as well as the different ways to execute the movements. We also
compared the different trajectory planning algorithms that the software is
capable of using in order to determine which one is best suited for the task.
Finally, we proposed different mobility schemes to be executed by the robot
depending on the situation it is facing. The first one is used when the robot
has to plan trajectories in a safe space, where the only obstacle to avoid is
the user's workspace. The second one is used when the robot has to interact
with the user, where a dummy model represents the user's position as a function
of time, which is the one to be avoided.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) prevent spoofing by simulation,
i.e., the generation of forged satellite signals based on public information.
However, authentication does not prevent record-and-replay attacks, commonly
termed as meaconing. These attacks are less powerful in terms of adversarial
control over the victim receiver location and time, but by acting at the signal
level, they are not thwarted by NMA. This makes replaying/relaying attacks a
significant threat for GNSS. While there are numerous investigations on
meaconing, the majority does not rely on actual implementation and experimental
evaluation in real-world settings. In this work, we contribute to the
improvement of the experimental understanding of meaconing attacks. We design
and implement a system capable of real-time, distributed, and mobile meaconing,
built with off-the-shelf hardware. We extend from basic distributed attacks,
with signals from different locations relayed over the Internet and replayed
within range of the victim receiver(s): this has high bandwidth requirements
and thus depends on the quality of service of the available network to work. To
overcome this limitation, we propose to replay on message level, including the
authentication part of the payload. The resultant reduced bandwidth enables the
attacker to operate in mobile scenarios, as well as to replay signals from
multiple GNSS constellations and/or bands simultaneously. Additionally, the
attacker can delay individually selected satellite signals to potentially
influence the victim position and time solution in a more fine-grained manner.
Our versatile test-bench, enabling different types of replaying/relaying
attacks, facilitates testing realistic scenarios towards new and improved
replaying/relaying-focused countermeasures in GNSS receivers.

tasks. However, most prompt-learning methods expand label words manually or
only consider the class name for knowledge incorporating in cloze-style
prediction, which will inevitably incur omissions and bias in short text

distance calculation between selected concepts and class labels. Experimental

modern recommender systems. However, most recommendation benchmarks only
concern the prediction of user-item ratings while omitting the underlying
causes behind the ratings. For example, the widely-used Yahoo!R3 dataset
contains little information on the causes of the user-movie ratings. A solution
could be to conduct surveys and require the users to provide such information.
In practice, the user surveys can hardly avoid compliance issues and sparse
user responses, which greatly hinders the exploration of causality-based
recommendation. To better support the studies of causal inference and further
explanations in recommender systems, we propose a novel semi-synthetic data
generation framework for recommender systems where causal graphical models with
missingness are employed to describe the causal mechanism of practical
recommendation scenarios. To illustrate the use of our framework, we construct
a semi-synthetic dataset with Causal Tags And Ratings (CTAR), based on the
movies as well as their descriptive tags and rating information collected from
a famous movie rating website. Using the collected data and the causal graph,
the user-item-ratings and their corresponding user-item-tags are automatically
generated, which provides the reasons (selected tags) why the user rates the
items. Descriptive statistics and baseline results regarding the CTAR dataset
are also reported. The proposed data generation framework is not limited to
recommendation, and the released APIs can be used to generate customized
datasets for other research tasks.

complexity is quite high due to the coupled structure of the cascade channel

forecasting. However, most of these methods adopt the standard point-wise
self-attention mechanism, which not only becomes intractable for long-term
forecasting since its complexity increases quadratically with the length of
time series, but also cannot explicitly capture the predictive dependencies
from contexts since the corresponding key and value are transformed from the
same point. This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called
{\em Preformer}. Preformer introduces a novel efficient {\em Multi-Scale
Segment-Correlation} mechanism that divides time series into segments and
utilizes segment-wise correlation-based attention for encoding time series. A
multi-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different
temporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer
further designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value
come from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if
a key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its
successive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Preformer outperforms other
Transformer-based methods.

useful information on their large scale structure. In the special case of
random regular graphs (RRGs), which consist of $N$ nodes of degree $c \ge 3$,
the DSPL, denoted by $P(L=\ell)$, follows a discrete Gompertz distribution.
Using the discrete Laplace transform we derive a closed-form expression for the
moment generating function of the DSPL of RRGs. From the moment generating
function we obtain closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the
DSPL. More specifically, we find that the mean distance between pairs of
distinct nodes is given by $\langle L \rangle = \frac{\ln N}{\ln (c-1)} +
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{ \ln c - \ln (c-2) +\gamma}{\ln (c-1)} + \mathcal{O} \left(
\frac{\ln N}{N} \right)$, where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
While the leading term is known, this result includes a novel correction term,
which yields very good agreement with the results obtained from direct
numerical evaluation of $\langle L \rangle$ via the tail-sum formula and with
the results obtained from computer simulations. However, it does not account
for an oscillatory behavior of $\langle L \rangle$ as a function of $c$ or $N$.
These oscillations are negligible in sparse networks but detectable in dense
networks. We also derive an expression for the variance ${\rm Var}(L)$ of the
DSPL, which captures the overall dependence of the variance on $c$ but does not
account for the oscillations. The oscillations are due to the discrete nature
of the shell structure around a random node. They reflect the profile of the
filling of new shells as $N$ is increased. The results for the mean and
variance are compared to the corresponding results obtained in other types of
random networks. The relation between the mean distance and the diameter is
discussed.

them to zero, it is proven that the length constraint can be satisfied for any
data and any chosen ratio between the two boundary tangents. Length
interpolation equation reduces to one algebraic equation with four solutions in
general. To select the best one, the value of the bending energy is observed.

application in vision systems. Previous approaches achieve improvement by

complexity of the RGB video network. To solve the problem, we propose a
multi-modality feature fusion network to combine the modalities of the skeleton
sequence and RGB frame instead of the RGB video, as the key information
contained by the combination of skeleton sequence and RGB frame is close to
that of the skeleton sequence and RGB video. In this way, the complementary
information is retained while the complexity is reduced by a large margin. To
better explore the correspondence of the two modalities, a two-stage fusion
framework is introduced in the network. In the early fusion stage, we introduce
a skeleton attention module that projects the skeleton sequence on the single
RGB frame to help the RGB frame focus on the limb movement regions. In the late
fusion stage, we propose a cross-attention module to fuse the skeleton feature
and the RGB feature by exploiting the correlation. Experiments on two
benchmarks NTU RGB+D and SYSU show that the proposed model achieves competitive
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods while reduces the

Existing approaches to improve traffic flow, widely known as automatic

promising results in planning for a single ego vehicle. This work proposes to
leverage machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow at urban

optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is critical for accurate and robust
machine analysis and clinical diagnosis. Traditional sequence-based approaches
such as propagating neighboring information to gradually fill in the missing
regions are cost-effective. But they generate less satisfactory outcomes when
dealing with larger missing regions and texture-rich structures. Emerging deep
learning-based methods such as encoder-decoder networks have shown promising
results in natural image inpainting tasks. However, they typically need a long
computational time for network training in addition to the high demand on the
size of datasets, which makes it difficult to be applied on often small medical
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale shadow
inpainting framework for OCT images by synergically applying sparse
representation and deep learning: sparse representation is used to extract
features from a small amount of training images for further inpainting and to
regularize the image after the multi-scale image fusion, while convolutional
neural network (CNN) is employed to enhance the image quality. During the image
inpainting, we divide preprocessed input images into different branches based
on the shadow width to harvest complementary information from different scales.
Finally, a sparse representation-based regularizing module is designed to
refine the generated contents after multi-scale feature aggregation.
Experiments are conducted to compare our proposal versus both traditional and
deep learning-based techniques on synthetic and real-world shadows. Results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves favorable image inpainting in
terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics, especially when wide shadows

formal specification language which enables precise specification of system
design and exhaustive checking of the design without any human effort. The
features of TLA+ make it widely used in the specification and model checking of
consensus protocols, both in academia and industry. However, the application of
TLA+ is limited by the state explosion problem in model checking. Though
compositional model checking is essential to tame the state explosion problem,
existing compositional checking techniques do not sufficiently consider the
characteristics of TLA+.
  In this work, we propose the Interaction-Preserving Abstraction (IPA)
framework, which leverages the features of TLA+ and enables practical and
efficient compositional model checking of consensus protocols specified in
TLA+. In the IPA framework, system specification is partitioned into multiple
modules, and each module is divided to the internal part and the interaction
part. The basic idea of the interaction-preserving abstraction is to omit the
internal part of each module, such that another module cannot distinguish
whether it is interacting with the original module or the coarsened abstract
one.
  We use the IPA framework to the compositional checking of the TLA+
specification of two consensus protocols Raft and ParallelRaft. Raft is a
consensus protocol which is originally developed in the academia and then
widely used in industry. ParallelRaft is the replication protocol in PolarFS,
the distributed file system for the commercial database Alibaba PoloarDB. We
demonstrate that the IPA framework is easy to use in realistic scenarios and at
the same time significantly reduces the model checking cost.

end, it is made up of two main steps: i) pairwise similarity modeling with
scarce labeled data; and ii) triplet-based metric learning with abundant
unlabeled data. The first step aims to model pairwise sample similarities by
using a small number of labeled samples. This is achieved by estimating the
target value differences of labeled samples with a Siamese neural network
(SNN). The second step aims to learn a triplet-based metric space (in which
similar samples are close to each other and dissimilar samples are far apart
from each other) when the number of labeled samples is insufficient. This is
achieved by employing the SNN of the first step for triplet-based deep metric
learning that exploits not only labeled samples but also unlabeled samples. For
the end-to-end training of DML-S2R, we investigate an alternate learning
strategy for the two steps. Due to this strategy, the encoded information in
each step becomes a guidance for learning phase of the other step. The

the large-scale synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides, such as tungsten

of the CVD process remains largely unknown and yet to be explored. Here, we
employ Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) in a two-stage process to tune the oxygen

of oxygen vacancies in the precursor films leads to a more facile conversion
from WO3-x to WS2. Using a joint study based on ab initio density functional
theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we unravel that the oxygen vacancies
in WO3-x can serve as niches through which sulfur atoms enters the lattice and
may facilitate an efficient growth of WS2 crystals. By solely modulating the
precursor stoichiometry, the photoluminescence emission of WS2 can be greatly
enhanced, while the size of WS2 domains increases significantly. Atomic
resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals that
tungsten vacancies are the dominant intrinsic defects in mono- and bilayers
WS2. Moreover, our data reveal that grain boundaries in bilayer WS2 emerge upon
the coalescence of AA' and AB-oriented crystals, while turbostatic moir\'e
patterns originate upon formation of distinct grain boundaries between the
bottom and bottom layers. The atomic resolution images show local strain
buildup in bilayer WS2 due to competing effects of complex grain boundaries.
Our study provides a means to tune the precursor composition in order to
control the lateral growth of TMDs, while revealing insights into the different
pathways for the formation of grain boundaries in bilayer WS2.

Recently, some scholars have tried to apply Transformer to time series

existing Transformer methods do not pay enough attention to the small time
segments that play a decisive role in prediction, making it insensitive to
small changes that affect the trend of time series, and it is difficult to
effectively learn continuous time-dependent features. To solve this problem, we
propose a differential attention fusion model based on Transformer, which
designs the differential layer, neighbor attention, sliding fusion mechanism,
and residual layer on the basis of classical Transformer architecture.
Specifically, the differences of adjacent time points are extracted and focused
by difference and neighbor attention. The sliding fusion mechanism fuses
various features of each time point so that the data can participate in
encoding and decoding without losing important information. The residual layer
including convolution and LSTM further learns the dependence between time
points and enables our model to carry out deeper training. A large number of
experiments on three datasets show that the prediction results produced by our
method are favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art.

the formation of ethanol through the reaction of CCH with one H$_2$O molecule
belonging to the ice, as a test case to investigate the viability of chemical
reactions based on a ""radical + ice component"" scheme as an alternative
mechanism for the synthesis of iCOMs, beyond the usual radical-radical

of 18 and 33 water molecules as ice models. Results indicate that
CH$_3$CH$_2$OH can potentially be formed by this proposed reaction mechanism.
The reaction of CCH with H$_2$O on the water ice clusters can be barrierless
(thanks to the help of boundary icy water molecules acting as proton transfer
assistants) leading to the formation of vinyl alcohol precursors (H$_2$CCOH and
CHCHOH). Subsequent hydrogenation of vinyl alcohol yielding ethanol is the only
step presenting a low activation energy barrier. We finally discuss the

friction drag due to fluid viscosity and form drag due to flow separation

prevents flow separation. As studied here, when the operating fluid is water, a
promising technique for form drag reduction is to modify the walls of the body

asperities, avoiding the direct contact of the liquid with the wall.
Superhydrophobic surfaces have been vastly studied for reducing friction drag.
We show they are also effective in reducing flow separation in turbulent flow

demonstrated by studying numerical simulations of turbulent flow over a bluff

superhydrophobic surfaces. The approach shown here contributes to new and

Fenchel-Moreau conjugations. This tropical analogue of Aronszajn's theorem

decomposition which expresses a tensor as a sum of rank one tensors. In stark
contrast to the matrix case, with light assumptions, the CPD of a low rank
tensor is (essentially) unique. The essential uniqueness of CPD makes this
decomposition a powerful tool in many applications as it allows for extraction
of component information from a signal of interest.
  One popular algorithm for algebraic computation of a CPD is the generalized
eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) which selects a matrix subpencil of a tensor,
then computes the generalized eigenvectors of the pencil. In this article, we
present a simplification of GEVD which improves the accuracy of the algorithm.
Surprisingly, the generalized eigenvector computation in GEVD is in fact
unnecessary and can be replaced by a QZ decomposition which factors a pair of
matrices as a product of unitary and upper triangular matrices. Computing a QZ
decomposition is a standard first step when computing generalized eigenvectors,
so our algorithm can been seen as a direct simplification of GEVD.

order in a system in equilibrium within a hadronic transport approach (SMASH).
In our model the net baryon, net charge and net strangeness is perfectly
conserved on an event-by-event basis and the cumulants are calculated as a
function of subvolume sizes and compared to analytic expectations. We find a
modification of the kurtosis due to charge annihilation processes in systems
with simplified degrees of freedom. Furthermore the result of the full SMASH
hadron gas for the net baryon and net proton number fluctuations is presented
for systems with zero and finite values of baryon chemical potential.
Additionally we find that due to dynamical correlations the cumulants of the
net baryon number cannot easily be recovered from the net protons. Finally the
influence of deuteron cluster formation on the net proton and net baryon
fluctuations in a simplified system is shown. This analysis is important to
better understand the relation between measurements of fluctuations in

granular solids. Here, using oscillatory shear rheology and in-situ optical
imaging, we study energy dissipation in a dense granular suspension of adhesive
particles that forms yield stress solids far below the isotropic jamming point
obtained in the limit of hard-sphere repulsion. We find interesting non-linear
flow regimes including intra-cycle strain stiffening and plasticity that
strongly depend on the applied strain amplitude ($\gamma_0$) and particle
volume fraction ($\phi$). We demonstrate that such nonlinearity over the entire
parameter range can be effectively captured by a dimensionless variable termed
as the normalized energy dissipation ($E_N$). Furthermore, in-situ optical
imaging reveals irreversible particle rearrangements correlating with the
spatiotemporal fluctuations in local velocity, the nature of which strikingly
varies across the yielding transition. By directly measuring the critical
jamming packing fractions using particle settling experiments, we propose a
detailed phase diagram that unravels the role of inter-particle interactions in
controlling the flow properties of the system for a wide range of $\gamma_0$

hydrogen and helium in great abundance. These are the so-called super-Earths
and mini-Neptunes. Their atmospheric composition suggests that they formed
early during the gas-rich phase of the circumstellar disk and were able to
avoid becoming hot Jupiters. As a possible explanation, recent studies explored
the recycling hypothesis and showed that atmosphere-disk recycling is able to
fully compensate for radiative cooling and thereby halt Kelvin-Helmholtz
contraction to prevent runaway gas accretion.
  To understand the parameters that determine the efficiency of atmospheric
recycling, we extend our earlier studies by exploring the effects of the core
mass, the effect of circumstellar gas on sub-Keplerian orbits (headwind), and
the optical depth of the surrounding gas on the recycling timescale.
Additionally, we analyze their effects on the size and mass of the forming
atmosphere.
  For the explored parameter space, all simulations eventually reach an
equilibrium where heating due to hydrodynamic recycling fully compensates
radiative cooling. In this equilibrium, the atmosphere-to-core mass ratio stays
well below $10 \, \%$, preventing the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating
and entering runaway gas accretion. Higher core masses cause the atmosphere to
become turbulent, which further enhances recycling.
  Even for our highest core mass of $10 \, M_\mathrm{Earth}$, atmosphere-disk
recycling is efficient enough to fully compensate for radiative cooling and
prevent the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating. Hence, in-situ formation
of hot Jupiters is very unlikely, and migration of gas giants is a key process
required to explain their existence. Our findings imply that atmosphere-disk
recycling is the most natural explanation for the prevalence of close-in
super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

Especially for sparse representations, such as human skeletons, a few occluded
points might destroy the geometrical and temporal continuity critically
affecting the results. Yet, the research of data-scarce recognition from
skeleton sequences, such as one-shot action recognition, does not explicitly
consider occlusions despite their everyday pervasiveness. In this work, we
explicitly tackle body occlusions for Skeleton-based One-shot Action
Recognition (SOAR). We mainly consider two occlusion variants: 1) random
occlusions and 2) more realistic occlusions caused by diverse everyday objects,
which we generate by projecting the existing IKEA 3D furniture models into the
camera coordinate system of the 3D skeletons with different geometric
parameters. We leverage the proposed pipeline to blend out portions of skeleton
sequences of the three popular action recognition datasets and formalize the
first benchmark for SOAR from partially occluded body poses. Another key
property of our benchmark are the more realistic occlusions generated by
everyday objects, as even in standard recognition from 3D skeletons, only
randomly missing joints were considered. We re-evaluate existing
state-of-the-art frameworks for SOAR in the light of this new task and further
introduce Trans4SOAR - a new transformer-based model which leverages three data
streams and mixed attention fusion mechanism to alleviate the adverse effects
caused by occlusions. While our experiments demonstrate a clear decline in
accuracy with missing skeleton portions, this effect is smaller with
Trans4SOAR, which outperforms other architectures on all datasets. Although we
specifically focus on occlusions, Trans4SOAR additionally yields
state-of-the-art in the standard SOAR without occlusion, surpassing the best
published approach by 2.85% on NTU-120.

we utilize the ambiguous information among the age labels, convert each age
label into a discrete label distribution and leverage the label distribution
learning (LDL) method to fit the data. For each audio data sample, our method
produces a age distribution of its speaker, and on top of the distribution we
also perform two other tasks: age prediction and age uncertainty minimization.
Therefore, our method naturally combines the age classification and regression
approaches, which enhances the robustness of our method. We conduct experiments
on the public NIST SRE08-10 dataset and a real-world dataset, which exhibit
that our method outperforms baseline methods by a relatively large margin,

may be naturally distributed in the different bundles of that user (Global
view), while a bundle may contain multiple intents of a user (Local view). Each
view has its advantages for intent disentangling: 1) From the global view, more
items are involved to present each intent, which can demonstrate the user's
preference under each intent more clearly. 2) From the local view, it can
reveal the association among items under each intent since items within the

novel model named Multi-view Intent Disentangle Graph Networks (MIDGN), which
is capable of precisely and comprehensively capturing the diversity of the

MIDGN disentangles the user's intents from two different perspectives,

user's intent coupled with items within each bundle.

contributions owing to lowered halo baryon fractions. IllustrisTNG results more
closely resemble SIMBA without jets. Projections of line-of-sight structures
weaken these model differences slightly, but they remain significant --
particularly at group and lower halo masses. In contrast, beam smearing at
$\textit{Planck}$ resolution makes the models indistinguishable, and both
models appear to agree well with $\textit{Planck}$ data down to the lowest
masses probed. We show that the arcminute resolution expected from forthcoming
facilities would retain the differences between model predictions, and thereby
provide strong constraints on AGN feedback.

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an
autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the
static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the
exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these
assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM
and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper,
DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This
method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static
and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework,
to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we
implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential
dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point
cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history
object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window.
The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding
window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform
SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly
improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios
and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets
have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.

study dynamic data. This is entirely a data-driven approach that extracts all
necessary information from data snapshots which are commonly supposed to be
sampled from measurement. The application of this approach becomes problematic
if the available data is incomplete because some dimensions of smaller scale
either missing or unmeasured. Such setting occurs very often in modeling
complex dynamical systems such as power grids, in particular with reduced-order
modeling. To take into account the effect of unresolved variables the optimal
prediction approach based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism can be applied to
obtain the most expected prediction under existing uncertainties. This
effectively leads to the development of a time-predictive model accounting for
the impact of missing data. In the present paper we provide a detailed
derivation of the considered method from the Liouville equation and finalize it
with the optimization problem that defines the optimal transition operator
corresponding to the observed data. In contrast to the existing approach, we
consider a first-order approximation of the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, state
the corresponding optimization problem and solve it with the gradient-based
optimization method. The gradient of the obtained objective function is
computed precisely through the automatic differentiation technique. The
numerical experiments illustrate that the considered approach gives practically
the same dynamics as the exact Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, but is less
computationally intensive.

exploitation can significantly improve search performance in lollipop-like
networks whereas it hinders target search in clique-like networks. Moreover, we
numerically verify that exploitation can reduce the time needed to fully
explore the underlying networks by using $550$ diverse real-world networks.
Based on the analytic result, we define the lollipop-likeness of a network and
observe a positive relationship between the advantage of exploitation and
lollipop-likeness.

Monte Carlo tree search -- enables the exploration of new kinds of models that
are unencumbered by constraints imposed to make decoding tractable, such as
autoregressivity or conditional independence assumptions. When applied to
autoregressive models, our algorithm has different biases than beam search has,
which enables a new analysis of the role of decoding bias in autoregressive
models. Empirically, we show that our adaptive tree search algorithm finds
outputs with substantially better model scores compared to beam search in
autoregressive models, and compared to reranking techniques in models whose
scores do not decompose additively with respect to the words in the output. We
also characterise the correlation of several translation model objectives with
respect to BLEU. We find that while some standard models are poorly calibrated
and benefit from the beam search bias, other often more robust models
(autoregressive models tuned to maximize expected automatic metric scores, the
noisy channel model and a newly proposed objective) benefit from increasing
amounts of search using our proposed decoder, whereas the beam search bias
limits the improvements obtained from such objectives. Thus, we argue that as
models improve, the improvements may be masked by over-reliance on beam search

zero-shot cross-lingual setting. To alleviate the effort of designing different
prompts for multiple languages, we propose a novel model that uses a unified
prompt for all languages, called UniPrompt. Different from the discrete prompts
and soft prompts, the unified prompt is model-based and language-agnostic.
Specifically, the unified prompt is initialized by a multilingual PLM to
produce language-independent representation, after which is fused with the text
input. During inference, the prompts can be pre-computed so that no extra
computation cost is needed. To collocate with the unified prompt, we propose a
new initialization method for the target label word to further improve the
model's transferability across languages. Extensive experiments show that our
proposed methods can significantly outperform the strong baselines across
different languages. We release data and code to facilitate future research.

the heterogeneity in the bitwidth specifications in the hardware has been

Heterogeneous Federated Learning (BHFL). BHFL brings in a new challenge, that
the aggregation of model parameters with different bitwidths could result in
severe performance degeneration, especially for high-bitwidth models. To tackle
this problem, we propose ProWD framework, which has a trainable weight
dequantizer at the central server that progressively reconstructs the
low-bitwidth weights into higher bitwidth weights, and finally into
full-precision weights. ProWD further selectively aggregates the model
parameters to maximize the compatibility across bit-heterogeneous weights. We
validate ProWD against relevant FL baselines on the benchmark datasets, using
clients with varying bitwidths. Our ProWD largely outperforms the baseline FL
algorithms as well as naive approaches (e.g. grouped averaging) under the
proposed BHFL scenario.

styles, along with an immense lexicon, is considerably expensive. Although data
synthesis is a promising way to relieve data hunger, two key issues of
handwriting synthesis, namely, style representation and content embedding,
remain unsolved. To this end, we propose a novel method that can synthesize
parameterized and controllable handwriting Styles for arbitrary-Length and
Out-of-vocabulary text based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed
SLOGAN. Specifically, we propose a style bank to parameterize the specific
handwriting styles as latent vectors, which are input to a generator as style
priors to achieve the corresponding handwritten styles. The training of the
style bank requires only the writer identification of the source images, rather
than attribute annotations. Moreover, we embed the text content by providing an
easily obtainable printed style image, so that the diversity of the content can
be flexibly achieved by changing the input printed image. Finally, the
generator is guided by dual discriminators to handle both the handwriting
characteristics that appear as separated characters and in a series of cursive
joins. Our method can synthesize words that are not included in the training
vocabulary and with various new styles. Extensive experiments have shown that
high-quality text images with great style diversity and rich vocabulary can be
synthesized using our method, thereby enhancing the robustness of the
recognizer.

evacuation of a double-deck electric unit railcar carried out in Prague in
2018. 15 evacuation trials involving 91 participants were conducted under
various evacuation scenarios considering different compositions of passenger
crowd, exit widths, and exit types (e.g. egress to a high platform, to an open
rail line using stairs, and a 750 mm jump without any supporting equipment).
The study's main goals were to collect experimental data on the movement
conditions in the railcar and to study the impact of various boundary
conditions on evacuation process and total evacuation time. Movement
characteristics (exit flows, speeds) and human behaviour (pre-movement
activities, exiting behaviours) were also analysed.
  The data obtained was used to validate and adjust a Pathfinder model to
capture important aspects of evacuation from the railcar. Furthermore, a series
of simulations using this model was performed to provide sensitivity analysis
of the influence of crowd composition, exit width, and exit type on total
evacuation time. As a key finding, we can conclude that for the case of a
standard exit path (platform or stairs) the width of the main exit had the
greatest impact on total evacuation time, however, crowd composition played the
prevailing role in evacuation scenarios involving a jump.

general-purpose toolboxes for establishing sharp excess risk bounds for
statistical estimators based on the framework of empirical risk minimization.
Applying this toolbox typically requires using the Bernstein condition, which
often restricts applicability to convex and proper settings. Recent years have
witnessed several examples of problems where optimal statistical performance is
only achievable via non-convex and improper estimators originating from
aggregation theory, including the fundamental problem of model selection. These
examples are currently outside of the reach of the classical localization
theory.
  In this work, we build upon the recent approach to localization via offset
Rademacher complexities, for which a general high-probability theory has yet to
be established. Our main result is an exponential-tail excess risk bound
expressed in terms of the offset Rademacher complexity that yields results at
least as sharp as those obtainable via the classical theory. However, our bound
applies under an estimator-dependent geometric condition (the ""offset
condition"") instead of the estimator-independent (but, in general,
distribution-dependent) Bernstein condition on which the classical theory
relies. Our results apply to improper prediction regimes not directly covered

suprasaturation densities, where the phase transitions of strongly interacting
matter and the quark matter symmetry energy are likely to be taken into
account. In this work, we investigate the properties of symmetry energy by
using a hybrid star with the hadron-quark phase transition. The interaction
among strange quark matter (SQM) in hybrid stars is based on a 3-flavor NJL
model with different vector and isovector channels, while the equation of state
(EOS) of the nuclear matter is obtained by considering the ImMDI-ST interaction
by varying the parameters x, y, and z. Our results indicate that the various
parameters and coupling constants of the interactions from the ImMDI-ST and NJL
model can lead to widely different trends for the symmetry energy in the
hadron-quark mixed phase and the different onsets of the hadron-quark phase
transition. In addition, it has been found that the radii and tidal
deformabilities of hybrid stars constrain mostly the density dependence of
symmetry energy while the observed maximum masses of hybrid stars constrain
mostly the EOS of symmetric nuclear and quark matter.

work assigned to each worker, but as $k$ increases, the overhead involved in
scheduling and managing the tasks begins to overtake the performance benefit.
We perform extensive experiments on the effects of task granularity on an
Apache Spark cluster, and based on these, developed a four-parameter model for
task and job overhead that, in simulation, produces sojourn time distributions
that match those of the real system. We also present analytical results which
illustrate how using tiny tasks improves the stability region of split-merge

both split-merge and single-queue fork-join systems with tiny tasks. Finally we
combine the overhead model with the analytical models to produce an analytical

these approximations matched the Spark experimental results very well in both

substrates have received growing attention during the last decades, the study
of three-dimensional cases is limited to a few studies on flat and axisymmetric
substrates. In this work, we exploit differential geometry to study the
drainage and spreading of thin films on generic curved substrates. We initially
investigate the drainage and spreading processes on spheroidal and paraboloidal
substrates by employing an asymptotic expansion in the vicinity of the pole and
a self-similar approach, finding that the thickness distribution is set by the
substrate metric and tangential gravity force components. Spheroids with a
large ratio between height and equatorial radius are characterized by a growing
thickness moving away from the pole, and vice versa. The non-symmetric coating
on a toroidal substrate shows that larger thicknesses and a faster spreading
are attained on the inner region than on the outer region of the torus. An
ellipsoid with three different axes is chosen as a testing ground for
three-dimensional drainage and spreading. Modulations in the drainage solution
are observed, with a different variation of the thickness along the two axes.
By imposing the conservation of mass, an analytical solution for the average
spreading front is obtained. The analytical and numerical results are in good
agreement. The resulting drainage solutions show also a good agreement with
experimental measurements obtained from the coating of a curing polymer on

the radioactive source of Fe-55 and the Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD)
simulations, since the radiation hardness of 6.8 $\times$ 10^12 1 MeV neq/cm^2
per year for Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) effects is required. In
measurements, the sensor gain has been calibrated using the k-$\alpha$ peak of
Fe-55 before and after irradiation. The pixel-wise equivalent noise charge
(ENC), charge collection efficiency (CCE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were
evaluated. The radiation-induced effects on cluster properties are studied
through a self-developed reconstruction algorithm. In TCAD simulations, charge
collections in 5 $\times$ 5 pixel matrixes for two typical impinging cases of
incident particles were simulated with and without irradiation. Both
measurements and simulations indicate that enlarged pixels with area of 21
$\mu$m $\times$ 84 $\mu$m, though suffering greater loss on sensor performance
than small pixels do, still have satisfactory noise and charge collection
performance after irradiation for particle tracking in the upcoming collider
detectors.

M81 and M82. Finally, the spatial distribution of the GC candidates $(g-i)$
colours is consistent with halo/intra-cluster GCs, i.e. it gets bluer as they
get further from the closest galaxy in the field. We further employ a
regression-tree based model to estimate the metallicity distribution of the GC
candidates based on their J-PLUS bands. The metallicity distribution of the
sample candidates is broad and displays a bump towards the metal-rich end. Our
list increases the population of GC candidates around the triplet by 3-fold,
stresses the usefulness of multi-band surveys in finding these objects, and
provides a testbed for further studies analysing their spatial distribution

obtain a multipartite LR inequality. However, the violation of such generalised
Wigner's inequality does not guarantee nonlocality between all possible
different bipartitions of the multipartite system. In the present work, this
limitation has been overcome by formulating a further generalisation of
Wigner's approach through the derivation of a set of LR inequalities with
respect to all different bipartitions of a N-partite system. Quantum mechanical
violations of all individual LR inequalities belonging to such a set would
rigorously certify multipartite nonlocality by also providing a finer
characterisation of the nature of multipartite nonlocality in the following
sense. The quantum mechanical violation of any given inequality of our complete
set of LR inequalities would enable identification of the corresponding
bipartition which exhibits nonlocality. This is in contrast to other
multipartite LR inequalities such as the Svetlichny inequality or its
generalisation that cannot be used to detect whether there is any particular
bipartition which is nonlocally correlated. The efficacy of the scheme
developed in this paper is illustrated for the tripartite and quadripartite

area, mainly when surface tension is present. One way to model the different
phases is with interface capturing methods. Two well-established interface
capturing approaches are the level-set and phase-field methods. The level-set
method is known for its ability to compute the surface tension accurately, and
phase-field models satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. This paper reviews
and compares a level-set and a phase-field approach to simulate two-phase
flows. We use a modified level-set method, called convected level-set. The
difference to the standard level-set method is that the re-initialization step
is embedded in the convection equation, avoiding a separate step during the
calculation. We also apply a global mass conservation procedure to enforce the
mass balance between phases. On the other hand, the phase-field approach uses a
conservative Allen-Cahn equation with a Lagrange multiplier to conserve the
mass. The methods are implemented in libMesh, a parallel adaptive finite
element library, using the same finite element formulations, time-marching
schemes, solvers, and mesh adaptivity strategies. We present numerical
solutions for the two methods considering adaptive mesh refinement and

part of a whole range of behaviors (walking, running, skating, skiing, etc.).
This paper presents a general model of balance control and applies it to the
balancing of a bicycle. Balance control has both a physics (mechanics) and a
neurobiological component. The physics component pertains to the laws that
govern the movements of the rider and his bicycle, and the neurobiological
component pertains to the mechanisms via which the central nervous system (CNS)
uses these laws for balance control. This paper presents a computational model
of this neurobiological component, based on the theory of stochastic optimal
feedback control (OFC). The central concept in this model is a computational
system, implemented in the CNS, that controls a mechanical system outside the
CNS. This computational system uses an internal model to calculate optimal
control actions as specified by the theory of stochastic optimal feedback
control (OFC). For the computational model to be plausible, it must be robust
to at least two inevitable inaccuracies: (1) model parameters that the CNS
learns slowly from interactions with the CNS-attached body and bicycle (i.e.,
the internal noise covariance matrices), and (2) model parameters that depend
on unreliable sensory input (i.e., movement speed). By means of simulations, I
demonstrate that this model can balance a bicycle under realistic conditions
and is robust to inaccuracies in the learned sensorimotor noise
characteristics. However, the model is not robust to inaccuracies in the
movement speed estimates. This has important implications for the plausibility
of stochastic OFC as a model for balance control.

issues in the mathematical convergence analysis of GF trajectories and GD type

conditions for critical points of the risk function and, thereby, to obtain an
understanding about the appearance of critical points in dependence of the

federated learning and neural architecture search (NAS). Although promising as
it may seem, the coupling of difficulties from both tenets makes the algorithm
development quite challenging. In particular, how to efficiently search the
optimal neural architecture directly from massive non-independent and

is a hard nut to crack. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, by leveraging

separation of magnetic poles cannot be happened, even in very small atomic
dimensions. Existence of magnetic dipoles is due to a fundamental property of
magnetic materials and belongs to intrinsic spin of electrons. For the
electron, N and S magnetic poles are considered, similar to a current loop. The
aim of this paper is theoretical calculate dissociation energy of N-S poles a
quantum magnetic particle with two approaches of classical and quantum
mechanics by providing a harmonic oscillator simple model to estimate
dissociation energy of the N-S poles and corresponding breakdown temperature
and internal pressure. The results showed that separation of magnetic poles
occurs in two states: (a) in an ultra-hot plasma medium with extremely high
temperatures, such as in the center of a hot star, and (b) at extremely high
pressures, such as between internal plates in complex superlattices of layered
solids. It will be shown that breakdown temperature is in order of {\theta}
=107 to 108 Kelvin. This temperature is very high and it only happens in an
ultra-hot plasma environment as fifth phase of matter. In addition, based on
this model, we calculated that the possibility of dissociation of bonds between
N and S magnetic poles for solid superlattices occurs at very high pressures
between crystal plates. According to these results, the presence of isolated
magnetic monopole in superlattices of solids under ultra-high-pressure
conditions is possible. Therefore, this model suggests that the conductivity of
magnetic monopole carries can be used in the manipulation of nanomaterials for
applications in the production of advanced devices such as new generation of
superconductors, new spin devices and magnetic-electronics advanced materials
with magnetic monopoles and super-dielectrics.

decade, new opportunity for MWP has emerged driven by the advances of
integrated photonics. However, despite significant progress made in terms of
integration level, a fully on-chip MWP functional system comprising all the
necessary photonic and electronic components, is yet to be demonstrated. Here,
we break the status quo and provide a complete on-chip solution for MWP system,
by exploiting hybrid integration of indium phosphide, silicon photonics and
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics platforms. Applying
this hybrid integration methodology, a fully chip-based MWP microwave
instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) system is experimentally
demonstrated. The unprecedented integration level brings great promotion to the
compactness, reliability, and performances of the overall MWP IFM system,
including a wide frequency measurement range (2-34 GHz), ultralow estimation
errors (10.85 MHz) and a fast response speed (0.3 ns). Furthermore, we deploy
the chip-scale MWP IFM system into realistic application tasks, where diverse
microwave signals with rapid-varying frequencies at X-band (8-12 GHz) are
accurately identified in real-time. This demonstration marks a milestone for
the development of integrated MWP, by providing the technology basis for the
miniaturization and massive implementations of various MWP functional systems.

predictions while avoiding unfair discrimination based on sensitive attributes
such as race, sex, religion, etc. An important line of work in this field is
enforcing fairness during the training step of a classifier. A simple yet
effective binary classification algorithm that follows this strategy is
two-naive-Bayes (2NB), which enforces statistical parity - requiring that the
groups comprising the dataset receive positive labels with the same likelihood.
In this paper, we generalise this algorithm into N-naive-Bayes (NNB) to
eliminate the simplification of assuming only two sensitive groups in the data
and instead apply it to an arbitrary number of groups.
  We propose an extension of the original algorithm's statistical parity
constraint and the post-processing routine that enforces statistical
independence of the label and the single sensitive attribute. Then, we
investigate its application on data with multiple sensitive features and
propose a new constraint and post-processing routine to enforce differential
fairness, an extension of established group-fairness constraints focused on
intersectionalities. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NNB
algorithm on US Census datasets and compare its accuracy and debiasing
performance, as measured by disparate impact and DF-$\epsilon$ score, with
similar group-fairness algorithms. Finally, we lay out important considerations
users should be aware of before incorporating this algorithm into their
application, and direct them to further reading on the pros, cons, and ethical
implications of using statistical parity as a fairness criterion.

biological processes which often involve physical deformations of these
molecules. At sufficiently long length scales (say above $\sim 20-30$ base
pairs) the mechanics of DNA and RNA double helices is described by a
homogeneous Twistable Wormlike Chain (TWLC), a semiflexible polymer model
characterized by twist and bending stiffnesses. At shorter scales this model
breaks down for two reasons: the elastic properties become sequence-dependent
and the mechanical deformations at distal sites gets coupled. We discuss in
this paper the origin of the latter effect using the framework of a non-local
Twistable Wormlike Chain (nlTWLC). We show, by comparing all-atom simulations
data for DNA and RNA double helices, that the non-local couplings are of very
similar nature in these two molecules: couplings between distal sites are
strong for tilt and twist degrees of freedom and weak for roll. We introduce
and analyze a simple double-stranded polymer model which clarifies the origin
of this universal distal couplings behavior. In this model, referred to as the
ladder model, a nlTWLC description emerges from the coarsening of local
(atomic) degrees of freedom into angular variables which describe the twist and
bending of the molecule. Differently from its local counterpart, the nlTWLC is
characterized by a length-scale-dependent elasticity. Our analysis predicts
that nucleic acids are mechanically softer at the scale of a few base pairs and
are asymptotically stiffer at longer length scales, a behavior which matches
experimental data.

enabling technology for ubiquitous sensing and IoT applications. For ICS
application to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), optimizing the waveform structure is
one of the most challenging tasks due to strong influences between sensing and
data communication functions. Specifically, the preamble of a data
communication frame is typically leveraged for the sensing function. As such,
the higher number of preambles in a Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) is, the
greater sensing task's performance is. In contrast, communication efficiency is
inversely proportional to the number of preambles. Moreover, surrounding radio
environments are usually dynamic with high uncertainties due to their high
mobility, making the ICS's waveform optimization problem even more challenging.
To that end, this paper develops a novel ICS framework established on the
Markov decision process and recent advanced techniques in deep reinforcement
learning. By doing so, without requiring complete knowledge of the surrounding
environment in advance, the ICS-AV can adaptively optimize its waveform
structure (i.e., number of frames in the CPI) to maximize sensing and data

isolation of populations is rare. Although speciation can be hindered if gene
flow is large, intermediate levels of migration can enhance speciation by
introducing genetic novelty in the semi-isolated populations or founding small
communities of migrants. Here we consider a two island neutral model of
speciation with continuous migration and study diversity patterns as a function
of the migration probability, population size, and number of genes involved in
reproductive isolation (dubbed as genome size). For small genomes, low levels
of migration induce speciation on the islands that otherwise would not occur.
Diversity, however, drops sharply to a single species inhabiting both islands
as the migration probability increases. For large genomes, sympatric speciation
occurs even when the islands are strictly isolated. Then species richness per
island increases with the probability of migration, but the total number of
species decreases as they become cosmopolitan. For each genome size, there is
an optimal migration intensity for each population size that maximizes the
number of species. We discuss the observed modes of speciation induced by
migration and how they increase species richness in the insular system while
promoting asymmetry between the islands and hindering endemism.

Hubbard interaction of the iron site, is used to show that the fluorinated spin
crossover Fe(phen$)_{2}$(NCS$)_{2}$ molecule whether in the gas phase or
adsorbed on Cu(001) surface switches from the original low spin state to the
high spin state. Using Bader electron density analysis, this inversion of the
spin-crossover is explained in terms of electron doping of the Fe-octahedron
cage which led to an increase of the Fe-N bond lengths. Consequently, the
ligand-field splitting is drastically reduced, making the high-spin ground
state more stable than the low-spin state. The calculated scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) images in the Tersoff-Hamann approximation show a clear
distinction between the fluorinated and the unfluorinated molecule. This
theoretical prediction is awaiting future STM experimental confirmation.

209458b in optical/visible light using the CHEOPS space telescope. Our
measurement of 20.4 +/- 3.3 ppm translates into a geometric albedo of A_g =
0.096 +/- 0.016. The previously estimated dayside temperature of about 1500 K
implies that our geometric albedo measurement consists predominantly of
reflected starlight and is largely uncontaminated by thermal emission. This
makes the present result one of the most robust measurements of A_g for any
exoplanet. Our calculations of the bandpass-integrated geometric albedo
demonstrate that the measured value of A_g is consistent with a cloud-free
atmosphere, where starlight is reflected via Rayleigh scattering by hydrogen
molecules, and the water and sodium abundances are consistent with stellar
metallicity. We predict that the bandpass-integrated TESS geometric albedo is
too faint to detect and that a phase curve of HD 209458b observed by CHEOPS
would have a distinct shape associated with Rayleigh scattering if the
atmosphere is indeed cloud free.

Here we demonstrate that AV3Sb5 can crystallize in a mono-layered form,
revealing a range of properties that render the system unique by using
first-principles and mean-field calculations. Most importantly, the
two-dimensional monolayer preserves intrinsically different symmetries from the
three-dimensional layered bulk, enforced by stoichiometry. Enrichment of the
van Hove singularities, a logarithmic divergence of electronic density of
states, consequently appears, leading to a variety of competing instabilities
such as doublets of charge density waves and s-and d-wave superconductivity. We
show that the competition between orders can be fine-tuned in the monolayer via
electron-filling of the van Hove singularities. Thus, our results suggest the
monolayer kagome metal AV3Sb5 as a promising platform for designer metallic

novel RE approach able to discover diverse layout types and their dynamic

flexible layout constraint specifications by sampling UIs at different sizes

replicate even some non-standard layout managers with complex dynamic layout
behaviours. We demonstrate that ReverseORC works across different platforms

melanoma specific survival and potential treatment strategies. However,
acquiring transcriptome data is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover,
it is not routinely used in the current clinical workflow. Here we attempt to
overcome this by developing deep learning models to classify gigapixel H&E
stained pathology slides, which are well established in clinical workflows,
into these immune subgroups. Previous subtyping approaches have employed
supervised learning which requires fully annotated data, or have only examined
single genetic mutations in melanoma patients. We leverage a multiple-instance
learning approach, which only requires slide-level labels and uses an attention
mechanism to highlight regions of high importance to the classification.
Moreover, we show that pathology-specific self-supervised models generate
better representations compared to pathology-agnostic models for improving our
model performance, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 for classifying histopathology
images as high or low immune subgroups. We anticipate that this method may
allow us to find new biomarkers of high importance and could act as a tool for
clinicians to infer the immune landscape of tumours and stratify patients,
without needing to carry out additional expensive genetic tests.

perturbation theory at weak interactions, we have also introduced new
generalised gradient approximations (GGA's), beyond the usual
point-charge-plus-continuum model, for the first two leading terms at strong
interactions, which are crucial to ensure robustness and reliability. We then
assess the SCF-ACM functionals for molecular systems and for prototypical
strong-correlation problems. We find that they perform well for both the total
energy and the electronic density and that the impact of SCF orbitals is
directly connected to the accuracy of the ACM functional form. For the H$_2$
dissociation the SCF-ACM functionals yield significant improvements with
respect to standard functionals, also thanks to the use of the new GGA's for
the strong-coupling functionals.

processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its
world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our
architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free

is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects
dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show
that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the
emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers
through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers
pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that
the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across
environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with

radiance profiles along the equatorial and polar directions follow power laws
in the 5{\deg}-50{\deg} range of elongation, with constant power exponents of
-2.33 and -2.55. Both profiles connect extremely well to the corresponding
standard profiles of the zodiacal light. The LASCO equatorial profile exhibits
a shoulder implying a 17% decrease of the radiance within 10Rsun that may be
explained by the disappearance of organic materials within 0.3 AU. LASCO
detected for the first time a secular variation of the F-corona, an increase at
a rate of 0.46% per year of the integrated radiance in the LASCO-C3 FoV. This
is likely the first observational evidence of the role of collisions in the
inner zodiacal cloud. A composite of C2 and C3 images produced the LASCO
reference map of the radiance of the F-corona from 2 to 30Rsun and, by
combining with ground-based measurements, the LASCO extended map from 1 to 6
Rsun. The plane of symmetry of the inner zodiacal cloud is strongly warped, its
inclination increasing towards the planes of the inner planets and ultimately
the solar equator. In contrast, its longitude of ascending node is found to be
constant and equal to 87.6{\deg}. LASCO did not detect any small-scale
structures such as putative rings occasionally reported during solar eclipses.
The outer border of the depletion zone where interplanetary dust particles

zone extends down to 5Rsun, thus defining the boundary of the dust-free zone

Fr\'echet distance in 2012, where one is allowed to take shortcuts along one of

parameterized version of this problem, where the number of shortcuts is bounded
by a parameter $k$. The corresponding decision problem can be stated as
follows: Given two polygonal curves $T$ and $B$ of at most $n$ vertices, a
parameter $k$ and a distance threshold $\delta$, is it possible to introduce
$k$ shortcuts along $B$ such that the Fr\'echet distance of the resulting curve
and the curve $T$ is at most $\delta$? We study this problem for polygonal

exists no algorithm with running time bounded by $n^{o(k)}$; (ii) there exists
a decision algorithm with running time in $O(kn^{2k+2}\log n)$. In contrast, we
also show that efficient approximate decider algorithms are possible, even when

can show that, if $k$ is a constant and the two curves are $c$-packed for some
constant $c$, then the approximate decider algorithm runs in near-linear time.

objects can then be segmented using a normalized graph-cut to group
self-similar regions. We solve the graph-cut problem using spectral clustering
with generalized eigen-decomposition and show that the second smallest
eigenvector provides a cutting solution since its absolute value indicates the
likelihood that a token belongs to a foreground object. Despite its simplicity,
this approach significantly boosts the performance of unsupervised object
discovery: we improve over the recent state of the art LOST by a margin of
6.9%, 8.1%, and 8.1% respectively on the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K. The
performance can be further improved by adding a second stage class-agnostic
detector (CAD). Our proposed method can be easily extended to unsupervised
saliency detection and weakly supervised object detection. For unsupervised
saliency detection, we improve IoU for 4.9%, 5.2%, 12.9% on ECSSD, DUTS,
DUT-OMRON respectively compared to previous state of the art. For weakly
supervised object detection, we achieve competitive performance on CUB and

highest Curie temperature T_C = 45-50 K. It exhibits a magnetic gap at the
Dirac point of the topological surface state that disappears above T_C. By
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we probe this gap at different magnetic fields
and temperatures. We firstly reveal that the gap size shrinks, when an in-plane
magnetic field of up to B = 3 T is applied, but does not close completely as
the magnetization is only partially rotated in-plane. This corroborates the
magnetic origin of the gap and the complex magnetic structure. In addition, we
demonstrate significant spatiotemporal fluctuations of the gap size at
temperatures as low as T_C/2, above which the remanent magnetization indeed
decays. This temperature is close to the antiferromagnetic transition
temperature observed for bulk-type single crystals of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$,
highlighting the important role of competing magnetic orders in the formation
of the favorable ferromagnetic topological insulator. Our study, thus, provides
crucial insights into the complex magnetic gap opening of topological
insulators that is decisive for quantum anomalous Hall devices.

volcano which underwent an intense cycle of eruptive activity between 1998 and
2008. Self-potential and other geophysical investigations of the volcano have
shown the existence of a well-established hydrothermal system within the summit
cone. The present study investigates the relationship between changes in the
hydrothermal system and eruptive activity at the summit cone of Piton de la
Fournaise. Here, we consider the depth of the hydrothermal activity section to
be the area where the hydrothermal flow is the most intense along its path. Ten
complete-loop self-potential surveys have been analyzed through multi-scale
wavelet tomography (MWT) to characterize depth variations of the hydrothermal
system between 1993 and 2008. Our MWT models strongly support the existence of
six main hydrothermalflow pathways associated with the main edifice structure.
Each of these pathways is part of the main hydrothermal system and is connected
to the main hydrothermal reservoir at depth. In both 2006 and 2008, around
Dolomieu crater, based on our results, the hydrothermal activity sections are
located between 2300 and 2500 m a.s.l., which correlate well with the elevation
of the observed fumarole belt within the post-2007-collapse crater wall. Our
results show that the depths of the local hydrothermal activity sections change
substantially over the investigated period. Vertical displacement of the main
potential generation area, associated withthese hydrothermal activity sections,
is observed on the order of several hundred meters at the transition between
the period of quiescence (1993--1997) and the resumption of eruptive activity
in 1998 and 2007, respectively. From 1999 to March 2008, the hydrothermal
system was consistently located at relatively shallow depths.By quantitatively
determining the vertical displacement of hydrothermal fluids over 16 years, we
identify a significant link between hydrothermal system and magmatic activity.
Hydrothermal system depth below the surface is an indicator of the activity
level (pressurization/depressurization of the volcano) within the
shallowmagmatic systems. Thus, when used in conjunction with long term volcano
monitoring, this approach can contribute substantially to detection of the
precursory signals of changes in volcanic activity.

experiments such as AMS--02. Several groups have reported an excess of events
in the antiproton flux in the rigidity range of $10$--$20$ GV. However, the
theoretical modeling of baryon production is not straightforward and relies in
part on phenomenological models in Monte Carlo event generators. In this work,
we assess the impact of QCD uncertainties on the spectra of antiprotons from
dark-matter annihilation. As a proof-of-principle, we show that for a
two-parameter model that depends only on the thermally-averaged annihilation
cross section ($\langle \sigma v \rangle$) and the dark-matter mass ($M_\chi$),
QCD uncertainties can affect the best-fit mass by up to $\sim 14 \%$ (with
large uncertainties for large DM masses), depending on the choice of $M_\chi$
and the annihilation channel ($b\bar{b}$ or $W^+ W^-$), and $\langle \sigma v
\rangle$ by up to $\sim 10\%$. For comparison, changes to the underlying
diffusion parameters are found to be within $1\%$--$5\%$, and the results are
also quite resilient to the choice of cosmic-ray propagation model. These
findings indicate that QCD uncertainties need to be included in future DM
analyses. To facilitate full-fledged analyses, we provide the spectra in

that ALMA directly maps the brightness temperature, in contrast to the

points of intersection of the interface and the edges of a tetrahedron are
usually not coplanar, which makes the extension of the original 2D IFE methods
based on a piecewise linear approximation of the interface to the 3D case not
straightforward. We address this coplanarity issue by an approach where the
interface is approximated via discrete level set functions. This approach is
very convenient from a computational point of view since in many practical
applications the exact interface is often unknown, and only a discrete level
set function is available. As this approach has also not be considered in the
2D IFE methods, in this paper we present a unified framework for both 2D and 3D
cases. We consider an IFE method based on the traditional Crouzeix-Raviart
element using integral values on faces as degrees of freedom. The novelty of
the proposed IFE is the unisolvence of basis functions on arbitrary
triangles/tetrahedrons without any angle restrictions even for anisotropic
interface problems, which is advantageous over the IFE using nodal values as
degrees of freedom. The optimal bounds for the IFE interpolation errors are
proved on shape-regular triangulations. For the IFE method, optimal a priori
error and condition number estimates are derived with constants independent of
the location of the interface with respect to the unfitted mesh. The extension
to anisotropic interface problems with tensor coefficients is also discussed.

understanding their biochemical roles. Identifying the representative protein
structures for protein sequences is essential for analysis of proteins at
proteome scale. However, there are technical difficulties in identifying the
representative structure of a given protein sequence and providing accurate
mapping of residue indices. Existing databases of mapping between structures
and sequences are usually static that are not suitable for studying proteomes
with frequent gene model revisions. They often do not provide reliable and
consistent representative structures that maximizes sequence coverage.
Furthermore, proteins isomers are usually not properly resolved. Results: To
overcome these difficulties, we have developed a computational pipeline called
SeqMapPDB to provide high-quality representative PDB structures of given
sequences. It provides mapping to structures that fully cover the sequences
when available, or to the set of partial non-overlapping structural domains
that maximally cover the query sequence. The residue indices are accurate
mapped and isomeric proteins are resolved. SeqMapPDB is efficient and can
rapidly carry out proteome-wide mapping to the selected version of reference
genomes in real-time. Furthermore, SeqMapPDB provides the flexibility of a
stand-alone pipeline for large scale mapping of in-house sequence and structure

recovered by synchronous demodulation. We designed two flexible fast
demodulation systems located upstream of the camera, allowing us to overcome
the limiting camera acquisition frequency and thus to maximize the collection

signal was then sampled synchronously on the same image, repeatedly during
acquisition. This microscopy, called ModLoc, allows to experimentally improve
the localization precision by a factor of 2.4 in one direction, compared to
classical Gaussian fitting methods. A temporal study and an experimental
demonstration both show that the short lifetimes of the molecules in blinking

including intrinsic uncertainty quantification and robustness to over-fitting.
This work investigates the use of a new method, the change-point method, for
handling the varying length scales found in different tokamak regimes. The use
of the Student's t-distribution for the Bayesian likelihood probability is also
investigated and shown to be advantageous in providing good fits in profiles
with many outliers. To compare different methods, synthetic data generated from
analytic profiles is used to create a database enabling a quantitative
statistical comparison of which methods perform the best. Using a full Bayesian
approach with the change-point method, Mat\'ern kernel for the prior
probability, and Student's t-distribution for the likelihood is shown to give
the best results.

is to to explain $K$ experimental measurements by fitting to them a

regularly determined by least-square methods, i.e., by minimizing the sum of
the squared residuals between the $K$ model predictions and the $K$

computationally demanding numerical simulations. Bayesian optimization methods
are specifically suited for minimizing expensive model functions. However, in

scheme with improved performance over previous developments, that considers all
$K$ contributions of the model function and that is specifically suited for
parameter reconstruction problems which are often based on hundreds of

proposed method outperforms established optimization methods. It also enables
to determine accurate uncertainty estimates with very few observations of the

certain ranges of waves and wavemaker types in their applicability.
Alternatively, machine learning can be considered to find nonlinear functional
relationships. Therefore, this paper proposes a simple and universal framework
for generating and absorbing waves based on machine learning. This framework
trains neural networks to establish the transfer function between the
free-surface elevation on the wavemaker and the wavemaker velocity.
Significantly, penalty term and data augmentation techniques based on
wave-making mechanisms are introduced to increase the generalization ability of
neural networks, rather than pure data-driven. Therefore, once the target wave
profiles in front of the wavemaker are given, it can realize generating waves
and absorbing reflected waves at the same time. Taking piston and plunger
wavemakers as examples, an in-house numerical solver is applied to simulate
both wave generation and absorption. The simulated wave profiles and wave
orbital velocities are validated with analytical solutions, showing that the
proposed framework is effective at eliminating the re-reflection wave. Then,
the validation for generating the solitary wave and the New-year wave is
performed, indicating that the generated waves agree quite well with the
desired wave elevation. The proposed framework can facilitate the wavemaker
design in the future, and no complex theoretical derivation is required.

collected datasets without exploring the environment. Directly applying
off-policy algorithms to offline RL usually fails due to the extrapolation
error caused by the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Previous methods tackle
such problem by penalizing the Q-values of OOD actions or constraining the
trained policy to be close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, such methods
typically prevent the generalization of value functions beyond the offline data
and also lack precise characterization of OOD data. In this paper, we propose
Pessimistic Bootstrapping for offline RL (PBRL), a purely uncertainty-driven
offline algorithm without explicit policy constraints. Specifically, PBRL
conducts uncertainty quantification via the disagreement of bootstrapped
Q-functions, and performs pessimistic updates by penalizing the value function
based on the estimated uncertainty. To tackle the extrapolating error, we
further propose a novel OOD sampling method. We show that such OOD sampling and
pessimistic bootstrapping yields provable uncertainty quantifier in linear
MDPs, thus providing the theoretical underpinning for PBRL. Extensive
experiments on D4RL benchmark show that PBRL has better performance compared to
the state-of-the-art algorithms.

been discussed as a potential source. For SiC, silicate, and graphite presolar

strongly impacts simulated $\delta ^{29}$Si values from classical novae. Our

differs from previous results by up to 50\% in the classical nova temperature
range ($T$ $=$ $100$ $-$ $400$~MK), while the rate uncertainty is reduced by up
to a factor of $3$. Using our new reaction rate in Monte Carlo reaction network
and hydrodynamic simulations of classical novae, we estimate $\delta ^{29}$Si
values with much reduced uncertainties. Our results establish $\delta ^{29}$Si
values measured in presolar grains as a sensitive probe for assessing their
classical nova paternity. We also demonstrate that $\delta ^{30}$Si values from

the anthropic window of Agrawal {\it et al.} (ABDS). Such a set-up predicts a
light Higgs mass m_h~ 125 GeV with sparticles generally beyond LHC bounds. We
discuss consequences for LHC searches: light higgsinos, highly mixed TeV-scale
top squarks, same-sign diboson events and m_{\tg}~ 2-5 TeV. We expect dark
matter to consist of an axion/higgsino-like WIMP admixture.

of an oscillation mode injected by inverter-based solar energy sources in

analysis of real-world ambient synchrophasor and point-of-wave data. The
analysis was performed by developing customized synchrophasor analysis tools
deployed on the PredictiveGrid^{TM} platform implemented at Dominion Energy.
Herein, we describe and illustrate the preliminary analysis results acquired
from spectrogram observations, power spectral density plots, and mode shape

graphene, few-layer graphene, h-BN, and graphene-BN heterostructure. It is
found that they almost have the same geometry-strain response. Consequently,
the NPR in bilayer graphene, triple-layer graphene, and graphene-BN

The velocity fields of the vanishing-Poynting observers in the locally
non-rotating reference frames are determined using the 3+1 decomposition
formalism. From a methodological point of view, and considering a
classification of the electromagnetic field based on its invariants, it is
convenient to separate the consideration of the vanishing-Poynting observers
into two cases corresponding to the pure and non-pure fields, additionally if
there are regions where the field rotates with the speed of light (light
surfaces) it becomes necessary to split these observers into two subfamilies.
We present several examples of relevance in astrophysics and general
relativity, such as pure rotating dipolar-like magnetic fields and the
electromagnetic field of the Kerr-Newman solution. For the latter example, we
see that vanishing-Poynting observers also measure a vanishing super-Poynting
vector, confirming recent results in the literature. Finally, for all non-null

pathology diagnosis has taken advantage of in-air trajectories. A similar
situation occurred in biometric security applications where the goal is to
identify or verify an individual using his signature or handwriting. These
studies do not consider the distance of the pen tip to the writing surface.
This is due to the fact that current acquisition devices do not provide height
formation. However, it is quite straightforward to differentiate movements at
two different heights: a) short distance: height lower or equal to 1 cm above a
surface of digitizer, the digitizer provides x and y coordinates. b) long
distance: height exceeding 1 cm, the only information available is a time stamp
that indicates the time that a specific stroke has spent at long distance.
Although short distance has been used in several papers, long distances have
been ignored and will be investigated in this paper. Methods In this paper, we
will analyze a large set of databases (BIOSECURID, EMOTHAW, PaHaW,
Oxygen-Therapy and SALT), which contain a total amount of 663 users and 17951
files. We have specifically studied: a) the percentage of time spent
on-surface, in-air at short distance, and in-air at long distance for different
user profiles (pathological and healthy users) and different tasks; b) The
potential use of these signals to improve classification rates. Results and
conclusions Our experimental results reveal that long-distance movements
represent a very small portion of the total execution time (0.5 % in the case
of signatures and 10.4% for uppercase words of BIOSECUR-ID, which is the
largest database). In addition, significant differences have been found in the
comparison of pathological versus control group for letter l in PaHaW database

detect the failure to enroll situations. The main contribution of this work is
the management of failure to enroll situations by means of a new proposal,
called intelligent enrollment, which consists of consistency checking in order
to automatically reject low quality samples. This strategy lets to enhance the
verification errors up to 22% when leaving out 8% of the users. In this
situation 8% of the people cannot be enrolled in the system and must be
verified by other biometrics or by human abilities. These people are identified
with intelligent enrollment and the situation can be thus managed. In addition
we also propose a DCT-based feature extractor with threshold coding and

controversial discussions of the quality of art, for which objective
quantification is nonsensical. We therefore consider a music-generating
algorithm as a counterpart to a human musician, in a setting where reciprocal
interplay is to lead to new experiences, both for the musician and the
audience. To obtain this behaviour, we resort to the framework of recurrent
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and learn to generate music, seeded by a human
musician. In the learned model, we generate novel musical sequences by
interpolation in latent space. Standard VAEs however do not guarantee any form
of smoothness in their latent representation. This translates into abrupt
changes in the generated music sequences. To overcome these limitations, we
regularise the decoder and endow the latent space with a flat Riemannian
manifold, i.e., a manifold that is isometric to the Euclidean space. As a
result, linearly interpolating in the latent space yields realistic and smooth
musical changes that fit the type of machine--musician interactions we aim for.
We provide empirical evidence for our method via a set of experiments on music
datasets and we deploy our model for an interactive jam session with a
professional drummer. The live performance provides qualitative evidence that
the latent representation can be intuitively interpreted and exploited by the
drummer to drive the interplay. Beyond the musical application, our approach
showcases an instance of human-centred design of machine-learning models,
driven by interpretability and the interaction with the end user.

that processing time and computer resources may substantially increase by

considered training problems is a direct consequence of the universal
approximation theorem and that the underlying mechanisms also cause, e.g.,
Lp-best approximation problems to be ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard for all
networks that do not have a dense image. The latter result also holds without
the assumption of local affine linearity and without any conditions on the
hidden layers. The paper concludes with a numerical experiment which
demonstrates that spurious local minima can indeed affect the convergence
behavior of gradient-based solution algorithms in practice.

fundamental task found throughout the data sciences. A collection of
principles, algorithms, and tools has been developed for performing such tasks
in the last decades (Pearl, 2000). One of the pervasive requirements found
throughout this literature is the articulation of assumptions, which commonly
appear in the form of causal diagrams. Despite the power of this approach,
there are significant settings where the knowledge necessary to specify a
causal diagram over all variables is not available, particularly in complex,
high-dimensional domains. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical modeling
tool called cluster DAGs (for short, C-DAGs) that allows for the partial
specification of relationships among variables based on limited prior
knowledge, alleviating the stringent requirement of specifying a full causal
diagram. A C-DAG specifies relationships between clusters of variables, while
the relationships between the variables within a cluster are left unspecified,
and can be seen as a graphical representation of an equivalence class of causal
diagrams that share the relationships among the clusters. We develop the
foundations and machinery for valid inferences over C-DAGs about the clusters
of variables at each layer of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (Pearl and Mackenzie
2018; Bareinboim et al. 2020) - L1 (probabilistic), L2 (interventional), and L3
(counterfactual). In particular, we prove the soundness and completeness of
d-separation for probabilistic inference in C-DAGs. Further, we demonstrate the
validity of Pearl's do-calculus rules over C-DAGs and show that the standard ID
identification algorithm is sound and complete to systematically compute causal
effects from observational data given a C-DAG. Finally, we show that C-DAGs are
valid for performing counterfactual inferences about clusters of variables.

aggregates local models after their traversals through a series of logically

installed and working in Spanish police premises. The first one is a Printrak
AFIS 2000 system with a database of more than 450,000 fingerprints, while the
second one is a NEC AFIS 21 SAID NT-LEXS Release 2.4.4 with a database of more
than 15 million fingerprints. Our experiments reveal that although both systems
can manage inkless fingerprints, the latest one offers better experimental
results

of large-scale systems. We observe that such memory allocation patterns, in the
context of multi-threading, are subject to high latencies, due to
\texttt{mutex} contention in the system memory allocator. Latencies incurred
due to such \texttt{mutex} contention produce undesirable bottlenecks in
user-facing services. Thus, we propose a ""memorization"" based technique,
\texttt{MemoMalloc}, for optimizing overall latency, with only moderate
increases in peak memory usage. Specifically, our technique consists of a
runtime component, which captures all allocations and uniquely associates them
with their high-level source operation, and a static analysis component, which
constructs an efficient allocation ""plan"". We present an implementation of
\texttt{MemoMalloc} in the PyTorch deep learning framework and evaluate memory
consumption and execution performance on a wide range of DNN architectures. We
find that \texttt{MemoMalloc} outperforms state-of-the-art general purpose
memory allocators, with respect to DNN inference latency, by as much as 40\%.

of digital audio recordings. Although forensic audio has been addressed in
several articles, the existing approaches are focused on analog magnetic
recordings, which are less prevalent because of the large amount of digital
recorders available on the market (optical, solid state, hard disks, etc.). An
approach based on digital signal processing that consists of spread spectrum
techniques for speech watermarking is presented. This approach presents the
advantage that the authentication is based on the signal itself rather than the
recording format. Thus, it is valid for usual recording devices in
police-controlled telephone intercepts. In addition, our proposal allows for
the introduction of relevant information such as the recording date and time
and all the relevant data (this is not always possible with classical systems).
Our experimental results reveal that the speech watermarking procedure does not
interfere in a significant way with the posterior forensic speaker
identification.

which, for internal lines, are built upon spin/polarization-sum relationships.
In turn, these are normally constructed upon plane-wave solutions of the free
field equations. A question that may now arise is whether such
spin/polarization-sums can be generalized. In the past there has been a first
attempt at generalizing spin sums for fermionic fields in terms of the
Michel-Wightman identities. In this paper we aim at finding the most general

increasingly important in drug discovery. However, in contrast to other
domains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not
satisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which
calls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we
study multi-task learning for molecular property prediction in a novel setting,
where a relation graph between tasks is available. We first construct a dataset
(ChEMBL-STRING) including around 400 tasks as well as a task relation graph.
Then to better utilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM
to systematically investigate the structured task modeling from two
perspectives. (1) In the \emph{latent} space, we model the task representations
by applying a state graph neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph. (2) In
the \emph{output} space, we employ structured prediction with the energy-based
model (EBM), which can be efficiently trained through noise-contrastive
estimation (NCE) approach. Empirical results justify the effectiveness of
SGNN-EBM. Code is available on https://github.com/chao1224/SGNN-EBM.

space dimension for the Internet and other graphs, based on typed edges (links)
from an ensemble of starting points. The method is applied to CAIDA's ITDK data
for the Internet. The effective dimension at different scales is calibrated to
the conventional Euclidean dimension using low dimensional hypercubes. Internet
spacetime has a 'foamy' multi-scale containment hierarchy, with interleaving
semantic types. There is an emergent scale for approximate long range order in
the device node spectrum, but this is not evident at the AS level, where there
is finite distance containment. Statistical dimension is thus a locally varying
measure, which is scale-dependent, giving an visual analogy for the hidden
scale-dependent dimensions of Kaluza-Klein theories. The characteristic
exterior dimensions of the Internet lie between 1.66 +- 0.00 and 6.12 +- 0.00,
and maximal interior dimensions rise to 7.7.

incorporating a finite constraint solver with the spreadsheet computing
paradigm. This framework allows the individual cells in the spreadsheet to be
attached to either a finite domain or a constraint specifying the relationship
among the cells. The framework provides an interface for constraint solving and
further enhances the spreadsheet computing paradigm by providing a set of
spreadsheet-specific constraints that will aid in controlling the scalability
of large spreadsheet applications implementations. Finally, we provide examples
to demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the extended spreadsheet
