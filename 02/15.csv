value $<1$, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays
polynomially fast to 0. That is, for every such game, there exists a constant
$c>0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is
at most $n^{-c}$. Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two
additional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer games, that may be of
independent interest:
  Playerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet
size): We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every
game with value $<1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel
repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to 0. More precisely, our
result applies for playerwise connected games, with any number of players and
any alphabet size. The class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger
than the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which
exponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected
games that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were
previously known [Ver96].
  Exponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game: In the 3-player
anti-correlation game, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the
remaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce
different outputs in $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold
parallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to 0. Only inverse
Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96]. This game was studied and
motivated in several previous works. In particular, Holmgren and Yang gave it
as an example for a 3-player game whose non-signaling value (is smaller than 1
and yet) does not decrease at all under parallel repetition [HY19].

  Low-Degree Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the classical Minimum Crossing Number problem: given an
$n$-vertex graph $G$, compute a drawing of $G$ in the plane, while minimizing
the number of crossings between the images of its edges. This is a fundamental
and extensively studied problem, whose approximability status is widely open.
In all currently known approximation algorithms, the approximation factor
depends polynomially on $\Delta$ -- the maximum vertex degree in $G$. The best
current approximation algorithm achieves an $O(n^{1/2-\varepsilon}\cdot
\text{poly}(\Delta\cdot\log n))$-approximation, for a small fixed constant
$\epsilon$, while the best negative result is APX-hardness, leaving a large gap
in our understanding of this basic problem. In this paper we design a
randomized $O\left(2^{O((\log n)^{7/8}\log\log
n)}\cdot\text{poly}(\Delta)\right )$-approximation algorithm for Minimum
Crossing Number. This is the first approximation algorithm for the problem that
achieves a subpolynomial in $n$ approximation factor (albeit only in graphs
whose maximum vertex degree is subpolynomial in $n$).
  In order to achieve this approximation factor, we design a new algorithm for
a closely related problem called Crossing Number with Rotation System, in
which, for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, the circular ordering, in which the images
of the edges incident to $v$ must enter the image of $v$ in the drawing is
fixed as part of the input. Combining this result with the recent reduction of
[Chuzhoy, Mahabadi, Tan '20] immediately yields the improved approximation
algorithm for Minimum Crossing Number. We introduce several new technical
tools, that we hope will be helpful in obtaining better algorithms for the
problem in the future.

known to chatter when combined with linear function approximation: SARSA does

the reward is not too large. Existing works regarding the convergence of linear

arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes the behavior of linear
SARSA for a new regime.

  In this paper, we formulate abelian 3d mirror symmetry as an equivalence

from multiple synchrophasors, i.e., phasor measurement units (PMUs), we propose
to identify events by extracting features based on modal dynamics. We combine
such traditional physics-based feature extraction methods with machine learning
to distinguish different event types. Including all measurement channels at
each PMU allows exploiting diverse features but also requires learning
classification models over a high-dimensional space. To address this issue,
various feature selection methods are implemented to choose the best subset of
features. Using the obtained subset of features, we investigate the performance
of two well-known classification models, namely, logistic regression (LR) and
support vector machines (SVM) to identify generation loss and line trip events

radio arrays, is one of the major technical challenges to overcome for the next
generation astroparticle detectors. In this context, we study polarisation
signatures of simulated radio signals to perform an identification of the
associated air-showers initiated by cosmic-rays and neutrinos. We compare the
two sources of radio emission (the charge excess and geomagnetic) and show that
the former is almost negligible for inclined (zenith angle $>65^{\circ}$)
cosmic-ray air-showers. This provides an efficient background rejection
criterion at the DAQ level, based on the projection of the total electric field
along the direction of the local magnetic field. This relevant quantity can be
easily computed -- even in an online treatment -- for antennas measuring three
orthogonal polarisations. Independently of the experimental antenna layout, we
estimate that assuming a random polarisation of noise events, a rejection from
$\approx 72\%$ (for a non favorable detector location) to $\approx 93\%$ (for a
favorable location) of the noise induced events and a trigger efficiency of 87%
(93%) with a $3\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) trigger threshold level should be
achievable. We also show that neutrino-induced showers present a charge excess
to geomagnetic signal ratio up to $\sim 10$ times higher than for cosmic ray
showers. Although this characteristic makes the identification of
neutrino-induced showers challenging via the method developed here, it provides
an efficient criterion to perform an offline discrimination between cosmic-ray
and neutrino primaries. The stronger charge excess emission will also help the
reconstruction of air-shower parameters, such as the core position.

compared to proto-solar. The origin of this enrichment and whether it represent
the bulk composition of the planetary envelope remain unknown. Internal
structure models of Jupiter suggest that its envelope is separated from the
deep interior and that the planet is not fully mixed. This implies that
Jupiter's atmosphere was enriched with heavy elements just before the end of
its formation. Such enrichment can be a result of late planetesimal accretion.
However, in-situ Jupiter formation models suggest the decreasing accretion rate
with increasing planetary mass, which cannot explain Jupiter's atmospheric
enrichment. In this study, we model Jupiter's formation and show that an
migration of proto-Jupiter from $\sim$ 20 AU to its current location can lead
to a late planetesimal accretion and atmospheric enrichment. Late planetesimal
accretion does not occur if proto-Jupiter migrates only a few AU. We suggest
that if Jupiter's outermost layer is fully-mixed and is relatively thin (up to
$\sim$ 20\% of its mass), such late accretion can explain its measured
atmospheric composition. It is therefore possible that Jupiter underwent
significant orbital migration followed by late planetesimal accretion.

We take a hybrid approach that cascades a linear AEC with a neural post-filter.
The former is used to deal with the linear echo components while the latter
suppresses the residual non-linear echo components. We use gated convolutional
F-T-LSTM neural network (GFTNN) as the backbone and shape the post-filter by a
multi-task learning (MTL) framework, where a voice activity detection (VAD)
module is adopted as an auxiliary task along with echo suppression, with the
aim to avoid over suppression that may cause speech distortion. Moreover, we
adopt an echo-aware loss function, where the mean square error (MSE) loss can
be optimized particularly for every time-frequency bin (TF-bin) according to
the signal-to-echo ratio (SER), leading to further suppression on the echo.
Extensive ablation study shows that the time delay estimation (TDE) module in
neural post-filter leads to better perceptual quality, and an adaptive filter
with better convergence will bring consistent performance gain for the
post-filter. Besides, we find that using the linear echo as the input of our
neural post-filter is a better choice than using the reference signal directly.
In the ICASSP 2022 AEC-Challenge, our approach has ranked the 1st place on word
accuracy (WAcc) (0.817) and the 3rd place on both mean opinion score (MOS)

that the accretion luminosity is much less than the neutron star's cooling
luminosity, which in turn is below the upper limit for $L_X$. In this scenario

embeddings of tree- and graph-structured data, upon which various hyperbolic
networks have been developed. Existing hyperbolic networks encode geometric
priors not only for the input, but also at every layer of the network. This
approach involves repeatedly mapping to and from hyperbolic space, which makes
these networks complicated to implement, computationally expensive to scale,
and numerically unstable to train. In this paper, we propose a simpler
approach: learn a hyperbolic embedding of the input, then map once from it to
Euclidean space using a mapping that encodes geometric priors by respecting the
isometries of hyperbolic space, and finish with a standard Euclidean network.
The key insight is to use a random feature mapping via the eigenfunctions of
the Laplace operator, which we show can approximate any isometry-invariant

neural networks: using even a linear graph model yields significant
improvements in both efficiency and performance over other hyperbolic baselines

out-of-distribution is that they fail to recover the ""correct"" features. We
challenge this notion with a simple experiment which suggests that ERM already
learns sufficient features and that the current bottleneck is not feature
learning, but robust regression. Our findings also imply that given a small
amount of data from the target distribution, retraining only the last linear
layer will give excellent performance. We therefore argue that devising simpler
methods for learning predictors on existing features is a promising direction
for future research. Towards this end, we introduce Domain-Adjusted Regression
(DARE), a convex objective for learning a linear predictor that is provably
robust under a new model of distribution shift. Rather than learning one
function, DARE performs a domain-specific adjustment to unify the domains in a
canonical latent space and learns to predict in this space. Under a natural
model, we prove that the DARE solution is the minimax-optimal predictor for a
constrained set of test distributions. Further, we provide the first
finite-environment convergence guarantee to the minimax risk, improving over
existing analyses which only yield minimax predictors after an environment
threshold. Evaluated on finetuned features, we find that DARE compares
favorably to prior methods, consistently achieving equal or better performance.

graph-matching: taking the over-view point clouds generated from
stereo/multi-stereo satellite images and the street-view point clouds generated
from monocular video images as the inputs, the proposed method models segments
of buildings as nodes of graphs, both detected from the satellite-based and
street-view based point clouds, thus to form the registration as a
graph-matching problem to allow non-rigid matches; to enable a robust solution
and fully utilize the topological relations between these segments, we propose
to address the graph-matching problem on its conjugate graph solved through a
belief-propagation algorithm. The matched nodes will be subject to a further
optimization to allow precise-registration, followed by a constrained bundle
adjustment on the street-view image to keep 2D29 3D consistencies, which yields
well-registered street-view images and point clouds to the satellite point

intersection of information science, computer science, mathematics, philosophy,
and quantum science, working at the core of our quantum technologies.
Regardless of its scientific success, quantum information is not exempt from
the intrinsic features that come from the fact that scientists are humans and
members of society: both the good and the bad of our social practices leak into
the scientific activity. In our scientific community, diversity and equal
opportunity problems are particularly difficult to observe due to social,
economic, or cultural barriers, often remaining invisible. How can our lack of
awareness negatively influence the progress of science in the long term? How
can our community grow into a better version of itself?
  This article reflects on how research events - such as conferences - can
contribute to a shift in our culture. This reflection draws on what we learn
from Q-Turn: an initiative triggered by postdoctoral researchers to discuss
these questions. One of Q-turn's main missions is to foster an inclusive
community and highlight outstanding research that may be under-appreciated in
other high-impact venues due to systemic biases. As well as a scientific
program, Q-turn features talks and discussions on issues that affect the
quantum information community, ranging from diversity and inclusion, health and
mental health, to workers' rights.
  In this perspective article, we will consider Q-Turn as an example of how a
research community can work to tackle systematic biases, review the successes,
and identify further points for development.

We extend the technique beyond the simple stream operators considered in

devices, is widely used in military and aerospace avionic platforms. Due to its
lack of security mechanisms, MIL-STD-1553 is exposed to cyber threats. The
methods previously proposed to address these threats are very limited,
resulting in the need for more advanced techniques. Inspired by the defense in
depth principle, we propose AnoMili, a novel protection system for the
MIL-STD-1553 bus, which consists of: (i) a physical intrusion detection
mechanism that detects unauthorized devices connected to the 1553 bus, even if
they are passive (sniffing), (ii) a device fingerprinting mechanism that
protects against spoofing attacks (two approaches are proposed: prevention and
detection), (iii) a context-based anomaly detection mechanism, and (iv) an
anomaly explanation engine responsible for explaining the detected anomalies in
real time. We evaluate AnoMili's effectiveness and practicability in two real
1553 hardware-based testbeds. The effectiveness of the anomaly explanation
engine is also demonstrated. All of the detection and prevention mechanisms
employed had high detection rates (over 99.45%) with low false positive rates.
The context-based anomaly detection mechanism obtained perfect results when
evaluated on a dataset used in prior work.

non-BPS extremal black hole attractors are always unique for a given,
supporting electric charge configuration; moreover, non-BPS black holes are
always unstable, and thus they decay into constituent BPS/anti-BPS pairs. For
what concerns extremal black strings, we confirm uniqueness also for non-BPS
strings in two-moduli CICY models. On the other hand, we discover multiple
non-BPS extremal black string attractors (with different tensions) in most of
the two-moduli THCY models, and we determine the corresponding magnetic
configurations supporting them; this indicates the existence of
volume-minimizing representatives in the same homology class having different
values of their local minimal volume. Moreover, we find that non-BPS black
strings, both for single and multiple solutions, are stable and thus enjoy
recombination of their constituent BPS/anti-BPS pairs.

binary with an outer companion. A highly misaligned circumbinary disk around
the inner binary is subject to two competing effects: (i) nodal precession
about the inner binary eccentricity vector that leads to an increase in
misalignment (polar alignment) and (ii) Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations of
eccentricity and inclination driven by the outer companion that leads to a
reduction in the misalignment. The outcome depends upon the ratio of the
timescales of these effects. If the inner binary torque dominates, then the
disk aligns to a polar orientation. If the outer companion torque dominates,
then the disk undergoes KL oscillations. In that case, the highly eccentric and
misaligned disk is disrupted and accreted by the inner binary, while some mass
is transferred to the outer companion. However, when the torques are similar,
the outer parts of the circumbinary disk can undergo large eccentricity
oscillations while the inclination remains close to the polar orientation. The
range of initial disk inclinations that evolve to a polar orientation is
smaller in the presence of the outer companion. Disk breaking is also more
likely, at least temporarily, during the polar alignment process. The stellar
orbits in HD 98800 have parameters such that polar alignment of the
circumbinary disk is expected. In the absence of the gas, solid particles are
unstable at much smaller radii than the gas disk inner tidal truncation radius
because KL driven eccentricity leads to close encounters with the binary.

surprisingly are independent of $d$, $K$ and the batch size $m$, under
appropriate choices of a slightly decreased learning rate. For bounded
nonconvex losses and a batch size $m=1$, we additionally show that both
generalization error and learning rate are independent of $d$ and $K$, and
remain essentially the same as for the SGD, even for two function evaluations.
Our results extensively extend and consistently recover established results for
SGD in prior work, on both generalization bounds and corresponding learning
rates. If additionally $m=n$, where $n$ is the dataset size, we derive

the vacuum state decay producing electron-positron pairs. Here we investigate
emission of soft photons which accompanies a nonperturbative process of pair

in the fine-structure constant. It is shown that the presence of photons in the
initial state gives rise to an additional (stimulated) channel of photon
emission besides the pure vacuum one. On the other hand, the number of final
(signal) photons includes also a negative contribution due to photon absorption
within the pair production process. These contributions are evaluated and
compared. To obtain quantitative predictions in the domain of realistic field
parameters, we employ the WKB approach. We propose to use an optical probe
photon beam, whose intensity changes as it traverses a spatial region where a
strong electric component of a background laser field is present. It is
demonstrated that relative intensity changes on the level of $1 \%$ can be
experimentally observed once the intensity of the strong background field
exceeds $10^{27}~\text{W/cm}^2$ within a large laser wavelength interval. This
finding is expected to significantly support possible experimental
investigations of nonlinear QED phenomena in the nonperturbative regime.

the rotation curve model of the LMC. Using nebular and wind emission lines, we
infer a velocity dispersion for LBVs of $40.0^{+9.9}_{-6.6}$ km s$^{-1}$. To
put LBVs in context with other evolved massive stars, we compare this to red
supergiants (RSGs) in the LMC, which have a significantly smaller velocity
dispersion of $16.5^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$ km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, 33% of LBVs have
radial velocities of more than 25 km s$^{-1}$, while only 9% of RSG have such
high velocities. This suggests that LBVs include more runaways than the
population of stars that evolves to become RSGs, indicating that LBVs are
preferentially kicked by a companion's supernova explosion as compared to other
evolved massive stars. Our investigation reveals other interesting clues about
LBVs in the LMC as well. We find that radial velocities and widths of emission
lines for each target remain constant over several epochs, whereas measured
absorption lines exhibit highly variable radial velocities for R110, R81, S
Dor, Sk-69$^\circ$142a, and Sk-69$^\circ$279. These five LBVs probably have a
binary companion. Additionally, we find that Sk-69$^\circ$142a experienced its
second outburst in 2019 September, shifting its status from candidate to
confirmed LBV.

expected from such rapidly rotating stars. We present results from a

of 29 sources have a photometric period between 0.1-0.2d, cover spectral
classes of M0-4V, and show no evidence for flares. We detect only one source
with clear radial velocity shifts, with another two having Gaia RUWE values
which suggests they are binaries. Further observations reveal the former star
possibly contains a brown dwarf companion with a mass of M$_2$>58 M$_{\rm Jup}$
and probability P(M$_2$<90 M$_{\rm Jup}$) = 50\%. There is no evidence for the
companion in our spectra, strengthening the case for a brown dwarf companion.
We also examine the folded TESS light curves of all our targets, finding at
least two are eclipsing binaries and one which has been contaminated by a
spatially nearby $\delta$ Sct star. We estimate that around 1/4 of our targets

majority of our targets are consistent with being single, low mass stars whose
variability is due to starspots. We outline the possible reasons why they are
not flare active despite being such rapid rotators.

utilise VLT/FORS2 spectropolarimetric data of ten M dwarf UFR stars between
spectral types $\sim$M2 - M6 all with $P_{\rm rot} <$ 1, to detect the presence
of a magnetic field. We divide our sample into rotation period bins of equal
size, with one star having many more flares in the TESS lightcurve than the
other. We also provide an analysis of the long-term variability within our
sample using TESS lightcurves taken during Cycles 1 and 3 (up to three years
apart). We identify 605 flares from our sample which have energies between
2.0$\times$10$^{31}$ and 5.4$\times$10$^{34}$ erg. Although we find no
significance difference in the flare rate between the Cycles, two of our
targets display changes in their lightcurve morphology, potentially caused by a
difference in the spot distribution. Overall, we find five stars (50%) in our
sample have a detectable magnetic field with strengths $\sim$1 - 2 kG. Of these
five, four were the more flare active stars within the period bins with one
being the less flare active star. It would appear the magnetic field strength
may not be the answer to the lack of flaring activity and supersaturation or
magnetic field configuration may play a role. However, it is clear the
relationship between rotation and activity is more complex than a steady
decrease over time.

white dwarf (WD) mass and the rate at which it accretes mass from its donor.
One of the advancements in this field is the understanding that the occurrence
of a nova eruption depends on the presence of heavy elements in the envelope,
and that the concentration of these elements is highly dependent on the time
allotted for accretion. This results in many features of the eruption being
correlated with the mass fractions of heavy elements in the ejected material,
however, the accreted material is always assumed to be of solar metallicity.
Here we explored the entire range of accretion rates onto a 1.25$M_\odot$ WD
for two cases of highly enriched accreted material and find enrichment to have
an influence on certain features for high accretion rates, while the effect of
enrichment on low accretion rates is negligible. We further find that the
ignition of the thermonuclear runaway which is known to be dependent on the
accumulation of a critical mass, is actually dependent on the accumulation of a
critical amount of heavy elements.

Mott insulators, the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model, to investigate the
potential of using HHG response to distinguish these materials. We develop an
analytical argument based on the Magnus expansion approximation to evolution by
the Schrodinger equation that indicates decreased distinguishability of Mott
insulators as lattice spacing, $a$, and the strength of the driving field,
$F_0$, increase relative to the frequency, $\omega_0$. This argument is then
bolstered through numerical simulations of different systems and subsequent
comparison of their responses in both the time and frequency domain.
Ultimately, we demonstrate reduced resolution of Mott insulators in both
domains when the dimensionless parameter $g \equiv aF_0 / \omega_0$ is large,
though the time domain provides higher distinguishability. Conductors are
exempted from these trends, becoming much more distinguishable in the frequency

geometric point of view in different geometric backgrounds. We propose a
Hamilton Jacobi equation for different geometric structures attending to one
particular characterization: whether they fulfill the Jacobi and Leibniz
identities simultaneously, or if at least they satisfy one of them.
  In this regard, we review the case of time dependent and dissipative physical
systems as systems that fulfill the Jacobi identity but not the Leibnitz
identity. Furthermore, we review the contact evolution Hamilton Jacobi theory
as a split off the regular contact geometry, and that actually satisfies the
Leibniz rule instead of Jacobi.
  Furthermore, we include a novel result, which is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
for conformal Hamiltonian vector fields as a generalization of the well known
Hamilton Jacobi on a symplectic manifold, that is retrieved in the case of a
zero conformal factor. The interest of a geometric Hamilton Jacobi equation is
the primordial observation that if a Hamiltonian vector field can be projected
into a configuration manifold by means of a 1-form dW, then the integral curves
of the projected vector field can be transformed into integral curves of the
Hamiltonian vector field provided that W is a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. Geometrically, the solution of the Hamilton Jacobi equation plays the
role of a Lagrangian submanifold of a certain bundle. Exploiting these features
in different geometric scenarios we propose a geometric theory for multiple
physical systems depending on the fundamental identities that their dynamic
satisfies. Different examples are pictured to reflect the results provided,

exploration, exploiting an arbitrary number of hierarchical fidelity levels,
i.e., performance evaluations coming from different models, solvers, or
discretizations, characterized by different accuracy. The method is intended to
accurately predict the design performance while reducing the computational
effort required by simulation-driven design (SDD) to achieve the global
optimum. The overall MF prediction is evaluated as a low-fidelity trained
surrogate corrected with the surrogates of the errors between consecutive
fidelity levels. Surrogates are based on stochastic radial basis functions
(SRBF) with least squares regression and in-the-loop optimization of
hyperparameters to deal with noisy training data. The method adaptively queries
new training data, selecting both the design points and the required fidelity
level via an active learning approach. This is based on the lower confidence
bounding method, which combines performance prediction and associated
uncertainty to select the most promising design regions. The fidelity levels
are selected considering the benefit-cost ratio associated with their use in
the training. The method's performance is assessed and discussed using four
analytical tests and three SDD problems based on computational fluid dynamics

source of Markovian noise that affects the dynamics of the system. Here we
extend this framework to consider a non-Markovian environment, one whose
dynamics have memory and which create additional correlations with the system
variables, and illustrate this with a selection of simple examples. Such an
environment produces a rich variety of behaviours. In particular, for a case of
thermal relaxation, the distributions of entropy produced under the
non-Markovian dynamics differ from the equivalent case of Markovian dynamics
only by a delay time. When a time-dependent external work protocol is turned
on, the system's correlations with the environment can either assist or hinder
its approach to equilibrium, and affect its production of entropy, depending on
the coupling strength between the system and environment.

invariant representations without the need for human annotations. Nonetheless,
the desired invariant representation is achieved by utilising prior online
transformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is
customised for a particular data type, e.g., visual data, and further
modifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other
hand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework,
mainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant
representation. This paper proposes a generic SSL framework based on a
constrained self-labelling assignment process that prevents degenerate
solutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a
self-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process
of adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the
self-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated
from the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive
learning is designed by leveraging both the self-labelling assignment and the
self-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation
process is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority
of state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To
validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of

fixed constant. It is well known that $N$ weakly converges to the Poisson
distribution with mean ${d^3}/{6}$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We address the
upper tail problem for $N,$ namely, we investigate how fast $k$ must grow, so
that the probability of $\{N\ge k\}$ is not well approximated anymore by the
tail of the corresponding Poisson variable. Proving that the tail exhibits a
sharp phase transition, we essentially show that the upper tail is governed by
Poisson behavior only when $k^{1/3} \log k< (\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \log n$
(sub-critical regime) as well as pin down the tail behavior when $k^{1/3} \log
k> (\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \log n$ (super-critical regime). We further prove
a structure theorem, showing that the sub-critical upper tail behavior is
dictated by the appearance of almost $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles whereas in
the supercritical regime, the excess triangles arise from a clique like
structure of size approximately $(6k)^{1/3}$. This settles the long-standing
upper-tail problem in this case, answering a question of Aldous, complementing
a long sequence of works, spanning multiple decades, culminating in (Harel,
Moussat, Samotij,'19) which analyzed the problem only in the regime $p\gg

a point of $f^{-1}\{y_0\}$ is mapped to a neighborhood of $y_0$. Assuming this
estimate for a fixed $K$ at every $y_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is equivalent to
assuming that the map $f$ is $K$-quasiregular, even if the choice of $\Sigma$

we obtain a higher-dimensional version of the argument principle that played a

influence planet habitability. Specifically, we model how rapid rotation
influences a planet's irradiation and determine the location of the habitable
zone for stars in the mass range $1.3M_\odot\leq M_\star\leq 2.2M_\odot$. Rapid
stellar rotation can dramatically change a star's luminosity and spectral
energy distribution and, therefore, can impact the habitability of any
surrounding planets. Stars of mass $M_\star\gtrsim1.3M_\odot$ commonly rotate
near their breakup speeds, which causes two effects relevant to planet
habitability. First, these stars flatten into oblate spheroids with shorter
polar radii and elongated equatorial radii. Second, rapid rotation induces a
pole-to-equator temperature gradient on the surface of these stars. Using a 1D
climate model, we calculate the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone of
well-known rapid rotators and average theoretical stars in our stellar mass
range. We find that, in general, rapid rotation causes the habitable zone to
reside closer in than for a non-rotating equivalent star. We also find that
gravity darkening dramatically reduces stellar UV emission, which combats the
common assumption that high-mass stars emit too much UV light for habitable
worlds. Overall, we determine that rapid stellar rotation has important
consequences for the overall habitability of a system and must be accounted for
both when modeling exoplanet environments and in observation of planets around
high-mass stars.

Hedonic Games (ASHGs). Such games model a basic clustering or coalition
formation scenario in which selfish agents are represented by the vertices of
an edge-weighted digraph $G=(V,E)$, and the weight of an arc $uv$ denotes the
utility $u$ gains by being in the same coalition as $v$. We focus on (arguably)
the most basic stability question about such a game: given a graph, does a Nash
stable solution exist and can we find it efficiently?
  We study the (parameterized) complexity of ASHG stability when the underlying
graph has treewidth $t$ and maximum degree $\Delta$. The current best FPT
algorithm for this case was claimed by Peters [AAAI 2016], with time complexity
roughly $2^{O(\Delta^5t)}$. We present an algorithm with parameter dependence
$(\Delta t)^{O(\Delta t)}$, significantly improving upon the parameter
dependence on $\Delta$ given by Peters, albeit with a slightly worse dependence
on $t$. Our main result is that this slight performance deterioration with
respect to $t$ is actually completely justified: we observe that the previously
claimed algorithm is incorrect, and that in fact no algorithm can achieve
dependence $t^{o(t)}$ for bounded-degree graphs, unless the ETH fails. This,
together with corresponding bounds we provide on the dependence on $\Delta$ and
the joint parameter establishes that our algorithm is essentially optimal for
both parameters, under the ETH.
  We then revisit the parameterization by treewidth alone and resolve a
question also posed by Peters by showing that Nash Stability remains strongly
NP-hard on stars under additive preferences. Nevertheless, we also discover an
island of mild tractability: we show that Connected Nash Stability is solvable
in pseudo-polynomial time for constant $t$, though with an XP dependence on $t$
which, as we establish, cannot be avoided.

Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data. A consistent luminosity ratio within
effective radius between the host galaxy and the X-galaxy is measured from HST
tri-band images, which leads to a mass ratio between the two galaxies as
$r_b\sim 2$. To determine the role of the X-galaxy in the lens system, we
modelled the dual-lens system with constraints from the VLBI-resolved jet
components and the HST images. The 8.4-GHz global-VLBI data currently provide
the most stringent constraints to the mass model, especially to the radial
power-law slope. The optimized models for this two-image three-component radio
lens favour a steeper-than-isothermal inner slope. The jet bending in image B
was also investigated and it turned out to be rather a misalignment than a
curvature. The goodness of fit indicates that the role of the X-galaxy is
crucial in the lens system if three pairs of resolved jet components are to be
fitted. When we imported the optimal model from radio constraints to optical
modelling with the HST tri-band data, the optimization kept the consistency of
the optimal model and successfully reproduced the features observed in the HST
images. This implies that the diffuse emission discovered in the HST images is
actually a detection of the secondary lensing effects from the companion lens.

the longest sampled timescales (corresponding to temporal frequencies of

while on the shortest sampled timescales ($\nu\sim$ 1-10 Hz) the variability is
suppressed. In addition, we observe a reduction (by up to a factor of $\sim$
1.8) of the otherwise high coherence between soft and hard band light curves,
as well as of the amplitude of the hard X-ray lags intrinsic to the X-ray
continuum. The observed increase of low frequency variability power can be
explained in terms of variations of the wind column density as a consequence of
motions of the intervening clumps. In this scenario (and assuming a terminal

sciences. We study the moments of multivariate Gaussians and GMMs. The $d$-th
moment of an $n$-dimensional random variable is a symmetric $d$-way tensor of
size $n^d$, so working with moments naively is assumed to be prohibitively
expensive for $d>2$ and larger values of $n$. In this work, we develop theory
and numerical methods for \emph{implicit computations} with moment tensors of
GMMs, reducing the computational and storage costs to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, respectively, for general covariance matrices, and to
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$, respectively, for diagonal ones. We
derive concise analytic expressions for the moments in terms of symmetrized
tensor products, relying on the correspondence between symmetric tensors and
homogeneous polynomials, and combinatorial identities involving Bell
polynomials. The primary application of this theory is to estimating GMM
parameters (means and covariances) from a set of observations, when formulated
as a moment-matching optimization problem. If there is a known and common
covariance matrix, we also show it is possible to debias the data observations,
in which case the problem of estimating the unknown means reduces to symmetric
CP tensor decomposition. Numerical results validate and illustrate the

the competitiveness of the method of moments as compared to expectation

formation in disk galaxies. We investigate this hypothesis using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a sample of 2779 nearby unbarred star-forming
main-sequence spiral galaxies. The strength of spiral arms is quantified by
their average Fourier amplitude relative to the axisymmetric disk. The star
formation properties in the central 1--3\,kpc region were derived from the SDSS
spectra. We show that galaxies with stronger spiral arms not only tend to have
more intense central specific star formation rate (sSFR), larger Balmer
absorption line index, and lower 4000-\AA\ break strength, but also have
enhanced central sSFR relative to sSFR measured for the whole galaxy. This link
is independent of redshift, stellar mass, surface density, and concentration.
There is a lack of evidence for strong spiral arms being associated with a
significant fraction of starburst or post-starburst galaxies, implying that the
spiral-induced central star formation is likely continuous rather than bursty.
We also show that stronger spiral arms tend to have an increasing fraction of
pseudo bulges, a relatively unchanged fraction of star-forming classical
bulges, and a decreasing fraction of quenched classical bulges. Moreover, the
concentration of galaxies hosting pseudo bulges mildly increases with stronger
spiral arms, implying that spirals help pseudo bulges grow. The connection
between spirals and the bulge type is partly attributed to the suppression of
spirals by classical bulges and partly to the enhanced central star formation
driven by spirals. We explain our results in a picture where spiral arms
transport cold gas inward to trigger continuous central star formation, which
facilitates the build-up of pseudo bulges. Spiral arms thus play a role in the
secular evolution of disk galaxies.

dynamics, biology, climate science, and other systems with irreversible

simple free energy minimization principle. Rather the mechanism of these
transitions depends crucially on the system's dynamics, which requires us to
analyze them in trajectory space rather than in phase space. Here we consider
situations where the path of these transitions can be characterized as the
minimizer of an action, whose minimum value can be used in a nonequilibrium
generalization of the Arrhenius law to calculate the system's phase diagram. We
also develop efficient numerical tools for the minimization of this action.
These tools are general enough to be transportable to many situations of
interest, in particular when the fluctuations present in the microscopic system
are non-Gaussian and its dynamics is not governed by the standard Langevin
equation. As an illustration, first-order phase transitions in two
spatially-extended nonequilibrium systems are analyzed: a modified
Ginzburg-Landau equation with a chemical potential which is non-gradient, and a
reaction-diffusion network based on the Schl\""ogl model. The phase diagrams of
both systems are calculated as a function of their control parameters, and the

method for solving the Helmholtz equation (with wavenumber $k$) suffers from
the pollution effect if, as $k\to \infty$, the total number of degrees of
freedom needed to maintain accuracy grows faster than this natural threshold.
  While the $h$-version of the finite element method (FEM) (where accuracy is
increased by decreasing the meshwidth $h$ and keeping the polynomial degree $p$
fixed) suffers from the pollution effect, the celebrated papers [Melenk, Sauter
2010], [Melenk, Sauter 2011], [Esterhazy, Melenk 2012], and [Melenk, Parsania,
Sauter 2013] showed that the $hp$-FEM (where accuracy is increased by
decreasing the meshwidth $h$ and increasing the polynomial degree $p$) applied
to a variety of constant-coefficient Helmholtz problems does not suffer from
the pollution effect.
  The heart of the proofs of these results is a PDE result splitting the
solution of the Helmholtz equation into ""high"" and ""low"" frequency components.
In this expository paper we prove this splitting for the constant-coefficient
Helmholtz equation in full space (i.e., in $\mathbb{R}^d$) using only
integration by parts and elementary properties of the Fourier transform; this
is in contrast to the proof for this set-up in [Melenk, Sauter 2010] which uses
somewhat-involved bounds on Bessel and Hankel functions. The proof in this
paper is motivated by the recent proof in [Lafontaine, Spence, Wunsch 2022] of
this splitting for the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation in full space;
indeed, the proof in [Lafontaine, Spence, Wunsch 2022] uses more-sophisticated
tools that reduce to the elementary ones above for constant coefficients.

I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) in 2020 January by the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observatories.
The X-ray spectrum is well-described by a model comprised of the continuum
emission from the corona and its reflection from the accretion disc around a
rapidly spinning (a > 0.94) black hole. In order to model the broadband
spectrum, it is necessary to account for the variation in ionisation across the
disc. Analysis of the X-ray spectrum in time periods before, during and after
the flares reveal the underlying changes to the corona associated with the
flaring. During the flares, the reflection fraction drops significantly,
consistent with the acceleration of the corona away from the accretion disc. We
find the first evidence that during the X-ray flares, the temperature drops
from 140(-20,+100)keV before to 45(-9,+40)keV during the flares. The profile of
the iron K line reveals the emissivity profile of the accretion disc, showing
it to be illuminated by a compact corona extending no more than 7(-2,+4)rg over
the disc before the flares, but with tentative evidence that the corona expands
as it is accelerated during the flares. Once the flares subsided, the corona
had collapsed to a radius of 6(-2,+2)rg. The rapid timescale of the flares
suggests that they arise within the black-hole magnetosphere rather than in the
accretion disc, and the variation of the corona is consistent with the
continuum arising from the Comptonisation of seed photons from the disc.

contain a sub-grid description for stellar cluster formation and evolution,
allowing us to study the simultaneous formation and evolution of stellar
clusters alongside their host galaxies across cosmic time. As a key ingredient
in these simulations, we include the physics of the multi-phase nature of the
interstellar medium (ISM), which enables studies of how the presence of a cold,
dense ISM affects cluster formation and evolution. We consider two different
star formation prescriptions: a constant star formation efficiency per
free-fall time, as well as an environmentally-dependent, turbulence-based
prescription. We identify two key results drawn from these simulations.
Firstly, we find that tidal shock-driven disruption caused by the graininess of
the cold ISM produces old ($\tau>10~$Gyr) stellar cluster populations with
properties that are in excellent agreement with the observed populations in the
Milky Way and M31. Importantly, the addition of the cold ISM addresses the
areas of disagreement found in previous simulations that lacked the cold gas
phase. Secondly, the formation of stellar clusters is extremely sensitive to
the baryonic physics that govern the properties of the cold, dense gas
reservoir in the galaxy. This implies that the demographics of stellar cluster
populations represent an important diagnostic tool for constraining baryonic
physics models in upcoming galaxy formation simulations that also include a
description of the cold ISM.

forming regions. We present 2D disk chemical models that incorporate a
stochastic X-ray flaring module, named \xgen, and examine the flares' overall
chemical impact compared to models that assume a constant X-ray flux. We
examine the impact of 500 years of flaring events and find global chemical
changes on both short time scales (days) in response to discrete flaring events
and long time-scales (centuries) in response to the cumulative impact of many
flares. Individual X-ray flares most strongly affect small gas-phase cations,
where a single flare can temporarily enhance the abundance of species such as
H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, CH$_3^+$, and C$^+$. We find that flares can also drive
chemistry out of ""steady state"" over longer time periods, where the
disk-integrated abundance of some species, such as O and O$_2$, changes by a
few percent over the 500 year model. We also explore whether the specific
history of X-ray flaring events (randomly drawn but from the same energy
distribution) impacts the chemical evolution and find that it does not.

build-up of structure and therefore the successive merging of galaxies into
more massive ones. As one can only observe galaxies at one specific time in
cosmic history, this merger history remains in principle unobservable. By using
the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project, we show that it is possible
to infer the unobservable stellar assembly and merger history of central
galaxies from their observable properties by using machine learning techniques.
In particular, in this first paper of ERGO-ML (Extracting Reality from Galaxy
Observables with Machine Learning), we choose a set of 7 observable integral
properties of galaxies (i.e. total stellar mass, redshift, color, stellar size,
morphology, metallicity, and age) to infer, from those, the stellar ex-situ
fraction, the average merger lookback times and mass ratios, and the lookback
time and stellar mass of the last major merger. To do so, we use and compare a
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and a conditional Invertible Neural
Network (cINN): thanks to the latter we are also able to infer the posterior
distribution for these parameters and hence estimate the uncertainties in the
predictions. We find that the stellar ex-situ fraction and the time of the last
major merger are well determined by the selected set of observables, that the
mass-weighted merger mass ratio is unconstrained, and that, beyond stellar
mass, stellar morphology and stellar age are the most informative properties.
Finally, we show that the cINN recovers the remaining unexplained scatter and
secondary cross-correlations. Our tools can be applied to large galaxy surveys
in order to infer unobservable properties of galaxies' past, enabling empirical
studies of galaxy evolution enriched by cosmological simulations.

It is commonly interpreted that their topography is isostatically supported and
that they represent fossils of an extinct tectonic regime. Using gravity and
topography we perform a comprehensive investigation of the lithospheric
structure of six crustal plateaus. We computed the admittance (gravity to
topography wavelength-dependent ratio) for each region and compared them to
modeled admittances. Three compensation scenarios were tested: Airy isostasy, a
surface-loading flexural model, and a flexural model with surface and
subsurface loads. Our results show that the topography of most plateaus is
supported by crustal thickening and that the addition of a mantle support
component is not necessary at the investigated wavelengths. The elastic
thickness was constrained to be less than 35 km with a best-fitting average of
15 km, confirming that these regions are consistent with an isostatic regime.
The average crustal thickness of the plateaus ranges from 15 to 34 km, and if
they are in Airy isostasy, this implies that the global average crustal
thickness of Venus is about 20 km. Phoebe Regio is the sole exception of our
analysis in that crustal thicknesses that are compatible with the other
plateaus are obtained only when a buoyant layer is included. Heat flow
estimations computed from the elastic thickness indicate that the plateaus
formed under higher heat flow conditions compared to the current global average
and could have caused localized melting. Present-day heat flow predictions
suggest that eclogitization could occur where the crust is thickest.

(i) the high mass population has a half-mass radius $r_{\rm h}$ of 4.88 pc,

ellipsoids with mean 1d velocity dispersions $\sigma$ of 0.427 and 0.415 km

equipartition ($\sigma \propto {\bar M}^{-1/2}$). We identify a new mass
segregation instability for clusters with escape speed $V$. Populations with
$V/\sigma \lesssim 2\sqrt{2}$ can never attain thermal equilibrium and
equipartition. This regime encompasses many Galactic open and globular

dust law slope and normalization in the range expected from theoretical
arguments; this galaxy therefore provides an example of what may be possible in
the future. However, most of the galaxies are best-fit by unusually steep or
shallow slopes. We then explore whether additional astrophysical effects or
observational biases could explain the elevated Paschen-$\beta$/H$\alpha$

covering fractions ($>$97%). Alternatively, differing slit losses for different

measuring all three lines with a consistent spectroscopic aperture. We conclude
that while the three-line approach to constraining the shape of the dust

consistent observational strategy will be required to minimize observational
biases and to disentangle the astrophysically interesting effect of differing

chemistry and materials, among the various applications. In recent years, there
have been significant advancements in the development of near-term quantum
algorithms for quantum simulation, including VQE and many of its variants.
However, for such algorithms to be useful, they need to overcome several
critical barriers including the inability to prepare high-quality
approximations of the ground state. Current challenges to state preparation,
including barren plateaus and the high-dimensionality of the optimization
landscape, make state preparation through ansatz optimization unreliable. In
this work, we introduce the method of ground state boosting, which uses a
limited-depth quantum circuit to reliably increase the overlap with the ground
state. This circuit, which we call a booster, can be used to augment an ansatz
from VQE or be used as a stand-alone state preparation method. The booster
converts circuit depth into ground state overlap in a controllable manner. We
numerically demonstrate the capabilities of boosters by simulating the
performance of a particular type of booster, namely the Gaussian booster, for
preparing the ground state of $N_2$ molecular system. Beyond ground state
preparation as a direct objective, many quantum algorithms, such as quantum
phase estimation, rely on high-quality state preparation as a subroutine.
Therefore, we foresee ground state boosting and similar methods as becoming
essential algorithmic components as the field transitions into using early
fault-tolerant quantum computers.

early generations, low-complexity models over-replicate and take over most of

we show that ensemble diversity, by any metric, does not meaningfully
contribute to an ensemble's uncertainty quantification on out-of-distribution

deep ensembles are a practical way to achieve improvements to predictive power,

determined. Here we report the results of two simultaneous XMM-Newton and HST
observations of this PULX taken to observe two distinct X-ray behaviours as
defined from its Swift light curve. We find that the X-ray spectrum of the PULX
is best described by the hard ultraluminous (HUL) regime during the observation
taken in the lower flux, lower variability amplitude behaviour; its spectrum
changes to a broadened disc during the higher flux, higher variability
amplitude epoch. However, we see no accompanying changes in the optical/UV
fluxes, with the only difference being a reduction in flux in the near-IR as
the X-ray flux increased. We attempt to fit irradiation models to explain the
UV/optical/IR fluxes but they fail to provide meaningful constraints. Instead,
a physical model for the system leads us to conclude that the optical light is
dominated by a companion O/B star, albeit with an IR excess that may be
indicative of a jet. We discuss how these results may be consistent with the

quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state exhibits a phase transition between
three distinct phases, one of which violates the area law. Here we consider a
classical stochastic version of the Fredkin model, which can be thought of as a
simple exclusion process subject to additional kinetic constraints, and study
its classical stochastic dynamics. The ground state phase transition of the
quantum chain implies an equilibrium phase transition in the stochastic
problem, whose properties we quantify in terms of numerical matrix product
states (MPS). The stochastic model displays slow dynamics, including power law
decaying autocorrelation functions and hierarchical relaxation processes due to
exponential localization. Like in other kinetically constrained models, the
Fredkin chain has a rich structure in its dynamical large deviations - which we
compute accurately via numerical MPS - including an active-inactive phase
transition, and a hierarchy of trajectory phases connected to particular
equilibrium states of the model. We also propose, via its height field
representation, a generalization of the Fredkin model to two dimensions in
terms of constrained dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice.

generalized logistic ordinal regression, increasing the flexibility of the

the simulations and observations reveals no X-ray detection of Cygnus A-2 to a
0.5-7.0 keV flux upper limit of $1.04 \times
10^{-12}\rm\,erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$, or a rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity of
$8.6\times 10^{42}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of Cygnus
A-2 based on our X-ray flux limit and find it to be consistent with a flaring
black hole rather than a steadily accreting source. The HRC observations are
additionally compared with archival ACIS data from 2016-2017, and both the
overall morphology and the flux limits of the AGN complex agree between the two
datasets. This consistency is despite the pile-up effect in ACIS which was
previously considered to bias the observed morphology of the AGN. The agreement
between the datasets demonstrates the viability of utilizing the archival
Chandra data of Cygnus A to analyze its AGN at an unprecedented level of
precision.

Li intercalation was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We
observed the cubic phase of NiO with sputtering power mainly affecting
crystallinity and grain size. These in turn affect the electrochromic

16.1) cm$^{2}$/C and the reversibility from 40% to 30% as sputtering power
increases from 60 W to 180 W. The impedance spectra indicates that ion
diffusion is larger for the film grown at 60 W and then goes down for the films
deposited at higher sputtering powers. XPS analysis reveals that higher values
of $P$ promote the formation of nickel hydroxides on the film surface. As
consequence of changes in crystallinity and morphology, the presence of nickel
hydroxides increases, showing that not only the electrochromic properties of

listener's probabilistic prior beliefs, something which is captured by one
currently influential model of pragmatics, the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
framework. In this paper we focus on cases when this sensitivity to priors
leads to counterintuitive predictions of the framework. Our domain of interest
is exhaustivity effects, whereby a sentence such as ""Mary came"" is understood
to mean that only Mary came. We show that in the baseline RSA model, under
certain conditions, anti-exhaustive readings are predicted (e.g., ""Mary came""
would be used to convey that both Mary and Peter came). The specific question
we ask is the following: should exhaustive interpretations be derived as purely
pragmatic inferences (as in the classical Gricean view, endorsed in the
baseline RSA model), or should they rather be generated by an encapsulated
semantic mechanism (as argued in some of the recent formal literature)? To
answer this question, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of different
RSA models and evaluate them against data obtained in a new study which tested
the effects of prior beliefs on both production and comprehension, improving on
previous empirical work. We found no anti-exhaustivity effects, but observed
that message choice is sensitive to priors, as predicted by the RSA framework
overall. The best models turn out to be those which include an encapsulated
exhaustivity mechanism (as other studies concluded on the basis of very
different data). We conclude that, on the one hand, in the division of labor
between semantics and pragmatics, semantics plays a larger role than is often
thought, but, on the other hand, the tradeoff between informativity and cost
which characterizes all RSA models does play a central role for genuine
pragmatic effects.

transformations give rise to a general class of scalar-tensor theories which
leads to a rich phenomenology in a cosmological setting. While this possibility
has been studied comprehensively in the literature for scalar fields, the
vector case has been hardly treated. We build hence models based on vector
fields conformally and disformally coupled to dark matter and derive explicitly
the general covariant form of the interaction term in an independent way of the
gravity theory, whereby this result can be applied to general vector-tensor
theories. For concreteness, the standard Proca theory with a vector exponential
potential is taken to describe the vector-tensor sector, and some specific
coupling functions are assumed to study the cosmological background dynamics by
dynamical system techniques. Despite of choosing such a minimalist form for the
underlying theory, the parameter space is considerably enriched compared to the
uncoupled case due to the novel interactions, leading to new branches of
solutions for the vector equation of motion. Thus, different trajectories can
exist in phase space depending on the coupling parameters associated to the
conformal and disformal functions. From here, new emerging vector-dark matter
scaling solutions, and renewed stable attractor points are found to drive the
late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. Numerical calculations are
performed as well to investigate more quantitatively the impact of the
conformal and disformal couplings on the cosmological background evolution.
These effects depend essentially on the strength on the coupling parameters

underlying task. Significant progress has been made in recent years, especially
for tasks with short horizons. However, when it comes to long-horizon tasks
with extended sequences of actions, an agent can easily ignore some
instructions or get stuck in the middle of the long instructions and eventually
fail the task. To address this challenge, we propose a model-agnostic
milestone-based task tracker (M-TRACK) to guide the agent and monitor its
progress. Specifically, we propose a milestone builder that tags the
instructions with navigation and interaction milestones which the agent needs
to complete step by step, and a milestone checker that systemically checks the
agent's progress in its current milestone and determines when to proceed to the
next. On the challenging ALFRED dataset, our M-TRACK leads to a notable 33% and
52% relative improvement in unseen success rate over two competitive base

by randomness, such as a randomly growing interface, or fluids subject to
random fluctuations that account e.g. for local stresses and heat fluxes not
related to the velocity and temperature gradients. For deterministic systems
with infinitely many degrees of freedom, normal form and center manifold theory
have shown a prodigious efficiency to often completely characterize how the
onset of linear instability translates into the emergence of nonlinear
patterns. However, in presence of random fluctuations, this reduction procedure
is seriously challenged due to large excursions caused by the noise, and the
approach needs to be revisited.
  We present an alternative framework to cope with these difficulties
exploiting the approximation theory of stochastic invariant manifolds and
energy estimates measuring the defect of parameterization of the high-modes. To
operate for fluid problems, these error estimates are derived under assumptions
regarding dissipation effects brought by the high-modes that suitably
counterbalance the loss of regularity due to the nonlinear terms. The approach
enables us to predict, from the reduced equations, the occurrence in large
probability of a stochastic analogue to the pitchfork bifurcation, as long as
the noise's intensity and the eigenvalue's magnitude of the mildly unstable
mode scale accordingly.
  Our parameterization formulas involve non-Markovian coefficients, which
depend explicitly on the history of the noise path that drives the SPDE
dynamics, and their memory content is self-consistently determined by the
intensity of the random force and its interaction through the SPDE's nonlinear
terms. Applications to a stochastic Rayleigh-Benard problem are detailed, for
which conditions for a stochastic pitchfork bifurcation (in large probability)
to occur, are clarified.

means of 2D radial-azimuthal particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations
with a uniform axial magnetic field. We find that the formation of the spoke
potential hump region can be explained as a result of the positive anode sheath
collapse due to the lower hybrid type instability evolving into the long

the non-neutral anode sheath undergoes a sequence of transitions into the large
scale modes. The sheath non-neutrality effect on the instability is considered
and incorporated in the two-fluid linear theory of the lower hybrid
instability. The unstable modes predicted by the theory in the linear phase and
nonlinear evolution are in good agreement with the fluctuation modes developed

contrast to offline HWR that only uses spatial information (i.e., images),
online HWR (OnHWR) uses richer spatio-temporal information (i.e., trajectory
data or inertial data). While there exist many offline HWR datasets, there is
only little data available for the development of OnHWR methods on paper as it
requires hardware-integrated pens. Methods. This paper presents data and
benchmark models for real-time sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning and
single character-based recognition. Our data is recorded by a sensor-enhanced
ballpoint pen, yielding sensor data streams from triaxial accelerometers, a
gyroscope, a magnetometer and a force sensor at 100 Hz. We propose a variety of
datasets including equations and words for both the writer-dependent and
writer-independent tasks. Our datasets allow a comparison between classical
OnHWR on tablets and on paper with sensor-enhanced pens. We provide an
evaluation benchmark for seq2seq and single character-based HWR using recurrent

connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss and cross-entropy (CE) losses.

population sizes $N_{\mathrm{e}}$ under marine hatchery practices. This paper
studies the Ryman-Laikre, or two-demographic-component, model of the hatchery
impact related to inbreeding in a population with power-law family-size
distribution, where hatchery inputs are represented by a Dirac delta function.
By examining the asymptotic (i.e. large-population limit) behavior of the
normalized sizes (or weights) of families of the mixture population, I derive
the distribution properties of the average weight of families (i.e. the sum of
the squared weights, $Y$) over the population existing at any given time. The
reciprocal of the average weight $Y$ gives the effective number of families (or
reproducing lineages) in the population, $N_{\mathrm{e}}=1/Y$. When the
specific production in the hatchery (i.e. the number of offspring per
broodstock) is low, the most probable value of $N_{\mathrm{e}}$ is close to the
lower bound of the $N_{\mathrm{e}}$-distribution. When the specific
hatchery-production is increased to a critical value with fixed mixing
proportion of hatchery fish, a discontinuous transition takes place, so that
the most probable $N_{\mathrm{e}}$ jumps to the upper extreme of the
distribution. This hatchery-induced transition is attributed to the breaking of
reciprocal symmetry, i.e. the fact that the typical value of $Y$ and its
reciprocal (the typical $N_{\mathrm{e}}$) do not vary with the population size
in opposite ways. At a high specific hatchery-production, the symmetry breaking
disappears.

luminosities of $\sim2\times10^{31}$--$3\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Black
widows show a bi-modal distribution in X-ray luminosities, with eclipsing black

the two confirmed non-eclipsing black widows are much fainter, with $L_X$ of

correlation between the number of MSPs and stellar encounter rate in GCs, and
suggest that between 600--1500 MSPs exist in these 36 GCs. Finally, we estimate
the number of X-ray detectable MSPs in the Galactic bulge, finding that 1--86

the very large correlation lengths at low temperatures. The finite-size
spectrum of the transfer matrix obtained by TNR is useful in identifying the
conformal field theory describing a possible critical point. Our results
indicate that the ultraviolet fixed point for the Heisenberg model and the
ferromagnetic $\mathrm{RP^2}$ model in the zero temperature limit corresponds
to a conformal field theory with central charge $c=2$, in agreement with two
independent would-be Nambu-Goldstone modes. On the other hand, the ultraviolet
fixed point in the zero temperature limit for the antiferromagnetic
Lebwohl-Lasher model, which is a variant of the $\mathrm{RP^2}$ model, seems to
have a larger central charge. This is consistent with $c=4$ expected from the
effective SO(5) symmetry. At $T >0$, the convergence of the spectrum is not
good in both the Heisenberg and ferromagnetic $\mathrm{RP^2}$ models. Moreover,
there seems no appropriate candidate of conformal field theory matching the
spectrum, which shows the effective central charge $c \sim 1.9$. These suggest
that both models have a single disordered phase at finite temperatures,

locations, only short periods of observations or hindcasts are available.
Hence, estimation of return values (corresponding to a period considerably
longer than that for which data is available) for cyclone-induced significant
wave height (SWH) from small samples is challenging. The STM-E (space-time
maximum and exposure) model was developed to provide reduced bias in estimates
of return values compared to competitor approaches in such situations, and
realistic estimates of return value uncertainty. STM-E exploits data from a
spatial neighbourhood satisfying certain conditions, rather than data from a
single location, for return value estimation.
  This article provides critical assessment of the STM-E model for tropical
cyclones in the Caribbean Sea near Guadeloupe for which a large database of
synthetic cyclones is available, corresponding to more than 3,000 years of
observation. Results indicate that STM-E yields values for the 500-year return
value of SWH and its variability, estimated from 200 years of cyclone data,
consistent with direct empirical estimates obtained by sampling 500 years of
data from the full synthetic cyclone database; similar results were found for
estimation of the 100-year return value from samples corresponding to
approximately 50 years of data. In general, STM-E also provides reduced bias

the weak scale as measured in our universe. In contrast, the SUSY preserving
\mu parameter is selected uniformly on a log scale as is consistent with the

anthropic selection of the weak scale to within a factor of a few of our

transmissions in the presence of receiver-side cache content can dramatically
ameliorate the file-size bottleneck of coded caching and substantially boost
performance in error-free wire-like channels. We here employ large-matrix
analysis to explore the effect of vector coded caching in realistic wireless
multi-antenna downlink systems. Our analysis answers a simple question: Under a
fixed set of antenna and SNR resources, and a given downlink MISO system which
can already enjoy an optimized exploitation of multiplexing and beamforming
gains, what is the multiplicative boost in the throughput when we are now
allowed to occasionally add content inside reasonably-sized receiver-side
caches? The derived closed-form expressions capture various linear precoders,
and a variety of practical considerations such as power dissemination across
signals, realistic SNR values, as well as feedback costs. The schemes are very
simple (we simply collapse precoding vectors into a single vector), and the
recorded gains are notable. For example, for 32 transmit antennas, a received
SNR of 20 dB, a coherence bandwidth of 300 kHz, a coherence period of 40 ms,
and under realistic file-size and cache-size constraints, vector coded caching
is here shown to offer a multiplicative throughput boost of about 310% with
ZF/RZF precoding and a 430% boost in the performance of already optimized
MF-based systems. Interestingly, vector coded caching also accelerates channel
hardening to the benefit of feedback acquisition, often surpassing 540% gains
over traditional hardening-constrained downlink systems.

at their last steps to produce rhythmic patterns for limbs movement. Different
patterns and gaits typically compete through winner-take-all (WTA) circuits to
produce the right movements. In this work we present a WTA circuit implemented
in a Spiking-Neural-Network (SNN) processor to produce such patterns for
controlling a robotic arm in real-time. The robot uses spike-based
proportional-integrativederivative (SPID) controllers to keep a commanded joint
position from the winner population of neurons of the WTA circuit. Experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of robotic control with spiking circuits following
brain-inspiration.

factors (nodes) change over discrete interactions based on causal impacts
(weighted directed edges) from other factors. This approach has traditionally
been used as an aggregate, similarly to System Dynamics, to depict the
functioning of a system. There has been a growing interest in taking this
aggregate approach at the individual-level, for example by equipping each agent
of an Agent-Based Model with its own FCM to express its behavior. Although
frameworks and studies have already taken this approach, an ongoing limitation
has been the difficulty of creating as many FCMs as there are individuals.
Indeed, current studies have been able to create agents whose traits are
different, but whose decision-making modules are often identical, thus limiting
the behavioral heterogeneity of the simulated population. In this paper, we
address this limitation by using Genetic Algorithms to create one FCM for each
agent, thus providing the means to automatically create a virtual population
with heterogeneous behaviors. Our algorithm builds on prior work from Stach and
colleagues by introducing additional constraints into the process and applying
it over longitudinal, individual-level data. A case study from a real-world
intervention on nutrition confirms that our approach can generate heterogeneous
agents that closely follow the trajectories of their real-world human
counterparts. Future works include technical improvements such as lowering the
computational time of the approach, or case studies in computational
intelligence that use our virtual populations to test new behavior change
interventions.

systems, such as probabilistic or weighted systems. There is growing interest
in generic approaches to behavioural distances. In particular, coalgebraic
methods capture variations in the system type (nondeterministic, probabilistic,
game-based etc.), and the notion of quantale abstracts over the actual values
distances take, thus covering, e.g., two-valued equivalences, (pseudo-)metrics,
and probabilistic (pseudo-)metrics. Coalgebraic behavioural distances have been
based either on liftings of SET-functors to categories of metric spaces, or on
lax extensions of SET-functors to categories of quantitative relations. Every
lax extension induces a functor lifting but not every lifting comes from a lax
extension. It was shown recently that every lax extension is Kantorovich, i.e.
induced by a suitable choice of monotone predicate liftings, implying via a
quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that behavioural distances
induced by lax extensions can be characterized by quantitative modal logics.
Here, we essentially show the same in the more general setting of behavioural
distances induced by functor liftings. In particular, we show that every
functor lifting, and indeed every functor on (quantale-valued) metric spaces,
that preserves isometries is Kantorovich, so that the induced behavioural
distance (on systems of suitably restricted branching degree) can be
characterized by a quantitative modal logic.

manipulation as a benchmark to measure simultaneous performance of precise
manipulation and sequential manipulation. The sub-structure of the Rubik's cube
demands precise positioning of the robot's end effectors, while its highly
reconfigurable nature enables tasks that require the robot to manage pose
uncertainty throughout long sequences of actions. We present a protocol for
quantitatively measuring both the accuracy and speed of Rubik's cube
manipulation. This protocol can be attempted by any general-purpose
manipulator, and only requires a standard 3x3 Rubik's cube and a flat surface
upon which the Rubik's cube initially rests (e.g. a table). We demonstrate this
protocol for two distinct baseline approaches on a PR2 robot. The first
baseline provides a fundamental approach for pose-based Rubik's cube
manipulation. The second baseline demonstrates the benchmark's ability to
quantify improved performance by the system, particularly that resulting from
the integration of pre-touch sensing. To demonstrate the benchmark's
applicability to other robot platforms and algorithmic approaches, we present
the functional blocks required to enable the HERB robot to manipulate the

of atomic vapors for magnetometry, alkali vapor cell clocks, and laser cooling
experiments. A primary advantage of these dispensers is that they contain
alkali metal in an inert form that can be exposed to air without hazard.
However, their high temperature of operation (>600 C) is undesirable for many
applications, as it shifts the atomic speed distribution to higher values and
presents a radiative heat source that can raise the temperature of its
surroundings. For this reason, dispensers are typically not used in
line-of-sight applications such as atomic beam generation. In this work, we
present an integrated rubidium dispenser collimating device with a thickness of
only 2 mm that produces a beam of atoms traveling primarily in the forward
direction. We find that the collimator plate serves to both shield the
dispenser's radiation as well as to moderate the velocity of the atomic beam so
that the measured longitudinal speed distribution is comparable to that of an
ordinary alkali oven at only a slightly elevated temperature of 200 C. To
confirm our theory, we also constructed another compact apparatus consisting of
a dispenser and a silicon collimator and the measurements support our
conclusion. Our integrated dispenser collimator will particularly be useful in
integrated photonics and cavity QED on chip, where a localized, directed source

therapy (MRT), require fast dose distribution predictions that are accurate at
the sub-mm level, especially close to tissue/bone/air interfaces. Monte Carlo
physics simulations are recognised to be one of the most accurate tools to
predict the dose delivered in a target tissue but can be very time consuming
and therefore prohibitive for treatment planning. Faster dose prediction
algorithms are usually developed for clinically deployed treatments only. In
this work, we explore a new approach for fast and accurate dose estimations
suitable for novel treatments using digital phantoms used in pre-clinical
development and modern machine learning techniques. We develop a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model, which is able to emulate the equivalent Geant4
Monte Carlo simulation with adequate accuracy, and use it to predict the
radiation dose delivered by a broad synchrotron beam to various phantoms. The
energy depositions used for the training of the GAN are obtained using full
Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations of a synchrotron radiation broad beam passing
through the phantoms. The energy deposition is scored and predicted in voxel
matrices of size 140x18x18 with a voxel edge length of 1 mm. The GAN model
consists of two competing 3D convolutional neural networks, which are
conditioned on the photon beam and phantom properties. The energy deposition
predictions inside all phantom geometries under investigation show deviations
of less than 3% of the maximum deposited energy from the simulation for roughly
99% of the voxels in the field of the beam. The computing time for a single
prediction is reduced from several hundred hours using Geant4 simulation to
less than a second using the GAN model.

  Stroke Transfer Capacity","5 pages, 3 tables, 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Background: Most acute stroke (AS) patients in the United States are
initially evaluated at a primary stroke center (PSC) and a significant
proportion requires transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for
advanced treatment. A CSC typically accepts patients from multiple PSCs in its
network, leading to capacity limits. This study uses a queueing model to
estimate impacts on CSC capacity due to transfers from PSCs.
  Methods: The model assumes that the number of AS patients arriving at each
PSC, proportion of AS patients transferred, and length of stay in the CSC
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) by type of AS are random, while the
transfer rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic AS patients are control variables.
The main outcome measure is the ""overflow"" probability, namely, the probability
of a CSC not having capacity (unavailability of a Neuro-ICU bed) to accept a
transfer. Data simulations of the model, using a base case and an expanded
case, were performed to illustrate the effects of changing key parameters, such
as transfer rates from PSCs and CSC Neuro-ICU capacity on overflow capacity.
  Results: Data simulations of the model using a base case show that an
increase of a PSC's ischemic stroke transfer rate from 15% to 55% raises the
overflow probability from 30.62% to 36.13%. Further simulations of the expanded
case show that to maintain an a priori CSC overflow probability of 30.62% when
adding a PSC with a AS transfer rate of 15% to the network, other PSCs would
need to decrease their transfer rate by 12.5% or the CSC Neuro-ICU would need
to add 2 beds.
  Discussion: A queuing model can be used to estimate the effects of change in
the size of a PSC-CSC network, change in AS transfer rates, or change in number
of CSC Neuro-ICU beds of a CSC on its capacity on the overflow probability in
the CSC.

  We define a vector valued Markov process with the minimal amount of

highlight that this process is the Markovian correction of $(B_i, i\geq 1)$.
Finally, when the offspring distributions are lineal fractional, we show that
the variables $(A_i, i\geq 1)$ are independent and identically distributed.

several neurologic disorders. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of
vascular morphology in healthy and diseased adults including changes during
aging and the anatomical variations in the Circle of Willis (CoW). Methods: We
used our automatic method to segment and extract novel geometric features of
the cerebral vasculature from MRA scans of 175 healthy subjects, 45 AIS, and 50
AD patients after spatial registration. This is followed by quantification and
statistical analysis of vascular alterations in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the biggest cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative
disorders. Results: We determined that the CoW is fully formed in only 35
percent of healthy adults and found significantly increased tortuosity and
fractality, with increasing age and with disease -- both AIS and AD. We also
found significantly decreased vessel length, volume and number of branches in
AIS patients. Lastly, we found that AD cerebral vessels exhibited significantly
smaller diameter and more complex branching patterns, compared to age-matched
healthy adults. These changes were significantly heightened with progression of
AD from early onset to moderate-severe dementia. Conclusion: Altered vessel
geometry in AIS patients shows that there is pathological morphology coupled
with stroke. In AD due to pathological alterations in the endothelium or
amyloid depositions leading to neuronal damage and hypoperfusion, vessel
geometry is significantly altered even in mild or early dementia. The specific
geometric features and quantitative comparisons demonstrate potential for using
vascular morphology as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for neurologic
disorders.

theoretical and experimental research, we investigate the anisotropic magnetic
and magnetoelastic properties for magnetic fields applied along the main
crystallographic axes as well as for fields canted out of the honeycomb plane.
We found that the magnetostriction anisotropy is unusually large compared to
the anisotropy of the magnetization, which is related to the strong
magnetoelastic $\widetilde{\Gamma'}$-type coupling in our \textit{ab-initio}
derived model. We observed large, non-symmetric magnetic anisotropy for
magnetic fields canted out of the honeycomb $ab$-plane in opposite directions,
namely towards the $+c^*$ or $-c^*$ axes, respectively. The observed
directional anisotropy is explained by considering the relative orientation of
the magnetic field with respect to the co-aligned RuCl$_6$ octahedra.
Magnetostriction measurements in canted fields support this non-symmetric
magnetic anisotropy, however these experiments are affected by magnetic torque
effects. Comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental findings allow
us to recognize the significant contribution of torque effects in experimental
setups where $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is placed in canted magnetic fields.

tacit collusion, where reinforcement learning algorithms learn to set collusive

This raises the question as to whether collusive pricing can be prevented
through the design of suitable ""buy boxes,"" i.e., through the design of the
rules that govern the elements of e-commerce sites that promote particular

reinforcement learning (RL) can also be used by platforms to learn buy box

adopt the methodology of Stackelberg POMDPs, and demonstrate success in
learning robust rules that continue to provide high consumer welfare together

sparked attention-related research in psychology, neuroscience, and, more
recently, computer vision and artificial intelligence. The attention mechanism
in artificial neural networks is known to improve learning tasks. However, no
previous research has combined the network attention and human attention. This
paper describes a gaze-guided class activation mapping (GG-CAM) method to
directly regulate the formation of network attention based on expert
radiologists' visual attention for the chest X-ray pathology classification
problem, which remains challenging due to the complex and often nuanced
differences among images. GG-CAM is a lightweight ($3$ additional trainable
parameters for regulating the learning process) and generic extension that can
be easily applied to most classification convolutional neural networks (CNN).
GG-CAM-modified CNNs do not require human attention as an input when fully
trained. Comparative experiments suggest that two standard CNNs with the GG-CAM
extension achieve significantly greater classification performance. The median
area under the curve (AUC) metrics for ResNet50 increases from $0.721$ to
$0.776$. For EfficientNetv2 (s), the median AUC increases from $0.723$ to
$0.801$. The GG-CAM also brings better interpretability of the network that
facilitates the weakly-supervised pathology localization and analysis.

information and the coordinates of ground users as the inputs, as well as the
location of UAVs and the transmission power of all transmitters as outputs, we
obtain the mapping from inputs to outputs through training the parameters of
GNN. Simulation results verified that the way to maximize the total

samples. Moreover, it also shows that the performance of proposed GNN-based

Interestingly, multiphoton quantum systems can host many complex forms of

properties of multiphoton systems degrade upon propagation leading to undesired
quantum-to-classical transitions. Furthermore, the manipulation of multiphoton

which define the nature of diverse light sources, can be modified upon
propagation in the absence of light-matter interactions. The generality of our
formalism unveils the conditions under which the evolution of multiphoton

we show that the implementation of conditional measurements may enable the

spray flame in a mixture of fine ethanol droplets and air. Eulerian-Eulerian
method with two-way coupling is used and detailed chemical mechanism is
considered. Different droplet diameters and liquid fuel equivalence ratios (ER)
are studied. The evaporation completion front (ECF) is defined to study the
interactions between the evaporation zone and flame front. The gas composition
at the flame front is quantified through an effective ER. The results show that
the kernel trajectory is considerably affected by droplet size and liquid ER.
Generally, the flame ER reaches the maximum when the ECF start to move from the
spherical center. It gradually decreases and reaches a constant value when the
flame freely propagates. Quasi-stationary spherical flame is observed when the
liquid ER is low, whilst kernel extinction/re-ignition appears when liquid ER
is high. These flame behaviors are essentially affected by the heat conduction
and species diffusion timescales between the droplet evaporation zone and flame
front. The dependence of the minimum ignition energy (MIE) on liquid ER is
U-shaped and there is an optimal liquid equivalence ratio range (ERo) with the
smallest MIE. Long and short ignition failure modes are observed, respectively
for small and large liquid ERs. When liquid ER is less than ERo (long failure
mode), larger energy is required to initiate the kernel due to very lean
composition near the spark. For liquid ER larger than ERo (short mode),
ignition failure is caused by strong evaporative heat loss and rich gas
composition due to heavy droplet loading.

the 2D crystal surrounding a bubble can adhere to and, meanwhile, slide on the

with the aid of large-scale labeled datasets. Yet these datasets are
time-consuming and labor-exhaustive to obtain on realistic tasks. To mitigate
the requirement for labeled data, self-training is widely used in
semi-supervised learning by iteratively assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled
samples. Despite its popularity, self-training is well-believed to be
unreliable and often leads to training instability. Our experimental studies
further reveal that the bias in semi-supervised learning arises from both the
problem itself and the inappropriate training with potentially incorrect pseudo
labels, which accumulates the error in the iterative self-training process. To
reduce the above bias, we propose Debiased Self-Training (DST). First, the
generation and utilization of pseudo labels are decoupled by two
parameter-independent classifier heads to avoid direct error accumulation.
Second, we estimate the worst case of self-training bias, where the pseudo
labeling function is accurate on labeled samples, yet makes as many mistakes as
possible on unlabeled samples. We then adversarially optimize the
representations to improve the quality of pseudo labels by avoiding the worst
case. Extensive experiments justify that DST achieves an average improvement of
6.3% against state-of-the-art methods on standard semi-supervised learning
benchmark datasets and 18.9%$ against FixMatch on 13 diverse tasks.
Furthermore, DST can be seamlessly adapted to other self-training methods and
help stabilize their training and balance performance across classes in both
cases of training from scratch and finetuning from pre-trained models.

due to its superior characters as compared to the centrosymmetric one. On one
side, the topological phase coming from global geometric properties of the
quantum wave function remains unchanged, on the other side, abundant exotic
phenomena are predicted to be merely emerged in non-centrosymmetric ones, due
to the redistribution of local quantum geometry. Whereas, probing the local
quantum geometry in non-centrosymmetric topological material remains
challenging. Here, we report a non-centrosymmetric topological phase in
ZrTe$_5$, probed by the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect. The angle-resolved and
temperature-dependent NLH measurement reveals the inversion and ab-plane mirror
symmetries breaking under 30 K, consistent with our theoretical calculation.
Our findings identify a new non-centrosymmetric phase of ZrTe$_5$ and provide a
platform to probe and control local quantum geometry via crystal symmetries.

alternative to existing transportation paradigms, currently challenged by
urbanization and increasing travel needs. By centrally controlling a fleet of

are currently starting to be deployed in a number of cities around the world.
Current learning-based approaches for controlling AMoD systems are limited to
the single-city scenario, whereby the service operator is allowed to take an
unlimited amount of operational decisions within the same transportation
system. However, real-world system operators can hardly afford to fully
re-train AMoD controllers for every city they operate in, as this could result
in a high number of poor-quality decisions during training, making the
single-city strategy a potentially impractical solution. To address these
limitations, we propose to formalize the multi-city AMoD problem through the
lens of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) and devise an actor-critic
algorithm based on recurrent graph neural networks. In our approach, AMoD
controllers are explicitly trained such that a small amount of experience
within a new city will produce good system performance. Empirically, we show
how control policies learned through meta-RL are able to achieve near-optimal
performance on unseen cities by learning rapidly adaptable policies, thus
making them more robust not only to novel environments, but also to
distribution shifts common in real-world operations, such as special events,
unexpected congestion, and dynamic pricing schemes.

for the instability of the learning process and the sensitivity of the acquired

and in summary, the smoothness of policy and value functions learned mainly in
RL contributes to these problems. However, if these functions are extremely
smooth, their expressiveness would be lost, resulting in not obtaining the
global optimal solution. This paper therefore considers RL under local
Lipschitz continuity constraint, so-called L2C2. By designing the
spatio-temporal locally compact space for L2C2 from the state transition at
each time step, the moderate smoothness can be achieved without loss of
expressiveness. Numerical noisy simulations verified that the proposed L2C2
outperforms the task performance while smoothing out the robot action generated

accreting matter on the neutron star (NS) surface. The quick release of
energetic X-ray photons during such bursts interacts with the surrounding
accretion disk, which raises the accretion rate due to Poynting-Robertson drag
and, thus, a fraction of the burst emission is reflected. We analyzed two
photospheric radius expansion bursts in the NS low-mass X-ray binary 4U
1636--536 that took place in 2017, using data from Neutron star Interior
Composition Explorer. The time-resolved burst spectra showed clear deviations
from a blackbody model. The spectral fitting can be significantly improved by
introducing either the enhanced persistent emission (the $f_a$ model) or the
reflection from the accretion disk (the \texttt{relxillNS} model). The $f_a$
model provides a higher blackbody temperature and higher burst flux compared
with the \texttt{relxillNS} model. The peak fluxes of two bursts from the $f_a$
model, $4.36\times10^{-8}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and
$9.10\times10^{-8}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, are slightly higher than the
Eddington limits of mixed hydrogen-helium and pure helium bursts from previous
observations, respectively. When the disk reflections have been taken into
account simultaneously, the peak fluxes are lower to match the preferred
values. We find evidence to support the finding that both the
Poynting-Robertson drag and disk reflection have been appeared during these two
X-ray bursts. Moreover, the disk reflection may contribute $\sim20-30\%$ of the
total burst emissions.

dialogue utterances, where each slot represents an essential part of the
information to accomplish a task, and slot value is updated recurrently in each
dialogue turn. However, many DST models cannot update slot values
appropriately. These models may repeatedly inherit wrong slot values extracted
in previous turns, resulting in the fail of the entire DST task. They cannot
update indirectly mentioned slots well, either. This study designed a model
with a mentioned slot pool (MSP) to tackle the update problem. The MSP is a
slot-specific memory that records all mentioned slot values that may be
inherited, and our model updates slot values according to the MSP and the
dialogue context. Our model rejects inheriting the previous slot value when it
predicates the value is wrong. Then, it re-extracts the slot value from the
current dialogue context. As the contextual information accumulates with the
dialogue progress, the new value is more likely to be correct. It also can
track the indirectly mentioned slot by picking a value from the MSP.

planets; the same orbital spacing between adjacent planet's pairs; and orbits
with small eccentricities and inclinations. We evolve the host star from the MS

those for which the $\beta$ radial and energy profiles are closely related.
Consequently, we propose that comparing the $\beta$ radial and energy profiles
might be a novel way to examine the sensitivity to different selection criteria
and thus examining the robustness of the anisotropy parameter in tracing
stellar kinematics. We compare simulated $\beta$ radial profiles against
various observations and demonstrate that, in most cases, the model diversity
is comparable with the error bars from different observations, meaning that the
TNG50 models are in good overall agreement with observations.

is a promising approach for realizing privacy-preserving FL, which has garnered
significant academic attention in recent years. Implementing the TEE on the
server side enables each round of FL to proceed without exposing the client's
gradient information to untrusted servers. This addresses usability gaps in
existing secure aggregation schemes as well as utility gaps in differentially
private FL. However, to address the issue using a TEE, the vulnerabilities of
server-side TEEs need to be considered -- this has not been sufficiently
investigated in the context of FL. The main technical contribution of this
study is the analysis of the vulnerabilities of TEE in FL and the defense.
First, we theoretically analyze the leakage of memory access patterns,
revealing the risk of sparsified gradients, which are commonly used in FL to
enhance communication efficiency and model accuracy. Second, we devise an
inference attack to link memory access patterns to sensitive information in the
training dataset. Finally, we propose an oblivious yet efficient aggregation
algorithm to prevent memory access pattern leakage. Our experiments on
real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method functions efficiently in
practical scales.

in anonymous, congested and highly dynamic and not-always-connected
networks/systems. More precisely, the system consists of an unknown number of
anonymous nodes with congestion on links and local computation. Links can
change arbitrarily from round to round, with only limitation that the union of
any T consecutive networks must form a temporarily connected (multi-)graph on
all nodes (knowledge of T is the only information the nodes require, otherwise
the communication would not be feasible). Nodes do not have any IDs, only some
number l of them have a bit distinguishing them from nodes without such a bit.
In each round a node can send and receive messages from its current neighbors.
Links and nodes are congested, in the sense that the length of messages and
local cache memory for local computation is (asymptotically) logarithmic.
  All-to-all communication is a fundamental principle in distributed computing
- it assumes that each node has an input message to be delivered to all other
nodes. Without loss of generality, the size of each input message is
logarithmic to fit in the link and node congestion assumption; otherwise, they
could be split in logarithmic batches and considered one-by-one. Because of
anonymity, each node needs to receive only a set of all input messages, each
accompanied by a number of initiating nodes (message multiplicity). We prove
that this task can be done in time polynomial in the (initially unknown) number
of nodes n and in the lower bound on the isoperimetric numbers of dynamically
evolving graphs. This allows to efficiently emulate a popular Congested Clique
model on top of Anonymous Dynamic Congested Systems (ADCS) with Opportunistic

around $4\sim 5$ mmag when averaged over $20'$ regions. However, significant
large- and small-scale spatial variation of magnitude offset, up to over 1 per

the $grizy$ filters. The calibration errors in different filters are
un-correlated, and are slightly larger for the $g$ and $y$ filters. We also

events enable DNA-interacting enzymes to recognize foreign DNA for destruction.
Due to the programmability and specificity of these genetic templates,
CRISPR-Cas systems are potential alternative antibiotics that can be engineered
to self-target antimicrobial resistance genes on the chromosome or plasmid.
However, several fundamental questions remain to repurpose these tools against
drug-resistant bacteria. For endogenous CRISPR-Cas self-targeting,
antimicrobial resistance genes and functional CRISPR-Cas systems have to
co-occur in the target cell. Furthermore, these tools have to outplay DNA
repair pathways that respond to the nuclease activities of Cas proteins, even
for exogenous CRISPR-Cas delivery. Here, we conduct a comprehensive survey of
CRISPR-Cas genomes. First, we address the co-occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems
and antimicrobial resistance genes in the CRISPR-Cas genomes. We show that the
average number of these genes varies greatly by the CRISPR-Cas type, and some
CRISPR-Cas types (IE and IIIA) have over 20 genes per genome. Next, we
investigate the DNA repair pathways of these CRISPR-Cas genomes, revealing that
the diversity and frequency of these pathways differ by the CRISPR-Cas type.
The interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA repair pathways is essential
for the acquisition of new spacers in CRISPR arrays. We conduct simulation
studies to demonstrate that the efficiency of these DNA repair pathways may be
inferred from the time-series patterns in the RNA structure of CRISPR repeats.
This bioinformatic survey of CRISPR-Cas genomes elucidates the necessity to
consider multifaceted interactions between different genes and systems to

maintaining sufficient thrust force to hover and fly. We describe the

Differential privacy (DP) is the state-of-the-art technique to defend against

antiferromagnetic order for $X$=Me$_4$P, Me$_4$As, Me$_4$Sb, Et$_2$Me$_2$As and
a QSL for $X$=EtMe$_3$Sb without adjustable parameters. We find that the QSL
for $X$=EtMe$_3$Sb exhibits 1D nature characterized by algebraic decay of spin
correlation along one direction, while exponential decay in the other
direction, indicating dimensional reduction from 2D to 1D. The 1D nature indeed
accounts for the experimental specific heat, thermal conductivity and magnetic
susceptibility. The identified QSL, however, preserves 2D nature as well
consistently with spin fractionalization into spinon with Dirac-like gapless
excitations and reveals duality bridging the 1D and 2D QSLs.

  Representations",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent work has uncovered a striking phenomenon in large-capacity neural
networks: they contain blocks of contiguous hidden layers with highly similar
representations. This block structure has two seemingly contradictory
properties: on the one hand, its constituent layers exhibit highly similar
dominant first principal components (PCs), but on the other hand, their
representations, and their common first PC, are highly dissimilar across
different random seeds. Our work seeks to reconcile these discrepant properties
by investigating the origin of the block structure in relation to the data and
training methods. By analyzing properties of the dominant PCs, we find that the
block structure arises from dominant datapoints - a small group of examples
that share similar image statistics (e.g. background color). However, the set
of dominant datapoints, and the precise shared image statistic, can vary across
random seeds. Thus, the block structure reflects meaningful dataset statistics,
but is simultaneously unique to each model. Through studying hidden layer
activations and creating synthetic datapoints, we demonstrate that these simple
image statistics dominate the representational geometry of the layers inside
the block structure. We explore how the phenomenon evolves through training,
finding that the block structure takes shape early in training, but the
underlying representations and the corresponding dominant datapoints continue
to change substantially. Finally, we study the interplay between the block
structure and different training mechanisms, introducing a targeted
intervention to eliminate the block structure, as well as examining the effects
of pretraining and Shake-Shake regularization.

computation-aware measurement for individual weight importance, followed by a
Cross-Layer Ranking (CLR) of weights to identify and remove the bottom-ranked
weights. Consequently, the per-layer sparsity makes up of the pruned network
structure in our filter pruning. Then, we introduce a recommendation-based
filter selection scheme where each filter recommends a group of its closest
filters. To pick the preserved filters from these recommended groups, we
further devise a k-Reciprocal Nearest Filter (RNF) selection scheme where the
selected filters fall into the intersection of these recommended groups. Both
our pruned network structure and the filter selection are non-learning

differentiate our method from existing works. We conduct image classification

shows better performance under successive-cancellation decoding. In this paper
we propose a hybrid polar coded modulation scheme that lies between BICM and
MLC, wherein a fraction of bits are assigned to set-partition (SP) labeling and
the remaining bits are assigned for Gray labeling. The SP labeled bits undergo
sequential demodulation, using iterative demodulation and polar decoding
similar to MLC, whereas the Gray labeled bits are first demodulated in parallel
and then sent for decoding similar to BICM. Either polar codes or other channel
codes (such as LDPC codes) can be used for the Gray labeled bits. For length
2048 rate 1/2 polar code on 256-QAM, the performance gap between BICM (Gray

over MLC. These performance gains make the proposed scheme attractive for

geometric interpolation method must be employed to extend the bond energy
expression from binary to ternary formalism. The aim of the present work is to
implement such extension by means of a generic geometric interpolation
approach. The generic method is unbiased and can be transformed into the widely
used Kohler, Toop and Muggianu approaches with special interpolation
parameters. The interpolation parameters can be calculated by the integration
method as well as be optimized by ternary experimental data. The generic bond
energy formalism (GBEF) has thus been derived to provide the MQMPA great
flexibility to describe ternary solutions with complex configurations.
Moreover, the GBEF is more concise than the formula derived by a combinatorial
Kohler-Toop method. The concise GBEF is in the respect more conveniently
programmed. Eventually, the Cu-Li-Sn liquid where both SRO and clustering among

to react quickly and effectively to the pool of stimuli patterns previously

involve a specific set-up centered around a relatively small set of patterns
presented in a particular environment. For example, at a party, people
recognize friends immediately, without deep analysis, just by seeing a fragment
of their clothes. This set-up with reduced ""ontology"" is referred to as a
""situation"". Situations are usually local in space and time. In this work, we
propose that neuron-astrocyte networks provide a network topology that is
effectively adapted to accommodate situation-based memory. In order to
illustrate this, we numerically simulate and analyze a well-established model
of a neuron-astrocyte network, which is subjected to stimuli conforming to the
situation-driven environment. Three pools of stimuli patterns are considered:
external patterns, patterns from the situation associative pool regularly
presented to the network and learned by the network, and patterns already
learned and remembered by astrocytes. Patterns from the external world are
added to and removed from the associative pool. Then we show that astrocytes
are structurally necessary for an effective function in such a learning and
testing set-up. To demonstrate this we present a novel neuromorphic model for
short-term memory implemented by a two-net spiking neural-astrocytic network.
Our results show that such a system tested on synthesized data with selective
astrocyte-induced modulation of neuronal activity provides an enhancement of
retrieval quality in comparison to standard spiking neural networks trained via
Hebbian plasticity only. We argue that the proposed set-up may offer a new way
to analyze, model, and understand neuromorphic artificial intelligence systems.

important for hyper-efficient implementations of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.
However, these networks face challenges when trained using error
backpropagation, due to the absence of gradient signals when applying hard
thresholds. The broadly accepted trick to overcoming this is through the use of
biased gradient estimators: surrogate gradients which approximate thresholding
in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), and Straight-Through Estimators (STEs),
which completely bypass thresholding in Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs). While
noisy gradient feedback has enabled reasonable performance on simple supervised
learning tasks, it is thought that such noise increases the difficulty of
finding optima in loss landscapes, especially during the later stages of
optimization. By periodically boosting the Learning Rate (LR) during training,
we expect the network can navigate unexplored solution spaces that would
otherwise be difficult to reach due to local minima, barriers, or flat
surfaces. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a cosine-annealed LR
schedule coupled with weight-independent adaptive moment estimation as applied

also show that the spread of Larmor frequencies within the electron ensemble in

of the qubit into the transmission line is suppressed. When strong control
fields are applied in the transmission line, the filter is saturated and
effectively switched off. Such a Purcell filtering capability permits both the
control and measurement of the qubit using the single transmission line, while
maintaining the long coherence time of the qubit in the absence of the control

realized using simple pulse shapes. For devices that already use one
transmission line both for control and measurement of the qubit, our work
provides a way to completely filter out the qubit frequency without removing
the possibility of controlling the system. Further, combining the proposed

few labelled data. This challenging task requires mining of the relevant
relationships between the query image and the support images. Previous works

various models have been designed to explore the correlation of pixels between
the query image and the support images. However, they focus only on pixel-wise
correspondence and ignore the overall correlation of objects. In this paper, we
introduce a mask-based classification method for addressing this problem. The
mask aggregation network (MANet), which is a simple mask classification model,
is proposed to simultaneously generate a fixed number of masks and their
probabilities of being targets. Then, the final segmentation result is obtained
by aggregating all the masks according to their locations. Experiments on both

electronic transitions. The spectra were measured for several momentum
transfers (q), conducted at both low temperature (T=14K) and room temperature.
While we can not rule out dispersive features possibly owing to propagating
excitations, the coarse envelopes of the general spectra did not appreciably
change shape with q, implying that the bulk of the observed L-edge RIXS
intensity originates from (mostly) non-dispersive ligand field (LF)
excitations. Summing the RIXS spectra over q and comparing the results at T=14
K to those at T=300 K, revealed pronounced temperature effects, including an
intensity change and energy shift of the 1.4 eV peak, a broadband intensity
increase of the 3-4 eV range, and higher energy features. The q-summed spectra
and their temperature dependences are virtually identical for nearly all of the

rigid alignment of images and/or volumes. In the context of images, a rigid
alignment involves estimating the inner-product between one image of $N\times
N$ pixels and another image that has been translated by some displacement and
rotated by some angle $\gamma$. In many situations the number of rotations
$\gamma$ considered is large (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(N)$), while the number of
translations considered is much smaller (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(1)$). In these
scenarios a naive algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(N^{3})$ operations to
calculate the array of inner-products for each image-pair. This computation can
be accelerated by using a fourier-bessel basis and the fast-fourier-transform
(FFT), requiring only $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations per image-pair. We propose
a simple data-driven compression algorithm to further accelerate this
computation, which we refer to as the `radial-SVD'. Our approach involves
linearly-recombining the different rings of the original images (expressed in
polar-coordinates), taking advantage of the singular-value-decomposition (SVD)
to choose a low-rank combination which both compresses the images and optimizes
a certain measure of angular discriminability. When aligning multiple images to
multiple targets, the complexity of our approach is $\mathcal{O}(N(\log(N)+H))$
per image-pair, where $H$ is the rank of the SVD used in the compression above.
The advantage gained by this approach depends on the ratio between $H$ and $N$;
the smaller $H$ is the better. In many applications $H$ can be quite a bit
smaller than $N$ while still maintaining accuracy. We present numerical results
in a cryo-EM application demonstrating that the radial- and degree-SVD can help
save a factor of $5$--$10$ for both image- and volume-alignment.

exploration of the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and phonons in crystalline
solids. Following photo-absorption of a pump pulse and the initial electronic
thermalization, the dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom
is dominated by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering processes.The
two-temperature model (TTM) and its generalizations -- as, e.g., the
non-thermal lattice model (NLM) -- provide valuable tools to describe these
phenomena and the ensuing coupled electron-phonon dynamics over timescales
ranging between few hundreds of femtoseconds and tens of picoseconds. While
more sophisticated theoretical approaches are nowadays available, the
conceptual and computational simplicity of the TTM makes it the method of
choice to model thermalization processes in pump-probe spectroscopy, and it
keeps being widely applied in both experimental and theoretical studies. In the
domain of ab-initio methods, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation (TDBE)
ameliorates many of the shortcomings of the TTM and it enables a realistic and
parameter-free description of ultrafast phenomena with full momentum
resolution. After a pedagogical introduction to the TTM and TDBE, in this

lifetime, and properties of possible dark radiation from DM decay. The
existence of inverse mass and energy cascade from small to large scales
facilitates the hierarchical structure formation. A scale-independent rate of
energy cascade $\varepsilon_u\approx-4.6\times10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be
identified. The energy cascade leads to a two-thirds law for pairwise velocity
and a four-thirds law for halo density. Both scaling laws can be confirmed by
N-body simulations and galaxy rotation curves. For collisionless dark matter
with only gravity involved, scaling laws can be extended down to the smallest
scale, where quantum effects become important. Combining $\varepsilon_u$,
Planck constant $\hbar$, and gravitational constant $G$ on that scale, we
predict DM particles have a mass
$m_X=(\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}=0.9\times10^{12}$GeV, a size
$l_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-1}\hbar G)^{1/3}=3\times10^{-13}$m, and a lifetime
$\tau_X=c^2/\varepsilon_u=10^{16}$yrs, where $c$ is the speed of light. The
energy scale $E_X=(\varepsilon_u^5\hbar^7G^{-2})^{1/9}=10^{-9}$eV strongly
suggests a dark ""radiation"" field to provide a viable mechanism for energy
dissipation. If existing, the dark ""radiation"" should be produced at an early

$\Omega_ah^2\approx 2.6\times 10^{-7}$, i.e. 1$\%$ of the photon energy in CMB

prediction, there also exist extensions in the form of reject options which
allow the model to reject inputs where only a prediction with an unacceptably

beamlines with an energy degrader as in the Proscan facility at PSI, but also
for modeling the beam traversing the Muon- and Pion-production targets of the
Paul Scherrer Institut's high intensity proton accelerator (HIPA). MinT is
intended to be useful as a support tool for the HIPA and Proscan control rooms.
This requires to have useful results within a few seconds. Hence simplicity and
speed of calculation is favored against higher accuracy. MinT has been designed
not only to replace the FORTRAN 77 codes TRANSPORT and TURTLE, but to combine
and extent their capabilities. MinT is a byte-code-compiler which translates an
input language, described by syntactic rules. This allows for control
structures like ""if-then-else"" or ""while""-loops, thus providing a high

Lagrangians, the cross section of $p+T^+_{cc}\to p+D^++D^0$ process is

measurement to a subsequent measurement, which can be quantified based on
observed data, sets lower-bounds to uncertainty. This idea can be universally
applied to various measures of uncertainty and disturbance, with the help of
data processing inequality. The obtained relations, referred to as disturbance
enhanced uncertainty relations, immediately find various applications in the
field of quantum information. They ensure preparation uncertainty relation such
as novel entropic uncertainty relations independent of the Maassen and Uffink

adversarial examples in the data space, which may neglect the geometric
characteristics of point clouds. Instead, we propose point cloud attacks from a
new perspective -- Graph Spectral Domain Attack (GSDA), aiming to perturb
transform coefficients in the graph spectral domain that corresponds to varying
certain geometric structure. In particular, we naturally represent a point
cloud over a graph, and adaptively transform the coordinates of points into the
graph spectral domain via graph Fourier transform (GFT) for compact
representation. We then analyze the influence of different spectral bands on
the geometric structure of the point cloud, based on which we propose to
perturb the GFT coefficients in a learnable manner guided by an energy
constraint loss function. Finally, the adversarial point cloud is generated by
transforming the perturbed spectral representation back to the data domain via
the inverse GFT (IGFT). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed GSDA in terms of both imperceptibility and attack success rates

a unified convergence analysis that covers a large variety of stochastic

reasoning from various graph components, i.e., objects and relationships.
However, current scene graph generation (SGG) methods, including the unbiased
SGG methods, still struggle to predict informative relationships due to the
lack of 1) high-level inference such as transitive inference between
relationships and 2) efficient mechanisms that can incorporate all interactions
of graph components. To address the issues mentioned above, we devise a
hyper-relationship learning network, termed HLN, for SGG. Specifically, the
proposed HLN stems from hypergraphs and two graph attention networks (GATs) are
designed to infer relationships: 1) the object-relationship GAT or OR-GAT to
explore interactions between objects and relationships, and 2) the
hyper-relationship GAT or HR-GAT to integrate transitive inference of
hyper-relationships, i.e., the sequential relationships between three objects
for transitive reasoning. As a result, HLN significantly improves the
performance of scene graph generation by integrating and reasoning from object
interactions, relationship interactions, and transitive inference of
hyper-relationships. We evaluate HLN on the most popular SGG dataset, i.e., the
Visual Genome dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate its great
superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods. For example, the proposed HLN
improves the recall per relationship from 11.3\% to 13.1\%, and maintains the

multi-mode network-on-chip (NoC) to reduce the communication latency and
improve scalability. An optimal submatrix-wise memory partition strategy is
applied to reduce the amount of NoC traffic; and a two-stage usage sort method
leverages distributed tiles to improve computation speed. To make HiMA
fundamentally scalable, we create a distributed version of DNC called DNC-D to
allow almost all memory operations to be applied to local memories with
trainable weighted summation to produce the global memory output. Two
approximation techniques, usage skimming and softmax approximation, are
proposed to further enhance hardware efficiency. HiMA prototypes are created in

sequential information propagation in a pipeline manner or two-way implicit
interaction with a shared encoder. However, they still suffer from poor
information interaction due to the gap between the different task forms of NER
and RE, raising a controversial question whether RE is really beneficial to
NER. Motivated by this, we propose a novel and unified cascade framework that
combines the advantages of both sequential information propagation and implicit
interaction. Meanwhile, it eliminates the gap between the two tasks by
reformulating entity-relation extraction as unified span-extraction tasks.
Specifically, we propose a selection recurrent network as a shared encoder to
encode task-specific independent and shared representations and design two
sequential information propagation strategies to realize the sequential
information flow between NER and RE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approaches can achieve state-of-the-art results on two common benchmarks, ACE05

generative factors called ""domain"" and ""content"", and address the problem of
disentangling them in a fully unsupervised way. To achieve this, we propose a
principled, generalizable probabilistic model inspired by the Variational
Autoencoder. Our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the composite
task of generating images by combining the domain of one input with the content
of another. Distinctively, it can perform this task in a few-shot, unsupervised
manner, without being provided with explicit labelling for either domain or
content. The disentangled representations are learned through the combination
of a group-wise encoder and a novel domain-confusion loss.

learn like the brain. To address this issue, we analyze the brain responses of
two ferret auditory cortices recorded with functional UltraSound imaging (fUS),
while the animals were presented with 320 10\,s sounds. We compare these brain
responses to the activations of Wav2vec 2.0, a self-supervised neural network
pretrained with 960\,h of speech, and input with the same 320 sounds.
Critically, we evaluate Wav2vec 2.0 under two distinct modes: (i) ""Pretrained"",
where the same model is used for all sounds, and (ii) ""Continuous Update"",
where the weights of the pretrained model are modified with back-propagation
after every sound, presented in the same order as the ferrets. Our results show
that the Continuous-Update mode leads Wav2Vec 2.0 to generate activations that
are more similar to the brain than a Pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 or than other
control models using different training modes. These results suggest that the
trial-by-trial modifications of self-supervised algorithms induced by
back-propagation aligns with the corresponding fluctuations of cortical
responses to sounds. Our finding thus provides empirical evidence of a common

frame given two consecutive frames. Most of the previous studies have focused
on appropriate frame warping operations and refinement modules for the warped
frames. These studies have been conducted on natural videos containing only
continuous motions. However, many practical videos contain various unnatural
objects with discontinuous motions such as logos, user interfaces and
subtitles. We propose three techniques to make the existing deep learning-based
VFI architectures robust to these elements. First is a novel data augmentation
strategy called figure-text mixing (FTM) which can make the models learn
discontinuous motions during training stage without any extra dataset. Second,
we propose a simple but effective module that predicts a map called
discontinuity map (D-map), which densely distinguishes between areas of
continuous and discontinuous motions. Lastly, we propose loss functions to give
supervisions of the discontinuous motion areas which can be applied along with
FTM and D-map. We additionally collect a special test benchmark called
Graphical Discontinuous Motion (GDM) dataset consisting of some mobile games

the covariance matrix of measurements. Calibration of such instruments is
necessary and is a critical task. This is how the estimation of instrumental
errors is usually done thanks to the knowledge of referenced celestial sources.
However, the use of high sensitive antennas in modern radio interferometers
(LOFAR, SKA) brings a new challenge in radio astronomy because there are more
sensitive to Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI). The presence of RFI during
the calibration process generally induces biases in state-of-the-art solutions.
The purpose of this paper is to propose an alternative to alleviate the effects
of RFI. For that, we first propose a model to take into account the presence of
RFI in the data across multiple frequency channels thanks to a low-rank
structured noise. We then achieve maximum likelihood estimation of the
calibration parameters with a Space Alternating Generalized
Expectation-Maximization (SAGE) algorithm for which we derive originally two
sets of complete data allowing close form expressions for the updates.
Numerical simulations show a significant gain in performance for RFI corrupted
data in comparison with some more classical methods.

attracts increasing attention in the reinforcement learning (RL) community.
Existing robust RL methods mostly aim to achieve the max-min robustness by
optimizing the policy's performance in the worst-case environment. However, in
practice, a user that uses an RL policy may have different preferences over its
performance across environments. Clearly, the aforementioned max-min robustness
is oftentimes too conservative to satisfy user preference. Therefore, in this
paper, we integrate user preference into policy learning in robust RL, and
propose a novel User-Oriented Robust RL (UOR-RL) framework. Specifically, we
define a new User-Oriented Robustness (UOR) metric for RL, which allocates
different weights to the environments according to user preference and
generalizes the max-min robustness metric. To optimize the UOR metric, we
develop two different UOR-RL training algorithms for the scenarios with or
without a priori known environment distribution, respectively. Theoretically,
we prove that our UOR-RL training algorithms converge to near-optimal policies
even with inaccurate or completely no knowledge about the environment
distribution. Furthermore, we carry out extensive experimental evaluations in 4
MuJoCo tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that UOR-RL is comparable to
the state-of-the-art baselines under the average and worst-case performance
metrics, and more importantly establishes new state-of-the-art performance

Comments are welcome!",,,,"gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate temporal and causal threads in the fabric of contemporary
physical theories with an emphasis on empirical and operationalistic aspects.
Building on the axiomatization of general relativity proposed by J. Ehlers, F.
Pirani and A. Schild and the global space-time structure elaborated by R.
Penrose, S.W. Hawking, B. Carter and others, we argue that the current way of
doing relativistic physics presupposes treating time and causality as primitive
concepts, neither of them being `more primitive' than the other. The decision
regarding which concepts to assume as primitive and which statements to regard
as axioms depends on the choice of the angle at which we contemplate the whole.
This standard approach is based on the presupposition that the concept of a
point-like particle is a viable approximation. However, this assumption is not
supported by a realistic approach to doing physics and, in particular, by
quantum theory. We remove this assumption by analysing the recent works by M.
Eckstein and T. Miller. They consider the space $P(M)$ of probability measures
on space-time $M$ such that, for an element $\mu \in P(M)$, the number $\mu
(K)$ specifies the probability of the occurrence of some event associated with
the space-time region $K$ and the measure $\mu$. In this way, $M$ is not to be
regarded as a collection of space-time events, but rather as a support for
corresponding probability measures. As shown by Eckstein and Miller, the space
$P(M)$ inherits the causal order from the underlying space-time and facilitates
a rigorous notion of a `causal evolution of probability measures'. We look at
the deductive chains creating temporal and causal structures analysed in these
works, in order to highlight their operational (or quasi-operational) aspect.
This is impossible without taking into account the relative frequencies and
correlations observed in relevant experiments.

Atkin's theory of $q$-connectivity to the case of directed simplices. This
results in a preorder where simplices are related by sequences of simplices
that share a $q$-face with respect to directions specified by chosen face maps.
We leverage the Alexandroff equivalence between preorders and topological
spaces to introduce a new class of topological spaces for directed graphs,
enabling to assign new homotopy types different from those of directed flag
complexes as seen by simplicial homology. We further introduce simplicial path
analysis enabled by the connectivity preorders. As an application we
characterise structural differences between various brain networks by computing
their longest simplicial paths.

  Skeletal Alignment",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human actions involve complex pose variations and their 2D projections can be
highly ambiguous. Thus 3D spatio-temporal or 4D (i.e., 3D+T) human skeletons,
which are photometric and viewpoint invariant, are an excellent alternative to
2D+T skeletons/pixels to improve action recognition accuracy. This paper
proposes a new 4D dataset HAA4D which consists of more than 3,300 RGB videos in
300 human atomic action classes. HAA4D is clean, diverse, class-balanced where
each class is viewpoint-balanced with the use of 4D skeletons, in which as few
as one 4D skeleton per class is sufficient for training a deep recognition
model. Further, the choice of atomic actions makes annotation even easier,
because each video clip lasts for only a few seconds. All training and testing
3D skeletons in HAA4D are globally aligned, using a deep alignment model to the
same global space, making each skeleton face the negative z-direction. Such
alignment makes matching skeletons more stable by reducing intraclass
variations and thus with fewer training samples per class needed for action
recognition. Given the high diversity and skeletal alignment in HAA4D, we
construct the first baseline few-shot 4D human atomic action recognition
network without bells and whistles, which produces comparable or higher
performance than relevant state-of-the-art techniques relying on embedded space
encoding without explicit skeletal alignment, using the same small number of
training samples of unseen classes.

  Multi-antenna Broadcast Channel with Confidential Messages","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.08472",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As physical layer security evolves to multi-user systems, multi-user
interference (MUI) becomes an unavoidable issue. Recently, rate-splitting
multiple access (RSMA) emerges as a powerful non-orthogonal transmission
framework and interference management strategy with high spectral efficiency.
Unlike most works fully treating MUI as noise, we take all users' secrecy rate
requirements into consideration and propose an RSMA-based secure beamforming
approach to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR), where MUI is partially
decoded and partially treated as noise. User messages are split and encoded
into common and private streams. Each user not only decodes the common stream
and the intended private stream, but also tries to eavesdrop other users'
private streams. A successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach is
proposed to maximize the instantaneous WSR under perfect channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT). We then propose a joint weighted minimum
mean square error and SCA-based alternating optimization algorithm to maximize
the weighted ergodic sum-rate under imperfect CSIT. Numerical results
demonstrate RSMA achieves better WSR and is more robust to channel errors than
conventional multi-user linear precoding technique while ensuring all users'
security requirements. Besides, RSMA can satisfy all users' secrecy rate
requirements without introducing WSR loss thanks to its powerful interference
management capability.

distinct relative forces and alignment mechanisms. We analyze the linear
stability of polar cells migrating homogeneously in the ECM. Our theory
predicts that, as a consequence of cell-matrix alignment, contractile cells
migrate homogeneously for small wave vectors, while sufficiently extensile
cells migrate in domains. Homogeneous cell migration of both extensile and
contractile cells may be unstable for larger wave vectors, due to active forces
and the alignment of cells with their concentration gradient. These mechanisms
are stabilized by cellular alignment to the migration flow and matrix
stiffness. They are expected to be suppressed entirely for rigid matrices with
elastic moduli of order 10 kPa. Our theory should be useful in analyzing

different atoms to fill the outer positions, a few novel two-dimensional

the stable behavior of low \k{appa} in the 1T-sandwich structure, being
insensitive to the component. Our study would help design advanced functional
materials with reliable heat transfer performance for practical applications,

systems into different categories regarding habitability and evolved them
through time using probabilistic cellular automata rules analogous to the
model. As a dynamic effect, we include the existence of natural dispersal
vectors (e.g., dust, asteroids) in a way that avoids assumptions about their
agency. By assuming that dispersal vectors have a finite velocity and range,
the model includes the parameter of 'optical depth of life spreading'. The
effect of the oscillatory infection rate on the long-term behavior of the
dispersal flux, which adds a diffusive component to its progression, is also
taken into account. We found that phase space is separated into subregions of
long-lasting transmission, rapidly terminated transmission, and a transition
region between the two. We observed that depending on the amplitude of the
oscillatory life spreading rate, life-transmission in the Galactic patch might
take on different geometrical shapes. Even if some host systems are
uninhabited, life transmission has a certain threshold, allowing a patch to be
saturated with viable material over a long period. Although stochastic
fluctuations in the local density of habitable systems allow for clusters that
can continuously infect one another, the spatial pattern disappears when life
transmission is below the observed threshold, so that transmission process is
not permanent in time. Both findings suggest that a habitable planet in a
densely populated region may remain uninfected.

shows that the large deviations of the time-integrated moments are anomalous in
the sense that the logarithm of their distribution scales nonlinearly with the
integration time. The Gaussian prefactor gives a correction to the low-noise
approximation and leads us to define an instanton variance giving some insights
as to how anomalous large deviations are created in time. The results are
compared with simulations based on importance sampling, extending our previous
results based on direct Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude by explaining why
many of the standard analytical and numerical methods of large deviation theory
fail in the case of anomalous large deviations.

focus on data scientist users. Instead, tackling fairness must be inclusive and
involve domain experts with specialized tools and workflows. Thus,
domain-specific visualizations are needed for algorithmic fairness.
Furthermore, while much work on AI fairness has focused on predictive
decisions, less has been done for fair allocation and planning, which require
human expertise and iterative design to integrate myriad constraints. We
propose the Intelligible Fair Allocation (IF-Alloc) Framework that leverages
explanations of causal attribution (Why), contrastive (Why Not) and
counterfactual reasoning (What If, How To) to aid domain experts to assess and
alleviate unfairness in allocation problems. We apply the framework to fair
urban planning for designing cities that provide equal access to amenities and
benefits for diverse resident types. Specifically, we propose an interactive
visual tool, Intelligible Fair City Planner (IF-City), to help urban planners
to perceive inequality across groups, identify and attribute sources of
inequality, and mitigate inequality with automatic allocation simulations and
constraint-satisfying recommendations. We demonstrate and evaluate the usage
and usefulness of IF-City on a real neighborhood in New York City, US, with
practicing urban planners from multiple countries, and discuss generalizing our
findings, application, and framework to other use cases and applications of
fair allocation.

antiferromagnet (HAF) on the square-kagome (also called shuriken) lattice has

ground state, flat-band physics near the saturation field, and quantum scars.
Here, we present large-scale numerical investigations of the specific heat
$C(T)$, the entropy $S(T)$ as well as the susceptibility $\chi(T)$ by means of
the finite-temperature Lanczos method for system sizes of
$N=18,24,30,36,42,48$, and $N=54$. We find that the specific heat exhibits a
low-temperature shoulder below the major maximum which can be attributed to
low-lying singlet excitations filling the singlet-triplet gap, which is
significantly larger than the singlet-singlet gap. This observation is further
supported by the behavior of the entropy $S(T)$, where a change in the
curvature is present just at about $T/J=0.2$, the same temperature where the
shoulder in $C$ sets in. For the susceptibility the low-lying singlet
excitations are irrelevant, and the singlet-triplet gap leads to an
exponentially activated low-temperature behavior. The maximum in $\chi(T)$ is
found at a pretty low temperature $T_{\rm max}/J=0.146$ (for $N=42$) compared
to $T_{\rm max}/J=0.935$ for the unfrustrated square-lattice HAF signaling the
crucial role of frustration also for the susceptibility. We find a striking
similarity of our square-kagome data with the corresponding ones for the kagome

faces with both the mouth and nose covered by a mask, which is now very common
under the COVID-19 pandemic. Common approaches to tackle this problem include
1) discarding information from the masked regions during recognition and 2)
restoring the masked regions before recognition. Very few works considered the
consistency between features extracted from masked faces and from their

faces often showing degraded performance on mask-free faces. In this paper, we
propose a unified framework, named Face Feature Rectification Network
(FFR-Net), for recognizing both masked and mask-free faces alike. We introduce
rectification blocks to rectify features extracted by a state-of-the-art
recognition model, in both spatial and channel dimensions, to minimize the

difficulty is that we must account for potential biases of the agent which may
cause it to seemingly irrationally reject advice. To do this we introduce a
novel formalization of assistance that models these biases, allowing the
assistant to infer and adapt to them. We then introduce a new method for
planning the assistant's actions which can scale to large decision making

generalization capacity of predictive rules learned from such data are left to
establish. We analyze here the simple Kriging task from a statistical learning
perspective, i.e. by carrying out a nonparametric finite-sample predictive
analysis. Given $d\geq 1$ values taken by a realization of a square integrable
random field $X=\{X_s\}_{s\in S}$, $S\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with unknown
covariance structure, at sites $s_1,\; \ldots,\; s_d$ in $S$, the goal is to
predict the unknown values it takes at any other location $s\in S$ with minimum

predicted, observed at $n\geq 1$ locations $\sigma_1,\; \ldots,\; \sigma_n$ in
$S$. Despite the connection of this minimization problem with kernel ridge
regression, establishing the generalization capacity of empirical risk
minimizers is far from straightforward, due to the non independent and

  Dynamics",,,,,"physics.comp-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the properties of charge dynamics is crucial to many practical
applications, such as electrochemical energy devices and transmembrane ion
channels. This work proposes a Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re Nernst-Planck (MANP)
framework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a
curl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy
dissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated
to be equivalent to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model. By the energy dissipation
law, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving
Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach
to study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a
companion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally
preserve the discrete Gauss's law and converge robustly with linear
computational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main
advantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with
space-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient
Poisson's equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb
correlations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified
MANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical
results on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in
inhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the
performance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics,
illustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for
modeling charge dynamics.

the least mean decision time compared to other sequential or fixed-time tests
for given error rates. In some circumstances, cells need to make decisions
accurately and quickly, therefore it has been suggested the SPRT may be used to
understand the speed-accuracy tradeoff in cellular decision making. It is
generally thought that in order for cells to make use of the SPRT, it is
necessary to find biochemical circuits that can compute the log-likelihood
ratio needed for the SPRT. However, this paper takes a different approach. We
recognise that the high-level behaviour of the SPRT is defined by its positive
detection or hit rate, and the computation of the log-likelihood ratio is just
one way to realise this behaviour. In this paper, we will present a method
which uses a transcription-based detector to emulate the hit rate of the SPRT
without computing the exact log-likelihood ratio. We consider the problem of
using a promoter with multiple binding sites to accurately and quickly detect
whether the concentration of a transcription factor is above a target level. We
show that it is possible to find binding and unbinding rates of the
transcription factor to the promoter's binding sites so that the probability
that the amount of mRNA produced will be higher than a threshold is
approximately equal to the hit rate of the SPRT detector. Moreover, we show
that the average time that this transcription-based detector needs to make a
positive detection is less than or equal to that of the SPRT for a wide range
of concentrations. We remark that the last statement does not contradict Wald's
optimality result because our transcription-based detector uses an open-ended
test.

Transformer models under-explored. In fact, user and item IDs, as important
identifiers in recommender systems, are inherently in different semantic space

effectively fuse IDs into such models becomes a critical issue. Inspired by
recent advancement in prompt learning, we come up with two solutions: find
alternative words to represent IDs (called discrete prompt learning), and
directly input ID vectors to a pre-trained model (termed continuous prompt
learning). In the latter case, ID vectors are randomly initialized but the
model is trained in advance on large corpora, so they are actually in different
learning stages. To bridge the gap, we further propose two training strategies:
sequential tuning and recommendation as regularization. Extensive experiments
show that our continuous prompt learning approach equipped with the training

arXiv:1805.08829 proved that this problem is co-recursively enumerable

partially ionised plasmas in the weakly ionised limit, typical for the lower
part of the solar atmosphere. The framework in which the properties of waves
are discussed depends on the relative magnitude of collisions between
particles, but also on the relative magnitude of the collisional frequencies
compared to the gyro-frequency of charged particles. Our investigation shows
that the weakly ionised solar atmospheric plasma can divided into two regions
and this division occurs, roughly, at the base of the chromosphere. In the
solar photosphere the plasma is non-magnetised and the dynamics can described
within the three-fluid framework where acoustic waves associated to each
species can propagate. Due to the very high concentration of neutrals, the
neutral sound waves propagates with no damping, while for the other two modes
the damping rate is determined by collisions with neutrals. The ion and
electron-related acoustic modes propagate with a cut-off determined by the
collisional frequency of these species with neutrals. In the weakly ionised
chromosphere only electrons are magnetised, however, the strong coupling of
charged particles reduces the working framework to a two-fluid model. The
disassociation of charged particles creates electric currents that can
influence the characteristic of waves. The propagation properties of waves with
respect to the angle of propagation are studied with the help of polar
diagrams.

of related (stabilised) linearised discrete problems, and tends to a local

finite-dimensional approximation spaces are adaptively refined; this is
implemented in terms of a new mesh refinement strategy in the context of finite

problem under consideration, and does not involve any a posteriori error
indicators. In combination, the resulting adaptive algorithm consists of an
iterative linearisation procedure on a sequence of hierarchically refined

achieved for a given charge ratio of the two beams when the length and
separation of two beams and the plasma density are fixed. The formulas can also
help obtain the optimal plasma densities for the maximum accelerated charge and

the input image into a grid and directly predicts per grid cell object masks
with fully-convolutional networks, yielding comparably good performance as
traditional two-stage Mask R-CNN yet enjoying much simpler architecture and
higher efficiency. We observe SOLO generates similar masks for an object at
nearby grid cells, and these neighboring predictions can complement each other
as some may better segment certain object part, most of which are however
directly discarded by non-maximum-suppression. Motivated by the observed gap,
we develop a novel learning-based aggregation method that improves upon SOLO by
leveraging the rich neighboring information while maintaining the architectural
efficiency. The resulting model is named SODAR. Unlike the original per grid
cell object masks, SODAR is implicitly supervised to learn mask representations
that encode geometric structure of nearby objects and complement adjacent
representations with context. The aggregation method further includes two novel
designs: 1) a mask interpolation mechanism that enables the model to generate
much fewer mask representations by sharing neighboring representations among
nearby grid cells, and thus saves computation and memory; 2) a deformable
neighbour sampling mechanism that allows the model to adaptively adjust
neighbor sampling locations thus gathering mask representations with more
relevant context and achieving higher performance. SODAR significantly improves
the instance segmentation performance, e.g., it outperforms a SOLO model with
ResNet-101 backbone by 2.2 AP on COCO \texttt{test} set, with only about 3\%
additional computation. We further show consistent performance gain with the

well as dynamic modeling in the resulting latent representation is needed. This
can be achieved by artificial neural networks for dimension reduction, and
differential equations for dynamic modeling of individual-level trajectories.
However, such approaches so far assume that parameters of individual-level
dynamics are constant throughout the observation period. Motivated by an
application from psychological resilience research, we propose an extension
where different sets of differential equation parameters are allowed for
observation sub-periods. Still, estimation for intra-individual sub-periods is
coupled for being able to fit the model also with a relatively small dataset.
We subsequently derive prediction targets from individual dynamic models of
resilience in the application. These serve as interpretable resilience-related
outcomes, to be predicted from characteristics of individuals, measured at
baseline and a follow-up time point, and selecting a small set of important
predictors. Our approach is seen to successfully identify individual-level
parameters of dynamic models that allows us to stably select predictors, i.e.,
resilience factors. Furthermore, we can identify those characteristics of
individuals that are the most promising for updates at follow-up, which might

galaxies, which may serve as a useful laboratory for dark matter exploration
since some of them contains almost 99$\%$ of pure dark matter. The majority of
these galaxies contain no black hole that inhabits them. Recently, there had
been reports that some dwarf galaxies may have a black hole within. In this
study, we construct a black hole solution combined with the Dehnen dark matter
halo profile, which is commonly used for dwarf galaxies. We aim to find out
whether there would be deviations relative to the standard black hole
properties, which might allow determining whether the dark matter profile in an
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy is cored or cuspy. To make the model more realistic,
we applied the modified Newman-Janis prescription to obtain the rotating
metric. We analyzed the black hole properties such as the event horizon,
ergoregion, geodesics of time-like and null particles, and the black hole
shadow. Using these observables, the results indicate the difficulty of
distinguishing whether the dark matter is cored or cuspy. To find an observable
that can potentially distinguish these two profiles, we also calculated the
weak deflection angle to examine the effect of the Dehnen profile in finite
distance and far approximation. Our results indicate that using the weak
deflection angle is far better, in many orders of magnitude, in potentially
differentiating these profiles. We conclude that although dwarf galaxies are
dark matter-dominated places, the effect on the Dehnen profile is still
dependent on the mass of the black hole, considering the method used herein.

has to overcome is that it needs to deal with a large amount of radioactive
material in such a way as to not compromise the energy resolution required for
the separation of useful events from the massive beta-decay background. The
PTOLEMY project offers an innovative approach to this problem based on
deposition of radioactive material on graphene. While such an approach is
expected to resolve the main difficulty, new challenges arise from the
proximity of the beta decayers to a solid state system. In this work, we focus
on the effect of the shakeup of the graphene electron system due to a
beta-decay event. We calculate the distortion of the relic neutrino peaks as
resulting from such a shakeup, analyse the impact of the distortion on the
visibility of neutrino capture events and discuss what technological solutions

paradigm, can find an optimal solution by restricting the shape of the

paper develops a framework that can provide tight lower bounds to the optimum.
These bounds act as proxies for the optimum which can then be used to bound the
deviation of a feasible solution from the optimum. To accomplish this, we
develop a framework that consists of (i) a bi-level discretization approach
that converts the MPDO to a relaxed path planning problem, and (ii) an
algorithm that can solve the relaxed problem to obtain lower bounds. We also
present numerical results to corroborate the performance of the proposed

diverse policies. This is often achieved by iteratively training new policies
against existing ones, growing a policy population that is robust to exploit.
This iterative approach suffers from two issues in real-world games: a) under
finite budget, approximate best-response operators at each iteration needs
truncating, resulting in under-trained good-responses populating the
population; b) repeated learning of basic skills at each iteration is wasteful
and becomes intractable in the presence of increasingly strong opponents. In
this work, we propose Neural Population Learning (NeuPL) as a solution to both
issues. NeuPL offers convergence guarantees to a population of best-responses
under mild assumptions. By representing a population of policies within a
single conditional model, NeuPL enables transfer learning across policies.
Empirically, we show the generality, improved performance and efficiency of
NeuPL across several test domains. Most interestingly, we show that novel
strategies become more accessible, not less, as the neural population expands.

Al2O3/Pt/Au/Co/Au nanostructures with perpendicular anisotropy were studied.
Thereby, a correlation between the PA molecules ordering at the surface with
the electron tunneling across this hybrid system as a function of the substrate
magnetization orientation as well as the coverage density and helicity of the
was observed. The highest spin polarization values, P, were found for
well-ordered self-assembled monolayers and with a defined chemical coupling of

induced spin selectivity is a cooperative effect. Thereby, P deduced from the
electron transmission along unoccupied molecular orbitals of the helical

electron mobility yielding a higher P value. By switching the magnetization
direction of the Co-layer, it was demonstrated that the non-spin-polarized STM

of exciting many-body phenomena. However, quantifying the entanglement between
two parts of a real-world quantum system is challenging when it interacts with
its environment, as the latter mixes cross-boundary classical with quantum
correlations. Here, we efficiently quantify quantum correlations in such
realistic open systems using the operator space entanglement spectrum of a
mixed state. If the system possesses a fixed charge, we show that a subset of
the spectral values encode coherence between different cross-boundary charge
configurations. The sum over these values, which we call ""configuration
coherence"", can be used as a quantifier for cross-boundary coherence.
Crucially, we prove that for purity non-increasing maps, e.g., Lindblad-type
evolutions with Hermitian jump operators, the configuration coherence is an
entanglement measure. Moreover, it can be efficiently computed using a tensor
network representation of the state's density matrix. We showcase the
configuration coherence for spinless particles moving on a chain in presence of
dephasing. Our approach can quantify coherence and entanglement in a broad

  Morris-Thorne wormholes","14 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been known for a long time that Morris-Thorne wormholes can only be
held open by violating the null energy condition, which can be expressed in the
form $\tau-\rho c^2>0$, where $\tau$ is the radial tension. Matter that
violates this condition is usually referred to as ""exotic."" For any wormhole
having a moderately-sized throat, the radial tension is equal to that at the
center of a massive neutron star. Attributing this outcome to exotic matter
seems reasonable enough, but it ignores the fact that exotic matter was
introduced for a completely different reason. Moreover, its problematical
nature suggests that the amount of exotic matter be held to a minimum, but this
would make the high radial tension harder to explain. If the amount is
infinitely small, this explanation breaks down entirely. By invoking $f(R)$
modified gravity, the need for exotic matter at the throat could actually be
eliminated, but the negation of the above condition, i.e., $\tau <\rho c^2$,
shows that we have not necessarily eliminated the high radial tension. This
survey discusses various ways to account for the high radial tension and, in
some cases, the possible origin of exotic matter. We conclude with some
comments on a possible multiply-connected Universe.

BOSS combined with overlapping galaxy-galaxy lensing from three surveys: DES
Y3, HSC Y1, and KiDS-1000. An intra-lensing-survey study finds good agreement
between these lensing data. We model the observations using the Dark Emulator
and fit the data at two fixed cosmologies: Planck, with $S_8=0.83$, and a
Lensing cosmology with $S_8=0.76$. For a joint analysis limited to scales with
$R>5.25h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that both cosmologies provide an acceptable fit to
the data. Full utilisation of the small-scale clustering and lensing
measurements is hindered by uncertainty in the impact of baryon feedback and
assembly bias, which we account for with a reasoned theoretical error budget.
We incorporate a systematic scaling parameter for each redshift bin, $A$, that
decouples the lensing and clustering to capture any inconsistency. When a wide
range of scales ($0.15<R<60h^{-1}$Mpc) are incorporated, we find different
results for the consistency of clustering and lensing between the two
cosmologies. Limiting the analysis to the bins for which the impact of the
selection of the lens sample is expected to be minimal, for the low-$S_8$
Lensing cosmology, the measurements are consistent with $A$=1; $A=0.91\pm0.04$
using DES+KiDS and $A=0.97\pm0.06$ using HSC. For the Planck cosmology case, we
find a discrepancy: $A=0.79\pm0.03$ using DES+KiDS and $A=0.84\pm0.05$ using
HSC. We demonstrate that a kSZ-based estimate for baryonic effects alleviates
some of the discrepancy in the Planck cosmology. This analysis demonstrates the
statistical power of these small-scale measurements, but also indicates that
caution is still warranted given current uncertainties in modelling baryonic
effects, assembly bias, and selection effects in the foreground sample.

(SRT) that takes place at two magnetic fields of $B_{SORT1}$ and $B_{SORT2}$.
The effect is observed in the magnetization curves of small Mn$^{3+}$ magnetic
clusters in the wurtzite GaN (being in a paramagnetic state) calculated using
crystal field model approach. The obtained results suggest that the computed
magnetic anisotropy (MA) reverses its sign on increasing $B$ across $B_{SORT}$.
Detailed analysis show however that MA is unchanged for high magnetic fields.
We show that the observed effect arises from the interplay of the crystalline
environment and the spin-orbit coupling $\lambda \hat{\textbf{S}}
\hat{\textbf{L}}$, therefore we name it spin orbital reorientation transition
(SORT). The value of $B_{SORT1}$ depends on the crystal field model parameters
and the number of ions $N$ in a given cluster, whereas $B_{SORT2}$ is
controlled mostly by the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$. The
explanation of SORT is given in terms of the spin $M_S$ and orbital momentum
$M_L$ contributions to the total magnetization $M = M_S + M_L$. The similar
effect should also be present in other materials with not completely quenched
(non zero) orbital angular momentum $L$, a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and the
positive value of $\lambda$.

waves in stellar radiation zones in exoplanetary or binary systems. We are
partly motivated to study tides due to massive short-period hot Jupiters, which
preferentially orbit stars with convective cores, for which wave breaking near
the stellar centre cannot operate. We develop a theory (and test it with
numerical calculations) for the nonlinear excitation of super-harmonic
""secondary"" waves (with frequencies $2\omega_p$) by a ""primary"" tidal wave
(with frequency $\omega_p$) near the interface between the radiation zone and
convective envelope. These waves have the same horizontal phase speeds to
leading order, and this nonlinear effect could contribute importantly to tidal
dissipation if the secondary waves can efficiently damp the primary. We derive
criteria involving the orbital and stellar parameters required to excite these
secondary waves to large amplitudes using a local model of the
radiative/convective interface, which we convert to apply to tides in a
spherical star. We numerically evaluate the critical amplitudes required for
this new nonlinear effect to become important using stellar models, comparing
them to the ""conventional"" criteria for wave breaking in radiative cores and
the application of WKBJ theory near convective cores. The criteria for this new
effect are easier to satisfy than the conventional measures of nonlinearity in
$1.4$ and $2M_\odot$ stars on the main-sequence. We predict nonlinear effects
to be important even for planetary-mass companions around the latter, but this
effect is probably less important in stars with radiative cores.

$\omega$-regular winning conditions, where the environment is constrained by a
strong transition fairness assumption. Strong transition fairness is a widely
occurring special case of strong fairness, which requires that any execution is
strongly fair with respect to a specified set of live edges: whenever the
source vertex of a live edge is visited infinitely often along a play, the edge
itself is traversed infinitely often along the play as well. We show that,
surprisingly, strong transition fairness retains the algorithmic
characteristics of the fixpoint algorithms for $\omega$-regular games -- the
new algorithms have the same alternation depth as the classical algorithms but
invoke a new type of predecessor operator. For Rabin games with $k$ pairs, the
complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n^{k+2}k!)$ symbolic steps, which is
independent of the number of live edges in the strong transition fairness
assumption. Further, we show that GR(1) specifications with strong transition
fairness assumptions can be solved with a 3-nested fixpoint algorithm, same as
the usual algorithm. In contrast, strong fairness necessarily requires
increasing the alternation depth depending on the number of fairness
assumptions. We get symbolic algorithms for (generalized) Rabin, parity and
GR(1) objectives under strong transition fairness assumptions as well as a
direct symbolic algorithm for qualitative winning in stochastic
$\omega$-regular games that runs in $O(n^{k+2}k!)$ symbolic steps, improving

requirements which makes them infeasible for embedded systems with limited
hardware resources. We propose dual convolutional kernels (DualConv) for
constructing lightweight deep neural networks. DualConv combines 3$\times$3 and
1$\times$1 convolutional kernels to process the same input feature map channels
simultaneously and exploits the group convolution technique to efficiently
arrange convolutional filters. DualConv can be employed in any CNN model such
as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 for image classification, YOLO and R-CNN for object
detection, or FCN for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we extensively test
DualConv for classification since these network architectures form the
backbones for many other tasks. We also test DualConv for image detection on
YOLO-V3. Experimental results show that, combined with our structural
innovations, DualConv significantly reduces the computational cost and number
of parameters of deep neural networks while surprisingly achieving slightly
higher accuracy than the original models in some cases. We use DualConv to
further reduce the number of parameters of the lightweight MobileNetV2 by 54%
with only 0.68% drop in accuracy on CIFAR-100 dataset. When the number of
parameters is not an issue, DualConv increases the accuracy of MobileNetV1 by
4.11% on the same dataset. Furthermore, DualConv significantly improves the
YOLO-V3 object detection speed and improves its accuracy by 4.4% on PASCAL VOC
dataset.

spikes whose locations are located at the vertices of a regular N-gon inside
either a unit disk or an annulus. We call such configuration a ring of spikes.
The ring radius is characterized in terms of the modified Green's function. For
a disk, we find that a ring of 9 or more spikes is always unstable with respect
to small eigenvalues. Conversely, a ring of 8 or less spikes is stable inside a
disk provided that the feed-rate $A$ is sufficiently large. More generally, for
sufficiently high feed-rate, a ring of $N$ spikes can be stabilized provided
that the annulus is thin enough. As $A$ is decreased, we show that the ring is
destabilized due to small eigenvalues first, and then due to large eigenvalues,
although both of these thresholds are separated by an asymptotically small
amount. For a ring of 8 spikes inside a disk, the instability appears to be
supercritical, and deforms the ring into a square-like configuration. For less
than 8 spikes, this instability is subcritical and results in spike death.

a viscous fluid, flows freely with well-dispersed particles in a the absence of
a magnetic field, but particle aggregation results in flow cessation when a
field is applied. The mechanism of dynamical arrest is examined by analysing
interactions between magnetic particles in a magnetic field subject to a shear
flow. An isolated spherical magnetic particle undergoes a transition between a
rotating state at low magnetic field and a static orientation at high magnetic
field. The effect of interactions for spherical dipolar and polarisable
particles with static orientation is examined for a dilute viscous suspension.
There are magnetic interactions due to the magnetic field disturbance at one
particle caused by the dipole moment of another, hydrodynamic interactions due
to the antisymmetric force moment of a non-rotating particle in a shear flow,
and a modification of the magnetic field due to the particle magnetic moment
density. When there is a concentration variation, the torque balance condition
results in a disturbance to the orientation of the particle magnetic moment.
The net force and the drift velocity due to these disturbances is calculated,
and the collective motion generated is equivalent to an anisotropic diffusion
process. When the magnetic field is in the flow plane, the diffusion
coefficients in the two directions perpendicular to the field direction are
negative, implying that concentration fluctuations are unstable in these
directions. This instability could initiate field-induced dynamical arrest in a

renewables. Adjusting inverter injection setpoints for distributed energy
resources can be an effective grid control mechanism. However, finding such
setpoints optimally requires solving an optimal power flow (OPF), which can be
computationally taxing in real time. This work proposes learning the mapping
from grid conditions to OPF minimizers using Gaussian processes (GPs). This
GP-OPF model predicts inverter setpoints when presented with a new instance of
grid conditions. Training enjoys closed-form expressions, and GP-OPF
predictions come with confidence intervals. To improve upon data efficiency, we
uniquely incorporate the sensitivities (partial derivatives) of the OPF mapping
into GP-OPF. This expedites the process of generating a training dataset as
fewer OPF instances need to be solved to attain the same accuracy. To further
reduce computational efficiency, we approximate the kernel function of GP-OPF
leveraging the concept of random features, which is neatly extended to
sensitivity data. We perform sensitivity analysis for the second-order cone
program (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF, whose sensitivities can be computed by
merely solving a system of linear equations. Extensive numerical tests using
real-world data on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus benchmark feeders corroborate the
merits of GP-OPF.

prediction of BCS theory, whether three-neutron interactions are included or
not. Using a more sophisticated many-body approach that incorporates the effect
of short-range correlations in pairing properties, we find that the gap to
critical temperature ratio in the low-density regime is substantially larger

technologies in both its aspects - less energy consumption and replacement of
the petrochemicals by natural ingredients; by the costly and maintenance
demanding equipment for nanoemulsification; and by the quest for efficient and
robust self-emulsifying formulations for oral drug delivery. Here we first
present a brief overview of the main known low-energy methods for nanoemulsion
formation, focusing on their mechanistic understanding and discussing some
recent advances in their development and applications. Next, we review three
conceptually new approaches for self-emulsification in chemical technologies,
discovered in the last several years. The colloidal features and the specific
requirements of the self-emulsifying drug-delivery systems (SEDDS) are also
discussed briefly. Finally, we summarize the current trends and the main

characteristic investigation, workflow modeling and anomaly detection. Log data
is inherently unstructured or semi-structured, which makes it harder to
understand the event flow or other important information of a system by reading
raw logs. The process of structuring log files first identifies the log message
groups based on the system events that triggered them, and extracts an event
template to represent the log messages of each event. This paper introduces a
novel method to extract event templates from raw system log files, by using the
vector space model commonly used in the field of Information Retrieval to
vectorize log data and group log messages into event templates based on their
vector similarity. Template extraction process is further enhanced with the use
of character and length based filters. When evaluated on publicly available
real-world log data benchmarks, this proposed method outperforms all the
available state-of-the-art systems in terms of accuracy and robustness.

a reformulated degradation model and two novel modules. Following the common
practices of blind SR, our method proposes to improve both the kernel
estimation as well as the kernel-based high-resolution image restoration. To be
more specific, we first reformulate the degradation model such that the
deblurring kernel estimation can be transferred into the low-resolution space.
On top of this, we introduce a dynamic deep linear filter module. Instead of
learning a fixed kernel for all images, it can adaptively generate deblurring
kernel weights conditional on the input and yield a more robust kernel
estimation. Subsequently, a deep constrained least square filtering module is
applied to generate clean features based on the reformulation and estimated
kernel. The deblurred feature and the low input image feature are then fed into
a dual-path structured SR network and restore the final high-resolution result.
To evaluate our method, we further conduct evaluations on several benchmarks,
including Gaussian8 and DIV2KRK. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves better accuracy and visual improvements against
state-of-the-art methods.

challenges in three aspects: (i) distributional shift between the behavior
policy and the optimal policy, (ii) function approximation to handle large

a pessimism-based algorithm, dubbed as pessimistic minimax value iteration
(PMVI), which overcomes the distributional shift by constructing pessimistic
estimates of the value functions for both players and outputs a policy pair by
solving NEs based on the two value functions. Furthermore, we establish a

notion of ""relative uncertainty"", which characterizes the necessary and
sufficient condition for achieving sample efficiency in offline MGs. To the
best of our knowledge, we provide the first nearly minimax optimal result for
offline MGs with function approximation.

Spectroscopy data, including the flux intensity and equivalent widths and the
properties of their underlying stellar population. In the current study we
derive a set of physical quantities for all these regions based on those
properties, including (i) the fraction of young stars; (ii) the ionization
strength (using six different estimations); (iii) the oxygen abundance (using
25 different calibrators); (iv) the nitrogen and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance;
(v) the dust extinction and (vi) the electron density. Using this dataset we
explore how the loci in the classical diagnostic diagrams are connected with
those quantities, the radial distributions of these parameters, and the
inter-relations between themselves and with the properties of the underlying
stellar populations. We conclude that many properties of the HII regions are
tightly related to the galactic stellar evolution at the location where those
regions are observed. Those properties are modulated only as a second-order
effect by the properties of the ionizing stars and the ionized nebulae that do
not depend on the astrophysical context in which they are formed. Our results

ICASSP2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the recent advancements of data driven approaches using deep neural
networks, music source separation has been formulated as an instrument-specific
supervised problem. While existing deep learning models implicitly absorb the
spatial information conveyed by the multi-channel input signals, we argue that
a more explicit and active use of spatial information could not only improve
the separation process but also provide an entry-point for many
user-interaction based tools. To this end, we introduce a control method based
on the stereophonic location of the sources of interest, expressed as the
panning angle. We present various conditioning mechanisms, including the use of
raw angle and its derived feature representations, and show that spatial
information helps. Our proposed approaches improve the separation performance
compared to location agnostic architectures by 1.8 dB SI-SDR in our Slakh-based
simulated experiments. Furthermore, the proposed methods allow for the
disentanglement of same-class instruments, for example, in mixtures containing
two guitar tracks. Finally, we also demonstrate that our approach is robust to
incorrect source panning information, which can be incurred by our proposed
user interaction.

methods to extract stellar-oscillation mode parameters has been one of the
keystone of modern stellar physics. In the helio- and asteroseismology fields,
these methods are usually referred as peakbagging. We introduce in this paper
the apollinaire module, a new Python 3 open-source Markov Chains Monte Carlo
(MCMC) framework dedicated to peakbagging. The theoretical framework necessary
to understand MCMC peakbagging methods for disk-integrated helio- and
asteroseismic observations are extensively described. In particular, we present
the models that are used to estimate the posterior probability function in a
peakbagging framework. A description of the apollinaire module is then
provided. We explain how the module enables stellar background, p-mode global
pattern and individual-mode parameters extraction. By taking into account
instrumental specificities, stellar inclination angle, rotational splittings,
and asymmetries, the module allows fitting a large variety of p-mode models
suited for solar as well as stellar data analysis with different instruments.
After having been validated through a Monte Carlo fitting trial on synthetic
data, the module is benchmarked by comparing its outputs with results obtained
with other peakbagging codes. An analysis of the PSD of 89 one-year subseries
of GOLF observations is performed. Six stars are also selected from the Kepler
LEGACY sample in order to demonstrate the code abilities on asteroseismic data.
The parameters we extract with apollinaire are in good agreement with those
presented in the literature and demonstrate the precision and reliability of
the module.

gravitational effects may instigate complex fractal features in the structure
of a black hole. Since the length scale during the inflation is expected to be
small, the energy density obtained from the application of the holographic
principle in the early universe will be large enough to support the
inflationary scenario. Using the Granda-Oliveros IR cut-off we have studied the
inflationary scenario with the universe filled with BHDE. Various analytic
solutions for the model were found out including the slow-roll parameters,
scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. Since inflation is generally
attributed to the presence of scalar fields, we have explored a correspondence
between BHDE and scalar field models. Both canonical scalar field and the
Tachyonic scalar field have been considered for this purpose. The evolution of
the potential generated from the fields are plotted and found to be consistent
with the observations. From the work we see that BHDE can be a model of dark
energy that can successfully drive the early time inflation.

study in Quantum Cognition, in systems relating to mental phenomena, such as
concepts in human memory [Aerts et al., 2013]. In the cognitive field of study,
a contemporary challenge facing the determination of whether a phenomenon is
contextual has been the identification and management of disturbances
[Dzhafarov et al., 2016]. Whether or not said disturbances are identified
through the modelling approach, constitute causal influences, or are
disregardableas as noise is important, as contextuality cannot be adequately
determined in the presence of causal influences [Gleason, 1957]. To address
this challenge, we first provide a formalisation of necessary elements of the
combinatorial approach within the language of canonical9 causal models. Through
this formalisation, we extend the combinatorial approach to support a
measurement and treatment of disturbance, and offer techniques to separately
distinguish noise and causal influences. Thereafter, we develop a protocol
through which these elements may be represented within a cognitive experiment.
As human cognition seems rife with causal influences, cognitive modellers may
apply the extended combinatorial approach to practically determine the
contextuality of cognitive phenomena.

However, this so-called ""minimal"" cooling paradigm faces the problem of
numerically simulating the observed anomalously fast drop in the neutron star
surface temperature using theoretical neutrino energy losses from superfluid
neutrons. As a solution to this problem, I propose a somewhat more complex
cooling model, in which, in addition to superfluid neutrons, direct Urca
processes from a very small central part of the neutron star core are also
involved. Numerical simulations of the cooling trajectory in this scenario show
excellent agreement with observations of the Cassiopeia A neutron star. The
proposed cooling scenario unambiguously relates the used equation of state and
the mass of the neutron star. For a neutron star constructed according to BSk25
equation of state, the most appropriate are the mass $M=1.62M_{\sun}$ and the
radius $R=12.36$ km. If BSk24 equation of state is used, then the most suitable

the work of Herrera \cite{herrera2021hyperbolically} and describe the
influences of such repulsive character on a few realistic features of
hyperbolical anisotropic fluids. After describing Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations
of motion, we elaborated the corresponding mass function along with its
conservation laws. In our study, besides observing negative energy density, we
notice the formation of Minkowskian core as matter content is compelled itself
not to follow inward motion near the axis of symmetry. Three families of
solution are found in $\Lambda$-dominated epoch. First is calculated by keeping
zero value to Weyl scalar, while the second solution maintains zero complexity
in the subsequent changes of the hyperbolical compact object. However, the last
model encompasses stiff fluid within the self-gravitating system. Such type of
theoretical setup suggests its direct link to study a few particular quantum
scenarios where negative behavior of energy density is noticed at $\Lambda$

many emerging technologies, such as fifth-generation networks and beyond,
virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (AI). Among such technologies, AI
has shown the great importance of processing big data to enhance immersive
experience and enable human-like intelligence of virtual agents. In this
survey, we make a beneficial effort to explore the role of AI in the foundation
and development of the metaverse. We first deliver a preliminary of AI,
including machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, and its
role in the metaverse. We then convey a comprehensive investigation of AI-based
methods concerning six technical aspects that have potentials for the
metaverse: natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking,
digital twin, and neural interface, and being potential for the metaverse.
Subsequently, several AI-aided applications, such as healthcare, manufacturing,
smart cities, and gaming, are studied to be deployed in the virtual worlds.
Finally, we conclude the key contribution of this survey and open some future

improved latency and hardware efficiency. To enhance the scalability, we
develop a multi-bank management that enables column-skipping for dataset stored
in different memristive memory banks. Prototype column-skipping sorters are
implemented with a 1T1R memristive memory in 40nm CMOS technology. Experimented
on a variety of sorting datasets, the length-1024 32-bit column-skipping sorter
with state recording of 2 demonstrates up to 4.08x speedup, 3.14x area

set of widely used indicators of human, social, and economic capital across 146
countries in July 2021 and February 2022. About 70% of the variability in
COVID-19 vaccination rates worldwide can be explained by differences in the
Human Development Index (HDI) and, specifically, in life expectancy at birth,
one year after the campaign debut. Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive
value beyond the HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between
vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of human development and
vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general
health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an
indicator of country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant,
though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. The metrics of
economic inequality, perceived corruption, poverty, and inputs into the health
system have strong bivariate correlations with COVID-19 vaccination but no
longer remain statistically significant when controlling for the HDI. Our
analysis identified the contours of a social structure that sustains life and
is reproduced through this process. COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be part of
the Matthew effect of accumulating advantages and aggravating disadvantages
that the pandemic inflicted on societies and communities across the world. At
the same time, the remaining variability in vaccination success that cannot be
pinned down through these sets of metrics points to a considerable scope for
collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization and
coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals,
scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least
some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and inequity.

allocation to more common actions such as recommendation or information
ranking. The aim to audit these algorithms has grown alongside. In this paper,
we focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user
side of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal
framework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers
developing them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is
uncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.
The contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to
law, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby
audit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second
(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:
Bobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on
real user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).
Sherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build
surrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for
whistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be
low in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right
to audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the
auditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.
This article thus highlights the relation of current audits with law, in order
to structure the growing field of algorithm auditing.

  Industrial Aerodynamics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The transverse inclination is a probable scenario when inclined structures
experience an inflow of altered attack angles. This work investigates the
effects of transverse inclination on an aeroelastic prism through
forced-vibration wind tunnel experiments. The aerodynamic characteristics are
tri-parametrically evaluated under different wind speeds, inclination angles,
and oscillation amplitudes. Results show that transverse inclination
fundamentally changes the wake phenomenology by impinging the fix-end horseshoe
vortex and breaking the separation symmetry. The aftermath is a bi-polar,
once-for-all change in the aerodynamics near the prism base. The suppression of
the horseshoe vortex unleashes the Karman vortex, which significantly increases
the unsteady crosswind force. After the initial morphology switch, the
aerodynamics become independent of inclination angle and oscillation amplitude
and depend solely on wind speed. The structure's upper portion does not feel
the effect, so this phenomenon is called Base Intensification. The phenomenon
only projects notable impacts on the low-speed and VIV regime and is
indifferent in the high-speed, quasi-steady Galloping regime. In practice, Base
Intensification will disrupt the pedestrian-level wind environment from the
unleashed Bernard-Karman vortex shedding, making it erratic and gusty.
Moreover, it increases the aerodynamic load at a structure base by as much as
4.3 times. Since fix-end stiffness prevents elastic dissipation, the load
translates to massive stress, making detection trickier and failures, if they
are to occur, more sudden, extreme, and without any warnings. The 4.3-time
amplification also surpasses the safety factor of many standard designs, so
transverse inclination deserves engineering attention.

investigated in the presence of a time-dependent perturbation. The latter is
attributed to the process of the energy measurement of the scattered particle.
The time-dependent Schrodinger equation of the model is exactly solved. The
calculation of the probability density inside the barrier proves that the
tunnelling dynamics is determined not only by the transmitted and reflected
waves but also by their interference. Furthermore, the interference term is
time-dependent and contribute to the scattering process duration. The
tunnelling time is calculated as the time to stop the flow of probability
density inside the barrier. This is the minimum duration of the measurement
process before detecting the particle beyond the barrier. Based on this, a new
method of estimating the tunnelling time by energy experimental measuring is
proposed.

various discretization schemes such as finite elements, finite volumes,

However, most researchers have focused on the performance of their models
within the time-space domain in which the models were trained. In this work, we
apply ML techniques to approximate PDE solutions and focus on the forecasting
problem outside of the training domain. To this end, we use two different ML
architectures - the feed forward neural (FFN) network and the long short-term

times based on the knowledge of the solutions in the past. The results of our

the limit of high model capacity. Therefore, in practice they can, for example,
be recovered using sufficiently large, well-trained NNs. The inner workings of
the considered methods are revealed through the explicit dependence of the
optimal output on the input data. By evaluating the analytical expressions, we
can identify phase transitions directly from experimentally accessible data
without training NNs, which makes this procedure favorable in terms of
computation time. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical
simulations covering, e.g., topological, quantum, and many-body localization
phase transitions. We expect similar analyses to provide a deeper understanding
