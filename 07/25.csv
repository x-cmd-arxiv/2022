effective tools in many fields of engineering, including autonomous vehicles,
medical diagnosis and search engines, and even in art creation. Indeed, NNs
often decisively outperform traditional algorithms. One area that is only
recently attracting significant interest is using NNs for designing numerical
solvers, particularly for discretized partial differential equations. Several
recent papers have considered employing NNs for developing multigrid methods,
which are a leading computational tool for solving discretized partial
differential equations and other sparse-matrix problems. We extend these new
ideas, focusing on so-called relaxation operators (also called smoothers),
which are an important component of the multigrid algorithm that has not yet
received much attention in this context. We explore an approach for using NNs
to learn relaxation parameters for an ensemble of diffusion operators with
random coefficients, for Jacobi type smoothers and for 4Color GaussSeidel
smoothers. The latter yield exceptionally efficient and easy to parallelize
Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) smoothers. Moreover, this work demonstrates
that learning relaxation parameters on relatively small grids using a two-grid
method and Gelfand's formula as a loss function can be implemented easily.
These methods efficiently produce nearly-optimal parameters, thereby
significantly improving the convergence rate of multigrid algorithms on large
grids.

images in each frame are replaced by terahertz (THz) waves, such movies can
monitor low-energy resonances and reveal fast structural or chemical
transitions. Here, we combine THz spectroscopy as a non-invasive optical probe
with a real-time monitoring technique to resolve non-reproducible phenomena at
50k frames per second. The concept, based on dispersive Fourier transform
spectroscopy to achieve unprecedented acquisition speed of THz spectroscopy
data, is demonstrated by monitoring sub-millisecond dynamics of hot carriers
injected in silicon by successive resonant pulses as a saturation density is
established. We anticipate that our experimental configuration will play a
crucial role in revealing fast irreversible physical and chemical processes at
THz frequencies with microsecond resolution to enable new applications in
fundamental research as well as in industry, notably as a rapid supply chain

that are far from the training distribution. This hinders their deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare. The
detection of a shift from the training distribution of individual datapoints
has gained attention. A number of techniques have been proposed for such
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. But in many applications, the inputs to a
machine learning model form a temporal sequence. Existing techniques for OOD
detection in time-series data either do not exploit temporal relationships in
the sequence or do not provide any guarantees on detection. We propose using
deviation from the in-distribution temporal equivariance as the non-conformity
measure in conformal anomaly detection framework for OOD detection in
time-series data.Computing independent predictions from multiple conformal
detectors based on the proposed measure and combining these predictions by
Fisher's method leads to the proposed detector CODiT with guarantees on false
detection in time-series data. We illustrate the efficacy of CODiT by achieving
state-of-the-art results on computer vision datasets in autonomous driving. We
also show that CODiT can be used for OOD detection in non-vision datasets by

film dubbing, virtual avatars and online education. Recent NeRF-based methods
generate more natural talking videos, as they better capture the 3D structural

identity with a large dataset. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Facial
Radiance Fields (DFRF) for few-shot talking head synthesis, which can rapidly
generalize to an unseen identity with few training data. Different from the
existing NeRF-based methods which directly encode the 3D geometry and
appearance of a specific person into the network, our DFRF conditions face
radiance field on 2D appearance images to learn the face prior. Thus the facial
radiance field can be flexibly adjusted to the new identity with few reference
images. Additionally, for better modeling of the facial deformations, we
propose a differentiable face warping module conditioned on audio signals to
deform all reference images to the query space. Extensive experiments show that
with only tens of seconds of training clip available, our proposed DFRF can
synthesize natural and high-quality audio-driven talking head videos for novel
identities with only 40k iterations. We highly recommend readers view our

distinct measurements on a single state can be made jointly predictable. The
existence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantum theory is generally
considered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical
worldview. However, this perspective is undermined by the fact that there exist
operational theories which exhibit nontrivial uncertainty relations but which
are consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admit of a
generalized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what
aspects of uncertainty relations, if any, cannot be realized in this way and so
constitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. We here consider uncertainty
relations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of
binary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of Pauli X and Pauli Z
observables in quantum theory). We show that, for a class of theories
satisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of this
predictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear
curve. Because qubit quantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the
fact that its predictability tradeoff describes a section of a circle is a
violation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example of
how the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality.
We also deduce the implications for a selected group of operational foils to
quantum theory and consider the generalization to three measurements.

Existing (monolithic) systems must be decomposed into microservices to harness
these characteristics. Since manual decomposition of large scale applications

strategies are gaining popularity. However, the usefulness of these approaches
is limited by the expressiveness of the program representation and their
inability to model the application's dependency on critical external resources
such as databases. Consequently, partitioning recommendations offered by
current tools result in architectures that result in (a) distributed monoliths,
and/or (b) force the use of (often criticized) distributed transactions. This
work attempts to overcome these challenges by introducing CARGO({short for
[C]ontext-sensitive l[A]bel p[R]opa[G]ati[O]n})-a novel un-/semi-supervised

partition quality of all modern microservice partitioning techniques. Further,
CARGO substantially reduces distributed transactions and a real-world

user feedback data is a well-known challenge in information retrieval. Existing
methods in unbiased learning to rank typically rely on click modeling or
inverse propensity weighting (IPW). Unfortunately, the search engines are faced
with severe long-tail query distribution, where neither click modeling nor IPW
can handle well. Click modeling suffers from data sparsity problem since the
same query-document pair appears limited times on tail queries; IPW suffers
from high variance problem since it is highly sensitive to small propensity
score values. Therefore, a general debiasing framework that works well under
tail queries is in desperate need. To address this problem, we propose a
model-based unbiased learning-to-rank framework. Specifically, we develop a
general context-aware user simulator to generate pseudo clicks for unobserved
ranked lists to train rankers, which addresses the data sparsity problem. In
addition, considering the discrepancy between pseudo clicks and actual clicks,
we take the observation of a ranked list as the treatment variable and further
incorporate inverse propensity weighting with pseudo labels in a doubly robust
way. The derived bias and variance indicate that the proposed model-based
method is more robust than existing methods. Finally, extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets, including simulated datasets and real click logs,
demonstrate that the proposed model-based method consistently performs
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios. The code is

the biggest sources of uncertainty for climate modeling. Many climate models do
not include aerosols in sufficient detail due to computational constraints. In
order to represent key processes, aerosol microphysical properties and
processes have to be accounted for. This is done in the ECHAM-HAM global
climate aerosol model using the M7 microphysics, but high computational costs
make it very expensive to run with finer resolution or for a longer time. We
aim to use machine learning to emulate the microphysics model at sufficient
accuracy and reduce the computational cost by being fast at inference time. The
original M7 model is used to generate data of input-output pairs to train a
neural network on it. We are able to learn the variables' tendencies achieving
an average $R^2$ score of $77.1\% $. We further explore methods to inform and
constrain the neural network with physical knowledge to reduce mass violation
and enforce mass positivity. On a GPU we achieve a speed-up of up to over 64x

access to true class labels, wishes to build a classification model by
utilizing more features from a passive party, which has no access to the
labels, to improve the model accuracy. In the prediction phase, with logistic
regression as the classification model, several inference attack techniques are
proposed that the adversary, i.e., the active party, can employ to reconstruct
the passive party's features, regarded as sensitive information. These attacks,
which are mainly based on a classical notion of the center of a set, i.e., the
Chebyshev center, are shown to be superior to those proposed in the literature.
Moreover, several theoretical performance guarantees are provided for the
aforementioned attacks. Subsequently, we consider the minimum amount of
information that the adversary needs to fully reconstruct the passive party's
features. In particular, it is shown that when the passive party holds one
feature, and the adversary is only aware of the signs of the parameters
involved, it can perfectly reconstruct that feature when the number of
predictions is large enough. Next, as a defense mechanism, a privacy-preserving
scheme is proposed that worsen the adversary's reconstruction attacks, while
preserving the full benefits that VFL brings to the active party. Finally,
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and
the privacy-preserving scheme.

when contaminated with unlabeled abnormal samples in training set under

address the above two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical

to complete missing regions. This enables us to preserve the style of local
geometric features, even if it drastically differs from the training data. Our
fully automatic approach proceeds in two stages. First, we learn to retrieve
candidate patches from the input shape. Second, we select and deform some of
the retrieved candidates to seamlessly blend them into the complete shape. This
method combines the advantages of the two most common completion methods:
similarity-based single-instance completion, and completion by learning a shape
space. We leverage repeating patterns by retrieving patches from the partial

the retrieval and deformation steps. Experimental results show our approach

standard sirens can provide local measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$),
regardless of the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart: The
presence of matter terms in GWs breaks the degeneracy between mass parameters
and redshift, allowing simultaneous measurement of both the luminosity distance
and redshift. Although the tidally disrupted NSBH systems can have EM emission,
the detection prospects of an EM counterpart will be limited to $z < 0.8$ in
the optical, in the era of the next generation GW detectors. However, the
distinctive merger morphology and the high redshift detectability of
tidally-disrupted NSBH makes them promising standard siren candidates for this
method. Using recent constraints on the equation-of-state of NSs from
multi-messenger observations of NICER and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, we show the
prospects of measuring $H_{0}$ solely from GW observation of NSBH systems,
achievable by Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. We
first analyze individual events to quantify the effect of high-frequency ($\ge$
500 Hz) tidal distortions on the inference of NS tidal deformability parameter
($\Lambda$) and hence on $H_0$. We find that disruptive mergers can constrain
$\Lambda$ up to $\mathcal{O}(60\%)$ more precisely than non-disruptive ones.
However, this precision is not sufficient to place stringent constraints on the
$H_0$ for individual events. By performing Bayesian analysis on different sets
of simulated NSBH data (up to $N=100$ events, corresponding to a timescale from
several hours to a day observation) in the ET+CE detectors, we find that NSBH
systems enable unbiased 4\% - 13\% precision on the estimate of $H_0$ (68\%
credible interval). This is a similar measurement precision found in studies
analyzing populations of NSBH mergers with EM counterparts in the LVKC O5 era.

case of chemical potential. Interestingly, in axial gauge a uniform classical
electric field actually can correspond to an inhomogeneous imaginary chemical
potential that varies with coordinate. On the other hand, with imaginary

$R$, through a SIR spreading process in heterogeneous networks; Characterizing
its decay process allows to analytically study the effects of countermeasures

policies.
  A striking result of recent studies has shown that heterogeneity across
nodes/individuals (or, super-spreading) may have a drastic effect on the
spreading process progression, which may cause a non-linear decrease of $R$ in
the number of infected individuals. We account for heterogeneity and analyze
the stochastic progression of the spreading process. We show that the decrease
of $R$ is, in fact, convex in the number of infected individuals, where this
convexity stems from heterogeneity. The analysis is based on establishing
stochastic monotonic relations between the susceptible populations in varying
times of the spread.
  We demonstrate that the convex behavior of the effective reproduction number
affects the performance of countermeasures used to fight a spread of a virus.

the commonality and individuality of fine-grained actions. The learnt atomic
actions, represented by visual concepts, are further mapped to fine and coarse
action labels leveraging the semantic label hierarchy. Our approach constructs
a visual representation hierarchy of four levels: clip level, atomic action
level, fine action class level and coarse action class level, with supervision
at each level. Extensive experiments on two large-scale fine-grained video

satisfactory explanation. The most widely accepted hypothesis involving a giant
impactor that tipped Uranus onto its side encounters several difficulties with
regards to the Uranus' spin rate and its prograde satellite system. An
obliquity increase that was driven by capture of Uranus into a secular
spin-orbit resonance remains a possible alternative hypothesis that avoids many
of the issues associated with a giant impact. We propose that secular
spin-orbit resonance could have excited Uranus' obliquity to its present day
value if it was driven by the outward migration of an as-yet undetected outer
Solar System body commonly known as Planet Nine. We draw support for our
hypothesis from an analysis of 123 N-body simulations with varying parameters
for Planet Nine and its migration. We find that in multiple instances, a
simulated Planet Nine drives Uranus' obliquity past 98 degrees, with a
significant number falling within 10 percent of this value. We note a
significant caveat to our results in that a much faster than present-day
spin-axis precession rate for Uranus is required in all cases for it to reach
high obliquities. We conclude that while it was in principle possible for
Planet Nine (if it exists) to have been responsible for Uranus' obliquity, the
feasibility of such a result hinges on Uranus' primordial precession rate.

tool for managing access to a shared resource, often a wireless communication
channel (e.g., [1]). For a wireless device to transmit successfully, it uses a
backoff protocol to ensure exclusive access to the channel. Modern radios,
however, do not need exclusive access to the channel to communicate; in
particular, they have the ability to receive useful information even when more
than one device transmits at the same time. These capabilities have now been
exploited for many years by systems that rely on interference cancellation,
physical layer network coding and analog network coding to improve efficiency.
For example, Zigzag decoding [56] demonstrated how a base station can decode
messages sent by multiple devices simultaneously.
  In this paper, we address the following question: Can we design a backoff
protocol that is better than exponential backoff when exclusive channel access
is not required. We define the Coded Radio Network Model, which generalizes
traditional radio network models (e.g., [30]). We then introduce the Decodable
Backoff Algorithm, a randomized backoff protocol that achieves an optimal
throughput of $1-o(1)$. (Throughput $1$ is optimal, as simultaneous reception
does not increase the channel capacity.) The algorithm breaks the constant
throughput lower bound for traditional radio networks [47-49], showing the
power of these new hardware capabilities.

the form of time spent on an operation, distance traveled to a location or
dosage of a drug. Letting A denote a continuous treatment variable, the target
of inference is the expected outcome if everyone in the population takes
treatment level A=a. Under standard assumptions, the dose-response function
takes the form of a partial mean. Building upon the recent literature on
nonparametric regression with estimated outcomes, we study three different
estimators. As a global method, we construct an
empirical-risk-minimization-based estimator with an explicit characterization
of second-order remainder terms. As a local method, we develop a two-stage,
doubly-robust (DR) learner. Finally, we construct a mth-order estimator based
on the theory of higher-order influence functions. Under certain conditions,
this higher order estimator achieves the fastest rate of convergence that we
are aware of for this problem. However, the other two approaches are easier to
implement using off-the-shelf software, since they are formulated as two-stage
regression tasks. For each estimator, we provide an upper bound on the
mean-square error and investigate its finite-sample performance in a

building blocks of large scale structure formation models. Despite their
importance -- or perhaps because of it! -- halo definitions continue to evolve
towards more physically motivated criteria. Here, we propose a new definition
that is physically motivated, and effectively unique and parameter-free: ''A
dark matter halo is comprised of the collection of particles orbiting in their
own self-generated potential.'' This definition is enabled by the fact that,
even with as few as $\approx 300$ particles per halo, nearly every particle in
the vicinity of a halo can be uniquely classified as either orbiting or
infalling based on its dynamical history. For brevity, we refer to haloes
selected in this way as physical haloes. We demonstrate that: 1) the mass

shortest paths match those of $G$ up to small additive error. We prove two new
lower bounds in the area of additive spanners:
  1) We construct $n$-node graphs $G$ for which any spanner on $O(n)$ edges
must increase a pairwise distance by $+\Omega(n^{1/7})$. This improves on a
recent lower bound of $+\Omega(n^{1/10.5})$ by Lu, Wein, Vassilevska Williams,

  2) A classic result by Coppersmith and Elkin [SODA '05] proves that for any
$n$-node graph $G$ and set of $p = O(n^{1/2})$ demand pairs, one can exactly
preserve all pairwise distances among demand pairs using a spanner on $O(n)$
edges. They also provided a lower bound construction, establishing that that
this range $p = O(n^{1/2})$ cannot be improved. We strengthen this lower bound
by proving that, for any constant $k$, this range of $p$ is still unimprovable

  state","5 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1016/j.ssc.2022.114964",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  A remarkable feature of the Landau-Zener transition is insensitivity of the
survival probability to the decay rate, of the excited state. Namely, the
probability for a particle, which is initially in the ground state, to remain
in the same state is insensitive to decay, which is due to e.g. coupling to
continuum [V. M. Akulin and W. P. Schleich, Phys. Rev. A 46, 4110 (1992)]. This
insensitivity was demonstrated for the case when the density of states in the
continuum is energy-independent. We study the opposite limit when the density
of states in the continuum is a step-like function of energy. As a result of
this step-like behavior of the density of states, the decay rate of a driven
excited level experiences a jump as a function of time at certain moment t_0.
We take advantage of the fact that the analytical solution at t<t_0 and at
t>t_0 is known. We show that the decay enters the survival probability when t_0
is comparable to the transition time.

(VQA) models heavily suffer from the language prior problem, which refers to
capturing superficial statistical correlations between the question type and
the answer whereas ignoring the image contents. Numerous efforts have been
dedicated to strengthen the image dependency by creating the delicate models or
introducing the extra visual annotations. However, these methods cannot
sufficiently explore how the visual cues explicitly affect the learned answer
representation, which is vital for language reliance alleviation. Moreover,
they generally emphasize the class-level discrimination of the learned answer
representation, which overlooks the more fine-grained instance-level patterns
and demands further optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel
collaborative learning scheme from the viewpoint of visual perturbation
calibration, which can better investigate the fine-grained visual effects and
mitigate the language prior problem by learning the instance-level
characteristics. Specifically, we devise a visual controller to construct two
sorts of curated images with different perturbation extents, based on which the
collaborative learning of intra-instance invariance and inter-instance
discrimination is implemented by two well-designed discriminators. Besides, we
implement the information bottleneck modulator on latent space for further bias
alleviation and representation calibration. We impose our visual
perturbation-aware framework to three orthodox baselines and the experimental
results on two diagnostic VQA-CP benchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its
effectiveness. In addition, we also justify its robustness on the balanced VQA
benchmark.

that coordinate with each other to support coherent beamforming towards a

oscillators, as well as the frequency and phase estimation errors induced at
the nodes, there exists decoherence that degrades the beamforming process. A
decentralized frequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm was proposed in
prior work for undirected networks in which the nodes locally share their
frequencies and phases with their neighbors to reach synchronization. Kalman
filtering (KF) was also integrated with DFPC (KF-DFPC) to lower the total
residual phase error upon convergence. Since these DFPC-based algorithms rely
on the average consensus protocol, they do not converge for directed networks.
In this paper, we propose a push-sum based frequency and phase consensus
(PsFPC) algorithm for the directed networks. The residual phase error of PsFPC
is theoretically derived as well. Kalman filtering is also integrated with
PsFPC and the resulting KF-PsFPC algorithm shows a significant reduction in the
residual phase error upon convergence. KF assumes that the model parameters,
i.e., the measurement noise and innovation noise covariance matrices, are
known. Since they may not be known in practice, we develop an online
expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm that iteratively computes the
maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the unknown matrices in an online manner.
EM is integrated with KF-PsFPC to propose the EM-KF-PsFPC algorithm. Simulation
results are included where the performance of the PsFPC-based algorithms is

First, to enhance distortion awareness, Trans4PASS, equipped with Deformable

object deformations and image distortions whenever (before or after adaptation)
and wherever (shallow or deep levels) by design. We further introduce the
upgraded Trans4PASS+ model, featuring DMLPv2 with parallel token mixing to
improve the flexibility and generalizability in modeling discriminative cues.
Second, we propose a Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) strategy for
unsupervised domain adaptation. Third, aside from Pinhole-to-Panoramic
(Pin2Pan) adaptation, we create a new dataset (SynPASS) with 9,080 panoramic
images to explore a Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) adaptation scheme in 360{\deg}

scenarios, and each of them is investigated with Pin2Pan and Syn2Real regimens.

identifying contradictions. This work aims to improve the contradiction
detection via rewriting all bot utterances to restore antecedents and ellipsis.
We curated a new dataset for utterance rewriting and built a rewriting model on

the progenitor of both the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and Virgo Overdensity

the chemodynamical properties and verify the link between HAC, VOD, and GSE. We
find that the orbital eccentricity distributions of the stellar overdensities
and GSE are comparable. We also find that they have similar, strongly peaked,
metallicity distribution functions, reinforcing the hypothesis of common
origin. Furthermore, we show that HAC and VOD are indistinguishable from the
prototypical GSE population within all chemical-abundance spaces analyzed. All
these evidences combined provide a clear demonstration that the GSE merger is
the main progenitor of the stellar populations found within these halo

allowing computations on the data in encrypted form. However, to support
general-purpose encrypted computations, all existing FHE schemes require an
expensive operation known as bootstrapping. Unfortunately, the computation cost
and the memory bandwidth required for bootstrapping add significant overhead to
FHE-based computations, limiting the practical use of FHE. In this work, we
propose FAB, an FPGA-based accelerator for bootstrappable FHE. Prior FPGA-based
FHE accelerators have proposed hardware acceleration of basic FHE primitives
for impractical parameter sets without support for bootstrapping. FAB, for the
first time ever, accelerates bootstrapping (along with basic FHE primitives) on
an FPGA for a secure and practical parameter set. The key contribution of our
work is to architect a balanced FAB design, which is not memory bound. To this
end, we leverage recent algorithms for bootstrapping while being cognizant of
the compute and memory constraints of our FPGA. We use a minimal number of
functional units for computing, operate at a low frequency, leverage high data
rates to and from main memory, utilize the limited on-chip memory effectively,
and perform operation scheduling carefully. For bootstrapping a fully-packed
ciphertext, while operating at 300 MHz, FAB outperforms existing
state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations by 213x and 1.5x respectively. Our
target FHE application is training a logistic regression model over encrypted
data. For logistic regression model training scaled to 8 FPGAs on the cloud,
FAB outperforms a CPU and GPU by 456x and 6.5x and provides competitive
performance when compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC design at a fraction of
the cost.

towards different visual stimuli, has become an attractive research topic
recently. Rather than a single label classification task, it is more rational
to regard VEA as a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) problem by voting from
different individuals. Existing methods often predict visual emotion
distribution in a unified network, neglecting the inherent subjectivity in its
crowd voting process. In psychology, the \textit{Object-Appraisal-Emotion}
model has demonstrated that each individual's emotion is affected by his/her
subjective appraisal, which is further formed by the affective memory. Inspired
by this, we propose a novel \textit{Subjectivity Appraise-and-Match Network
(SAMNet)} to investigate the subjectivity in visual emotion distribution. To
depict the diversity in crowd voting process, we first propose the
\textit{Subjectivity Appraising} with multiple branches, where each branch
simulates the emotion evocation process of a specific individual. Specifically,
we construct the affective memory with an attention-based mechanism to preserve
each individual's unique emotional experience. A subjectivity loss is further
proposed to guarantee the divergence between different individuals. Moreover,
we propose the \textit{Subjectivity Matching} with a matching loss, aiming at
assigning unordered emotion labels to ordered individual predictions in a
one-to-one correspondence with the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive experiments
and comparisons are conducted on public visual emotion distribution datasets,
and the results demonstrate that the proposed SAMNet consistently outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation study verifies the effectiveness of our
method and visualization proves its interpretability.

estimates surface normals as pixel-wise probability densities for each view

filtering network that learns to recover per-pixel depth and surface normal.

computational challenges involved in simulating a highly curved membrane, as
the one found in a small vesicle. In the present work, thanks to the computing
power of Anton2, we present the first all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of
a full-scale, realistically composed (both heterogeneous and asymmetric)
vesicle of a meaningful time scale (over 10 microseconds), which reveals unique
biophysical properties of various lipid molecules (diffusion coefficients,
surface areas per lipid, order parameters) and packing defects in a highly
curved environment. Most interestingly, a bilayer of the same lipid composition
demonstrating no phase coexistence when flat shows very strong indictors of
phase coexistence when highly curved. Lipid molecules found in the
curvature-induced different phases are carefully verified by their distinct
composition, area per lipid, parking defects, as well as diffusion coefficient.
The result of the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is consistent with
previous experimental and theoretical models and enhance the understanding of
nanoscale dynamics and membrane organization of small, highly curved

of these operations increases when the transportation, power, and
communications networks fail, leaving people stranded and unable to communicate
their locations and needs. The advent of emerging technologies like uncrewed
autonomous vehicles can help humanitarian logistics providers reach otherwise
stranded populations after transportation network failures. However, due to the
failures in telecommunication infrastructure, demand for emergency aid can
become uncertain. To address the challenges of delivering emergency aid to
trapped populations with failing infrastructure networks, we propose a novel
robust computational framework for a two-echelon vehicle routing problem that
uses uncrewed autonomous vehicles, or drones, for the deliveries. We formulate
the problem as a two-stage robust optimization model to handle demand
uncertainty. Then, we propose a column-and-constraint generation approach for
worst-case demand scenario generation for a given set of truck and drone
routes. Moreover, we develop a decomposition scheme inspired by the column
generation approach to heuristically generate drone routes for a set of demand
scenarios. Finally, we combine the heuristic decomposition scheme within the

trucks and drones, the time that affected communities are served, and the
quantities of aid materials delivered. To validate our proposed computational
framework, we use a simulated dataset that aims to recreate emergency aid

  Retrieval",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) has aroused much attention due to
its fast query speed and efficient storage. Previous literatures have achieved
promising results for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) by discovering discriminative
hash codes and modality-specific hash functions. Nonetheless, most existing CMR
works are subjected to some restrictions: 1) It is assumed that data of
different modalities are fully paired, which is impractical in real
applications due to sample missing and false data alignment, and 2) binary
regression targets including the label matrix and binary codes are too rigid to
effectively learn semantic-preserving hash codes and hash functions. To address
these problems, this paper proposes an Adaptive Marginalized Semantic Hashing
(AMSH) method which not only enhances the discrimination of latent
representations and hash codes by adaptive margins, but also can be used for
both paired and unpaired CMR. As a two-step method, in the first step, AMSH
generates semantic-aware modality-specific latent representations with
adaptively marginalized labels, which enlarges the distances between different
classes, and exploits the labels to preserve the inter-modal and intra-modal
semantic similarities into latent representations and hash codes. In the second
step, adaptive margin matrices are embedded into the hash codes, and enlarge
the gaps between positive and negative bits, which improves the discrimination
and robustness of hash functions. On this basis, AMSH generates
similarity-preserving hash codes and robust hash functions without strict
one-to-one data correspondence requirement. Experiments are conducted on
several benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of
AMSH over some state-of-the-art CMR methods.

24 source images on the basis of feature point identification. The longwave MRT
and plane radiant temperature can be estimated from the spherical thermal image

were made using the system in outdoor and indoor environments with various

Sparse-based domain Adaptation Super-Resolution network (SASR) for the
reconstruction of realistic 6x6 mm2/low-resolution (LR) OCTA images to
high-resolution (HR) representations. To be more specific, we first perform a
simple degradation of the 3x3 mm2/high-resolution (HR) image to obtain the
synthetic LR image. An efficient registration method is then employed to
register the synthetic LR with its corresponding 3x3 mm2 image region within
the 6x6 mm2 image to obtain the cropped realistic LR image. We then propose a
multi-level super-resolution model for the fully-supervised reconstruction of
the synthetic data, guiding the reconstruction of the realistic LR images
through a generative-adversarial strategy that allows the synthetic and
realistic LR images to be unified in the feature domain. Finally, a novel
sparse edge-aware loss is designed to dynamically optimize the vessel edge
structure. Extensive experiments on two OCTA sets have shown that our method
performs better than state-of-the-art super-resolution reconstruction methods.
In addition, we have investigated the performance of the reconstruction results

the teacher HGNN with its prediction logits. Meanwhile, the second-order
relation-level knowledge distillation imitates the relational correlation
between node embeddings of different types generated by the teacher HGNN.
  Extensive experiments on various popular HGNNs models and three real-world
heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method obtains consistent and
considerable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and
generalization ability.

a novel view-dependent perspective of salient objects, reasonably reflecting
the most eye-catching objects in point cloud scenarios. Following this
formulation, we introduce PCSOD, the first dataset proposed for point cloud SOD
consisting of 2,872 in-/out-door 3D views. The samples in our dataset are
labeled with hierarchical annotations, e.g., super-/sub-class, bounding box,

feasibility of our solution, we further contribute a baseline model and
benchmark five representative models for a comprehensive comparison. The
proposed model can effectively analyze irregular and unordered points for

large-scale unlabeled face images. It remains challenging to identify small or
sparse face image clusters that we call hard clusters, which is caused by the
heterogeneity, \ie, high variations in size and sparsity, of the clusters.
Consequently, the conventional way of using a uniform threshold (to identify
clusters) often leads to a terrible misclassification for the samples that
should belong to hard clusters. We tackle this problem by leveraging the
neighborhood information of samples and inferring the cluster memberships (of
samples) in a probabilistic way. We introduce two novel modules,
Neighborhood-Diffusion-based Density (NDDe) and Transition-Probability-based
Distance (TPDi), based on which we can simply apply the standard Density Peak
Clustering algorithm with a uniform threshold. Our experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that each module contributes to the final performance of our
method, and by incorporating them into other advanced face clustering methods,
these two modules can boost the performance of these methods to a new

stations for Internet access, and constitute the LEO-satellite-based access
network (LEO-SAN). LEO-SAN is expected to provide seamless massive access and
extended coverage with high signal quality. However, its practical
implementation still faces significant technical challenges, e.g., high
mobility and limited budget for communication payloads of LEO satellite nodes.
This paper aims at revealing the main technical issues that have not been fully
addressed by the existing LEO-SAN designs, from three aspects namely random
access, beam management and Doppler-resistant transmission technologies. More
specifically, the critical issues of random access in LEO-SAN are discussed
regarding low flexibility, long transmission delay, and inefficient handshakes.
Then the beam management for LEO-SAN is investigated in complex propagation
environments under the constraints of high mobility and limited payload budget.
Furthermore, the influence of Doppler shifts on LEO-SAN is explored.
Correspondingly, promising technologies to address these challenges are also
discussed, respectively. Finally, the future research directions are
envisioned.

In this paper, we take a further step and present Domain Adaptive Person Search
(DAPS), which aims to generalize the model from a labeled source domain to the
unlabeled target domain. Two major challenges arises under this new setting:
one is how to simultaneously solve the domain misalignment issue for both
detection and Re-ID tasks, and the other is how to train the ReID subtask
without reliable detection results on the target domain. To address these
challenges, we propose a strong baseline framework with two dedicated designs.
1) We design a domain alignment module including image-level and task-sensitive
instance-level alignments, to minimize the domain discrepancy. 2) We take full
advantage of the unlabeled data with a dynamic clustering strategy, and employ
pseudo bounding boxes to support ReID and detection training on the target
domain. With the above designs, our framework achieves 34.7% in mAP and 80.6%

astrophysicists for decades. One promising place for capturing evidence of
their presence must be high-redshift objects; signatures should be recorded in
their characteristic chemical abundances. We deduce the Fe and Mg abundances of
the broad-line region (BLR) from the intensities of ultraviolet Mg II and Fe II
emission lines in the near-infrared spectrum of UKIDSS Large Area Survey (ULAS)
J1342+0928 at $z = 7.54$, by advancing our novel flux-to-abundance conversion
method developed for $z\sim 1$ quasars. We find that the BLR of this quasar is
extremely enriched, by a factor of 20 relative to the solar Fe abundance,
together with a very low Mg/Fe abundance ratio: $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]=+1.36\pm0.19$
and $[\mathrm{Mg/Fe}]=-1.11\pm0.12$, only 700 million years after the Big Bang.
We conclude that such an unusual abundance feature cannot be explained by the
standard view of chemical evolution that considers only the contributions from
canonical supernovae. While there remains uncertainty in the high-mass end of
the Pop III IMF, here we propose that the larger amount of iron in ULAS
J1342+0928 was supplied by a pair-instability supernova (PISN) caused by the
explosion of a massive Pop III star in the high-mass end of the possible range
of 150-300 $M_\odot$. Chemical-evolution models based on initial PISN
enrichment well explain the trend in [Fe/Mg]-$z$ all the way from $z < 3$ to $z
= 7.54$. We predict that stars with very low [Mg/Fe] at all metallicities are
hidden in the Galaxy, and they will be efficiently discovered by ongoing
new-generation photometric surveys.

of the probability distribution can be associated with non-perturbative effects
of inflation. In this paper, we present some particular examples in which the
tail of the distribution becomes highly non-Gaussian although the statistics
remains almost Gaussian in the perturbative regime. We begin with an extension
of the ultra-slow-roll inflation that incorporates a transition process, where
the inflaton climbs up a tiny potential step at the end of the non-attractor
stage before it converges to the slow-roll attractor. Through this example, we
identify the key role of the off-attractor behaviour for the upward-step
transition, and then extend the analysis to another type of the transition with
two slow-roll stages connected by a tiny step. We perform both the perturbative
and non-perturbative analyses of primordial fluctuations generated around the
step in detail, and show that the tiny but nontrivial transition may affect
large perturbations in the tail of the distribution, while the perturbative
non-Gaussianity remains small. Our result indicates that the non-Gaussian tails
can have rich phenomenology which has been overlooked in conventional analyses.
We also study the implications of this non-Gaussian tail for the formation of
primordial black holes, and find that their mass fraction can be parametrically
amplified by several orders of magnitudes in comparison with the case of the
Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we also discuss a mechanism of primordial
black holes formation for this upward step inflation model by trapping the
inflaton in the bottom of the step.

graphics, among many others. Unfortunately, BMF is computationally hard and
heuristic algorithms are used to compute Boolean factorizations. Very recently,
the theoretical breakthrough was obtained independently by two research groups.
Ban et al. (SODA 2019) and Fomin et al. (Trans. Algorithms 2020) show that BMF
admits an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). However,
despite the theoretical importance, the high double-exponential dependence of
the running times from the rank makes these algorithms unimplementable in
practice. The primary research question motivating our work is whether the
theoretical advances on BMF could lead to practical algorithms.
  The main conceptional contribution of our work is the following. While EPTAS
for BMF is a purely theoretical advance, the general approach behind these
algorithms could serve as the basis in designing better heuristics. We also use
this strategy to develop new algorithms for related $\mathbb{F}_p$-Matrix

recommender systems, where the task of recommendation can be formulated as the
link prediction problem on user-item bipartite graphs. Training GNN-based
recommender systems (GNNRecSys) on large graphs incurs a large memory
footprint, easily exceeding the DRAM capacity on a typical server. Existing
solutions resort to distributed subgraph training, which is inefficient due to
the high cost of dynamically constructing subgraphs and significant redundancy
across subgraphs.
  The emerging persistent memory technologies provide a significantly larger
memory capacity than DRAMs at an affordable cost, making single-machine
GNNRecSys training feasible, which eliminates the inefficiencies in distributed
training. One major concern of using persistent memory devices for GNNRecSys is
their relatively low bandwidth compared with DRAMs. This limitation can be
particularly detrimental to achieving high performance for GNNRecSys workloads
since their dominant compute kernels are sparse and memory access intensive. To
understand whether persistent memory is a good fit for GNNRecSys training, we
perform an in-depth characterization of GNNRecSys workloads and a comprehensive
analysis of their performance on a persistent memory device, namely, Intel

an essential task for various purposes, such as traversable area detection and
object recognition. Under these circumstances, several ground segmentation
methods have been proposed. However, some limitations are still encountered.
First, some ground segmentation methods require fine-tuning of parameters
depending on the surroundings, which is excessively laborious and
time-consuming. Moreover, even if the parameters are well adjusted, a partial
under-segmentation problem can still emerge, which implies ground segmentation
failures in some regions. Finally, ground segmentation methods typically fail
to estimate an appropriate ground plane when the ground is above another
structure, such as a retaining wall. To address these problems, we propose a
robust ground segmentation method called Patchwork++, an extension of
Patchwork. Patchwork++ exploits adaptive ground likelihood estimation (A-GLE)
to calculate appropriate parameters adaptively based on the previous ground
segmentation results. Moreover, temporal ground revert (TGR) alleviates a
partial under-segmentation problem by using the temporary ground property.
Also, region-wise vertical plane fitting (R-VPF) is introduced to segment the
ground plane properly even if the ground is elevated with different layers.

points efficiently based on the 3D LiDAR reflection model. We demonstrate the
qualitative and quantitative evaluations using a SemanticKITTI dataset. Our

an essential aspect of the investigation. Moreover, the plateau widths in the
Hall resistance have been considered simply an effect of disorder as in the
integral quantum Hall effect. The existing theories could neither explain the
Hall resistance curve owing to plateau widths nor calculate the energy gaps.
This study reveals that both the energy gaps and plateau widths contain
fundamental many-body aspects of the FQHE. They are found to be connected via
the strengths of multi-particle correlations, which do not affect the plateau
heights. They are automatically quantized just by the presence of
multi-particle correlations. This work focuses on correlated skipping electrons
moving through the edge of an incompressible strip formed within a Hall bar.
Consequently, a single-particle Hamiltonian was constructed incorporating the
Zeeman energies of multiply-correlated skipping electrons. The resulting energy
spectrum exhibits hierarchical splits of the Landau levels according to
correlation order. The lowest Landau level is examined. Based on such level
splitting, a previously measured Hall resistance curve and energy gaps are
quantitatively explained by determining the parameters that describe the
degrees of multi-particle correlations. The chemical potential and effective
$g$-factors are additionally predicted for the Hall resistance. Furthermore,
the fractional electron charge $e/(2n+1)$ for an electron participating in
$n$-particle correlation was obtained by identifying the Fermi distribution
function of $n$ correlated basic transport entities moving through the edge of
the incompressible strip. Finally, the ideal-like Hall resistance was obtained
at half-filling using the strengths of multi-particle correlations given in a

  Intelligent Surface Communications",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz) communications
have been regarded as a promising candidate for future 6G networks because of
its ultra-wide bandwidth and ultra-low power consumption. However, there exists
the beam split problem, especially when the base station (BS) or RIS owns the
large-scale antennas, which may lead to serious array gain loss. Therefore, in
this paper, we investigate the beam split and beamforming design problems in
the THz RIS communications. Specifically, we first analyze the beam split
effect caused by different RIS sizes, shapes and deployments. On this basis, we
apply the fully connected time delayer phase shifter hybrid beamforming
architecture at the BS and deploy distributed RISs to cooperatively mitigate
the beam split effect. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly
optimizing the hybrid analog/digital beamforming, time delays at the BS and
reflection coefficients at the RISs. To solve the formulated problem, we first
design the analog beamforming and time delays based on different RISs physical
directions, and then it is transformed into an optimization problem by jointly
optimizing the digital beamforming and reflection coefficients. Next, we
propose an alternatively iterative optimization algorithm to deal with it.
Specifically, for given the reflection coefficients, we propose an iterative
algorithm based on the minimum mean square error technique to obtain the
digital beamforming. After, we apply LDR and MCQT methods to transform the
original problem to a QCQP, which can be solved by ADMM technique to obtain the
reflection coefficients. Finally, the digital beamforming and reflection
coefficients are obtained via repeating the above processes until convergence.
Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can effectively alleviate
the beam split effect and improve the system capacity.

driven system hosts regular $0$- and anomalous $\pi$-Majorana end modes~(MEMs).
By tuning the chemical potential and the frequency of the drive, we illustrate
the generation of multiple MEMs in our theoretical set up. We utilize the
chiral symmetry operator to topologically characterize these MEMs via a
dynamical winding number constructed out of the periodized evolution operator.
Interestingly, the robustness of the $0$- and $\pi$-MEMs is established in the
presence of on-site time-independent random disorder potential. We employ the
twisted boundary condition to define the dynamical topological invariant for
this translational-symmetry broken system. The interplay between the Floquet
driving and the weak disorder can stabilize the MEMs giving rise to a quantized
value of the dynamical winding number for a finite range of drive parameters.
This observation might be experimentally helpful in scrutinizing the
topological nature of the Floquet MEMs. We showcase another driving protocol
namely, a periodic kick in the chemical potential to study the generation of
Floquet MEMs in our setup. Our work paves a realistic way to engineer multiple
MEMs in a driven system.

two methods of hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forests

and applications, ranging from statistics, computer science, economics,
psychology to public health. In many scientific research, randomized
experiments provide a golden standard for estimation of causal effects for
decades. However, in many situations, randomized experiments are not feasible
in practice so that practitioners need to rely on empirical investigation for
causal reasoning. Causal inference via observational data is a challenging task
since the knowledge of the treatment assignment mechanism is missing, which
typically requires non-testable assumptions to make the inference possible. For
several years, great effort has been devoted to the research of causal
inference for binary treatments. In practice, it is also common to use
observational data on multiple treatment comparisons. Within the potential
outcomes framework, we propose a generalized cross-fitting estimator (GCF),
which generalizes the doubly robust estimator with cross-fitting for binary
treatment to multiple treatment comparisons and provides rigorous proofs on its
statistical properties. This estimator permits the use of more flexible machine
learning methods to model the nuisance parts, and based on relatively weak
assumptions, while there is still a theoretical guarantee for valid statistical
inference. We show the asymptotic properties of the GCF estimators, and provide
the asymptotic simultaneous confidence intervals that achieve the
semiparametric efficiency bound for average treatment effect. The performance
of the estimator is accessed through simulation study based on the common
evaluation metrics generally considered in the causal inference literature.

the link between the two arenas, are the so-called ``color-event horizon'' of
quantum chromodynamics, and the enormous (de)accelerations involved in such
scattering processes: both phenomena point to the Unruh (and related Hawking)
type of effects. After the first pioneering investigations of this, such
research went on and on, including studies of the horizon entropy and other
``black-hole thermodynamical'' behaviors, which incidentally are also the
frontier of the analog gravity research itself. It is stressed in various
places here that the \textit{trait d'union} between the two phenomenologies is
that in both scenarios, hadron physics and black hole physics, ``thermal''
behaviors are more easily understood not as due to real thermalization
processes (sometimes just impossible, given the small number of particles
involved), but rather to a stochastic/quantum entanglement nature of such
temperature. Finally, other aspects, such as the self-critical organizations of
hadronic matter and of black-holes, have been recently investigated. The
results of those investigations are also summarized and commented upon here. As
a general remark, this research line shows that indeed we can probe quantum
gravity theoretical constructions with analog systems that are not confined to
belong only to the condensed matter arena. This is as it must be.

However, the crowdedness and occlusions in the cluttered scenario cause
significant difficulties to generate valid grasp poses without collisions,
which results in low efficiency and high failure rates. To address these, we
present a generic framework called GE-Grasp for robotic motion planning in
dense clutter, where we leverage diverse action primitives for occluded object
removal and present the generator-evaluator architecture to avoid spatial
collisions. Therefore, our GE-Grasp is capable of grasping objects in dense
clutter efficiently with promising success rates. Specifically, we define three
action primitives: target-oriented grasping for target capturing, pushing, and
nontarget-oriented grasping to reduce the crowdedness and occlusions. The
generators effectively provide various action candidates referring to the
spatial information. Meanwhile, the evaluators assess the selected action
primitive candidates, where the optimal action is implemented by the robot.
Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of grasping in clutter with
respect to motion efficiency and success rates. Moreover, we achieve comparable
performance in the real world as that in the simulation environment, which

direct camera-map alignment with normalized information distance. Through

pivotal role in the space-air-ground integrated network for sixth-generation

connectivity between NSPSs and various airborne/spaceborne platforms is
required for a plethora of bandwidth-consuming applications, such as NSPS-based
Ad hoc networking, in-flight Internet and relaying technology. However, such
requirement seems to contradict with the scarcity of spectrum resources at
conventional microwave frequencies, which motivates the exploitation of
terahertz (THz) band ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz. Due to huge available
bandwidth, the THz signals are capable of supporting ultra-high-rate data
transmission for NS-COM over 100 Gb/s, which are naturally suitable for the
near-space environment with marginal path loss. To this end, this article
provides an extensive investigation on the THz-band NS-COM (THz-NS-COM) from a
physical-layer perspective. Firstly, we summarize the potential applications of
THz communications in the near-space environment, where the corresponding
technical barriers are analyzed. Then the channel characteristics of THz-NS-COM
and the corresponding modeling strategies are discussed, respectively.
Afterwards, three essential research directions are investigated to surpass the
technical barriers of THz-NS-COM, i.e., robust beamforming for ultra-massive

integrated sensing and communications. Several open problems are also provided
to unleash the full potential of THz-NS-COM.

  Codes and PAC Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Sorting operation is one of the main bottlenecks for the
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding. This paper introduces an
improvement to the SCL decoding for polar and pre-transformed polar codes that
reduces the number of sorting operations without degrading the code's
error-correction performance. In an SCL decoding with an optimum metric
function we show that, on average, the correct branch's bit-metric value must
be equal to the bit-channel capacity, and on the other hand, the average
bit-metric value of a wrong branch can be at most zero. This implies that a
wrong path's partial path metric value deviates from the bit-channel capacity's
partial summation. For relatively reliable bit-channels, the bit metric for a
wrong branch becomes very large negative number, which enables us to detect and
prune such paths. We prove that, for a threshold lower than the bit-channel
cutoff rate, the probability of pruning the correct path decreases
exponentially by the given threshold. Based on these findings, we presented a
pruning technique, and the experimental results demonstrate a substantial
decrease in the amount of sorting procedures required for SCL decoding. In the
stack algorithm, a similar technique is used to significantly reduce the
average number of paths in the stack.

Unlike positive SPM, negative SPM can discover events that should have occurred
but have not occurred, and it can be used for financial risk management and
fraud detection. However, existing methods generally ignore the repetitions of
the pattern and do not consider gap constraints, which can lead to mining
results containing a large number of patterns that users are not interested in.
To solve this problem, this paper discovers frequent one-off negative
sequential patterns (ONPs). This problem has the following two characteristics.
First, the support is calculated under the one-off condition, which means that
any character in the sequence can only be used once at most. Second, the gap
constraint can be given by the user. To efficiently mine patterns, this paper
proposes the ONP-Miner algorithm, which employs depth-first and backtracking
strategies to calculate the support. Therefore, ONP-Miner can effectively avoid
creating redundant nodes and parent-child relationships. Moreover, to
effectively reduce the number of candidate patterns, ONP-Miner uses pattern
join and pruning strategies to generate and further prune the candidate
patterns, respectively. Experimental results show that ONP-Miner not only
improves the mining efficiency, but also has better mining performance than the
state-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, ONP mining can find more
interesting patterns in traffic volume data to predict future traffic.

manipulated with per-subcarrier space domain processing followed by per-user
frequency domain processing. Moreover, the space domain processing of each UT
is shown to be identical for all the subcarriers, and an asymptotically optimal
vector for the per-subcarrier space domain linear processing is derived. The
frequency domain processing can be efficiently implemented by means of the fast

features that broadly correlate with the EPR spectrum. A well-defined negative
Overhauser peak and two solid effect peaks are observed for the central

in diamond had measured a positive Overhauser enhancement in this manifold.
Frequency-chirped millimeter-wave excitation of the electron spins is seen to
significantly improve the enhancements for the two outer nuclear spin manifolds

central manifolds. The outer lines are best fit using a combination of the
cross effect and a truncated cross effect -- which is known to mimic features
of an Overhauser effect. Similar features are also observed in experiments on

electrical networks under the assumption of 'flat' or uniform voltage profiles.
This solution generalises the common 'DC power flow' approach to electrical
network problems where the detail of the voltage profile is disregarded and the
focus is on the distribution of active power flows and voltage phase angles. In
the usual approach to the problem, network resistance is ignored and simplified
power-angle relations are used based on branch reactances alone. The purpose of
this note is to describe a tractable generalisation of this approach to account
for arbitrary network resistances. The solution is worked in detail for a
single network branch with resistance $R \geq 0$ and reactance $X > 0$, with
explicit formulae derived linking branch impedance, active and reactive power
flows, voltage phase displacement and losses under the 'flat' voltage profile
assumption. These formulae have a convenient expression in terms of a
'coefficient of support' which relates the assumed active power flow to the
corresponding reactive power consumed on the branch, and encapsulates much of
the mathematical technicalities in the exact solution. It is shown that when
network resistance is taken into account, the angle displacement $\delta_j -
\delta_k$ between adjacent bus voltages is always larger than given by the
lossless power-angle relation $\sin(\delta_j - \delta_k) = XP$. The approach is
applied to the analysis of circulating power flows in large networks, building
on the classic work of Janssens and Kamagate (2003). It is seen that in
networks with nonzero branch resistances, a circulating flow of active power is
always accompanied by a counter-circulating flow of reactive power.

information, called ConceptBeam. Target speech extraction means extracting the
speech of a target speaker in a mixture. Typical approaches have been
exploiting properties of audio signals, such as harmonic structure and
direction of arrival. In contrast, ConceptBeam tackles the problem with
semantic clues. Specifically, we extract the speech of speakers speaking about
a concept, i.e., a topic of interest, using a concept specifier such as an
image or speech. Solving this novel problem would open the door to innovative
applications such as listening systems that focus on a particular topic
discussed in a conversation. Unlike keywords, concepts are abstract notions,
making it challenging to directly represent a target concept. In our scheme, a
concept is encoded as a semantic embedding by mapping the concept specifier to
a shared embedding space. This modality-independent space can be built by means
of deep metric learning using paired data consisting of images and their spoken
captions. We use it to bridge modality-dependent information, i.e., the speech
segments in the mixture, and the specified, modality-independent concept. As a
proof of our scheme, we performed experiments using a set of images associated
with spoken captions. That is, we generated speech mixtures from these spoken
captions and used the images or speech signals as the concept specifiers. We
then extracted the target speech using the acoustic characteristics of the
identified segments. We compare ConceptBeam with two methods: one based on
keywords obtained from recognition systems and another based on sound source
separation. We show that ConceptBeam clearly outperforms the baseline methods
and effectively extracts speech based on the semantic representation.

Jigsaw-ViT is able to improve both in generalization and robustness over the
standard ViT, which is usually rather a trade-off. Experimentally, we show that
adding the jigsaw puzzle branch provides better generalization than ViT on

acquisition via compressed sensing (CS) and machine learning for inference
tasks directly on a small number of measurements. It can be a promising
alternative to classical image-domain methods and enjoys great advantages in
memory saving and computational efficiency. However, previous attempts on CL
are not only limited to a fixed CS ratio, which lacks flexibility, but also
limited to MNIST/CIFAR-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world
high-resolution (HR) data or vision tasks. In this paper, a novel
transformer-based compressive learning framework on large-scale images with
arbitrary CS ratios, dubbed TransCL, is proposed. Specifically, TransCL first
utilizes the strategy of learnable block-based compressed sensing and proposes
a flexible linear projection strategy to enable CL to be performed on
large-scale images in an efficient block-by-block manner with arbitrary CS
ratios. Then, regarding CS measurements from all blocks as a sequence, a pure
transformer-based backbone is deployed to perform vision tasks with various
task-oriented heads. Our sufficient analysis presents that TransCL exhibits
strong resistance to interference and robust adaptability to arbitrary CS
ratios. Extensive experiments for complex HR data demonstrate that the proposed
TransCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and
semantic segmentation tasks. In particular, TransCL with a CS ratio of $10\%$
can obtain almost the same performance as when operating directly on the
original data and can still obtain satisfying performance even with an
extremely low CS ratio of $1\%$. The source codes of our proposed TransCL is
available at \url{https://github.com/MC-E/TransCL/}.

the EUs in each DR program (modeled in the lower layer). The competitions among
the EUs in each DR program is captured through a non-cooperative simultaneous

middle-layer DR provider and the lower-layer EUs is solved by converting the
original bi-level programming to a singlelevel programming. This converted
single-level programming is embedded in an iterative algorithm toward solving
the entire coupled games framework. Case studies are performed on IEEE 34-bus

  Objective: There is little knowledge on the application of differential
testing beyond deep learning. Within this article, we want to close this gap
for classification algorithms.
  Method: We conduct a case study using Scikit-learn, Weka, Spark MLlib, and
Caret in which we identify the potential of differential testing by considering
which algorithms are available in multiple frameworks, the feasibility by
identifying pairs of algorithms that should exhibit the same behavior, and the
effectiveness by executing tests for the identified pairs and analyzing the
deviations.
  Results: While we found a large potential for popular algorithms, the
feasibility seems limited because often it is not possible to determine
configurations that are the same in other frameworks. The execution of the
feasible tests revealed that there is a large amount of deviations for the
scores and classes. Only a lenient approach based on statistical significance
of classes does not lead to a huge amount of test failures.
  Conclusions: The potential of differential testing beyond deep learning seems
limited for research into the quality of machine learning libraries.
Practitioners may still use the approach if they have deep knowledge about
implementations, especially if a coarse oracle that only considers significant
differences of classes is sufficient.

observability, designing state observers for the state estimation of epidemic
models remains a challenging task. Epidemic spread is a nonlinear process,
often modeled as the law of mass action, which is of a quadratic form; thus, on
a compact domain, its Lipschitz constant turns out to be local and relatively
large, which renders the Lipschitz-based design criteria of existing observer
architectures infeasible. In this paper, a novel observer architecture is
proposed for the state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems that
encompasses the deterministic epidemic models. The proposed observer offers
extra leverage to reduce the influence of nonlinearity in the estimation error
dynamics, which is not possible in other Luenberger-like observers. Algebraic
Riccati inequalities are derived as sufficient conditions for the asymptotic
convergence of the estimation error to zero under local Lipschitz and
generalized Lipschitz assumptions. Equivalent linear matrix inequality
formulations of the algebraic Riccati inequalities are also provided. The
efficacy of the proposed observer design is illustrated by its application on
the celebrated SIDARTHE-V epidemic model.

In both
natural scenarios and industrial production, different surface inclinations
bring distinctive deformation and freezing dynamics to frozen droplets. We
explore the freezing of pendent and sessile droplets at different Bond number
regimes. The effect of gravity on the droplet freezing process is analyzed by
considering droplet morphology, freezing front dynamics, and freezing time. It
is found that gravity can significantly influence droplet freezing processes
via shaping the initial droplet, resulting in the flattening or elongation of
pendent and sessile droplets, respectively. We show that the droplet initial
geometry is the most important parameter and it completely controls the droplet
freezing. Despite the significant difference in the initial droplet shape
several remarkable similarities have been found for pendent and sessile
droplets at small and large Bond numbers. The final height of a frozen droplet
is found to be linearly proportional to its initial height. The time evolution
of the ice-liquid-air contact line is found to reproduce the power-law
$t^{0.5}$, but noticeably faster than the Stefan 1-D icing front propagation.
As a consequence, the time to freeze a droplet is faster than predicted by the
Stefan model and it is found to be dependent on the initial droplet height and
base radius through a simple power-law.

quantum graph is defined by having a Laplacian on each edge of a metric graph
and imposing boundary conditions at the vertices to get an eigenvalue problem.
A problem studying such quantum graphs is that the spectrum is timeconsuming to
compute by hand and the inverse problem of finding a quantum graph having a
specified spectrum is difficult. We solve the forward problem, to find the
eigenvalues, using a previously developed computer program. We obtain all
eigenvalues analytically for not too big graphs that have rationally dependent
edges. We solve the inverse problem using ""spectrally grown graphs"". The
spectrally grown graphs are evolved from a starting (parent) graph such that
the child graphs have eigenvalues are close to some criterion. Our experiments
show that the method works and we can usually find graphs having spectra which
are numerically close to a prescribed spectrum. There are naturally exceptions,
such as if no graph has the prescribed spectrum. The selection criteria (goals)
strongly influence the shape of the evolved graphs. Our experiments allows us
to make new conjectures concerning the spectra of quantum graphs. We

versatile energy-optimal quadrupedal jumping motions automatically (e.g.,
flips, spin). The jumping motions via the centroidal dynamics are formulated as
a 12-dimensional black-box optimization problem subject to the robot
kino-dynamic constraints. Gradient-based approaches offer great success in
addressing trajectory optimization (TO), yet, prior knowledge (e.g., reference
motion, contact schedule) is required and results in sub-optimal solutions. The
new proposed framework first employed a heuristics-based optimization method to
avoid these problems. Moreover, a prioritization fitness function is created
for heuristics-based algorithms in robot ground reaction force (GRF) planning,
enhancing convergence and searching performance considerably. Since
heuristics-based algorithms often require significant time, motions are planned
offline and stored as a pre-motion library. A selector is designed to
automatically choose motions with user-specified or perception information as
input. The proposed framework has been successfully validated only with a
simple continuously tracking PD controller in an open-source Mini-Cheetah by
several challenging jumping motions, including jumping over a window-shaped
obstacle with 30 cm height and left-flipping over a rectangle obstacle with 27
cm height.

forming a compact representation fed into an image reconstruction network to

performance of deep learning is likely to impede in face of non-IID situations.
Domain generalization (DG) enables a model to generalize to an unseen test
distribution, i.e., to learn domain-invariant representations. In this paper,
we argue that domain-invariant features should be originating from both
internal and mutual sides. Internal invariance means that the features can be
learned with a single domain and the features capture intrinsic semantics of
data, i.e., the property within a domain, which is agnostic to other domains.
Mutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains
(cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the
transferable features w.r.t. other domains. We then propose DIFEX for
Domain-Invariant Feature EXploration. DIFEX employs a knowledge distillation
framework to capture the high-level Fourier phase as the internally-invariant

the scenario where utility company imposes time-of-use (ToU) price and net

develop a cost allocation mechanism with easy to compute analytical formula.
Allocation is fair and cost effective for every household. We design the price

grand coalition always stable. Thus sharing electricity of storage devices
among consumers can be effective in this set-up. Our mechanism is implemented

cored isothermal dark matter sphere). The overall thin-disk thickness is
assumed to be constant at all radii, though flaring can also be tested. The
adopted radial variation in the thin-disk star-formation rate (SFR) reflects
the inside-out disk growth scenario. We allow a smooth power-law SFR continuum
to be modified by an arbitrary number of Gaussian peaks. We present a public

the literature ranging from marginal cost road pricing to trip based multimodal
pricing. The underlying models were formulated under different theoretical
assumptions and with varying, and sometimes conflicting objectives. This paper
presents a unifying framework under which different approaches can be compared
based on their respective assumptions. The unifying modelling framework is
referred to as trip pricing model, which extends path-differentiated pricing to
multimodal paths, i.e., trips on whatever mode or combinations of modes, and
generalizes road pricing schemes (which are shown to be a special case). By
setting both positive (tolls) and negative (incentives) prices, revenue-neutral
schemes are also shown to be special cases, with no a-priori assumption on
which paths/modes to toll/incentivize. For model comparison, the pricing design
problem is formulated in a multi-objective optimization framework, which
combines traffic efficiency, environmental sustainability, users' acceptance,
social and spatial equity, as pricing objectives. The trip pricing scheme is
compared with traditional road pricing schemes, and with their revenue-neutral
variants. First-best and second-best pricing schemes, designed in single- and
multi-objective optimization frameworks, are compared on the Nguyen-Dupuis
network. Results suggest a vast potential for multi-objective trip congestion
pricing over single-objective road pricing. In addition, the application of
both positive and negative prices is shown to significantly increase the
expected acceptance of pricing schemes and to preserve efficiency and
sustainability objectives. The results should promote the design of more
effective pricing policies, i.e., set of pricing rules easier to communicate,
based on now available technologies of passengers' tracking and pricing.

dense object detection task. However,a deep understanding of how AP loss
affects the detector from a pairwise ranking perspective has not yet been
developed.In this work, we revisit the average precision (AP)loss and reveal
that the crucial element is that of selecting the ranking pairs between
positive and negative samples.Based on this observation, we propose two
strategies to improve the AP loss. The first of these is a novel Adaptive
Pairwise Error (APE) loss that focusing on ranking pairs in both positive and
negative samples. Moreover,we select more accurate ranking pairs by exploiting
the normalized ranking scores and localization scores with a clustering
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the MSCOCO dataset support our analysis and
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with current
classification and ranking loss. The code is available at

individuating power of contemporary machine learning, such epistemic equity
arises in the context of any decision guidance, whether traditional or
innovative. Yet no general framework for its quantification, let alone
assurance, currently exists. Here we formulate epistemic equity in terms of
model fidelity evaluated over learnt multi-dimensional representations of

introducing a comprehensive framework for Representational Ethical Model

polarity inversion line is the most prominent photospheric field change during
flares. It is considered to be caused by the contraction of flare loops, the
details behind which is still not fully understood. Here we investigate the
$B_h$-increase in 35 major flares using HMI high-cadence vector magnetograms.
We find that $B_h$-increase is always accompanied by the increase of field
inclination. It usually initiates near the flare ribbons, showing step-like
change in between the ribbons. In particular, its evolution in early flare
phase shows close spatio-temporal correlation to flare ribbons. We further find
that $B_h$-increase tends to have similar intensity in confined and eruptive
flares, but larger spatial-extent in eruptive flares in a statistical sense.
Its intensity and timescale have inverse and positive correlations to the
initial ribbon separations, respectively. The results altogether are well
consistent with a recent proposed scenario which suggests that the
reconnection-driven contraction of flare loops enhances photospheric $B_h$
according to the ideal induction equation, providing statistical evidence to
the reconnection-driven origin for $B_h$-increase for the first time.

expensive to generate and critical events are scarce, like extreme natural
hazard. In the case of floodings, each event relies on an expensive-to-evaluate
hydraulic simulator which takes as inputs offshore meteo-oceanic conditions and
dyke breach parameters to compute the water level map. In this article, Lloyd's
algorithm, which classically serves to quantize data, is adapted to the context

importance sampling, while Functional Principal Component Analysis combined
with a Gaussian process deal with the costly hydraulic simulations. The
calculated prototype maps represent the probability distribution of the
flooding events in a minimal expected distance sense, and each is associated to
a probability mass. The method is first validated using a 2D analytical model

the metamodel and the importance sampling, are evaluated to quantify the

distillation framework to guide the learning of the object detector and thereby
restrain the overfitting in both the pre-training stage on base classes and
fine-tuning stage on novel classes. To be specific, we first present a novel
Position-Aware Bag-of-Visual-Words model for learning a representative bag of
visual words (BoVW) from a limited size of image set, which is used to encode
general images based on the similarities between the learned visual words and
an image. Then we perform knowledge distillation based on the fact that an
image should have consistent BoVW representations in two different feature
spaces. To this end, we pre-learn a feature space independently from the object
detection, and encode images using BoVW in this space. The obtained BoVW
representation for an image can be considered as distilled knowledge to guide
the learning of object detector: the extracted features by the object detector
for the same image are expected to derive the consistent BoVW representations
with the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method and demonstrate the superiority over other state-of-the-art

on the design of the cross section and on strain, as well as on external
electric and magnetic fields. In this work, we analyze in detail the dependence
of the SOI and $g$ factors on the orbital magnetic field. We focus on magnetic
fields aligned along the axis of the NW, where orbital effects are enhanced and
result in a renormalization of the effective $g$ factor up to $400\,\%$, even
at small values of magnetic field. We provide an exact analytical solution for
holes in Ge NWs and we derive an effective low-energy model that enables us to
investigate the effect of electric fields applied perpendicular to the NW. We
also discuss in detail the role of strain, growth direction, and high energy
valence bands in different architectures, including Ge/Si core/shell NWs,
gate-defined one-dimensional channels in planar Ge, and curved Ge quantum
wells. In core/shell NWs grown along the $[110]$ direction the $g$ factor can
be twice larger than for other growth directions which makes this growth
direction advantageous for Majorana bound states. Also curved Ge quantum wells
feature large effective $g$ factors and SOI, again ideal for hosting Majorana
bound states. Strikingly, because these quantities are independent of the
electric field, hole spin qubits encoded in curved quantum wells are to good
approximation not susceptible to charge noise, significantly boosting their

powerful tool that can integrate an off-the-shelf deep denoiser for different
image restoration tasks with known observation models. However, obtaining the
observation model that exactly matches the actual one can be challenging in
practice. Thus, the PnP schemes with conventional deep denoisers may fail to

argue that the robustness of the PnP framework is largely limited by using the
off-the-shelf deep denoisers that are trained by deterministic optimization. To
this end, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based PnP
framework, dubbed RePNP, by leveraging a light-weight DRL-based denoiser for
robust image restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed RePNP is robust to the observation model used in the PnP scheme
deviating from the actual one. Thus, RePNP can generate more reliable
restoration results for image deblurring and super resolution tasks. Compared
with several state-of-the-art deep image restoration baselines, RePNP achieves
better results subjective to model deviation with fewer model parameters.

SLSNe II and attempt to constrain their power source using light-curve models.
The brightest events are photometrically and spectroscopically similar to the
prototypical SN 2008es, while others are found spectroscopically more
reminiscent of non-superluminous SNe II, especially SNe II-L. $^{56}$Ni decay
as the primary power source is ruled out. Light-curve models generally cannot
distinguish between circumstellar interaction (CSI) and a magnetar central
engine, but an excess of ultraviolet (UV) emission signifying CSI is seen in
most of the SNe with UV data, at a wide range of photometric properties.
Simultaneously, the broad H$\alpha$ profiles of the brightest SLSNe II can be
explained through electron scattering in a symmetric circumstellar medium
(CSM). In other SLSNe II without narrow lines, the CSM may be confined and
wholly overrun by the ejecta. CSI, possibly involving mass lost in recent
eruptions, is implied to be the dominant power source in most SLSNe II, and the
diversity in properties is likely the result of different mass loss histories.
Based on their radiated energy, an additional power source may be required for
the brightest SLSNe II, however -- possibly a central engine combined with CSI.

resources constraints, in which the key challenge is stability-plasticity
dilemma, i.e., it is uneasy to simultaneously have the stability to prevent
catastrophic forgetting of old tasks and the plasticity to learn new tasks
well. In this paper, we propose a new continual learning approach, Advanced
Null Space (AdNS), to balance the stability and plasticity without storing any
old data of previous tasks. Specifically, to obtain better stability, AdNS
makes use of low-rank approximation to obtain a novel null space and projects
the gradient onto the null space to prevent the interference on the past tasks.
To control the generation of the null space, we introduce a non-uniform
constraint strength to further reduce forgetting. Furthermore, we present a
simple but effective method, intra-task distillation, to improve the
performance of the current task. Finally, we theoretically find that null space
plays a key role in plasticity and stability, respectively. Experimental
results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared

note two problems that jointly happen in many industrial systems: 1)
Irregular/asynchronous observations and actions and 2) Dramatic changes in
environment dynamics from an episode to another (e.g. varying payload inertial
properties). We propose a general framework that overcomes those difficulties
by meta-learning adaptive dynamics models for continuous-time prediction and

from the external environment is essential to the system's growth and survival.
Examples include the extraction of sunlight and nutrients in organic plants, of
monetary income in business organisations and of mobile robots in swarm
intelligence actions. When operating within competitive, ever-changing
environments, such systems must distribute their internal assets wisely so as
to improve and adapt their ability to extract available resources. As the
system size increases, the asset-distribution process often gets organised
around a multi-scale control topology. This topology may be static (fixed) or
dynamic (enabling growth and structural adaptation) depending on the system's
internal constraints and adaptive mechanisms. In this paper, we expand on a
plant-inspired asset-distribution model and introduce a more general
multi-scale model applicable across a wider range of natural and artificial
system domains. We study the impact that the topology of the multi-scale
control process has upon the system's ability to self-adapt asset distribution
when resource availability changes within the environment. Results show how
different topological characteristics and different competition levels between
system branches impact overall system profitability, adaptation delays and
disturbances when environmental changes occur. These findings provide a basis
for system designers to select the most suitable topology and configuration for
their particular application and execution environment.

concentrators in three-dimensional systems. A different physical situation can
in principle be expected for dye-solution filled microcavities with a mirror

with the IRAM-30m telescope in the first three CO transitions. We remarkably
detected all BCGs at high signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm S/N}\simeq(3.8-10.2)$,
for a total of 7 detected lines out of 8, corresponding to a success rate of
$88\%$. This allows us to double the number of distant BCGs with clear
detections in at least two CO lines. We have then combined our observations
with available stellar, star formation, and dust properties of the BCGs, and we
have compared them with a sample of $\sim100$ distant cluster galaxies with
observations in CO. Our analysis yields large molecular gas reservoirs
$M_{H_2}\simeq(0.5-1.4)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$, excitation ratios $r_{31}=
L^{\prime}_{\rm CO(3\rightarrow2)}/L^{\prime}_{\rm

excitation ratio $r_{31}$ of intermediate-$z$ BCGs appears to be well
correlated with the star formation rate and efficiency, which suggests that
excited gas is found only in highly star forming and cool-core BCGs. By
performing color-magnitude plots and a red sequence modeling we find that
recent bursts of star formation are needed to explain the fact that the BCGs
are measurably bluer than photometrically selected cluster members. We suggest
that a substantial amount of the molecular gas has been accreted by the KiDS
BCGs, but still not efficiently converted into stars.

accumulative measurement errors and noises can affect the estimation results.
In this paper, a more robust gait phase estimation method is proposed using a
unified form of piecewise monotonic gait phase-thigh angle models for various

is a stable variable and avoids phase drifting. A Kalman filter-based smoother
is designed to further suppress the mutations of the estimated gait phase.

numerically employing the Newman-Ziff algorithm. Distortion is administered in
the lattice by systematically and randomly dislocating its sites from their
regular positions. The amount of distortion is tunable by a parameter called
the distortion parameter. In this model, two occupied neighboring sites are
considered connected only if the distance between them is less than a
predefined value called the connection threshold. It is observed that the
percolation threshold always increases with distortion if the connection
threshold is equal to or greater than the lattice constant of the regular
lattice. On the other hand, if the connection threshold is less than the
lattice constant, the percolation threshold first decreases, then increases
steadily as distortion is increased. It is shown that the variation of the
percolation threshold can be well explained by the change in the fraction of
occupied bonds with distortion. The values of the relevant critical exponents
of the transition strongly indicate that percolation in regular and distorted
simple cubic lattices belong to the same universality class. It is also
demonstrated that this model is intrinsically distinct from the site-bond
percolation model.

understand the human intention since it guides the human towards a certain
goal. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture which assumes a
sequence of human action (low-level) can be driven from the human intention
(high-level). Based on this, we deal with Long-Term Action Anticipation task in
egocentric videos. Our framework first extracts two level of human information
over the N observed videos human actions through a Hierarchical Multi-task MLP
Mixer (H3M). Then, we condition the uncertainty of the future through an
Intention-Conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (I-CVAE) that generates K stable
predictions of the next Z=20 actions that the observed human might perform. By
leveraging human intention as high-level information, we claim that our model
is able to anticipate more time-consistent actions in the long-term, thus
improving the results over baseline methods in EGO4D Challenge. This work
ranked first in both CVPR@2022 and ECVV@2022 EGO4D LTA Challenge by providing
more plausible anticipated sequences, improving the anticipation of nouns and
overall actions. The code is available at

extensive simulations and the analysis of multiple psychiatric and

substantial power over conventional approaches and leads to insightful
discoveries on nonlinear associations between gene expression levels and

doing so, we applied the proposed method for 797 continuous traits from the UK

prerequisite for the success of radio interferometers such as the Murchison

years, novel calibration techniques targeting the power spectrum paradigm of
EoR science have been actively researched and where possible implemented. Using
recently acquired computation resources for the MWA, we test the full
capabilities of the state-of-the-art calibration techniques available for the
MWA EoR project, with a focus on both direction dependent and direction
independent calibration. Specifically, we investigate improvements that can be
made in the vital calibration stages of sky modelling, ionospheric correction,
and compact source foreground subtraction as applied in the hybrid foreground
mitigation approach (one that combines both foreground subtraction and
avoidance). Additionally, we investigate a method of ionospheric correction
using interpolated ionospheric phase screens and assess its performance in the
power spectrum space. Overall, we identify a refined RTS calibration
configuration that leads to an at least 2 factor reduction of the EoR window

marks a step further towards detecting the 21 cm signal using the MWA and the

only requiring the image-level annotations. Recently, some works have managed
to select the accurate boxes generated from a well-trained WSOD network to
supervise a semi-supervised detection framework for better performance.
However, these approaches simply divide the training set into labeled and
unlabeled sets according to the image-level criteria, such that sufficient
mislabeled or wrongly localized box predictions are chosen as pseudo
ground-truths, resulting in a sub-optimal solution of detection performance. To
overcome this issue, we propose a novel WSOD framework with a new paradigm that
switches from weak supervision to noisy supervision (W2N). Generally, with
given pseudo ground-truths generated from the well-trained WSOD network, we
propose a two-module iterative training algorithm to refine pseudo labels and
supervise better object detector progressively. In the localization adaptation
module, we propose a regularization loss to reduce the proportion of
discriminative parts in original pseudo ground-truths, obtaining better pseudo
ground-truths for further training. In the semi-supervised module, we propose a
two tasks instance-level split method to select high-quality labels for
training a semi-supervised detector. Experimental results on different
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of W2N, and our W2N outperforms all
existing pure WSOD methods and transfer learning methods. Our code is publicly

generalization, never previously implemented, facilitated direct comparisons
between surging and quasi-steady pressure coefficients, and thus unsteady
effects could be distinguished from Reynolds number effects. A
momentum-integral boundary layer analysis was implemented to determine movement
of the bubble separation point, and movement of the transition point was
extracted from experimental surface pressure coefficients. The most significant
finding was that bubble bursting occurs, counterintuitively, during early
imposition of the favorable temporal pressure gradient. This is because the
favorable pressure gradient rapidly drives the bubble aft, rendering it unable
to reattach. Bursting resulted in large lift and form-drag coefficient
oscillations, and failure to implement the generalized pressure coefficient
definition resulted in temporal form-drag errors of up to 400 counts.

Unlike conventional High-Definition streaming applications, streaming virtual
reality applications requires not only stringent latency requirements but also
the computation capability of the transmitter to quickly respond to dynamic
users' demands. Thus, conventional RSMA approaches usually fail to address the
challenges caused by computational demands at the transmitter, let alone the
dynamic nature of the virtual reality streaming applications. To overcome the

control over the strength of electronic interactions and lattice symmetry, 2D
heterostrain provides a powerful platform to engineer, tune, and probe strongly
correlated moir\'e materials.

the redshift range $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$, in a tomographic approach, with the
main goal of probing BAO. This work presents the forecasts of measuring the
transversal BAO signal during the BINGO Phase 1 operation. We use two
clustering estimators, the two-point angular correlation function (ACF) and the
angular power spectrum (APS), and a template-based method to model the ACF and
APS estimated from simulations of the BINGO region and extract the BAO
information. The tomographic approach allows the combination of redshift bins
to improve the template fitting performance. We find that each clustering
estimator shows different sensitivities to specific redshift ranges, although
both of them perform better at higher redshifts. In general, the APS estimator
provides slightly better estimates, with smaller uncertainties and larger
probability of detection of the BAO signal, achieving $\gtrsim 90$\% at higher
redshifts. We investigate the contribution from instrumental noise and residual
foreground signals and find that the former has the greater impact, getting
more significant as the redshift increases, in particular the APS estimator.
Indeed, including noise in the analysis increases the uncertainty up to a
factor of $\sim 2.2$ at higher redshifts. Foreground residuals, in contrast, do
not significantly affect our final uncertainties. In summary, our results show
that, even including semi-realistic systematic effects, BINGO has the potential
to successfully measure the BAO scale in radio frequencies. (Abridged)

nonlinear systems through a generally infinite dimensional globally linear
representation. Originally, the Koopman formalism has been described for
autonomous systems and the extension for actuated continuous-time systems with
a linear input or a control affine form has only recently been addressed.
However, such a derivation for discrete-time systems has not yet been
developed. Thus, a particular Koopman form is generally assumed, predominantly
a linear time invariant (LTI) model, as it facilitates the use of control
techniques such as linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control.
However, we show that this assumption is insufficient to capture the dynamics
of the underlying nonlinear system. In the present paper, we systematically
investigate and analytically derive lifted forms under inputs for a general
class of nonlinear systems in both continuous and discrete time, using the
fundamental theorem of calculus. We prove that the resulting lifted
representations give linear state-space Koopman models where the input matrix
becomes state (and input, for the discrete-time case)-dependent, hence it can
be seen as a specially structured linear parameter-varying (LPV) description of
the underlying system. We also provide error bounds on how much the parameter
variation contributes and how well the system behaviour can be approximated by
an LTI Koopman representation. The introduced theoretical insight greatly helps
for performing proper model structure selection in system identification with
Koopman models as well as making a proper choice for LTI or LPV techniques for
the control of nonlinear systems through the Koopman approach.

annotation in terms of arousal and valence are per se subjective. To address
this, these emotion annotations are typically collected by multiple annotators
and averaged across annotators in order to obtain labels for arousal and
valence. However, besides the average, also the uncertainty of a label is of
interest, and should also be modeled and predicted for automatic emotion
recognition. In the literature, for simplicity, label uncertainty modeling is
commonly approached with a Gaussian assumption on the collected annotations.
However, as the number of annotators is typically rather small due to resource
constraints, we argue that the Gaussian approach is a rather crude assumption.
In contrast, in this work we propose to model the label distribution using a
Student's t-distribution which allows us to account for the number of

Kullback-Leibler divergence based loss function and use it to train an

source domain to a different but related fully-unlabeled target domain. To
address the problem of domain shift, more and more UDA methods adopt pseudo
labels of the target samples to improve the generalization ability on the
target domain. However, inaccurate pseudo labels of the target samples may
yield suboptimal performance with error accumulation during the optimization
process. Moreover, once the pseudo labels are generated, how to remedy the
generated pseudo labels is far from explored. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels in the target domain. It
first generates coarse pseudo labels by a conventional UDA method. Then, it
iteratively exploits the intra-class similarity of the target samples for
improving the generated coarse pseudo labels, and aligns the source and target
domains with the improved pseudo labels. The accuracy improvement of the pseudo
labels is made by first deleting dissimilar samples, and then using spanning
trees to eliminate the samples with the wrong pseudo labels in the intra-class
samples. We have applied the proposed approach to several conventional UDA
methods as an additional term. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method can boost the accuracy of the pseudo labels and further lead to
more discriminative and domain invariant features than the conventional
baselines.

observe that fitting the dynamics model under the distribution for \emph{all

The evolving policy during training will cause state-action visitation
distribution shifts. We theoretically analyze how this distribution shift over

propose a novel dynamics model learning method, named \textit{Policy-adapted
Dynamics Model Learning (PDML)}. PDML dynamically adjusts the historical policy
mixture distribution to ensure the learned model can continually adapt to the

density (PSD) of the X-ray emission of XRBs shows significant evolution with
spectral states. It is not clear whether AGN follow a similar evolutionary
trend, however, though their X-ray emission and the PSD are both variable. In
this work, we study a sample of nine AGN with multiple long observations with
XMM-Newton, which exhibit significant X-ray spectral variation. We perform
Bayesian PSD analysis to measure the PSD shape and variation. We find that a
large change in the X-ray energy spectrum (mainly the change of flux state) is
often accompanied by a large change in the PSD shape. The emergence of a
high-frequency break in the PSD also depends on the spectral state. Among the
four sources with significant high-frequency PSD breaks detected, three show
the break only in the high-flux state, while the remaining one shows it only in

states of an AGN is found to vary by as much as 1.0 dex. These results suggest
that the different variability properties observed are likely caused by
different physical processes dominating different spectral states. Our results
also indicate that the intrinsic PSD variation can introduce a significant
fraction of the dispersion as reported for the correlations between various
X-ray variability properties and the black hole mass.

addressing the sources of complexity in these methods, we propose a more

and a unidirectional many-to-one vanilla RNN operate in tandem, each best
capturing one set of channel impairments while compensating for the
shortcomings of the other. We deploy this model in two different receiver
configurations. In one, the neural network is placed after a linear
equalization chain and is merely responsible for nonlinearity mitigation; in
the other, the neural network is directly placed after the chromatic dispersion
compensation and is responsible for joint nonlinearity and polarization mode
dispersion compensation. For a 16-QAM 64 GBd dual-polarization optical

statistics, information, a path is described which tries to explore this
connection from the point of view of (non)locality of the gravitational field.
First the emphasis is put on that well-known thermodynamic results related to
null hypersurfaces (i.e. to lightsheets and to generalized covariant entropy
bound) can be interpreted as implying an irreducible intrinsic nonlocality of
gravity. This nonlocality even if possibly concealed at ordinary
scales(depending on which matter is source of the gravitational field, and
which matter we use to probe the latter) unavoidably shows up at the smallest
scales, read the Planck length $l_p$, whichever are the circumstances we are
considering. Some consequences are then explored of this nonlocality when
embodied in the fabric itself of spacetime by endowing the latter with a
minimum length $L$, in particular the well-known and intriguing fact that this
brings to get the field equations, and all of gravity with it, as a
statistical-mechanical result. This is done here probing the neighborhood of a
would-be (in ordinary spacetime) generic event through lightsheets (instead of
spacelike or timelike geodesic congruences as in other accounts) from it. The
tools for these derivations are nonlocal quantities, and among them the
minimum-length Ricci scalar stands out both for providing micro degrees of
freedom for gravity in the statistical account and for the fact that
intriguingly the ordinary, or `classical', Ricci scalar can not be recovered
from it in the $L\to 0$ limit. Emphasis is put on that classical gravity is
generically obtained this way for $\hbar\ne 0$, but not in the $\hbar\to 0$
limit (the statistically derived field equations become singular in this
limit), adding to previous results in this sense. (truncated Abstract; see the

mobile particles are constrained to the surface of a 2D cylinder and immersed
in vacuum (no dielectric image charges). An EDL corresponds to the end-circle
of the cylinder which carries a (fixed) position-dependent line charge density.
The geometries of one single EDL and two EDLs at distance $d$ are considered;
the particle density profile is studied for both geometries, the effective
interaction of two EDLs is given by the particle pressure on either of the line
walls. For any coupling constant $\Gamma\equiv \beta e^2 = 2\times {\rm
integer}$, there exists a mapping of the 2D one-component Coulomb system onto
the 1D interacting anticommuting-field theory defined on a chain of sites.
Using specific transformation symmetries of anticommuting variables, the
contact value theorem is generalized to the EDL with modulated line charge
density. For the free-fermion coupling $\Gamma=2$ it is shown that, under
certain conditions, the matrix of interaction strengths between anticommuting
variables diagonalizes itself which permits one to obtain exact formulas for
the particle density profile as well as the pressure. The obtained results
confirm the previous indications of weak-coupling and Monte Carlo observations
that the surface charge inhomogeneity implies an enhancement of the counterion
density at the contact with the charged line and a diminution of the pressure
between two parallel lines in comparison with the uniformly charged ones (with
the same mean charge densities).

liquid-liquid-solid interface (LLS) on the rod climbing effect of two
immiscible Newtonian liquids using experimental and numerical approaches.
Experiments revealed that the final steady state contact angle, $\theta_{w}$ at
the LLS interface varies with the rod rotation speed, $\omega$. For the present
system, $\theta_{w}$ changes from $\sim$69$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$83$^{\circ}$ when
the state of the rod is changed from static condition to rotating at 3.3 Hz.
With further increase in $\omega$, the $\theta_{w}$ exceeds 90$^{\circ}$ which
cannot be observed experimentally. It is inferred from the simulations that the
input value of $\theta_{w}$ saturates and attains a constant value of
$\sim$120$^{\circ}$ for $\omega>$ 5 Hz. Using numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that this contact angle hysteresis must be considered for the
correct prediction of the Newtonian rod climbing effect. Using the appropriate
values of the contact angle in the boundary condition, an excellent
quantitative match between the experiments and simulations is obtained in terms
of: the climbing height, the threshold rod rotation speed for onset of
climbing, and the shape of liquid-liquid interface. This resolves the
discrepancy between the experiments and simulations in the existing literature
where a constant value of the contact angle has been used for all speeds of rod
rotation.

the hyperparameters of the GP have a plausible interpretation in terms of
physical properties of the star and spots. In this paper, we test the
reliability of this interpretation by modelling data simulated using a spot
model using a QP GP, and the recently proposed quasi-periodic plus cosine (QPC)
GP, comparing the posterior distributions of the GP hyperparameters to the
input parameters of the spot model. We find excellent agreement between the
input stellar rotation period and the QP and QPC GP period, and very good
agreement between the spot decay timescale and the length scale of the squared
exponential term. We also compare the hyperparameters derived from light and
radial velocity (RV) curves for a given star, finding that the period and
evolution timescales are in good agreement. However, the harmonic complexity of
the GP, while displaying no clear correlation with the spot properties in our
simulations, is systematically higher for the RV than for the light curve data.
Finally, for the QP kernel, we investigate the impact of noise and
time-sampling on the hyperparameters in the case of RVs. Our results indicate
that good coverage of rotation period and spot evolution time-scales is more
important than the total number of points, and noise characteristics govern the
harmonic complexity.

parameters and resulting injection depth are needed to enable targeting
specific skin layers, and enhance the pharmacokinetics of various therapeutic
compounds. The complexity of skin, its opacity and non-linear mechanical
properties, pose a technological challenge. Hence the use of surrogates is
instrumental to understand how to inject without needles. In particular,
reducing undesired splashing upon jet impact and liquid squeeze-out after
injection are needed to minimize infection risks and ensure accurate dosage.
Therefore, in this paper we explore how microfluidic jet characteristics
influence the impact outcome on a range of materials as skin surrogate. Jets
with velocities between 7 - 77 m/s and diameters 35 - 130 $\mu$m were directed
at substrates with shear moduli between 0.2 kPa and 26 GPa. We found seven
different regimes depending on jet inertia and substrate shear modulus.
Furthermore, three distinct transition regions were identified as the
thresholds between regimes: i) spreading/splashing threshold, ii) dimple
formation threshold, and iii) plastic/elastic deformation threshold. These
thresholds allow predicting the required jet velocity and diameter to inject
substrates with known shear modulus. We found that jet velocity is a better
predictor for the injection depth compared to the Weber number, as the jet
diameter does not influence the injection depth. Our findings are relevant for
advancing needle-free injection research, because the shear modulus of skin
depends on multiple factors, such as ethnicity, body part and environmental

A quantitative notion of orientational typicality is introduced and its
interplay with orientational order is found to evidence a statistical
regularity with respect to point symmetry. By the assertion of axioms on the

especially software and electronic. Test paths can be automatically generated
from the system model to test such systems using a suitable algorithm. This
paper presents a strategy that generates test paths and allows to start and end
test paths only in defined states of the finite state machine. The strategy
also simultaneously supports generating test paths only of length in a given
range. For this purpose, alternative system models, test coverage criteria, and
a set of algorithms are developed. The strategy is compared with the best
alternative based on the reduction of the test set generated by the established
N-switch coverage approach on a mix of 171 industrial and artificially
generated problem instances. The proposed strategy outperforms the compared
variant in a smaller number of test path steps. The extent varies with the used
test coverage criterion and preferred test path length range from none to two
and half fold difference. Moreover, the proposed technique detected up to 30%
more simple artificial defects inserted into experimental SUT models per one
test step than the compared alternative technique. The proposed strategy is
well applicable in situations where a possible test path starts and ends in a
state machine needs to be reflected and, concurrently, the length of the test
paths has to be in a defined range.

  framework of transcriptome-wide association study",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Polygnicity refers to the phenomenon that multiple genetic variants have a
non-zero effect on a complex trait. It is defined as the proportion of genetic
variants that have a nonzero effect on the trait. Evaluation of polygenicity
can provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of the trait.
Several recent works have attempted to estimate polygenicity at the SNP level.
However, evaluating polygenicity at the gene level can be biologically more
meaningful. We propose the notion of gene-level polygenicity, defined as the
proportion of genes having a non-zero effect on the trait under the framework
of transcriptome-wide association study. We introduce a Bayesian approach
polygene to estimate this quantity for a trait. The method is based on spike
and slab prior and simultaneously provides an optimal subset of non-null genes.
Our simulation study shows that polygene efficiently estimates gene-level
polygenicity. The method produces downward bias for small choices of trait
heritability due to a non-null gene, which diminishes rapidly with an increase
in the GWAS sample size. While identifying the optimal subset of non-null
genes, polygene offers a high level of specificity and an overall good level of
sensitivity -- the sensitivity increases as the sample size of the reference
panel expression and GWAS data increase. We applied the method to seven
phenotypes in the UK Biobank, integrating expression data. We find height to be
most polygenic and asthma to be the least polygenic. Our analysis suggests that
both HDL and triglycerides are more polygenic than LDL.

This pass resulted in very unique observations of the solar corona by the
Wide-field Instrument for Solar PRobe (WISPR). WISPR observed at least ten
CMEs, some of which were so close that the structures appear distorted. All of
the CMEs appeared to have a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure and most were
oriented such that the view was along the axis orientation, revealing very
complex interiors. Two CMEs had a small MFR develop in the interior, with a
bright circular boundary surrounding a very dark interior. Trailing the larger
CMEs were substantial outflows of small blobs and flux-rope like structures
within striated ribbons, lasting for many hours. When the heliophysics plasma
sheet (HPS) was inclined, as it was during the days around perihelion on
November 21, 2021, the outflow was over a very wide latitude range. One CME was
overtaken by a faster one, with a resultant compression of the rear of the
leading CME and an unusual expansion in the trailing CME. The small Thomson

a bi-disperse atomic fluid, which can remain liquid below its melting point
(supercooled state), to study the effect of temperature on friction and slip
length between the liquid and a smooth apolar wall, in a broad range of
temperatures. At high temperatures, an Arrhenius law fits well the temperature
dependence of viscosity, friction and slip length. In contrast, when the fluid
is supercooled, the viscosity becomes super-Arrhenian, while interfacial
friction can remain Arrhenian or even drastically decrease when lowering the
temperature, resulting in a massive increase of the slip length. We rationalize
the observed superlubricity by the surface crystallization of the fluid, and
the incommensurability between the structures of the fluid interfacial layer
and of the wall. This study calls for experimental investigation of the slip
length of supercooled liquids on low surface energy solids.

limiting the throughput and efficiency of the system. To overcome the
aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces COSIME, an general in-memory

for efficient CSS. By leveraging the one-transistor AND gate function of FeFET
devices, current-based translinear analog circuit and winner-take-all (WTA)

between one user's opinion change episode and subsequent behavioral change on
an online social media, Reddit. In particular, we look at r/ChangeMyView, an
online community dedicated to debating one's own opinions. Interestingly, this
forum adopts a well-codified schema for explicitly self-reporting opinion
change. Starting from this ground truth, we analyze changes in future online
information consumption behavior that arise after a self-reported opinion
change on sociopolitical topics; and in particular, operationalized in this
work as the participation to sociopolitical subreddits. Such participation
profile is important as it represents one's information diet, and is a reliable
proxy for, e.g., political affiliation or health choices.
  We find that people who report an opinion change are significantly more
likely to change their future participation in a specific subset of online
communities. We characterize which communities are more likely to be abandoned
after opinion change, and find a significant association (r=0.46) between
propaganda-like language used in a community and the increase in chances of
leaving it. We find comparable results (r=0.39) for the opposite direction,
i.e., joining a community. This finding suggests how propagandistic communities

various physical parameters, although play a key role in these smart systems
but also causes the threat of breach of the privacy of the users. Existing
solutions for privacy-preserving computation for decentralized systems either
use too complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of

we propose a novel lightweight strategy LiPI for Privacy-Preserving Data

decentralized and collaborative data obfuscation and does not exploit any
dependency on any trusted third party. In addition, besides minimizing the
communication requirements, we make appropriate use of the recent advances in
Synchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols in our design to accomplish the
goal efficiently. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in
both simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates
that our strategy works up to at least 51.7% faster and consumes 50.5% lesser

with more data, with three new results: (1) The central estimate of the
economic impact of global warming is always negative. (2) The confidence
interval about the estimates is much wider. (3) Elicitation methods are most
pessimistic, econometric studies most optimistic. Two previous results remain:
(4) The uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises. (5)
Poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones. A meta-analysis of
the impact of weather shocks reveals that studies, which relate economic growth
to temperature levels, cannot agree on the sign of the impact whereas studies,
which make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the
sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. The former studies posit
that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that
the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of
the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a
function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon shows a similar pattern
to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of
moderate warming in the near and medium term.

alarming potential faults of target systems in various domains. Current
state-of-the-art time series anomaly detectors mainly focus on devising
advanced neural network structures and new reconstruction/prediction learning
objectives to learn data normality (normal patterns and behaviors) as
accurately as possible. However, these one-class learning methods can be
deceived by unknown anomalies in the training data (i.e., anomaly
contamination). Further, their normality learning also lacks knowledge about
the anomalies of interest. Consequently, they often learn a biased, inaccurate
normality boundary. This paper proposes a novel one-class learning approach,
named calibrated one-class classification, to tackle this problem. Our
one-class classifier is calibrated in two ways: (1) by adaptively penalizing
uncertain predictions, which helps eliminate the impact of anomaly
contamination while accentuating the predictions that the one-class model is
confident in, and (2) by discriminating the normal samples from native anomaly
examples that are generated to simulate genuine time series abnormal behaviors
on the basis of original data. These two calibrations result in
contamination-tolerant, anomaly-informed one-class learning, yielding a
significantly improved normality modeling. Extensive experiments on six
real-world datasets show that our model substantially outperforms twelve
state-of-the-art competitors and obtains 6% - 31% F1 score improvement. The

Specifically, we first measure the dependence by estimating the mutual

have larger adversarial MI and smaller natural MI compared with those w.r.t.

optimally dispatching a fixed set of DERs, eschewing methods for optimally
determining set membership. Intuitively, these fixed sets may not be optimal
from a control perspective. Here, we propose a method to cluster the DERs based
on a proxy for their covariances, with the goal of minimising the maximum
variance across all DER clusters. This method does not require the enumeration

represented as a mixture of the restricted primitive model (RPM) of ionic fluid

approaches, i.e., the scale particle theory (SPT) and the associative mean
spherical approximation (AMSA). Whereas the SPT is sufficient to provide a
rather good description of a reference system taking into account hard-core
interactions, the AMSA is known to be efficient in treating the Coulomb
interactions between the ions. Alternatively, we also use the mean spherical
approximation (MSA) for comparison. In general, both approximations lead to
similar qualitative results for the phase diagrams: the region of coexisting
envelope becomes broader and shifts towards larger densities and higher
temperatures when the pressure increases. However, the AMSA and the MSA produce
different concentration dependences, i.e., contrary to the MSA, the AMSA phase
diagrams show that the high-density phase mostly consists of the ions for all
pressures considered. To demonstrate the effect of asphericity of solvent
molecules on the fluid-fluid phase transition, we consider an ""equivalent""
mixture in which the HSC particles are replaced by hard spheres (HS) of the
same volume. It is observed that in the case of HSC solvent (RPM-HSC model),
the region of phase coexistence is wider than for the case of the solvent
molecules being of spherical shape (RPM-HS model). It is also found that the
critical temperature is higher in the RPM-HSC model than in the RPM-HS model,

this difference remains essential.

Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) competition. The IAC is a competition where
full-scale race cars run autonomously on Indianapolis Motor Speedway(IMS) up to
290 km/h (180 mph). Race cars will experience severe vibrations. Especially at
high speeds. These vibrations can degrade standard localization algorithms
based on precision GPS-aided inertial measurement units. Degraded localization
can lead to serious problems, including collisions. Therefore, we propose a
resilient navigation system that enables a race car to stay within the track in
the event of localization failures. Our navigation system uses a multi-sensor
fusion-based Kalman filter. We detect degradation of the navigation solution
using probabilistic approaches to computing optimal measurement values for the
correction step of our Kalman filter. In addition, an optimal path planning
algorithm for obstacle avoidance is proposed. In this challenge, the track has
static obstacles on the track. The vehicle is required to avoid them with
minimal time loss. By taking the original optimal racing line, obstacles, and
vehicle dynamics into account, we propose a road-graph-based path planning
algorithm to ensure that our race car can perform efficient obstacle avoidance.
The proposed localization system was successfully validated to show its
capability to prevent localization failures in the event of faulty GPS
measurements during the historic world's first autonomous racing at IMS. Owing
to our robust navigation and planning algorithm, we were able to finish the
race as one of the top four teams while the remaining five teams failed to
finish due to collisions or out-of-track violations.

theory, with applications spanning from quantum communication to computation.
Typical measurement paradigms for state discrimination involve a minimum
probability of error or unambiguous discrimination with a minimum probability
of inconclusive results. Alternatively, an optimal inconclusive measurement, a
non-projective measurement, achieves minimal error for a given inconclusive
probability. This more general measurement encompasses the standard measurement
paradigms for state discrimination and provides a much more powerful tool for
quantum information and communication. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the
optimal inconclusive measurement for the discrimination of binary coherent
states using linear optics and single-photon detection. Our demonstration uses
coherent displacement operations based on interference, single-photon
detection, and fast feedback to prepare the optimal feedback policy for the
optimal non-projective quantum measurement with high fidelity. This generalized
measurement allows us to transition among standard measurement paradigms in an
optimal way from minimum error to unambiguous measurements for binary coherent
states. As a particular case, we use this general measurement to implement the
optimal minimum error measurement for phase-coherent states, which is the
optimal modulation for communications under the average power constraint.
Moreover, we propose a hybrid measurement that leverages the binary optimal
inconclusive measurement in conjunction with sequential, unambiguous state
elimination to realize higher dimensional inconclusive measurements of coherent
states.

semi-supervised learning of the latent state TOD models, which is referred to
as JSA-TOD. To our knowledge, JSA-TOD represents the first work in developing
JSA based semi-supervised learning of discrete latent variable conditional

Extensive experiments show that JSA-TOD significantly outperforms its

noise process with a common spectrum among the millisecond pulsars in the
arrays. The spectral properties of this common-noise process are consistent
with expectations for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from
inspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries. However, recent simulation
analyses based on Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data indicate that such a
detection may arise spuriously. In this paper, we use simulated pulsar timing
array datasets to further test the robustness of the inference methods for
spectral and spatial correlations from a GWB. Expanding on our previous
results, we find strong support (Bayes factors exceeding $10^5$) for the
presence of a common-spectrum noise process in datasets where no common process
is present, under a wide range of timing noise prescriptions per pulsar. We
show that these results are highly sensitive to the choice of Bayesian priors
on timing noise parameters, with priors that more closely match the injected
distributions of timing noise parameters resulting in diminished support for a
common-spectrum noise process. These results emphasize shortcomings in current
methods for inferring the presence of a common-spectrum process, and imply that
the detection of a common process is not a reliable precursor to detection of
the GWB. Future searches for the nanohertz GWB should remain focussed on
detecting spatial correlations, and make use of more tailored specifications
for a common-spectrum noise process.

stationary and independent increments. The properties of such models are
different from those of Brownian reduction models. In particular, for L\'evy
models the decoherence rate depends on the overall scale of the energy. Thus,
in L\'evy reduction models, a macroscopic quantum system will spontaneously
collapse to an eigenstate even if the energy level gaps are small.

elastic-scattering events were recorded at $\sqrt{s} = 13~$TeV with an
integrated luminosity of $340~\mu \textrm{b}^{-1}$ using the ALFA subdetector
of ATLAS in 2016. The elastic cross section was measured differentially in the
Mandelstam $t$ variable in the range from $-t = 2.5 \cdot 10^{-4}~$GeV$^{2}$ to

paper presents measurements of the total cross section $\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}$,
parameters of the nuclear slope, and the $\rho$-parameter defined as the ratio
of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic-scattering amplitude in
the limit $t \rightarrow 0$. These parameters are determined from a fit to the
differential elastic cross section using the optical theorem and different
parameterizations of the $t$-dependence. The results for
$\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}$ and $\rho$ are \begin{equation*}

$\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}$ is dominated by the luminosity measurement, and in
$\rho$ by imperfect knowledge of the detector alignment and by modelling of the

chunks of knowledge and reuse them in novel combinations for solving different
problems. Learning such compositional structures has been a challenge for
artificial systems, due to the underlying combinatorial search. To date,
research into compositional learning has largely proceeded separately from work
on lifelong or continual learning. This dissertation integrated these two lines
of work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of
functionally compositional structures. The framework separates the learning
into two stages: learning how to combine existing components to assimilate a
novel problem, and learning how to adapt the existing components to accommodate
the new problem. This separation explicitly handles the trade-off between
stability and flexibility. This dissertation instantiated the framework into
various supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Supervised
learning evaluations found that 1) compositional models improve lifelong
learning of diverse tasks, 2) the multi-stage process permits lifelong learning
of compositional knowledge, and 3) the components learned by the framework
represent self-contained and reusable functions. Similar RL evaluations
demonstrated that 1) algorithms under the framework accelerate the discovery of
high-performing policies, and 2) these algorithms retain or improve performance
on previously learned tasks. The dissertation extended one lifelong
compositional RL algorithm to the nonstationary setting, where the task
distribution varies over time, and found that modularity permits individually
tracking changes to different elements in the environment. The final
contribution of this dissertation was a new benchmark for compositional RL,
which exposed that existing methods struggle to discover the compositional
properties of the environment.

the class feature that generalizes to any environmental changes in testing. To
impose them on learning, for equivariance, we demonstrate that any

privacy-sensitive information of their training data. Thus, in this work, we
aim to answer the following questions: ""Can we effectively recover private

information which can discriminate the private training distribution from other

the ground true prediction of the targeted recovery instance, SecretGen does
not require such prior knowledge, making it more practical. We conduct
extensive experiments on different datasets under diverse scenarios to compare
SecretGen with other baselines and provide a systematic benchmark to better
understand the impact of different auxiliary information and optimization
operations. We show that without prior knowledge about true class prediction,
SecretGen is able to recover private data with similar performance compared
with the ones that leverage such prior knowledge. If the prior knowledge is
given, SecretGen will significantly outperform baseline methods. We also
propose several quantitative metrics to further quantify the privacy

In the presented study, we implemented a multimodal human-robot interaction
(HRI) scenario, in which a simulated robot communicates with its human partner
through speech and gestures. The robot announces its intention verbally and
selects the appropriate action using pointing gestures. The human partner, in
turn, evaluates whether the robot's verbal announcement (intention) matches the
action (pointing gesture) chosen by the robot. For cases where the verbal
announcement of the robot does not match the corresponding action choice of the
robot, we expect error-related potentials (ErrPs) in the human
electroencephalogram (EEG). These intrinsic evaluations of robot actions by
humans, evident in the EEG, were recorded in real time, continuously segmented
online and classified asynchronously. For feature selection, we propose an
approach that allows the combinations of forward and backward sliding windows
to train a classifier. We achieved an average classification performance of 91%
across 9 subjects. As expected, we also observed a relatively high variability
between the subjects. In the future, the proposed feature selection approach
will be extended to allow for customization of feature selection. To this end,
the best combinations of forward and backward sliding windows will be
automatically selected to account for inter-subject variability in
classification performance. In addition, we plan to use the intrinsic human

  solids","29 pages, 10 figures including the supplementary information",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft physics.data-an physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuum mechanics describes compressive failure as a standard bifurcation
in the response of a material to an increasing load: damage, which initially
grows uniformly in the material, localizes within a thin band at failure. Yet,
experiments recording the acoustic activity preceding localization evidence
power-law distributed failure precursors of increasing size, suggesting that
compressive failure is a critical phenomenon. We examine here this apparent
contradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and
its evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D cellular
solids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is
adequately described by a non-stationary depinning equation derived from damage
mechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description,
precursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the
material's disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following
individual damage events. Yet, the divergence of their characteristic size
close to failure, which we observe in our experiments, is not the signature of
a transition towards criticality. Instead, the system remains at a fixed
distance to the critical point at all stages of the damage evolution. The
divergence results from the progressive loss of stability of the material as it
is driven towards localization. Thus, our study shows that compressive failure
is a standard bifurcation for which the material disorder plays a marginal
role. It also shows that precursory activity constitute by-products of the
evolution towards localization and can serve to build a predictive method to
assess the residual lifetime of structures.

Here, we demonstrate that doublon-holon fluctuations in systems with

study the half-filled attractive bilayer Hubbard model on the square lattice
using dynamical mean-field theory. The band structure of the noninteracting
system contains a wide band formed by bonding orbitals and a narrow band formed
by antibonding orbitals, with bandwidths tunable by the inter-layer hopping.
The shrinking of the narrow band can lead to a substantial increase in the
superconducting order parameter and phase stiffness in the wide band. At the
same time, the coupling to the wide band allows the narrow band to remain
superconducting -- and to reach the largest order parameter -- in the flat band
limit. We develop an anomalous worm sampling method to study superconductivity
in the limit of vanishing effective hopping. By analyzing the histogram of the
local eigenstates, we clarify how the interplay between different interaction

the method adaptively increase the orthogonality of the clusters by applying a

iteratively increases the spectral gap and refines the orthogonality of the
data to achieve a clustering with high specificity. By using the diffusion map
framework and representing the relation between data points using transition
probabilities, the method is robust with respect to both the underlying
distance, noise in the data and random initialization. We prove that the method
converges globally to a unique fixpoint for certain parameter values. We also
propose a related approach where the transition probabilities in the Markov

generates a minimizer to a nonconvex optimization problem. We apply the method

Here we investigate the contribution of interspur interactions (interactions
between radiolytic species of individual particle tracks) to overall
radiochemical interactions as a function of irradiation parameters, and suggest
an increase in interspur interaction as a potential mechanism for tissue
sparing in FLASH radiation therapy. We construct a model that analytically
represents the spatiotemporal distribution of spurs in a target volume as a
function of irradiation parameters (e.g. dose, dose rate, linear energy
transfer), and quantifies the effect of interspur interactions on the ongoing
radiochemistry. Spurs evolve under a simplified reaction-diffusion equation
with parameters based on Monte Carlo simulations, and interspur interaction is
quantified by calculating the expected values of interspur overlap in the
target.
  The model demonstrates that for any set of irradiation parameters, a minimum
critical dose and dose rate are necessary to induce significant interspur
interaction, and that interspur interactions correlate negatively with beam
linear energy transfer at a fixed dose. The model suggests optimal beam
parameters, including dose, dose rate, linear energy transfer, and pulse
structure, to maximize interspur interactions. Depending on the rate of radical
scavenging in the target, which limits interspur interaction, this model
predicts that the irradiation parameters necessary to elicit the FLASH effect
may coincide with an onset of significant interspur interactions, suggesting
that interspur interaction may be the underlying mechanism of the FLASH effect.

radiative transfer equation is solved under the infinite speed of light, steady
state assumption by a transport sweep across the entire computational grid.
Since Arepo is based on an adaptive, unstructured grid, the dependency graph
induced by the sweep dependencies of the grid cells is non-trivial. In order to
solve the topological sorting problem in a distributed manner, we employ a
task-based-parallelism approach. The main advantage of the sweep method is that
the computational cost scales only with the size of the grid, and is
independent of the number of sources or the distribution of sources in the
computational domain, which is an advantage for radiative transfer in
cosmological simulations, where there are large numbers of sparsely distributed
sources. We successfully apply the code to a number of physical tests such as
the expansion of HII regions, the formation of shadows behind dense objects,
the scattering of light, as well as its behavior in the presence of periodic
boundary conditions. In addition, we measure its computational performance with

Transition1x containing 9.6 million Density Functional Theory (DFT)
calculations of forces and energies of molecular configurations on and around
reaction pathways at the wB97x/6-31G(d) level of theory. The data was generated
by running Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations with DFT on 10k reactions
while saving intermediate calculations. We train state-of-the-art equivariant
graph message-passing neural network models on Transition1x and cross-validate
on the popular ANI1x and QM9 datasets. We show that ML models cannot learn
features in transition-state regions solely by training on hitherto popular
benchmark datasets. Transition1x is a new challenging benchmark that will
provide an important step towards developing next-generation ML force fields
that also work far away from equilibrium configurations and reactive systems.

emerging non von Neumann computing paradigm. Inspired by the way human brain
functions, HDC leverages high dimensional patterns to perform learning tasks.
Compared to neural networks, HDC has shown advantages such as energy efficiency
and smaller model size, but sub-par learning capabilities in sophisticated
applications. Recently, researchers have observed when combined with neural
network components, HDC can achieve better performance than conventional HDC
models. This motivates us to explore the deeper insights behind theoretical
foundations of HDC, particularly the connection and differences with neural
networks. In this paper, we make a comparative study between HDC and neural
network to provide a different angle where HDC can be derived from an extremely
compact neural network trained upfront. Experimental results show such neural
network-derived HDC model can achieve up to 21% and 5% accuracy increase from
conventional and learning-based HDC models respectively. This paper aims to
provide more insights and shed lights on future directions for researches on
this popular emerging learning scheme.

of partial sums of order statistics to investigate the tail behaviors of
hypothetical and empirical distributions. We simulate our statistic on a set of

time stamp. Stock prices, temperature, etc are examples of time series data in
real life. Time series data are used for forecasting sales, predicting trends.
Visualization is the process of visually representing data or the relationship
between features of a data either in a two-dimensional plot or a
three-dimensional plot. Visualizing the time series data constitutes an
important part of the process for working with a time series dataset.
Visualizing the data not only helps in the modelling process but it can also be
used to identify trends and features that cause those trends. In this work, we
take a real-life time series dataset and analyse how the target feature relates
to other features of the dataset through visualization. From the work that has
been carried out, we present an effective method of visualization for time
series data which will be much useful for machine learning modelling with such
datasets.

  Predictions From User Equilibrium Models",,,,,"cs.CE physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Transportation contributes a substantial fraction of all greenhouse gas
emissions. One approach for reducing such emissions is to modify vehicles'
route choices to minimize their fuel consumption or emission, which is known as
eco-routing. Most eco-routing is based on vehicles choosing routes that
minimize their individual fuel consumption or emissions. The Braess paradox
demonstrates that when vehicles choose routes to minimize their individual
goals, the aggregate effect may paradoxically result in the opposite net effect
due to changes in congestion patterns. We construct a multiclass user
equilibrium model in which some vehicles use eco-routing and others seek to
minimize their individual travel times. Using this model, we show that the
Braess paradox exists for eco-routing. If a large number of vehicles are trying
to minimize their fuel consumption or emissions, the total fuel consumption or
emissions may increase. We then solve the multiclass user equilibrium on
publicly available city network data, and find that eco-routing results in
increases in fuel consumption and emissions on some city networks as well.

to a model in each learning phase. The goal is to learn a unified model
performant on all the classes observed so far. Given the recent popularity of
Vision Transformers (ViTs) in conventional classification settings, an
interesting question is to study their continual learning behaviour. In this
work, we develop a Debiased Dual Distilled Transformer for CIL dubbed
$\textrm{D}^3\textrm{Former}$. The proposed model leverages a hybrid nested ViT
design to ensure data efficiency and scalability to small as well as large
datasets. In contrast to a recent ViT based CIL approach, our
$\textrm{D}^3\textrm{Former}$ does not dynamically expand its architecture when
new tasks are learned and remains suitable for a large number of incremental
tasks. The improved CIL behaviour of $\textrm{D}^3\textrm{Former}$ owes to two
fundamental changes to the ViT design. First, we treat the incremental learning
as a long-tail classification problem where the majority samples from new
classes vastly outnumber the limited exemplars available for old classes. To
avoid the bias against the minority old classes, we propose to dynamically
adjust logits to emphasize on retaining the representations relevant to old
tasks. Second, we propose to preserve the configuration of spatial attention
maps as the learning progresses across tasks. This helps in reducing
catastrophic forgetting by constraining the model to retain the attention on
the most discriminative regions. $\textrm{D}^3\textrm{Former}$ obtains
favorable results on incremental versions of CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and
ImageNet datasets. Code is available at https://tinyurl.com/d3former

such as drug discovery, molecular biology, or material and process design. The
frequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships
(QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to
the properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph
neural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the
molecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes
and bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end
fashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in
QSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction
performance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field
of research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the
application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.

systems, index theory, and computational homology. These mathematical machinery
was invented initially by Henri Poincare around 1900 and developed over time to
understand shapes and dynamical systems whose structure and behavior is too
complicated to solve for analytically but can be understood via global
relationships. In particular, we show how individual neurons in a neural
network can correspond to simplexes in a simplicial complex manifold
approximation to the decision surface learned by the NN, and how these
simplexes can be used to compute topological invariants from algebraic topology
for the decision manifold with an explicit computation of homology groups by
hand in a simple case. We also show how the gradient of the probability density
function learned by the NN creates a dynamical system, which can be analyzed by
a myriad of topological tools such as Conley Index Theory, Morse Theory, and
Stable Manifolds. We solve analytically for associated the differential
equation for a trained NN with a single hidden layer of 256 Neurons applied to
the MINST digit dataset, and approximately numerically that it a sink and basin
of attraction for each of the 10 classes, but the sinks and strong attracting
manifolds lie in regions not corresponding to images of actual digits. Index
theory implies the existence of saddles. Level sets of the probability
functions are 783-dimensional manifolds which can only change topology at
critical points of the dynamical system, and these changes in topology can be
investigated with Morse Theory.
