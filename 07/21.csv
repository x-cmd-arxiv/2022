kind which enumerate restricted permutations and respectively restricted
partitions, the restriction being that the first r elements must be in distinct
cycles and respectively in distinct subsets. Kim-Kim-Lee-Park constructed the
degenerate r-Stirling numbers of both kinds as degenerate versions of them. The
aim of this paper is to derive some identities and recurrence relations for the
degenerate r-Stirling numbers of the first kind and of the second kind via
boson operators. In particular, we obtain the normal ordering of a degenerate
integral power of the number operator multiplied by an integral power of the
creation boson operator in terms of boson operators where the degenerate
r-Stirling numbers of the second kind appear as the coefficients.

involving neutron stars. If the merger remnant is a millisecond magnetar
instead of a black hole, a significant proportion of the rotational energy
deposited to the emerging ejecta can produce a late-time radio brightening from
its interaction with the ambient medium. Detection of this late-time radio
emission from short GRBs can have profound implications for understanding the
physics of the progenitor. We report the radio observations of five short GRBs
- 050709, 061210, 100625A, 140903A, and 160821B using the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) at 1250, 610, and 325 MHz frequencies after $\sim$ $2 - 11$
years from the time of the burst. The GMRT observations at low frequencies are
particularly important to detect the signature of merger ejecta emission at the
peak. These observations are the most delayed searches associated with some of
these GRBs for any late-time low-frequency emission. We find no evidence for
such an emission. We find that none of these GRBs are consistent with maximally
rotating magnetar with a rotational energy of $\sim 10^{53}\, {\rm ergs}$.
However, magnetars with lower rotational energies cannot be completely ruled
out. Despite the non detection, our study underscores the power of radio
observations in the search for magnetar signatures associated with short GRBs.
However, only future radio observatories may have the capabilities to either
detect these signatures or put more stringent constraints on the model.

main finding is that leveraging data from a source domain is an effective way
to mitigate shortcut learning. By promoting independence across different
factors of variation in the learned representations, networks can learn to
consider only predictive factors and ignore potential shortcut factors during

been explored in different scenarios, typically relying on the so-called
co-visibility graph. However, how to build direct rotation relationships
between two frames without overlap is still an open topic, which, if solved,
could greatly improve the accuracy of visual odometry.
  In this paper, a new minimal solution is proposed to solve relative rotation
estimation between two images without overlapping areas by exploiting a new
graph structure, which we call Extensibility Graph (E-Graph). Differently from
a co-visibility graph, high-level landmarks, including vanishing directions and
plane normals, are stored in our E-Graph, which are geometrically extensible.
Based on E-Graph, the rotation estimation problem becomes simpler and more
elegant, as it can deal with pure rotational motion and requires fewer
assumptions, e.g. Manhattan/Atlanta World, planar/vertical motion. Finally, we
embed our rotation estimation strategy into a complete camera tracking and
mapping system which obtains 6-DoF camera poses and a dense 3D mesh model.
  Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor representation. A bulk free energy of the Maier-Saupe form
with eigenvalue constraints on $\mathbf{Q}$, plus elastic terms up to cubic
order in $\mathbf{Q}$ are used to understand the effects of anisotropic
anchoring and Frank-Oseen elasticity on the morphology of nematic-isotropic
domains. Further, a volume constraint is introduced to stabilize tactoids of
any size at coexistence. We find that anisotropic anchoring results in
differences in interface thickness depending on the relative orientation of the
director at the interface, and that interfaces become biaxial for tangential
alignment when anisotropy is introduced. For negative tactoids, surface defects
induced by boundary topology become sharper with increasing elastic anisotropy.
On the other hand, by parametrically studying their energy landscape, we find
that surface defects do not represent the minimum energy configuration in
positive tactoids. Instead, the interplay between Frank-Oseen elasticity in the
bulk, and anisotropic anchoring yields semi-bipolar director configurations
with non-circular interface morphology. Finally, we find that for growing
tactoids the evolution of the director configuration is highly sensitive to the
anisotropic term included in the free energy, and that minimum energy
configurations may not be representative of kinetically obtained tactoids at
long times.

amounts of data captured in information systems, which can aid businesses in
understanding their processes better, improve workflows, or provide operational
support. By making predictions about ongoing processes, bottlenecks can be
identified and resources reallocated, as well as insights gained into the state
of a process instance (case). Traditionally, data is extracted from systems in
the form of an event log with a single identifying case notion, such as an
order id for an Order to Cash (O2C) process. However, real processes often have
multiple object types, for example, order, item, and package, so a format that
forces the use of a single case notion does not reflect the underlying
relations in the data. The Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL) format was
introduced to correctly capture this information. The state-of-the-art
predictive methods have been tailored to only traditional event logs. This
thesis shows that a prediction method utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, and Sequence to Sequence
models (Seq2seq), can be augmented with the rich data contained in OCEL.
Objects in OCEL can have attributes that are useful in predicting the next
event and timestamp, such as a priority class attribute for an object type
package indicating slower or faster processing. In the metrics of sequence
similarity of predicted remaining events and mean absolute error (MAE) of the
timestamp, the approach in this thesis matches or exceeds previous research,
depending on whether selected object attributes are useful features for the
model. Additionally, this thesis provides a web interface to predict the next
sequence of activities from user input.

for all instances are fully available, which may not be true in many real-world
applications due to the high cost of acquiring sensitive information. When
sensitive attributes are not disclosed or available, it is needed to manually
annotate a small part of the training data to mitigate bias. However, the
skewed distribution across different sensitive groups preserves the skewness of
the original dataset in the annotated subset, which leads to non-optimal bias
mitigation. To tackle this challenge, we propose Active Penalization Of
Discrimination (APOD), an interactive framework to guide the limited
annotations towards maximally eliminating the effect of algorithmic bias. The
proposed APOD integrates discrimination penalization with active instance
selection to efficiently utilize the limited annotation budget, and it is
theoretically proved to be capable of bounding the algorithmic bias. According
to the evaluation on five benchmark datasets, APOD outperforms the
state-of-the-arts baseline methods under the limited annotation budget, and
shows comparable performance to fully annotated bias mitigation, which
demonstrates that APOD could benefit real-world applications when sensitive
information is limited.

group fairness in rankings and in particular rank aggregation remains in its
infancy. Recent work introduced the concept of fair rank aggregation for
combining rankings but restricted to the case when candidates have a single
binary protected attribute, i.e., they fall into two groups only. Yet it
remains an open problem how to create a consensus ranking that represents the
preferences of all rankers while ensuring fair treatment for candidates with
multiple protected attributes such as gender, race, and nationality. In this
work, we are the first to define and solve this open Multi-attribute Fair

fairness criteria for rankings, called MANI-RANK, ensuring fair treatment of
groups defined by individual protected attributes and their intersection.
Leveraging the MANI-RANK criteria, we develop a series of algorithms that for
the first time tackle the MFCR problem. Our experimental study with a rich

approach to achieve both intersectional and protected attribute fairness while
also representing the preferences expressed through many base rankings. Our

vision, pure VT models perform poorly on tiny datasets. To address this issue,
this paper proposes the locality guidance for improving the performance of VTs
on tiny datasets. We first analyze that the local information, which is of
great importance for understanding images, is hard to be learned with limited
data due to the high flexibility and intrinsic globality of the self-attention
mechanism in VTs. To facilitate local information, we realize the locality
guidance for VTs by imitating the features of an already trained convolutional
neural network (CNN), inspired by the built-in local-to-global hierarchy of
CNN. Under our dual-task learning paradigm, the locality guidance provided by a
lightweight CNN trained on low-resolution images is adequate to accelerate the
convergence and improve the performance of VTs to a large extent. Therefore,
our locality guidance approach is very simple and efficient, and can serve as a
basic performance enhancement method for VTs on tiny datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve VTs when
training from scratch on tiny datasets and is compatible with different kinds
of VTs and datasets. For example, our proposed method can boost the performance
of various VTs on tiny datasets (e.g., 13.07% for DeiT, 8.98% for T2T and 7.85%
for PVT), and enhance even stronger baseline PVTv2 by 1.86% to 79.30%, showing

stage links the health outcomes to exposures. The first stage is based on the
Bayesian melding model, which assumes a common latent field for the
geostatistical monitors data and a high-resolution data such as satellite data.
The second stage fits a GLMM using the spatial averages of the estimated latent
field, and additional spatial and temporal random effects. Uncertainty from the
first stage is accounted for by simulating repeatedly from the posterior
predictive distribution of the latent field. A simulation study was carried out
to assess the impact of the sparsity of the data on the monitors, number of
time points, and the specification of the priors in terms of the biases, RMSEs,
and coverage probabilities of the parameters and the block-level exposure
estimates. The results show that the parameters are generally estimated
correctly but there is difficulty in estimating the latent field parameters.
The method works very well in estimating block-level exposures and the effect
of exposures on the health outcomes, which is the primary parameter of interest
for spatial epidemiologists and health policy makers, even with the use of
non-informative priors.

superconducting wires are known to cause flux noise in Superconducting Quantum
Interference Devices, providing a mechanism for decoherence in superconducting
qubits. While flux noise is well characterised experimentally, the microscopic
model underlying spin dynamics remains unknown. First-principles theories are
too computationally expensive to capture spin diffusion over large length
scales, third-principles approaches lump spin dynamics into a single
phenomenological spin-diffusion operator that is not able to describe the
quantum noise regime and connect to microscopic models and disorder scenarios.
Here we propose an intermediate ""second principles"" method to describe general
spin dissipation and flux noise in the quantum regime. It leads to the
interpretation that flux noise arises from the density of paramagnon
excitations at the edge of the wire, with paramagnon-paramagnon interactions
leading to spin diffusion, and interactions between paramagnons and other
degrees of freedom leading to spin energy relaxation. At high frequency we
obtain an upper bound for flux noise, showing that the (super)Ohmic noise
observed in experiments does not originate from interacting spin impurities. We
apply the method to Heisenberg models in two dimensional square lattices with
random distribution of vacancies and nearest-neighbour spins coupled by
constant exchange. Numerical calculations of flux noise show that it follows
the observed power law $A/\omega^{\alpha}$, with amplitude $A$ and exponent
$\alpha$ depending on temperature and inhomogeneities. These results are
compared to experiments in niobium and aluminium devices. The method
establishes a connection between flux noise experiments and microscopic
Hamiltonians identifying relevant microscopic mechanisms and guiding strategies

rest-frame optical emission line spectra of galaxies in the epoch of

(see JWST PR 2022-035). We present an analysis of the emission line properties
of these galaxies, finding that these galaxies have a high excitation (as
indicated by high ratios of [OIII]/[OII], [NeIII]/[OII]), strong
[OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, high equivalent widths, and other properties which are
typical of low-metallicity star-forming galaxies. Using the direct method we
determine oxygen abundances of $12+\log(O/H)=7.9$ in two $z=7.7$ galaxies, and
a lower metallicity of $12+\log(O/H)\approx 7.4-7.5$ in the $z=8.5$ galaxy
using different strong line methods. More accurate metallicity determinations
will require better data. With stellar masses estimated from SED fits, we find
that the three galaxies lie close to or below the $z \sim 2$ mass-metallicity
relation. Overall, these first galaxy spectra at $z \sim 8$ show a strong
resemblance of the emission lines properties of galaxies in the epoch of
reionization with those of relatively rare local analogues previously studied

becomes a dominant task in the long-range perception task of autonomous

the network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and
spatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range,
which makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient
long-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object
detector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to
the number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon
the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR)
module. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies
instance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the
issue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse
architecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR
avoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by
grouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the
large-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and
state-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD
in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset,
which has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset

  In this paper, we extend the scope of this theory by replacing varieties of

intuitively, whereas sheaves are defined on open subsets, K-sheaves are defined
on compact ones. Throughout, we consider sheaves on complete lattices rather
than spaces; this allows us to obtain point-free versions of sheaf
representations whereby spaces are replaced with frames.

nonlinear mechanical systems was found by defining topological indices via the
Poincar\'e-Hopf index. It turns out, because of the mathematical similarity,
this topological index shows a way to approach supersymmetric quantum theory
from classical mechanics. Using this mathematical similarity, we establish a
topological connection between isostatic mechanical metamaterials and
supersymmetric quantum systems, such as electrons coupled to phonons in metals
and superconductors. Firstly, we define $Q_{net}$ for an isostatic mechanical
system that counts the minimum number of zero-energy configurations. Secondly,
we write a supersymmetric Hamiltonian that describes a metal or a
superconductor interacting with anharmonic phonons. This Hamiltonian has a
Witten index, a topological invariant that captures the balance of bosonic and
fermionic zero-energy states. We are able to connect these two systems by
showing that $Q_{net}=W$ under very general conditions. Our result shows that
(1) classical metamaterials can be used to study the topology of interacting
quantum systems with aid of supersymmetry, and (2) with fine-tuning between
anharmonicity of phonons and couplings among Majorana fermions and phonons, it
is possible to realize such a supersymmetric quantum system that shares the
same topology as classical mechanical systems.

proposed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed and

non-adaptive step-sizes(constant or diminishing) to provide theoretical
convergence guarantees. Typically, the step-sizes are fine-tuned in practice to
the dataset and the learning algorithm to provide good empirical performance.
Such fine-tuning might be impractical in many learning scenarios, and it is
therefore of interest to study compressed SGD using adaptive step-sizes.
Motivated by prior work on adaptive step-size methods for SGD to train neural
networks efficiently in the uncompressed setting, we develop an adaptive
step-size method for compressed SGD. In particular, we introduce a scaling
technique for the descent step in compressed SGD, which we use to establish
order-optimal convergence rates for convex-smooth and strong convex-smooth
objectives under an interpolation condition and for non-convex objectives under
a strong growth condition. We also show through simulation examples that
without this scaling, the algorithm can fail to converge. We present
experimental results on deep neural networks for real-world datasets, and
compare the performance of our proposed algorithm with previously proposed
compressed SGD methods in literature, and demonstrate improved performance on
ResNet-18, ResNet-34 and DenseNet architectures for CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10

alternative classical hypothesis for the validation of these experiments using
the probability distribution of mixtures of coherent states sent into a lossy
interferometer; these input mixed states, which we term squashed states, have
vacuum fluctuations in one quadrature and excess fluctuations in the other. We
find that for configurations in the high photon number density regime, the
comparison of statistical correlations does not tell apart the ground truth of
the experiment (two-mode squeezed states sent into an interferometer) from our
alternative hypothesis. The Bayesian test indicates that, for all
configurations excepting Jiuzhang 1.0, the ground truth is a more likely
explanation of the experimental data than our alternative hypothesis. A similar
result is obtained for the HOG test: for all configurations of Jiuzhang 2.0,
the test indicates that the experimental samples have higher ground truth
probability than the samples obtained form our alternative distribution; for
Jiuzhang 1.0 the test is inconclusive. Our results provide a new hypothesis
that should be considered in the validation of future GBS experiments, and shed
light into the need to identify proper metrics to verify quantum advantage in
the context of GBS. They also indicate that a classical explanation of the

structure of jets in loosely defined terms such as ""sheath"" and ""spine"" based
on discussions of parsec scale properties. But, the applicability, dimension
and prominence of these features on sub-lt-yr scales has previously been
unconstrained by observation. The first direct evidence of jet structure near
the source in M\,87 is extreme limb brightening (a double-rail morphology), 0.3
- 0.6 mas from the source, that is prominent in observations with high
resolution and sensitivity. Intensity cross-cuts of these images provide three
strong, interdependent constraints on the geometry responsible for the
double-rail morphology: the rail to rail separation, the peak to trough
intensity ratio and the rail widths. Analyzing these constraints indicates that
half or more of the jet volume resides in a thick-walled, tubular, mildly
relativistic, protonic jet only $\sim 0.25$ lt-yr (or $\sim 300$ M, where M is
the central black hole mass in geometrized units) from the source. By contrast,
the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration interprets their observations with
the aid of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations that produce an
invisible (by construction) jet with a surrounding luminous, thin sheath. Yet,
it is shown that synthetic images of simulated jets are center brightened 0.3 -
0.6 mas from the source. This serious disconnection with observation occurs in
a region previously claimed in the literature to be well represented by the
simulations. The limb brightening analysis motivates a discussion of possible
simulation modifications to improve conformance with observations.

A main feature of this equation is the presence of a nonlocal double integral

derived by Toivanen (2008) in the case of the one-dimensional Kou integral. The
acquired algorithm for the two-dimensional Kou integral has optimal
computational cost: the number of basic arithmetic operations is directly
proportional to the number of spatial grid points in the semidiscretization.
For the effective discretization in time, we study seven contemporary operator
splitting schemes of the implicit-explicit (IMEX) and the alternating direction
implicit (ADI) kind. All these schemes allow for a convenient, explicit
treatment of the integral term. We analyze their (von Neumann) stability. By
ample numerical experiments for put-on-the-average option values, the actual
convergence behavior as well as the mutual performance of the seven operator

particularly for in-the-wild objects that lack 3D ground truths. In this work,
we present MeshInversion, a novel framework to improve the reconstruction by
exploiting the generative prior of a 3D GAN pre-trained for 3D textured mesh
synthesis. Reconstruction is achieved by searching for a latent space in the 3D
GAN that best resembles the target mesh in accordance with the single view
observation. Since the pre-trained GAN encapsulates rich 3D semantics in terms
of mesh geometry and texture, searching within the GAN manifold thus naturally
regularizes the realness and fidelity of the reconstruction. Importantly, such
regularization is directly applied in the 3D space, providing crucial guidance
of mesh parts that are unobserved in the 2D space. Experiments on standard
benchmarks show that our framework obtains faithful 3D reconstructions with
consistent geometry and texture across both observed and unobserved parts.
Moreover, it generalizes well to meshes that are less commonly seen, such as
the extended articulation of deformable objects. Code is released at

electroweak decay. We attempt an approach to constrain the temporal variation
of the Fermi coupling constant $G_F$. To probe it, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
light curves are being used as a source of reliable primordial nucleosynthesis
events across the redshifts. We utilized studies suggesting that in the initial
phase after the SNe Ia explosion, the electroweak decay of $^{56}Ni \rightarrow
^{56}Co \rightarrow ^{56}Fe$ is the key contributor to powering the SNe Ia
light curve. We hence used the Pan-STARRS supernovae catalog having 1169
supernovae light curves in $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ spectral filters. The
post-peak decrease in the apparent magnitude of light curves (in the rest frame
of SNe) was related to the electroweak decay rate of primordial
nucleosynthesis. Further, the decay rate relates to $G_F$. To keep the analysis
independent of the cosmological model, we used the Hubble parameter measurement
and a non-parametric statistical method, the Gaussian Process. Our study
suggests a small yet finite temporal variation of $G_F$ and puts a strong upper
bound on the present value of the fractional change in the Fermi coupling

well-characterized, there has been little examination of their ""outer edges"",
or the locations of their outermost planets. Here we present evidence that the
observed high-multiplicity Kepler systems truncate at smaller orbital periods
than can be explained by geometric and detection biases alone. To show this, we
considered the existence of hypothetical planets orbiting beyond the observed
transiting planets with properties dictated by the ""peas-in-a-pod"" patterns of
intra-system radius and period ratio uniformity. We evaluated the detectability
of these hypothetical planets using (1) a novel approach for estimating the
mutual inclination dispersion of multi-transiting systems based on transit
chord length ratios and (2) a model of transit probability and detection
efficiency that accounts for the impacts of planet multiplicity on
completeness. Under the assumption that the ""peas-in-a-pod"" patterns continue
to larger orbital separations than observed, we find that $\gtrsim35\%$ of
Kepler compact multis should possess additional detected planets beyond the
known planets, constituting a $\sim7\sigma$ discrepancy with the lack of such
detections. These results indicate that the outer ($\sim100-300$ days) regions
of compact multis experience a truncation (i.e. an ""edge-of-the-multis"") or a
significant breakdown of the ""peas-in-a-pod"" patterns, in the form of
systematically smaller radii or larger period ratios. We outline future
observations that can distinguish these possibilities, and we discuss
implications for planet formation theories.

large-scale structure evolution. Modelling the spectral features due to
emission and absorption from this very diffuse plasma poses a challenge, as
both collisional and photo-ionisation processes must be accounted for. In this
paper, we study the ionisation by photons emitted by the intra-cluster medium
in addition to the photo-ionisation by the cosmic UV/X-ray background on gas in
the vicinity of galaxy clusters. For near massive clusters such as A2029, the
ionisation parameter can no longer describe the ionisation balance uniquely.
The ionisation fractions (in particular of C IV, C V, C VI, N VII, O VI, O VII,

the cluster illumination changes the column densities for two different
orientations of the line of sight. For lines of sight passing close to the

a factor of $2.2$, C V by a factor of $3$, and Ne VIII can be boosted by a

disruptions to earth's magnetic field. The coronal holes act as sources of
solar wind that can reach the earth. Thus, coronal holes are used in physical
models for predicting the evolution of solar wind and its potential for
interfering with the earth's magnetic field. Due to inherent uncertainties in
the physical models, there is a need for a classification system that can be
used to select the physical models that best match the observed coronal holes.
  The physical model classification problem is decomposed into three
subproblems. First, he thesis develops a method for coronal hole segmentation.
Second, the thesis develops methods for matching coronal holes from different
maps. Third, based on the matching results, the thesis develops a physical map
classification system.
  A level-set segmentation method is used for detecting coronal holes that are
observed in extreme ultra-violet images (EUVI) and magnetic field images. For
validating the segmentation approach, two independent manual segmentations were
combined to produce 46 consensus maps. Overall, the level-set segmentation
approach produces significant improvements over current approaches.
  Physical map classification is based on coronal hole matching between the
physical maps and (i) the consensus maps (semi-automated), or (ii) the
segmented maps (fully-automated). Based on the matching results, the system
uses area differences,shortest distances between matched clusters, number and
areas of new and missing coronal hole clusters to classify each map. The
results indicate that the automated segmentation and classification system
performs better than individual humans.

the opportunity to probe the environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
through the torques that accretion disks induce on the binary. Within a
Bayesian framework, we study how well such environmental effects can be
measured using gravitational wave observations from the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA). We focus on the torque induced by planetary-type
migration on quasicircular inspirals, and use different prescriptions for
geometrically thin and radiatively efficient disks. We find that LISA could
detect migration for a wide range of disk viscosities and accretion rates, for
both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ disk prescriptions. For a typical EMRI with masses
$50M_\odot+10^6M_\odot$, we find that LISA could distinguish between migration
in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ disks and measure the torque amplitude with $\sim 20\%$
relative precision. Provided an accurate torque model, we also show how to turn
gravitational-wave measurements of the torque into constraints on the disk
properties. Furthermore, we show that, if an electromagnetic counterpart is
identified, the multimessenger observations of the AGN EMRI system will yield
direct measurements of the disk viscosity. Finally, we investigate the impact
of neglecting environmental effects in the analysis of the gravitational-wave
signal, finding 3$\sigma$ biases in the primary mass and spin, and showing that
ignoring such effects can lead to false detection of a deviation from general
relativity. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of gravitational
observations as probes of accretion-disk physics, accessible so far through
electromagnetic observations only.

LoBALs, an unprecedented sample size for radio matched BALQSOs given the LoTSS
sky coverage to date. BALQSOs are a radio-quiet population that show an
increase of $\times 1.50$ radio-detection fraction compared to non-BALQSOs.
LoBALs show an increase of $\times 2.22$ that of non-BALQSO quasars. We show
that this detection fraction correlates with wind-strength, reddening and
C_{IV} emission properties of BALQSOs and that these features may be connected,
although no single property can fully explain the enhanced radio detection
fraction. We create composite spectra for sub-classes of BALQSOs based on wind
strength and colour, finding differences in the absorption profiles of
radio-detected and radio-undetected sources, particularly for LoBALs. Overall,
we favour a wind-ISM interaction explanation for the increased radio-detection
fraction of BALQSOs.

fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Scalable qubit designs require
several Majorana modes localized on quantum wires networks, with braiding
operations relying on the presence of the groundstate degeneracy of the
topologically nontrivial superconducting phase. However, this degeneracy is
lifted due to the hybridization between Majorana modes localized at a finite
distance. Here, we describe a braiding protocol in a trijunction where each

lowest-energy state decreases exponentially with the number of Majorana modes

Determining properties of dust formed in and around supernovae from
observations remains challenging. This may be due to either incomplete coverage
of data in wavelength or time but also due to often inconspicuous signatures of
dust in the observed data. Aims. Here we address this challenge using modern
machine learning methods to determine the amount, composition and temperature
of dust from a large set of simulated data. We aim to determine whether such
methods are suitable to infer these properties from future observations of
supernovae. Methods. We calculate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of dusty
shells around supernovae. We develop a neural network consisting of eight fully
connected layers and an output layer with specified activation functions that
allow us to predict the dust mass, temperature and composition and their
respective uncertainties from each SED. We conduct a feature importance
analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to find the minimum set of
JWST filters required to accurately predict these properties. Results. We find
that our neural network predicts dust masses and temperatures with a
root-mean-square error (RMSE) of $\sim$ 0.12 dex and $\sim$ 38 K, respectively.
Moreover, our neural network can well distinguish between the different dust
species included in our work, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 95\%
for carbon and 99\% for silicate dust. Conclusions. Our analysis shows that the
JWST filters NIRCam F070W, F140M, F356W, F480M and MIRI F560W, F770W, F1000W,
F1130W, F1500W, F1800W are likely the most important needed to determine the
properties of dust formed in and around supernovae from future observations. We
tested this on selected optical to infrared data of SN 1987A at 615 days past
explosion and find good agreement with dust masses and temperatures inferred
with standard fitting methods in the literature.

runaway cooling of gas in the cores of galaxy clusters. However, how this
energy is transported and thermalized throughout the Intracluster Medium (ICM)
remains unclear. In recent work we showed that streaming cosmic rays (CRs)
destabilise sound waves in dilute ICM plasmas. Here we show that CR streaming
in the presence of gravity also destabilises a pressure-balanced wave. We term
this new instability the CR buoyancy instability (CRBI). In stark contrast to
standard results without CRs, the pressure-balanced mode is highly compressible
at short wavelengths due to CR streaming. Maximal growth rates are of order
$(p_c / p_g) \beta^{1/2} \omega_{\rm ff}$, where $p_c/p_g$ is the ratio of CR
pressure to thermal gas pressure, $\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic
pressure and $\omega_{\rm ff}$ is the free-fall frequency. The CRBI operates
alongside buoyancy instabilities driven by background heat fluxes, i.e. the
heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the magneto-thermal instability
(MTI). When the thermal mean free path $l_{\rm mfp}$ is $\ll$ the gas scale
height $H$, the HBI/MTI set the growth rate on large scales, while the CRBI
sets the growth rate on small scales. Conversely, when $l_{\rm mfp} \sim H$ and
$(p_c/p_g) \beta^{1/2} \gtrsim 1$, CRBI growth rates exceed HBI/MTI growth
rates even on large scales. Our results suggest that CR-driven instabilities
may be partially responsible for the sound waves/weak shocks and turbulence
observed in galaxy clusters. CR-driven instabilities generated near radio
bubbles may also play an important role redistributing AGN energy throughout
clusters.

shown that these phases play an important role in lepton number and lepton
flavour violating decays and transitions, with a striking impact for the

potential role of the heavy neutral fermions and of the new CP violating phases
in Higgs and $Z$-boson lepton flavour violating decays $H,Z\to

In order to allow for a thorough analysis, we derive the full analytical
expressions of the latter observables, taking into account the effect of the
(final state) charged lepton masses. A comprehensive exploration of lepton
flavour violating $Z$ and Higgs decays confirms that these are very sensitive
to the presence of the additional heavy neutral leptons. Moreover, the new CPV
phases have a clear impact on the decay rates, leading to both destructive and
constructive interferences. Interestingly, in the $\mu\tau$ sector, the $Z\to

has been obtained so far in the literature from standard misalignment in
post-inflationary $U(1)$ breaking scenarios or from large misalignment. The
main reason is that adiabatic fluctuations are significant at early times;
therefore, even if amplification from parametric resonance effects is moderate,
the final size of ALP fluctuations is larger in kinetic misalignment. We
compare halo mass functions and halo spectra obtained in kinetic misalignment,
large misalignment, and standard misalignment, respectively. Our analysis does
not depend on the specific model realization of the kinetic misalignment

the combination of which naturally evokes an emergent second-order topological
superconductivity in a two-dimensional subsystem spanned by screw or edge

class D, where Majorana zero modes appear around the ""corners"" of a
low-dimensional embedded subsystem, instead of those of the full crystal. A
nested domain wall theory is developed to understand the origin of these defect

distributed quantum information processors for both computing and secure
communication. Transmission between superconducting/solid-state quantum
processors necessitates transduction of individual microwave photons to optical
photons. Current approaches to transduction employ solid state links between
electrical and optical domains, facing challenges from the thermal noise added
by the strong classical pumps required for high conversion efficiency and
bandwidth. Neutral atoms are an attractive alternative transducer: they couple
strongly to optical photons in their ground states, and to
microwave/millimeter-wave photons in their Rydberg states. Nonetheless, strong
coupling of atoms to both types of photons, in a cryogenic environment to
minimize thermal noise, has yet to be achieved. Here we demonstrate
quantum-limited transduction of millimeter-wave (mmwave) photons into optical
photons using cold $^{85}$Rb atoms as the transducer. We achieve this by
coupling an ensemble of atoms simultaneously to a first-of-its-kind, optically
accessible three-dimensional superconducting resonator, and a vibration
suppressed optical cavity, in a cryogenic ($5$ K) environment. We measure an
internal conversion efficiency of $58(11)\%$, a conversion bandwidth of
$360(20)$ kHz and added thermal noise of $0.6$ photons, in agreement with a
parameter-free theory. Extensions to this technique will allow near-unity
efficiency transduction in both the mmwave and microwave regimes. More broadly,
this state-of-the-art platform opens a new field of hybrid mmwave/optical
quantum science, with prospects for operation deep in the strong coupling
regime for efficient generation of metrologically or computationally useful
entangled states and quantum simulation/computation with strong nonlocal
interactions.

Therefore, the results tend to converge to the mean of the multi-modal

key idea is to introduce a motion guidance representation, which is a compact
quantization of 2D optical flow with only four discrete motion directions.
Conditioned on the motion guidance, the blur decomposition is led to a
specific, unambiguous solution by using a novel two-stage decomposition
network. We propose a unified framework for blur decomposition, which supports
various interfaces for generating our motion guidance, including human input,
motion information from adjacent video frames, and learning from a video

that the proposed framework is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to

Therefore, we present in a companion paper (submitted) a neural network
predicting the parameter values with corresponding uncertainties of a Singular

present a newly-developed pipeline glee_auto.py to model consistently any

pipelines that require high-resolution images, glee_auto.py is optimized for
ground-based images such as those from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) or the
upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We further present
glee_tools.py, a flexible automation code for individual modeling that has no
direct decisions and assumptions implemented. Both pipelines, in addition to
our modeling network, minimize the user input time drastically and thus are
important for future modeling efforts. We apply the network to 31 real
galaxy-scale lenses of HSC and compare the results to the traditional models.
In the direct comparison, we find a very good match for the Einstein radius

ellipticity show reasonable agreement. The main discrepancies are on the
external shear as expected from our tests on mock systems. In general, our

regression for surrogate modeling and statistical learning. This article
reviews many similarities shared between kriging and GPs, but also highlights
some important differences. One is that GPs impose a process that can be used
to automate kernel/variogram inference, thus removing the human from the loop.
The GP framework also suggests a probabilistically valid means of scaling to
handle a large corpus of training data, i.e., an alternative to so-called
ordinary kriging. Finally, recent GP implementations are tailored to make the
most of modern computing architectures such as multi-core workstations and
multi-node supercomputers. We argue that such distinctions are important even
in classically geostatistical settings. To back that up, we present
out-of-sample validation exercises using two, real, large-scale borehole data
sets involved in the mining of gold and other minerals. We pit classic kriging
against the modern GPs in several variations and conclude that the latter can
more economical (fewer human and compute resources), more accurate and offer
better uncertainty quantification. We go on to show how the fully generative
modeling apparatus provided by GPs can gracefully accommodate left-censoring of

(2014)). Inspired by PAC learnability, we develop a new notion of learnability
by requiring that the algorithm must produce an accurate forecast with a
reasonable amount of data uniformly over the class of models consistent with
the part of the true specification. In addition, we assume that the monopolist
has a lexicographic preference over the payoff and the complexity cost of the
algorithm, seeking an algorithm with a minimum number of parameters subject to
PAC-guaranteeing the optimal solution (Rubinstein (1986)). We show that for the
set of demand curves with strictly decreasing uniformly Lipschitz continuous
marginal revenue curve, the optimal algorithm recursively estimates the slope
and the intercept of the linear demand curve, even if the actual demand curve
is not linear. The monopolist chooses a misspecified model to save
computational cost, while learning the true optimal decision uniformly over the
set of underspecified demand curves.

on-screen sound separation system which is capable of learning to separate
sounds and associate them with on-screen objects by looking at in-the-wild

on-screen sound separation, including the coarse resolution of spatio-temporal
attention, poor convergence of the audio separation model, limited variety in
training and evaluation data, and failure to account for the trade off between
preservation of on-screen sounds and suppression of off-screen sounds. We
provide solutions to all of these issues. Our proposed cross-modal and
self-attention network architectures capture audio-visual dependencies at a
finer resolution over time, and we also propose efficient separable variants
that are capable of scaling to longer videos without sacrificing much
performance. We also find that pre-training the separation model only on audio
greatly improves results. For training and evaluation, we collected new human
annotations of onscreen sounds from a large database of in-the-wild videos
(YFCC100M). This new dataset is more diverse and challenging. Finally, we
propose a calibration procedure that allows exact tuning of on-screen
reconstruction versus off-screen suppression, which greatly simplifies
comparing performance between models with different operating points. Overall,
our experimental results show marked improvements in on-screen separation
performance under much more general conditions than previous methods with
minimal additional computational complexity.

  Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flaky tests are defined as tests that manifest non-deterministic behaviour by
passing and failing intermittently for the same version of the code. These
tests cripple continuous integration with false alerts that waste developers'
time and break their trust in regression testing. To mitigate the effects of
flakiness, both researchers and industrial experts proposed strategies and
tools to detect and isolate flaky tests. However, flaky tests are rarely fixed
as developers struggle to localise and understand their causes. Additionally,
developers working with large codebases often need to know the sources of
non-determinism to preserve code quality, i.e., avoid introducing technical
debt linked with non-deterministic behaviour, and to avoid introducing new
flaky tests. To aid with these tasks, we propose re-targeting Fault
Localisation techniques to the flaky component localisation problem, i.e.,
pinpointing program classes that cause the non-deterministic behaviour of flaky
tests. In particular, we employ Spectrum-Based Fault Localisation (SBFL), a
coverage-based fault localisation technique commonly adopted for its simplicity
and effectiveness. We also utilise other data sources, such as change history
and static code metrics, to further improve the localisation. Our results show
that augmenting SBFL with change and code metrics ranks flaky classes in the
top-1 and top-5 suggestions, in 26% and 47% of the cases. Overall, we
successfully reduced the average number of classes inspected to locate the
first flaky class to 19% of the total number of classes covered by flaky tests.
Our results also show that localisation methods are effective in major
flakiness categories, such as concurrency and asynchronous waits, indicating
their general ability to identify flaky components.

Digraphwave -- a scalable algorithm for extracting structural node embeddings

multimodal CNN to learn from multimodal EMG-IMU data and estimate the generated
force for elbow flexion and extension, for both intra- and inter-subject

time and frequency domains) and IMU (in time domain) and aggregates them to
obtain an effective embedding for force estimation. We describe a new dataset

proposed method. The results show the robustness of our approach in comparison

data-driven prescriptive analytics to help them make informed decisions. These
prescriptive policies need to satisfy operational constraints, and proactively
eliminate rule conflicts, both of which are ubiquitous in practice. It is also
desirable for them to be simple and interpretable, so they can be easily
verified and implemented. Existing approaches from the literature center around
constructing variants of prescriptive decision trees to generate interpretable
policies. However, none of the existing methods are able to handle constraints.
In this paper, we propose a scalable method that solves the constrained
prescriptive policy generation problem. We introduce a novel path-based
mixed-integer program (MIP) formulation which identifies a (near) optimal
policy efficiently via column generation. The policy generated can be
represented as a multiway-split tree which is more interpretable and
informative than a binary-split tree due to its shorter rules. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method with extensive experiments on both synthetic and

using belief propagation (BP). The proposed filter propagates a PMB density on
the posterior of sets of trajectories through the filtering recursions over
time, where the PMB mixture (PMBM) posterior after the update step is
approximated as a PMB. The efficient PMB approximation relies on several
important theoretical contributions. First, we present a PMBM conjugate prior
on the posterior of sets of trajectories for a generalized measurement model,
in which each object generates an independent set of measurements. The PMBM
density is a conjugate prior in the sense that both the prediction and the
update steps preserve the PMBM form of the density. Second, we present a factor
graph representation of the joint posterior of the PMBM set of trajectories and
association variables for the Poisson spatial measurement model. Importantly,
leveraging the PMBM conjugacy and the factor graph formulation enables an
elegant treatment on undetected objects via a Poisson point process and
efficient inference on sets of trajectories using BP, where the approximate
marginal densities in the PMB approximation can be obtained without enumeration
of different data association hypotheses. To achieve this, we present a
particle-based implementation of the proposed filter, where smoothed trajectory
estimates, if desired, can be obtained via single-object particle smoothing
methods, and its performance for EOT with ellipsoidal shapes is evaluated in a
simulation study.

underpinnings are valid for data taken with other imaging missions and analysis

does not result in unphysical negative counts. We derive the formulae for
arbitrary confidence intervals for the source counts and show that our new

several variants of images designed to optimize different science goals for

perform classification of materials across multiple scales (from atomic to

hierarchical materials such as zeolites and semi ordered materials such as
mesophases. We first demonstrate a case study where the classification is based
on a global, structure-level representation such as space group and structural
dimensionality (e.g., bulk, 2D, clusters etc.). Using representative materials
such as polycrystals and zeolites, we next demonstrate the transferability of
our network in successfully performing local atom-level classification tasks,
such as grain boundary identification and other heterointerfaces. We also
demonstrate classification in (thermal) noisy dynamical environments using a
representative example of crystal nucleation and growth of a zeolite polymorph
from an amorphous synthesis mixture. Finally, we characterize the formation of
a binary mesophase and its phase transitions and the growth of ice,
demonstrating the performance of CEGANN in systems with thermal noise and
compositional diversity. Overall, our approach is agnostic to the material type
and allows for multiscale classification of features ranging from atomic-scale
crystal structures to heterointerfaces to microscale grain boundaries.

weakness: while effective, their lack of temporal consistency makes them

undesirable to adversaries as it may trigger security escalations. We introduce
perfect illusory attacks, a novel form of adversarial attack on sequential

We then propose the more versatile E-illusory attacks, which result in
observation transitions that are consistent with the state-transition function
of the environment and can be learned end-to-end. Compared to existing attacks,
we empirically find E-illusory attacks to be significantly harder to detect

similarly harder to detect for humans. We conclude that future work on
adversarial robustness of \mbox{(human-)AI} systems should focus on defences

problem. Compared to images of individual objects, scene images could be much
more semantically complex and abstract. Their difference mainly lies in the
level of granularity of recognition. Yet, image recognition serves as a key
pillar for the good performance of scene recognition as the knowledge attained
from object images can be used for accurate recognition of scenes. The existing
scene recognition methods only take the category label of the scene into
consideration. However, we find that the contextual information that contains
detailed local descriptions are also beneficial in allowing the scene
recognition model to be more discriminative. In this paper, we aim to improve
scene recognition using attribute and category label information encoded in
objects. Based on the complementarity of attribute and category labels, we
propose a Multi-task Attribute-Scene Recognition (MASR) network which learns a
category embedding and at the same time predicts scene attributes. Attribute
acquisition and object annotation are tedious and time consuming tasks. We
tackle the problem by proposing a partially supervised annotation strategy in
which human intervention is significantly reduced. The strategy provides a much
more cost-effective solution to real world scenarios, and requires considerably
less annotation efforts. Moreover, we re-weight the attribute predictions
considering the level of importance indicated by the object detected scores.
Using the proposed method, we efficiently annotate attribute labels for four
large-scale datasets, and systematically investigate how scene and attribute
recognition benefit from each other. The experimental results demonstrate that
MASR learns a more discriminative representation and achieves competitive
recognition performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods

CFSM learns a linear subspace with orthogonal bases in the style latent space

the pre-trained synthesis model can be guided by the FR model, making the
resulting images more beneficial for FR model training. Besides, target dataset
distributions are characterized by the learned orthogonal bases, which can be
utilized to measure the distributional similarity among face datasets. Our

network incorporates anatomical information from additional image modalities

with high visual quality while maintaining high fidelity. Experiments on a
1H-MRSI dataset acquired from 25 high-grade glioma patients indicate that our
enhancer network outperforms the adversarial networks and the baseline

detachment from epithelial binding. These motility changes occur in response to
the properties of the surrounding fluid environment, biochemical activation

explanation of flagellar beat generation that can explain motility modulation

elastic model of the flagellum exhibiting planar flagellar beats, together with
nonlocal viscous fluid dynamics. The biophysical system is parameterised
completely by four dimensionless parameter groupings. The effect of parameter
variation is explored through computational simulation, revealing beat patterns

effective way of bitwidth-adaptive quantization aware training (QAT) where
meta-learning is effectively combined with QAT by redefining meta-learning
tasks to incorporate bitwidths. After being deployed on a platform, MEBQAT
allows the (meta-)trained model to be quantized to any candidate bitwidth then
helps to conduct inference without much accuracy drop from quantization.
Moreover, with a few-shot learning scenario, MEBQAT can also adapt a model to
any bitwidth as well as any unseen target classes by adding conventional
optimization or metric-based meta-learning. We design variants of MEBQAT to
support both (1) a bitwidth-adaptive quantization scenario and (2) a new
few-shot learning scenario where both quantization bitwidths and target classes
are jointly adapted. We experimentally demonstrate their validity in multiple
QAT schemes. By comparing their performance to (bitwidth-dedicated) QAT,
existing bitwidth adaptive QAT and vanilla meta-learning, we find that merging
bitwidths into meta-learning tasks achieves a higher level of robustness.

hindered by scattering of carriers by lattice vibrations. Assessing the
intrinsic phonon-limited carrier mobility is thus of paramount importance to
identify promising candidates for next-generation devices. Here we provide a
framework to efficiently compute the drift and Hall carrier mobility of
two-dimensional materials through the Boltzmann transport equation by relying
on a Fourier-Wannier interpolation. Building on a recent formulation of
long-range contributions to dynamical matrices and phonon dispersions [Phys.
Rev. X 11, 041027 (2021)], we extend the approach to electron-phonon coupling
including the effect of dynamical dipoles and quadrupoles. We identify an
unprecedented contribution associated with the Berry connection that is crucial
to preserve the Wannier-gauge covariance of the theory. This contribution is
not specific to 2D crystals, but also concerns the 3D case, as we demonstrate
via an application to bulk SrO. We showcase our method on a wide selection of
relevant monolayers ranging from SnS2 to MoS2, graphene, BN, InSe, and
phosphorene. We also discover a non-trivial temperature evolution of the Hall
hole mobility in InSe whereby the mobility increases with temperature above 150
K due to the mexican-hat electronic structure of the InSe valence bands.
Overall, we find that dynamical quadrupoles are essential and can impact the
carrier mobility in excess of 75%.

physics, being useful from the characterization of the endpoint of black hole

weakly} isolated horizons (WIHs) as quasilocal generalizations of event
horizons is purely geometrical, and is independent of the variables used in
describing the gravitational field. Here we consider a canonical decomposition
of general relativity in terms of connection and vierbein variables starting
from a first order action. Within this approach, the information about the
existence of a (weakly) isolated horizon is obtained through a set of boundary
conditions on an internal boundary of the spacetime region under consideration.
We employ, for the self-dual action, a generalization of the Dirac algorithm
for regions with boundary. While the formalism for treating gauge theories with
boundaries is unambiguous, the choice of dynamical variables on the boundary is
not. We explore this freedom and consider different canonical formulations for
non-rotating black holes as defined by WIHs. We show that both the notion of
horizon degrees of freedom and energy associated to the horizon is not unique,
even when the descriptions might be self-consistent. This represents a
generalization of previous work on isolated horizons both in the exploration of
this freedom and in the type of horizons considered. We comment on previous

their indirect two-step counterparts (e.g., using time-difference of arrivals).
However, underwater acoustic DLOC methods require prior knowledge of the

the best of our knowledge, the first data-driven DLOC method. Inspired by
classical and contemporary optimal model-based DLOC solutions, and leveraging
the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we devise a holistic
CNN-based solution. Our method includes a specifically-tailored input

We demonstrate that our method outperforms attractive alternatives, and
asymptotically matches the performance of an oracle optimal model-based

model while keeping the training data local. Different from the horizontal FL
(HFL) setting where each client has partial data samples, vertical FL (VFL),
which allows each client to collect partial features, has attracted intensive
research efforts recently. In this paper, we identified two challenges that
state-of-the-art VFL frameworks are facing: (1) some works directly average the
learned feature embeddings and therefore might lose the unique properties of
each local feature set; (2) server needs to communicate gradients with the
clients for each training step, incurring high communication cost that leads to
rapid consumption of privacy budgets. In this paper, we aim to address the
above challenges and propose an efficient VFL with multiple linear heads (VIM)
framework, where each head corresponds to local clients by taking the separate
contribution of each client into account. In addition, we propose an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based method to solve our
optimization problem, which reduces the communication cost by allowing multiple
local updates in each step, and thus leads to better performance under
differential privacy. We consider various settings including VFL with model
splitting and without model splitting. For both settings, we carefully analyze
the differential privacy mechanism for our framework. Moreover, we show that a
byproduct of our framework is that the weights of learned linear heads reflect
the importance of local clients. We conduct extensive evaluations and show that
on four real-world datasets, VIM achieves significantly higher performance and
faster convergence compared with state-of-the-arts. We also explicitly evaluate
the importance of local clients and show that VIM enables functionalities such

the amount of flexibility needed for resolving probable distribution network
(DN) voltage and thermal congestion. A framework is required to avoid over or
under procurement of flexibility in the presence of uncertainty. To this end,
we propose a scenario-based robust chance-constrained (CC) day-ahead
flexibility needs assessment (FNA) framework. The CC level is analogous to the
risk DSO is willing to take in flexibility planning. Multi-period optimal power
flow is performed to calculate the amount of flexibility needed to avoid
network issues. Flexibility is defined in terms of nodal power ramp-up and
ramp-down and cumulative energy needs over a full day for each node. Future
uncertainties are considered as multiple scenarios generated using multivariate
Gaussian distribution and Cholesky decomposition. These scenarios are utilized
to solve the flexibility needs assessment optimal power flow (FNA-OPF) problem.
Zonal clustering of an LV feeder is performed using electrical distance as a
measure and spatial partitioning. The FNA tool calculates ramp-up and ramp-down
flexibility's power and energy requirements. Energy and power needs are often
valued differently in many energy markets. We identify the marginal value of
flexibility associated with energy and power needs separately. From numerical
results for an LV feeder, it is observed that zonal flexibility needs
assessment is more immune to uncertainty than nodal flexibility needs, making
it more useful for DSOs to evaluate day-ahead flexibility procurement. We also
propose a Pareto optimal mechanism for selecting CC level to reduce flexibility
needs while reducing DN congestion.

the size of the sound horizon $r_s^*$ while concurrently suppressing the power

one free parameter that is of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ in Planck units. We find that
the inferred value of $H_0$ can be increased, while that of $\sigma_8$ can be
decreased, both by $\approx 1\sigma$ compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case.
However, ultimately the model is disfavored by Planck and BAO data alone,
compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with a $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +6$.
When including large scale structure and supernova data $\Delta \chi^2 \approx

  Using our algorithm for Partial Set Cover as a subroutine, we give a

and H$_{2}$O. The two components strongly interact with each other via
chemistry and cloud formation. Previous works adopted sophisticated
microphysical approaches to understand the clouds. Here we show that the
observed vapor and cloud distributions on Venus can be well explained by a
semi-analytical model. Our model assumes local thermodynamical equilibrium for
water vapor but not for sulfuric acid vapor, and includes the feedback of cloud
condensation and acidity to vapor distributions. The model predicts strong
supersaturation of the H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ vapor above 60 km, consistent with our
recent cloud condensation model. The semi-analytical model is 100 times faster
than the condensation model and 1000 times faster than the microphysical
models. This allows us to quickly explore a large parameter space of the
sulfuric acid gas-cloud system. We found that the cloud mass loading in the
upper clouds has an opposite response of that in the lower clouds to the vapor
mixing ratios in the lower atmosphere. The transport of water vapor influences
the cloud acidity in all cloud layers while the transport of sulfuric acid
vapor only dominates in the lower clouds. This cloud model is fast enough to be
coupled with the climate models and chemistry models to understand the cloudy
atmospheres of Venus and Venus-like extra-solar planets.

very high magnetic fields reveals a distinct high-field regime which is
controlled by energy-scale competition. This extends the strange metal

English Wikipedia corpus. With full access to the data and to the model
parameters as they change during every step while training, we can map in
detail how the representation of gender develops, what patterns in the dataset
drive this, and how the model's internal state relates to the bias in a
downstream task (semantic textual similarity). We find that the representation
of gender is dynamic and identify different phases during training.
Furthermore, we show that gender information is represented increasingly
locally in the input embeddings of the model and that, as a consequence,
debiasing these can be effective in reducing the downstream bias. Monitoring
the training dynamics, allows us to detect an asymmetry in how the female and
male gender are represented in the input embeddings. This is important, as it
may cause naive mitigation strategies to introduce new undesirable biases. We
discuss the relevance of the findings for mitigation strategies more generally

discriminate based on protected attributes. For the commercial adoption and
massive roll-out of the deepfake detection technology, it is vital to evaluate

deepfake detectors across demographic variations such as gender and race. As
the performance differential of deepfake detectors between demographic
subgroups would impact millions of people of the deprived sub-group. This paper
aims to evaluate the fairness of the deepfake detectors across males and
females. However, existing deepfake datasets are not annotated with demographic
labels to facilitate fairness analysis. To this aim, we manually annotated
existing popular deepfake datasets with gender labels and evaluated the
performance differential of current deepfake detectors across gender. Our
analysis on the gender-labeled version of the datasets suggests (a) current
deepfake datasets have skewed distribution across gender, and (b) commonly
adopted deepfake detectors obtain unequal performance across gender with mostly
males outperforming females. Finally, we contributed a gender-balanced and
annotated deepfake dataset, GBDF, to mitigate the performance differential and
to promote research and development towards fairness-aware deep fake detectors.

complicated dynamical behaviour through border-collision bifurcations.
Mathematically these occur when a stable fixed point of a piecewise-smooth map
collides with a switching manifold as parameters are varied. The purpose of
this paper is to highlight the extreme complexity possible in the subsequent
dynamics. We perturb instances of the border-collision normal form in $n \ge 2$
dimensions for which the $n^{\rm th}$ iterate is a direct product of identical
skew tent maps that have chaotic attractors comprised of $k \ge 2$ disjoint
intervals. The resulting maps have coexisting attractors and we use Burnside's
lemma to count the number of mutually disjoint trapping regions produced by
taking unions of Cartesian products of slight enlargements of the disjoint
intervals. The attractors are shown to be chaotic by demonstrating that some
iterate of the map is piecewise-expanding. The resulting transition from a
stable fixed point to many coexisting chaotic attractors is shown to occur
throughout open subsets of parameter space and not destroyed by adding higher
order terms to the normal form, hence can be expected to arise generically in
mathematical models.

problem in which edge costs are symmetric and obey circulant symmetry. Despite
the substantial symmetry of the input, remarkably little is known about the
symmetric circulant TSP, and the complexity of the problem has been an
often-cited open question. Considerable effort has been made to understand the
case in which only edges of two lengths are allowed to have finite cost: the
two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP. In this paper, we resolve the complexity of
the two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP. To do so, we reduce two-stripe
symmetric circulant TSP to the problem of finding certain minimum-cost
Hamiltonian paths on cylindrical graphs. We then solve this Hamiltonian path
problem. Our results show that the two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP is in P.
Note that a two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP instance consists of a constant
number of inputs (including $n$, the number of cities), so that a
polynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem must run in time
polylogarithmic in $n$, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the optimization
problem cannot output the tour. We address this latter difficulty by showing
that the optimal tour must fall into one of two parameterized classes of tours,
and that we can output the class and the parameters in polynomial time. Thus we
make a substantial contribution to the set of polynomial-time solvable special
cases of the TSP, and take an important step towards resolving the complexity

$O3N2$ emission-line intensity ratios. These relations were calibrated using
oxygen abundance estimations obtained by comparing the observational
emission-line ratios of 43 LINER galaxies (taken from the MaNGA survey) and
grids of photoionization models built with the {\sc Cloudy} code assuming
post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars with different temperatures. We
found that the oxygen abundance of LINERs in our sample is in the $\rm 8.48 <~

recommend the use of the $N2$ index to estimate the oxygen abundances of

dispersion than the $O3N2$ index. In addition, the estimated metallicities are
in good agreement with those derived by extrapolating the disk oxygen abundance

opportunity for searches of charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) and other
new physics scenarios. In contrast to the $e \leftrightarrow \mu$ CLFV
transition for which very stringent limits exist, there is still a relatively
large discovery space for the $e \to \tau$ CLFV transition, potentially to be
explored by the EIC. With the latest detector design of ECCE (EIC Comprehensive
Chromodynamics Experiment) and projected integral luminosity of the EIC, we
find the $\tau$-leptons created in the DIS process $ep\to \tau X$ are expected
to be identified with high efficiency. A first ECCE simulation study,
restricted to the 3-prong $\tau$-decay mode and with limited statistics for the
Standard Model backgrounds, estimates that the EIC will be able to improve the
current exclusion limit on $e\to \tau$ CLFV by an order of magnitude.

  media: a deep learning-based study","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scattering of light in complex media scrambles optical wavefronts and breaks
the principles of conventional imaging methods. For decades, researchers have
endeavored to conquer the problem by inventing approaches such as adaptive
optics, iterative wavefront shaping, and transmission matrix measurement. That
said, imaging through/into thick scattering media remains challenging to date.
With the rapid development of computing power, deep learning has been
introduced and shown potentials to reconstruct target information through
complex media or from rough surfaces. But it also fails once coming to
optically thick media where ballistic photons become negligible. Here, instead
of treating deep learning only as an image extraction method, whose
best-selling advantage is to avoid complicate physical models, we exploit it as
a tool to explore the underlying physical principles. By adjusting the weights
of ballistic and scattered photons through a random phasemask, it is found that
although deep learning can extract images from both scattered and ballistic
light, the mechanisms are different: scattering may function as an encryption
key and decryption from scattered light is key sensitive, while extraction from
ballistic light is stable. Based on this finding, it is hypothesized and
experimentally confirmed that the foundation of the generalization capability
of trained neural networks for different diffusers can trace back to the
contribution of ballistic photons, even though their weights of photon counting
in detection are not that significant. Moreover, the study may pave an avenue
for using deep learning as a probe in exploring the unknown physical principles
in various fields.

  Heterogeneous Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) allows agents to jointly train a global model without
sharing their local data. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of local
data, it is challenging to optimize or even define fairness of the trained
global model for the agents. For instance, existing work usually considers
accuracy equity as fairness for different agents in FL, which is limited,
especially under the heterogeneous setting, since it is intuitively ""unfair"" to
enforce agents with high-quality data to achieve similar accuracy to those who
contribute low-quality data, which may discourage the agents from participating
in FL. In this work, we propose a formal FL fairness definition, fairness via
agent-awareness (FAA), which takes different contributions of heterogeneous
agents into account. Under FAA, the performance of agents with high-quality
data will not be sacrificed just due to the existence of large amounts of
agents with low-quality data. In addition, we propose a fair FL training
algorithm based on agent clustering (FOCUS) to achieve fairness in FL measured
by FAA. Theoretically, we prove the convergence and optimality of FOCUS under
mild conditions for linear and general convex loss functions with bounded
smoothness. We also prove that FOCUS always achieves higher fairness in terms
of FAA compared with standard FedAvg under both linear and general convex loss
functions. Empirically, we show that on four FL datasets, including synthetic
data, images, and texts, FOCUS achieves significantly higher fairness in terms
of FAA while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy compared with FedAvg
and state-of-the-art fair FL algorithms.

are relatively underdeveloped. We develop a new likelihood-based framework,
based on moment matching, for inference and identifiability analysis of
differential equation models that capture biological heterogeneity through
parameters that vary according to probability distributions. As our novel
method is based on an approximate likelihood function, it is highly flexible;
we demonstrate identifiability analysis using both a frequentist approach based
on profile likelihood, and a Bayesian approach based on Markov-chain Monte
Carlo. Through three case studies, we demonstrate our method by providing a
didactic guide to inference and identifiability analysis of hyperparameters
that relate to the statistical moments of model parameters from independent
observed data. Our approach has a computational cost comparable to analysis of
models that neglect heterogeneity, a significant improvement over many existing
alternatives. We demonstrate how analysis of random parameter models can aid
better understanding of the sources of heterogeneity from biological data.

Imaging is 2 or higher dimensional information communication. Conventionally,
an imaging channel comprises a lens and free spaces of its both sides. The
transfer function of each part is known; thus, the response of a conventional
imaging channel is known as well. Replacing the lens with a scattering layer,
the image can still be extracted from the detection plane. That is to say, the
scattering medium reconstructs the channel for imaging. Aided by deep learning,
we find that different from the lens there are different channels in a
scattering medium, i.e., the same scattering medium can construct different
channels to match different manners of source encoding. Moreover, we found that
without a valid channel the convolution law for a shift-invariant system, i.e.,
the output is the convolution of its point spread function (PSF) and the input
object, is broken, and information cannot be transmitted onto the detection
plane. In other words, valid channels are essential to transmit image

granular chain of dissipative grains driven by a harmonically vibrated tube.
Multiple gradual resonant modes, namely, non-resonance mode, partial-resonance
mode, and complete-resonance mode, are identified. With a fixed vibration
frequency, increased vibration acceleration leads to a one-by-one increase in
the number of grains participating in resonance, which is equal to the number
of grain-wall collisions in a vibration period. Compared with the
characteristic time of the grain-grain and the grain-wall collisions, the time
of free flight plays a dominant role in grain motion. This condition results in
the occurrence of large opening gaps between the grains and independent
grain-grain and gain-wall collisions. A general master equation that describes
the dependence of the system energy on the length of the granular chain and the
number of grain-wall collisions is established, and it is in good agreement
with the simulation results. We observe a gradual step-jump increase in system
energy when the vibration acceleration is continuously increased, which is
dedicated to an individual energy injection. Moreover, two typical phase
diagrams are discussed in the spaces of $\phi-\it{\Gamma}$ and $N-\it\Gamma$.

critical task of remote sensing and photogrammetry fields. Although recent deep
learning-based methods have achieved satisfactory performance, they have
ignored the unicity of the receptive field, which makes the ALS point cloud
classification remain challenging for the distinguishment of the areas with
complex structures and extreme scale variations. In this article, for the
objective of configuring multi-receptive field features, we propose a novel
receptive field fusion-and-stratification network (RFFS-Net). With a novel
dilated graph convolution (DGConv) and its extension annular dilated
convolution (ADConv) as basic building blocks, the receptive field fusion
process is implemented with the dilated and annular graph fusion (DAGFusion)
module, which obtains multi-receptive field feature representation through
capturing dilated and annular graphs with various receptive regions. The
stratification of the receptive fields with point sets of different resolutions
as the calculation bases is performed with Multi-level Decoders nested in
RFFS-Net and driven by the multi-level receptive field aggregation loss
(MRFALoss) to drive the network to learn in the direction of the supervision
labels with different resolutions. With receptive field
fusion-and-stratification, RFFS-Net is more adaptable to the classification of
regions with complex structures and extreme scale variations in large-scale ALS
point clouds. Evaluated on the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D dataset, our RFFS-Net
significantly outperforms the baseline approach by 5.3% on mF1 and 5.4% on
mIoU, accomplishing an overall accuracy of 82.1%, an mF1 of 71.6%, and an mIoU
of 58.2%. Furthermore, experiments on the LASDU dataset and the 2019 IEEE-GRSS
Data Fusion Contest dataset show that RFFS-Net achieves a new state-of-the-art
classification performance.

tracking and quantifying uncertainties in the long-time response of stochastic
dynamical systems using the spectral approach. The method uses a novel concept
called 'enriched stochastic flow maps' as a means to construct an evolving
finite-dimensional random function space that is both accurate and
computationally efficient in time. In this paper, we present a multi-element
version of the FSC method (the ME-FSC method for short) to tackle (mainly)
those dynamical systems that are inherently discontinuous over the probability
space. In ME-FSC, the random domain is partitioned into several elements, and
then the problem is solved separately on each random element using the FSC
method. Subsequently, results are aggregated to compute the probability moments
of interest using the law of total probability. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the ME-FSC method in dealing with discontinuities and
long-time integration of stochastic dynamical systems, four representative
numerical examples are presented in this paper, including the Van-der-Pol
oscillator problem and the Kraichnan-Orszag three-mode problem. Results show
that the ME-FSC method is capable of solving problems that have strong

further analyze plenty of trust values obtained via fuzzy trust evaluation or

present an evolutionary game based secure clustering protocol to achieve a
trade-off between security assurance and energy saving for sensor nodes when
electing for the cluster heads. A sensor node which failed to be the cluster

adversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity,
focusing on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted
much attention. However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g.,
Auto-Attack. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their
vulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the
other labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the
logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest
logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of
important samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with
cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples, we propose
switching one-vs-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to
one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We
prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times larger than

formulate a novel regularization loss suitable for distance-based classifiers,

the configuration of the stripe domains and skyrmions by using a uniaxial

strain, and the direction of the reorientated domains is determined by the
direction of the applied uniaxial strain and the type of domain walls,
including Bloch- and N\'eel- types. Furthermore, by constructing a phase
diagram, we discovered that when the uniaxial tensile strain increases, the
ferromagnetic islands undergo a continuous phase transition from a skyrmion to
multi-domains or a single domain. The competition between magnetic anisotropy
energy and stray field energy leads to the continuous phase transition and the
formation of domain patterns under the uniaxial tensile strain. Our research
provides a theoretical foundation for the development of strain-controlled

loss is evaluated at a set of scattered residual points. The distribution of
these points are highly important to the performance of PINNs. However, in the
existing studies on PINNs, only a few simple residual point sampling methods
have mainly been used. Here, we present a comprehensive study of two categories
of sampling: non-adaptive uniform sampling and adaptive nonuniform sampling. We
consider six uniform sampling, including (1) equispaced uniform grid, (2)
uniformly random sampling, (3) Latin hypercube sampling, (4) Halton sequence,
(5) Hammersley sequence, and (6) Sobol sequence. We also consider a resampling

accuracy of PINNs, we propose two new residual-based adaptive sampling methods:
residual-based adaptive distribution (RAD) and residual-based adaptive
refinement with distribution (RAR-D), which dynamically improve the
distribution of residual points based on the PDE residuals during training.
Hence, we have considered a total of 10 different sampling methods, including
six non-adaptive uniform sampling, uniform sampling with resampling, two
proposed adaptive sampling, and an existing adaptive sampling. We extensively
tested the performance of these sampling methods for four forward problems and
two inverse problems in many setups. Our numerical results presented in this

genres. MOBA games such as League of Legends have competitive environments
where players race for their rank. In most MOBA games, a player's rank is
determined by the match result (win or lose). It seems natural because of the
nature of team play, but in some sense, it is unfair because the players who
put a lot of effort lose their rank just in case of loss and some players even
get free-ride on teammates' efforts in case of a win. To reduce the
side-effects of the team-based ranking system and evaluate a player's
performance impartially, we propose a novel embedding model that converts a
player's actions into quantitative scores based on the actions' respective
contribution to the team's victory. Our model is built using a sequence-based
deep learning model with a novel loss function working on the team match. The
sequence-based deep learning model process the action sequence from the game
start to the end of a player in a team play using a GRU unit that takes a
hidden state from the previous step and the current input selectively. The loss
function is designed to help the action score to reflect the final score and
the success of the team. We showed that our model can evaluate a player's
individual performance fairly and analyze the contributions of the player's
respective actions.

traditional noisy label classification tasks due to the inter-class similarity

filtering out large-loss samples. In this paper, we explore dealing with noisy

remember noisy samples by focusing on a part of the features that can be
considered related to the noisy labels instead of learning from the whole
features that lead to the latent truth. Inspired by that, we propose a novel
Erasing Attention Consistency (EAC) method to suppress the noisy samples during
the training process automatically. Specifically, we first utilize the flip
semantic consistency of facial images to design an imbalanced framework. We
then randomly erase input images and use flip attention consistency to prevent
the model from focusing on a part of the features. EAC significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art noisy label FER methods and generalizes well to

simulations and theoretical analysis. Occurring at small length scales, the
pinch-off dynamics admits similarity solutions that can be classified into the
Stokes regime and the diffusion-dominated regime, with the latter being
recently experimentally observed in aqueous two-phase systems [Phys. Rev. Lett.
123, 134501 (2019)]. Derived by applying Onsager's variational principle, the
Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model is employed as a minimal model capable of
describing the interfacial motion driven by not only advection but also
diffusion. By analyzing the free energy dissipation mechanisms in the model, a
characteristic length scale is introduced to measure the competition between
diffusion and viscous flow in interfacial motion. This length scale is
typically of nanometer scale for systems far from the critical point, but can
approach micrometer scale for aqueous two-phase systems close to the critical
point. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model is solved by using an accurate and
efficient spectral method in a cylindrical domain with axisymmetry. Ample
numerical examples are presented to show the pinch-off processes in the Stokes
regime and the diffusion-dominated regime respectively. In particular, the
crossover between these two regimes is investigated numerically and
analytically to reveal how the scaling behaviors of similarity solutions are to
be qualitatively changed as the characteristic length scale is inevitably
accessed by the pinching neck of the interface. Discussions are also provided
for numerical examples that are performed for the breakup of long liquid
filaments and show qualitatively different phenomena in different scaling

of human mobility network resilience characterizations, however, focus mainly
on macroscopic network properties; little is known about variation in measured
resilience characteristics (i.e., the extent of impact and recovery duration)
across macroscopic, substructure (motif), and microscopic mobility scales. To
address this gap, in this study, we examine the human mobility network in eight
parishes in Louisiana (USA) impacted by the 2021 Hurricane Ida. We constructed
human mobility networks using location-based data and examined three sets of
measures: (1) macroscopic measures, such as network density, giant component
size, and modularity; (2) substructure measures, such motif distribution; and
(3) microscopic mobility measures, such as the radius of gyration and average
travel distance. To determine the extent of impact and duration of recovery,
for each measure, we established the baseline values and examined the
fluctuation of measures during the perturbation caused by Hurricane Ida. The
results reveal the variation of impact extent and recovery duration obtained
from different sets of measures at different scales. Macroscopic measures, such
as giant components, tend to recover more quickly than substructure and
microscopic measures. In fact, microscopic measures tend to recover more slowly
than measures in other scales. These findings suggest that resilience
characteristics in human mobility networks are scale-variant, and thus, a
single measure at a particular scale may not be representative of the
perturbation impacts and recovery duration in the network as a whole. These
results spotlight the need to use measures at different scales to properly
characterize resilience in human mobility networks.

with weak turbulence, dust concentration via coagulation instability overcomes
dust depletion due to radial drift, leading to the formation of multiple dust
rings. The nonlinear development of coagulation instability also accelerates

of 3D point clouds, as it is a challenging yet indispensable problem to recover
the complete shape of a 3D object from its partial observation. In this paper,
we propose a novel SeedFormer to improve the ability of detail preservation and
recovery in point cloud completion. Unlike previous methods based on a global
feature vector, we introduce a new shape representation, namely Patch Seeds,
which not only captures general structures from partial inputs but also
preserves regional information of local patterns. Then, by integrating seed
features into the generation process, we can recover faithful details for
complete point clouds in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, we devise an
Upsample Transformer by extending the transformer structure into basic
operations of point generators, which effectively incorporates spatial and
semantic relationships between neighboring points. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion
networks on several benchmark datasets. Our code is available at

and the latter is denser and richer in semantic information. Recently,
AutoAlign presents a learnable paradigm in combining these two modalities for

introduced by the global-wise attention. To solve the problem, we propose
Cross-Domain DeformCAFA module in this work. It attends to sparse learnable
sampling points for cross-modal relational modeling, which enhances the
tolerance to calibration error and greatly speeds up the feature aggregation
across different modalities. To overcome the complex GT-AUG under multi-modal

convex combination of image patches given their depth information. Moreover, by
carrying out a novel image-level dropout training scheme, our model is able to
infer in a dynamic manner. To this end, we propose AutoAlignV2, a faster and
stronger multi-modal 3D detection framework, built on top of AutoAlign.

common practice before transcoding. To this end, streaming and broadcast
platforms benefit from so-called bitrate ladders to determine the optimal
resolution for given bitrates. However, the task of determining the bitrate
ladder can usually be challenging as, on one hand, so-called fit-for-all static
ladders would waste bandwidth, and on the other hand, fully specialized ladders
are often not affordable in terms of computational complexity. In this paper,
we propose an ML-based scheme for predicting the bitrate ladder based on the
content of the video. The baseline of our solution predicts the bitrate ladder
using two constituent methods, which require no encoding passes. To further
enhance the performance of the constituent methods, we integrate a conditional
ensemble method to aggregate their decisions, with a negligibly limited number
of encoding passes. The experiment, carried out on the optimized software
encoder implementation of the VVC standard, called VVenC, shows significant
performance improvement. When compared to static bitrate ladder, the proposed
method can offer about 13% bitrate reduction in terms of BD-BR with a
negligible additional computational overhead. Conversely, when compared to the
fully specialized bitrate ladder method, the proposed method can offer about
86% to 92% complexity reduction, at cost the of only 0.8% to 0.9% coding

pedestrian proposals, and then project them on a unit hypersphere with L2
normalization. These methods also incorporate all positive proposals, that
sufficiently overlap with the ground truth, equally to learn person

considering feature distributions degenerates the discriminative power of
person representations, and 2) positive proposals often also depict background
clutter and person overlaps, which could encode noisy features to person
representations. In this paper, we introduce OIMNet++ that addresses the

Recent works by Ipsen, Zhou, Higham, and Mary have computed SR probabilistic
error bounds for basic linear algebra kernels. For example, the inner product
SR probabilistic bound of the forward error is proportional to $\sqrt$ nu
instead of nu for the default rounding mode. To compute the bounds, these works
show that the errors accumulated in computation form a martingale. This paper
proposes an alternative framework to characterize SR errors based on the
computation of the variance. We pinpoint common error patterns in numerical
algorithms and propose a lemma that bounds their variance. For each probability

probabilistic error bound in several situations. Our method has the advantage
of providing a tight probabilistic bound for all algorithms fitting our model.
We show how the method can be applied to give SR error bounds for the inner

heterogeneous unpaired datasets undermine existing methods to extract key
features and distinguish normal from abnormal cases, resulting in inaccurate
and unstable AL-CXR. To address this problem, we propose an improved two-stage
GAN-IT involving registration and data augmentation. For the first stage, we
introduce an advanced deep-learning-based registration technique that virtually
and reasonably converts unpaired data into paired data for learning
registration maps, by sequentially utilizing linear-based global and uniform
coordinate transformation and AI-based non-linear coordinate fine-tuning. This
approach enables the independent and complex coordinate transformation of each
detailed location of the lung while recognizing the entire lung structure,
thereby achieving higher registration performance with resolving inherent
artifacts caused by unpaired conditions. For the second stage, we apply data
augmentation to diversify anomaly locations by swapping the left and right lung
regions on the uniform registered frames, further improving the performance by
alleviating imbalance in data distribution showing left and right lung lesions.
The proposed method is model agnostic and shows consistent AL-CXR performance
improvement in representative AI models. Therefore, we believe GAN-IT for
AL-CXR can be clinically implemented by using our basis framework, even if
learning data are scarce or difficult for the pixel-level disease annotation.

weighted sum to obtain multiple architectures with different complexities. This
study aims at reducing the search cost associated with finding multiple
architectures. The proposed method uses multiple distributions to generate
architectures with different complexities and updates each distribution using
the samples obtained from multiple distributions based on importance sampling.
The proposed method allows us to obtain multiple architectures with different
complexities in a single architecture search, resulting in reducing the search
cost. The proposed method is applied to the architecture search of
convolutional neural networks on the CIAFR-10 and ImageNet datasets.
Consequently, compared with baseline methods, the proposed method finds
multiple architectures with varying complexities while requiring less
computational effort.

training and deploying deep models under real-world and large-scale scenarios,
which requires a collection of multiple AI functions. UFO aims to benefit each
single task with a large-scale pretraining on all tasks. Compared with the well
known foundation model, UFO has two different points of emphasis, i.e.,
relatively smaller model size and NO adaptation cost: 1) UFO squeezes a wide
range of tasks into a moderate-sized unified model in a multi-task learning
manner and further trims the model size when transferred to down-stream tasks.
2) UFO does not emphasize transfer to novel tasks. Instead, it aims to make the
trimmed model dedicated for one or more already-seen task. With these two
characteristics, UFO provides great convenience for flexible deployment, while
maintaining the benefits of large-scale pretraining. A key merit of UFO is that
the trimming process not only reduces the model size and inference consumption,
but also even improves the accuracy on certain tasks. Specifically, UFO
considers the multi-task training and brings two-fold impact on the unified
model: some closely related tasks have mutual benefits, while some tasks have
conflicts against each other. UFO manages to reduce the conflicts and to
preserve the mutual benefits through a novel Network Architecture Search (NAS)
method. Experiments on a wide range of deep representation learning tasks
(i.e., face recognition, person re-identification, vehicle re-identification
and product retrieval) show that the model trimmed from UFO achieves higher
accuracy than its single-task-trained counterpart and yet has smaller model
size, validating the concept of UFO. Besides, UFO also supported the release of
17 billion parameters computer vision (CV) foundation model which is the
largest CV model in the industry.

Quantization is one of the promising approaches to solve this problem. However,
existing methods fail to quantize SR models with a bit-width lower than 8 bits,
suffering from severe accuracy loss due to fixed bit-width quantization applied
everywhere. In this work, to achieve high average bit-reduction with less
accuracy loss, we propose a novel Content-Aware Dynamic Quantization (CADyQ)
method for SR networks that allocates optimal bits to local regions and layers
adaptively based on the local contents of an input image. To this end, a
trainable bit selector module is introduced to determine the proper bit-width
and quantization level for each layer and a given local image patch. This
module is governed by the quantization sensitivity that is estimated by using
both the average magnitude of image gradient of the patch and the standard
deviation of the input feature of the layer. The proposed quantization pipeline
has been tested on various SR networks and evaluated on several standard
benchmarks extensively. Significant reduction in computational complexity and
the elevated restoration accuracy clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed CADyQ framework for SR. Codes are available at

uniformly responds to the spin-orbit torque. This assumption breaks down when
the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer is comparable to the dynamic exchange
coupling length, which can be as short as a few nanometers in certain

nonuniform contribution of each magnetic sublayer to the magnetoresistance or
the Kerr effect may impact the accuracy in the extrapolation of spin-orbit

use numerical models to investigate such an impact in three different
techniques: the magneto-optic-Kerr-effect method, the second-harmonic method

self-ensembles is used to identify incorrectly labeled samples. In parallel,
our method generates multi-view predictions by transforming an input data into
various forms and considers their agreement to identify incorrectly labeled
samples. By combining the aforementioned metrics, we present the proposed {\it
self-ensemble-based robust training} (SRT) method, which can filter the samples
with noisy labels to reduce their influence on training. Experiments on
widely-used public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a

processes in EIC, which has a large cross section and a simple final state. Due
to the gluonic nature of the exchange Pomeron, this process can be related to
the gluon distributions in the nucleus. The momentum transfer dependence of
this process is sensitive to the interaction sites, which provides a powerful
tool to probe the spatial distribution of gluons in the nucleus. Recently the
problem of the origin of hadron mass has received lots of attention in
determining the anomaly contribution $M_{a}$. The trace anomaly is sensitive to
the gluon condensate, and exclusive production of quarkonia such as J/$\psi$
and $\Upsilon$ can serve as a sensitive probe to constrain it. In this paper,
we present the performance of the ECCE detector for exclusive J/$\psi$
detection and the capability of this process to investigate the above physics
opportunities with ECCE.

difficult for consumers to access its benefits like applications in
post-capture focus and aperture control. Learning-based techniques which solve
the ill-posed problem of LF reconstruction from sparse (1, 2 or 4) views have
significantly reduced the requirement for complex hardware. LF video
reconstruction from sparse views poses a special challenge as acquiring
ground-truth for training these models is hard. Hence, we propose a
self-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from
monocular videos. We use self-supervised geometric, photometric and temporal
consistency constraints inspired from a recent self-supervised technique for LF
video reconstruction from stereo video. Additionally, we propose three key
techniques that are relevant to our monocular video input. We propose an
explicit disocclusion handling technique that encourages the network to inpaint
disoccluded regions in a LF frame, using information from adjacent input
temporal frames. This is crucial for a self-supervised technique as a single
input frame does not contain any information about the disoccluded regions. We
also propose an adaptive low-rank representation that provides a significant
boost in performance by tailoring the representation to each input scene.
Finally, we also propose a novel refinement block that is able to exploit the
available LF image data using supervised learning to further refine the
reconstruction quality. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates
the significance of each of the proposed building blocks and also the superior
results compared to previous state-of-the-art monocular LF reconstruction
techniques. We further validate our algorithm by reconstructing LF videos from
monocular videos acquired using a commercial GoPro camera.

has been a surge of interest in solving partial differential equations with
deep learning-based methods, and the integration with domain decomposition
strategies has attracted considerable attention owing to its enhanced
representation and parallelization capacities of the network solution. While
there are already several works that substitute the subproblem solver with
neural networks for overlapping Schwarz methods, the non-overlapping
counterpart has not been extensively explored because of the inaccurate flux
estimation at interface that would propagate errors to neighbouring subdomains
and eventually hinder the convergence of outer iterations. In this study, a
novel learning approach for solving elliptic boundary value problems, i.e., the
compensated deep Ritz method using neural network extension operators, is
proposed to enable reliable flux transmission across subdomain interfaces,
thereby allowing us to construct effective learning algorithms for realizing
non-overlapping domain decomposition methods (DDMs) in the presence of
erroneous interface conditions. Numerical experiments on a variety of elliptic
problems, including regular and irregular interfaces, low and high dimensions,
two and four subdomains, and smooth and high-contrast coefficients are carried

made by using a symmetry adapted basis set combining electronic (spin and

accurate {\it ab initio} calculations are performed separately for reactants

variations within the ISM. Using the PHANGS-MUSE large program, we develop and
apply a new technique to model the strong emission lines arising from HII
regions in 19 nearby spiral galaxies at ~50 pc resolution and infer electron
temperatures for the nebulae. Methods: Due to the charge-exchange coupling of
the ionization fraction of the atomic oxygen to that of hydrogen, the
emissivity of the observed [OI]6300/Ha line ratio can be modeled as a function
of gas phase oxygen abundance (O/H), ionization fraction (f_ion) and electron
temperature (T_e). We measure (O/H) using a strong line metallicity
calibration, and identify a correlation between f_ion and
[SIII]9069/[SII]6716,6730, tracing ionization parameter variations. Results: We
solve for T_e, and test the method by reproducing direct measurements of
T_e([NII]5755) based on auroral line detections to within ~600 K. We apply this
charge-exchange method of calculating T_e to 4,129 HII regions across 19
PHANGS-MUSE galaxies. We uncover radial temperature gradients, increased
homogeneity on small scales, and azimuthal temperature variations in the disks
that correspond to established abundance patterns. This new technique for
measuring electron temperatures leverages the growing availability of optical
integral field unit spectroscopic maps across galaxy samples, increasing the
statistics available compared to direct auroral line detections.

design UAV flight trajectories, UAV-node communication associations, and uplink
power control to effectively utilize the harvested energy and manage co-channel

nodes, the design goal is to maximize the worst user rate. The joint design
problem is highly non-convex and requires causal (future) knowledge of the
instantaneous energy state information (ESI) and channel state information
(CSI), which are difficult to predict in reality. To overcome these challenges,
we propose an offline method based on convex optimization that only utilizes
the average ESI and CSI. The problem is solved by three convex subproblems with
successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternative optimization. We further
design an online convex-assisted reinforcement learning (CARL) method to
improve the system performance based on real-time environmental information. An
idea of multi-UAV regulated flight corridors, based on the optimal offline UAV
trajectories, is proposed to avoid unnecessary flight exploration by UAVs and
enables us to improve the learning efficiency and system performance, as
compared with the conventional reinforcement learning (RL) method. Computer

opportunity to change the type of security in which the collateral is
deposited. Due to non-zero collateral basis spreads, this optionality
significantly impacts asset valuation. Because of the complexity of valuing the
option, many practitioners resort to deterministic assumptions on the
collateral rates. In this article, we focus on a valuation model of the
collateral choice option based on stochastic dynamics. Intrinsic differences in
the resulting collateral choice option valuation and its implications for
collateral management are presented. We obtain sensitivities of the collateral
choice option price under both the deterministic and the stochastic model, and
we show that the stochastic model attributes risks to all involved collateral
currencies. Besides an inability to capture volatility effects, the
deterministic model exhibits a digital structure in which only the
cheapest-to-deliver currency influences the valuation at a given time. We
further consider hedging an asset with the collateral choice option by a
portfolio of domestic and foreign zero-coupon bonds that do not carry the
collateral choice option. We propose static hedging strategies based on the
crossing times of the deterministic model and based on variance-minimization
under the stochastic model. We show how the weights of this model can be
explicitly determined with the semi-analytical common factor approach and we
show in numerical experiments that this strategy offers good hedging

production optimization are performed multiple times over the life of an asset,
can provide significant improvement in the specified objective. These
procedures are computationally expensive due to the large number of flow
simulations required for data assimilation and optimization. Existing CLRM
procedures are applied asset by asset, without utilizing information that could
be useful over a range assets. Here, we develop a CLRM framework for multiple
assets with varying numbers of wells. We use deep reinforcement learning to
train a single global control policy that is applicable for all assets
considered. The new framework is an extension of a recently introduced control
policy methodology for individual assets. Embedding layers are incorporated
into the representation to handle the different numbers of decision variables
that arise for the different assets. Because the global control policy learns a
unified representation of useful features from multiple assets, it is less
expensive to construct than asset-by-asset training (we observe about 3x
speedup in our examples). The production optimization problem includes a
relative-change constraint on the well settings, which renders the results
suitable for practical use. We apply the multi-asset CLRM framework to 2D and
3D water-flooding examples. In both cases, four assets with different well
counts, well configurations, and geostatistical descriptions are considered.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the global control policy provides
objective function values, for both the 2D and 3D cases, that are nearly
identical to those from control policies trained individually for each asset.
This promising finding suggests that multi-asset CLRM may indeed represent a
viable practical strategy.

in dark matter detection. Generally we estimate the halo profile using a
kinematical equation of dSphs but the halo profile has a large uncertainty
because we have only a limited number of kinematical dataset. In this paper, we
utilize cosmological models of dark matter subhalos to obtain better
constraints on halo profile of dSphs. The constraints are realized as two
cosmological priors: satellite prior, based on a semi-analytic model of the
accretion history of subhalos and their tidal stripping effect, and
stellar-to-halo mass relation prior, which estimates halo mass of a galaxy from
its stellar mass using empirical correlations. In addition, we adopt a radial
dependent likelihood function by considering velocity dispersion profile, which
allows us to mitigate the parameter degeneracy in the previous analysis using a
radial independent likelihood function with averaged dispersion. Using these
priors, we estimate the squared dark matter density integrated over the
region-of-interest (so-called $J$-factor) of 8 classical and 27 ultra-faint
dSphs. Our method significantly decreases the uncertainty of $J$-factors (upto
about $20\%$) compared to the previous radial independent analysis. We confirm
the model dependence of $J$-factor estimates by evaluating Bayes factors of
different model setups and find that the estimates are still stable even when
assuming different cosmological models.

growth of multimedia data on the Internet and mobile devices. Most existing

Temporal Saliency Query (TSQ) mechanism, which introduces class-specific

Specifically, we model the class-specific saliency measuring process as a
query-response task. For each category, the common pattern of it is employed as
a query and the most salient frames are responded to it. Then, the calculated
similarities are adopted as the frame saliency scores. To achieve it, we
propose a Temporal Saliency Query Network (TSQNet) that includes two
instantiations of the TSQ mechanism based on visual appearance similarities and
textual event-object relations. Afterward, cross-modality interactions are
imposed to promote the information exchange between them. Finally, we use the
class-specific saliencies of the most confident categories generated by two
modalities to perform the selection of salient frames. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving state-of-the-art

verifying the result of a computation using types, and the behavior using
effects. This paper extends an effect system for verifying temporal,
value-dependent properties on event sequences yielded by programs to the
delimited control operators shift0/reset0. While these delimited control
operators enable useful and powerful programming techniques, they hinder
reasoning about the behavior of programs because of their ability to suspend,
resume, discard, and duplicate delimited continuations. This problem is more
serious in effect systems for temporal properties because these systems must be
capable of identifying what event sequences are yielded by captured
continuations. Our key observation for achieving effective reasoning in the
presence of the delimited control operators is that their use modifies answer
effects, which are temporal effects of the continuations. Based on this
observation, we extend an effect system for temporal verification to
accommodate answer-effect modification. Allowing answer-effect modification
enables easily reasoning about traces that captured continuations yield.
Another novel feature of our effect system is the support for dependently-typed
continuations, which allows us to reason about programs more precisely. We
prove soundness of the effect system for finite event sequences via type safety
and that for infinite event sequences using a logical relation.

reference frames as possible. Existing flow-based propagation methods split the
video synthesis process into multiple steps: flow completion -> pixel
propagation -> synthesis. However, there is a significant drawback that the
errors in each step continue to accumulate and amplify in the next step. To
this end, we propose an Error Compensation Framework for Flow-guided Video
Inpainting (ECFVI), which takes advantage of the flow-based method and offsets
its weaknesses. We address the weakness with the newly designed flow completion
module and the error compensation network that exploits the error guidance map.
Our approach greatly improves the temporal consistency and the visual quality

our proposed method with the speed up of x6, compared to the state-of-the-art

to upsampling kernels; iii) a decoder-dependent gating mechanism for enhanced
detail delineation. We first study the upsampling properties of FADE on toy

benefit from the use of pre-trained language models such as Codex, which can

to select the most appropriate solution from the multiple samples generated by
the pre-trained language models. A natural way to evaluate the quality and
correctness of a code solution is to run it against a set of test cases, but
the manual creation of such test cases is often costly and time-consuming. In
this paper, we propose a novel method, CodeT, that leverages the same
pre-trained language models to automatically generate test cases for the code

explicitly enhances the dense associations in both the inter-frame and
cross-modal manners. Firstly, we aim to build the inter-frame correlations for
all existing instances within the frames. Specifically, we compute the
inter-frame patch-wise cosine similarity to estimate the dense alignment and
then perform the inter-frame contrastive learning to map them close in feature
space. Secondly, we propose to build the fine-grained patch-word alignment to
associate each patch with certain words. Due to the lack of this kind of

cosine similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DCNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both video and image REC benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and thorough analyses to
explore the optimal model designs. Notably, our inter-frame and cross-modal
contrastive losses are plug-and-play functions and are applicable to any video
REC architectures. For example, by building on top of Co-grounding, we boost
the performance by 1.48% absolute improvement on Accu.@0.5 for VID-Sentence

unicellular to multicellular organisms. Volvocine algae are models for this
transition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas to
multicellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on
the surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in
these species is of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and
intercellular connections; steering is a consequence of the response of
individual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell organism
with a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing
illumination of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time
tuned to the rotation period of the colony around its primary axis. Here,
combining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse with 3D
tracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies
phototaxis of Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the
rotations around an axis perpendicular to the flagellar beat plane that occur
through the adaptive response to oscillating light levels as the organism
spins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar
photoresponse and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that
accurately describes the observed photoalignment. In showing that the adaptive
time scale is tuned to the organisms' rotational period across three orders of
magnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis
in green algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise
from the individual flagella of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium
and the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.

variations of the numerical value of the GW signal's post-Newtonian (PN)

detection, deviations of the signal phasing coefficients at various PN orders
are routinely measured and reported. As the search templates themselves do not
incorporate any deviations from GR, they may miss astrophysical signals
carrying a significant departure from general relativity. We present a
parametrized template-based search for exotic gravitational-wave signals beyond
General Relativity by incorporating deviations to the signal's phasing
coefficients at different post-Newtonian orders in the search templates. We
present critical aspects of the new search, such as improvements in search
volume and its effect on various parts of the parameter space. In particular,
we demonstrate a factor x2 increase in search sensitivity (at a fixed

consistent marginal improvement by adding AGs in True Positive Rate (TPR) at
0.01% False Positive Rate (FPR) and Precision at 95% TPR over the

we propose a flexible, empirical model of H I-halo relation. In this model,
while the H I mass depends primarily on the mass of host halo, there is also
secondary dependence on other halo properties. We apply our model to the
observation data of the Arecibo Fast Legacy ALFA Survey (ALFALFA), and find it
can successfully fit to the cosmic H I abundance ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$), average H
I-halo mass relation $\langle M_{\rm HI}|M_{\rm h}\rangle$, and the H I
clustering. The bestfit of the ALFALFA data rejects with high confidence level
the model with no secondary halo dependence of H I mass and the model with
secondary dependence on halo spin parameter ($\lambda$), and shows strong
dependence on halo formation time ($a_{1/2}$) and halo concentration ($c_{\rm

hydrodynamical simulations, the IllustrisTNG simulation confirms the dependence
of H I mass on secondary halo parameters. However, the IllustrisTNG results
show strong dependence on $\lambda$ and weak dependence on $c_{\rm vir}$ and

tackle these issues, we propose a differentiable integrated prediction-planning

our framework uses a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner,
which takes as input the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents given by
the neural network and optimizes the trajectory for the autonomous vehicle,
enabling all operations to be differentiable, including the cost function
weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving
dataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and
validated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing
results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across
a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing
the planning module to output trajectories close to those of human drivers. In
closed-loop testing, the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods,
showing the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness
against the distributional shift. Importantly, we find that joint training of
planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with
a separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests.
Moreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the

existence of high frequency component, which makes it difficult to obtain
high-accuracy parameter estimation. To cope with this challenge, we divide the
radar target parameter estimation into two stages equipped with different but
equivalent signal models, where the first-stage coarse estimation is used to
narrow down the search range for the next stage, and the second-stage refined
estimation is based on the Bayesian approach to avoid the convergence to a bad
local optimum of the likelihood function. Specifically, in the coarse
estimation stage, we employ a weighted root MUSIC algorithm to achieve initial

VBI (PVBI) in which only the probability of each particle is optimized and the
per-iteration computational complexity increases exponentially with the number

sampling efficiency by averaging over iterations. As such, it is shown that the

by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its
low annotation cost in real applications. Recent studies leverage the advantage
of self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active
semantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class
activation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer
neglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses
the semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization
results significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we
introduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate
WSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial
relationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a
learnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial
context intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is
designed as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during
inference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization
ability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through
optimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to

localization of the start and end moment for each action instance in a long,
untrimmed video. While vision Transformers have driven the recent advances in
video understanding, it is non-trivial to design an efficient architecture for
action detection due to the prohibitively expensive self-attentions over a long
sequence of video clips. To this end, we present an efficient hierarchical
Spatio-Temporal Pyramid Transformer (STPT) for action detection, building upon
the fact that the early self-attention layers in Transformers still focus on
local patterns. Specifically, we propose to use local window attention to
encode rich local spatio-temporal representations in the early stages while
applying global attention modules to capture long-term space-time dependencies
in the later stages. In this way, our STPT can encode both locality and
dependency with largely reduced redundancy, delivering a promising trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. For example, with only RGB input, the proposed
STPT achieves 53.6% mAP on THUMOS14, surpassing I3D+AFSD RGB model by over 10%
and performing favorably against state-of-the-art AFSD that uses additional
flow features with 31% fewer GFLOPs, which serves as an effective and efficient
end-to-end Transformer-based framework for action detection.

responsible for an array of exotic properties from morphic effects in simple
magnets to magnetodielectric coupling in multiferroic spinels and hematites.
Traditionally, a single spin-phonon coupling constant is used to characterize
how effectively the lattice can affect the spin, but it is hardly enough to
capture novel electromagnetic behaviors to the full extent. Here, we introduce
a concept of spin-phonon dispersion to project the spin moment change along the
phonon crystal momentum direction, so the entire spin change can be mapped out.
Different from the phonon dispersion, the spin-phonon dispersion has both
positive and negative frequency branches {even in the equilibrium ground
state}, which correspond to the spin enhancement and spin reduction,
respectively. Our study of bcc Fe and hcp Co reveals that the spin force
matrix, that is, the second-order spatial derivative of spin moment, is similar
to the vibrational force matrix, but its diagonal elements are smaller than the
off-diagonal ones. This leads to the distinctive spin-phonon dispersion. The
concept of spin-phonon dispersion expands the traditional Elliott-Yafet theory
in nonmagnetic materials to the entire Brillouin zone in magnetic materials,
thus opening the door to excited states in systems such as CoF$_2$ and NiO,
where a strong spin-lattice coupling is detected in the THz regime.

In particular, deep-learning practitioners have usually relied on heavily

yield to a better decision-making process. In particular, we introduce
diffusion models for three seismic applications: demultiple, denoising and

therefore key to investigating the interactions between cells and the matrix,
and to understanding tumor growth. The structural complexity and multiscale
nature of the collagen network rule out classical image analysis algorithms,
and call for specific methods. We propose an approach based on the mathematical
modelling of the collagen network, and on the identification of the model

The specific model considered accounts for both the small-scale fibrillar

solar wind models based on tomography maps of the coronal plasma density gained
from coronagraph observations, providing a novel alternative to magnetic
extrapolations. The tomographical density maps provide a direct constraint of
the coronal structure at heliocentric distances of 4 to 8Rs, thus avoiding the
need to model the complex non-radial lower corona. An empirical inverse
relationship converts densities to solar wind velocities which are used as an
inner boundary condition by the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation (HUXt) model
to give ambient solar wind velocity at Earth. The dynamic time warping (DTW)
algorithm is used to quantify the agreement between tomography/HUXt output and
in situ data. An exhaustive search method is then used to adjust the lower
boundary velocity range in order to optimize the model. Early results show up
to a 32% decrease in mean absolute error between the modelled and observed
solar wind velocities compared to that of the coupled MAS/HUXt model. The use
of density maps gained from tomography as an inner boundary constraint is thus
a valid alternative to coronal magnetic models, and offers a significant
advancement in the field given the availability of routine space-based
coronagraph observations.

second surprise in this model: if $B$ and $B(H)$ become correlated, then $Y$
will never be a semimartingale, and $H$ can be identified, regardless of its

semiparametric extensions of $Y$ with stochastic volatility in both the

of a single scalar field. The black hole is described by the Kerr-black-bounce
metric with a nearly extremal regularizing parameter $\ell=0.99r_+$. We compare
the results with a Kerr black hole evaporating under the same conditions.
Firstly, we compute the gray-body factors and show that the Kerr-black-bounce
evolves towards a non-Schwartzchild-like asymptotic state with $a_* \sim 0.47$,
differently from a Kerr black hole whose asymptotic spin would be $a_* \sim
0.555$. We show that this result depends on the combined contributions of the
differences in the gray-body factors and the surface gravity affected by the
regularizing parameter. We also discuss how the surface gravity affects the
temperature and the primary emissivity and decreases those quantities with
respect to the Kerr black hole. Consequently, the regular black hole has a
longer lifetime. Finally, we briefly comment on the possibility of
investigating the beyond-the-horizon structure of a black hole exploiting its
Hawking emission.

accompaniment to traditional methods in pathology. Significant technological
advances have developed these next generation techniques to provide rich,
spatially resolved, multidimensional chemical images. The rise of digital
pathology has significantly enhanced the synergy of these imaging modalities
with optical microscopy and immunohistochemistry, enhancing our understanding
of the biological mechanisms and progression of diseases. Techniques such as
imaging mass cytometry provide labelled multidimensional (multiplex) images of
specific components used in conjunction with digital pathology techniques.
These powerful techniques generate a wealth of high dimensional data that
create significant challenges in data analysis. Unsupervised methods such as
clustering are an attractive way to analyse these data, however, they require
the selection of parameters such as the number of clusters. Here we propose a
methodology to estimate the number of clusters in an automatic data-driven
manner using a deep sparse autoencoder to embed the data into a lower
dimensional space. We compute the density of regions in the embedded space, the
majority of which are empty, enabling the high density regions to be detected
as outliers and provide an estimate for the number of clusters. This framework
provides a fully unsupervised and data-driven method to analyse
multidimensional data. In this work we demonstrate our method using 45
multiplex imaging mass cytometry datasets. Moreover, our model is trained using
only one of the datasets and the learned embedding is applied to the remaining
44 images providing an efficient process for data analysis. Finally, we
demonstrate the high computational efficiency of our method which is two orders
of magnitude faster than estimating via computing the sum squared distances as
a function of cluster number.

well interpret the origins of these three GRBs, supported by that: (1) Their
X-ray MEs and EEs show unambiguous fall-back accretion signatures, decreasing
as $\propto{t}^{-5/3}$, which might account for their long duration. The EEs
can result from the fall-back accretion of $r$-process heating materials,
predicted to occur after NSBH mergers. (2) The beaming-corrected local event
rate density for this type of merger-origin long-duration GRBs is
$\mathcal{R}_0\sim2.4^{+2.3}_{-1.3}\,{\rm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$,
consistent with that of NS-first-born NSBH mergers. (3) Our detailed analysis
on the EE, afterglow and kilonova of the recently high-impact event

the non-eikonal effects on single inclusive particle production, contrary to
what happens in jet quenching, are only sizable, of a few percent, for modest

we find that the effects on double inclusive gluon production are larger for

lines were very broad during the initial days, which later became narrower and
sharper as the nova evolved. This is interpreted as the expanding shocked

decreased monotonically with time as $v\propto t^{-0.6}$. The physical and

question that can be addressed by precise measurements of the binary and
orbital parameters from their gravitational-wave signal. Such binaries are
expected to circularize due to the emission of gravitational waves as they
approach merger. However, depending on their formation channel, some binaries
could have a non-negligible eccentricity when entering the frequency band of
current gravitational-wave detectors. In order to measure eccentricity in an
observed gravitational-wave signal, accurate waveform models that describe
binaries in eccentric orbits are necessary. In this work we demonstrate the
efficacy of the improved TEOBResumS waveform model for eccentric coalescing
binaries with aligned spins. We first validate the model against mock signals
of aligned-spin binary black hole mergers and quantify the impact of
eccentricity on the estimation of other intrinsic binary parameters. We then
perform a fully Bayesian reanalysis of GW150914 with the eccentric waveform
model. We find (i) that the model is reliable for aligned-spin binary black
holes and (ii) that GW150914 is consistent with a non-eccentric merger although
we cannot rule out small values of initial eccentricity at a reference
frequency of $20$ Hz. Finally, we present a systematic method to measure the
eccentricity and its evolution directly from the gravitational-wave posterior
samples. Such an estimator is useful when comparing results from different
analyses as the definition of eccentricity may differ between models. Our
scheme can be applied even in the case of small eccentricities and can be
adopted straightforwardly in post-processing to allow for direct comparison
between models.

place. In this work, we mainly present the moving sample case and only discuss
very briefly the moving inertial frame case. It is the moving which mixes the

have developed a simple method for estimating volatility and price staleness in
empirical data, in order to filter out such regularity patterns from return

clustered into different groups according to some entropy measures. In
particular, we use the Kullback-Leibler distance and a novel entropy metric
capturing the co-movements between pairs of stocks. By using Monte Carlo
simulations, we are then able to identify the time periods of market
inefficiency for a group of 18 stocks. The inefficiency of the Moscow Stock
Exchange that we have detected is a signal of the possibility of devising
profitable strategies, net of transaction costs. The deviation from the

addition to the information of the compact microphone array itself, this method
does not need any precognition of the environmental parameters. Besides, the
learning-based DNN models are designed and used to improve the accuracy and
integrity of the localization results of the direct source and first-order
reflections. The direction of arrival (DOA) and time difference of arrival
(TDOA) information of the direct and reflected signals are firstly estimated
using the proposed DCNN and TD-CNN models, which have higher sensitivity and
accuracy than the conventional methods. Then the position of the sound source
is inferred by integrating the DOA, TDOA and array height using the proposed

boundaries are derived based on the geometric relation. Experimental results of
both simulations and real measurements verify the effectiveness and accuracy of

of a soft matrix embedded with particles of high remnant magnetic induction.
Since the application of an external magnetic flux induces a body couple in
HMSMs, the Cauchy stress tensor in these materials is asymmetric, in general.
Therefore, the micropolar continuum theory can be employed to capture the
deformation of these materials. On the other hand, the geometries and
structures made of HMSMs often possess small thickness compared to the overall
dimensions of the body. Accordingly, in the present contribution, a
10-parameter micropolar shell formulation to model the finite elastic
deformation of thin structures made of HMSMs and subject to magnetic stimuli is
developed. The present shell formulation allows for using three-dimensional
constitutive laws without any need for modification to apply the plane stress
assumption in thin structures. Due to the highly nonlinear nature of the
governing equations, a nonlinear finite element formulation for numerical
simulations is also developed. To circumvent locking at large distortions, an
enhanced assumed strain formulation is adopted. The performance of the
developed formulation is examined in several numerical examples. It is shown
that the proposed formulation is an effective tool for simulating the
deformation of thin bodies made of HMSMs.

biopsy is challenging. The highly heterogeneous appearance of cancer, presence

advancements in high-frequency ultrasound imaging - micro-ultrasound - have
drastically increased the capability of tissue imaging at high resolution. Our
aim is to investigate the development of a robust deep learning model
specifically for micro-ultrasound-guided prostate cancer biopsy. For the model
to be clinically adopted, a key challenge is to design a solution that can
confidently identify the cancer, while learning from coarse histopathology
measurements of biopsy samples that introduce weak labels. METHODS: We use a
dataset of micro-ultrasound images acquired from 194 patients, who underwent
prostate biopsy. We train a deep model using a co-teaching paradigm to handle
noise in labels, together with an evidential deep learning method for
uncertainty estimation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the
clinically relevant metric of accuracy vs. confidence. RESULTS: Our model
achieves a well-calibrated estimation of predictive uncertainty with area under
the curve of 88$\%$. The use of co-teaching and evidential deep learning in
combination yields significantly better uncertainty estimation than either
alone. We also provide a detailed comparison against state-of-the-art in

software systems, but they are prone to fail under conditions that are
different from the ones observed during training (out-of-distribution inputs)
or on inputs that are truly ambiguous, i.e., inputs that admit multiple classes
with nonzero probability in their ground truth labels. Recent work proposed DNN
supervisors to detect high-uncertainty inputs before their possible
misclassification leads to any harm. To test and compare the capabilities of
DNN supervisors, researchers proposed test generation techniques, to focus the
testing effort on high-uncertainty inputs that should be recognized as
anomalous by supervisors. However, existing test generators can only produce
out-of-distribution inputs. No existing model- and supervisor-independent
technique supports the generation of truly ambiguous test inputs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel way to generate ambiguous inputs to test
DNN supervisors and used it to empirically compare several existing supervisor
techniques. In particular, we propose AmbiGuess to generate ambiguous samples
for image classification problems. AmbiGuess is based on gradient-guided
sampling in the latent space of a regularized adversarial autoencoder.
Moreover, we conducted what is - to the best of our knowledge - the most
extensive comparative study of DNN supervisors, considering their capabilities
to detect 4 distinct types of high-uncertainty inputs, including truly
ambiguous ones.

Network (CNN), has received much attention. Recent work showed that ViTs are
also vulnerable to adversarial examples like CNNs. To build robust ViTs, an
intuitive way is to apply adversarial training since it has been shown as one
of the most effective ways to accomplish robust CNNs. However, one major
limitation of adversarial training is its heavy computational cost. The
self-attention mechanism adopted by ViTs is a computationally intense operation
whose expense increases quadratically with the number of input patches, making
adversarial training on ViTs even more time-consuming. In this work, we first
comprehensively study fast adversarial training on a variety of vision

relying on the specialty of self-attention, we actively remove certain patch

adversarial training. The slimmed self-attention modules accelerate the
adversarial training on ViTs significantly. With only 65\% of the fast

the neutron-to-proton ($n/p$) ratio which is controlled by the standard weak
processes in the early universe. Here, we study the effect of an extra particle
species ($\chi$) which co-annihilates with neutron, thereby potentially
changing the ($n/p$) ratio in addition to the former processes. We find a novel
interplay between the co-annihilation and the weak interaction in deciding the
($n/p$) ratio and the yield of $\chi$. At the initial stage of BBN for the
large co-annihilation strength ($G_D$) in comparison to the weak coupling
($G_F$), more neutrons are removed from the thermal bath modifying the ($n/p$)
ratio from its standard evolution. We find that the standard BBN prediction is
restored for $G_D/G_F \lesssim 10^{-1}$, while the mass of $\chi$ being much
smaller than the neutron mass. When the mass of $\chi$ is comparable to the
neutron mass, we can allow large $G_D/G_F$ values, as the thermal abundance of
$\chi$ becomes Boltzmann-suppressed. Therefore, the ($n/p$) ratio is restored
to its standard value via dominant weak processes in later epochs. We also
discuss the viability of this new particle to be a dark matter candidate.

multidimensional (MD) spectroscopy of the system in the time domain. A Fourier

fluid inside a capillary tube of varying radius under steady-state conditions.
The incompressible fluid is Newtonian and the compressible fluid is an inviscid
ideal gas. The surface tension associated with the interfaces between the two
fluids introduces capillary forces that vary along the tube due to the
variation in the tube radius. The interplay between effects due to the
capillary forces and the compressibility results in a set of properties that
are different from incompressible two-phase flow. As the fluids move towards
the outlet, the bubbles of the compressible fluid grow in volume due to the
decrease in pressure. The volumetric growth of the compressible bubbles makes
the volumetric flow rate at the outlet higher than at the inlet. The growth is
not only a function of the pressure drop across the tube, but also of the
ambient pressure. Furthermore, the capillary forces create an effective
threshold below which there is no flow. Above the threshold, the system shows a
weak non-linearity between the flow rates and the effective pressure drop,
where the non-linearity also depends on the absolute pressures across the tube.

breakdown, while in the retrograde case the forced mode continues to exist also
for higher Poincar\'e numbers. Depending largely on the occurrence and

a sensitive dependency of the self-excitation condition on the nutation angle

relax these assumptions. One in particular, the ""spatial deformation approach""
defines a transformation from the geographic space in which data are observed,
to a latent space in which stationarity and isotropy are assumed to hold.
Taking inspiration from this class of models, we develop a new model for
spatially dependent data observed on graphs. Our method implies an embedding of
the graph into Euclidean space wherein the covariance can be modeled using
traditional covariance functions such as those from the Mat\'{e}rn family. This
is done via a class of graph metrics compatible with such covariance functions.
By estimating the edge weights which underlie these metrics, we can recover the
""intrinsic distance"" between nodes of a graph. We compare our model to existing
methods for spatially dependent graph data, primarily conditional
autoregressive (CAR) models and their variants and illustrate the advantages
our approach has over traditional methods. We fit our model and competitors to

systems as an alternative to the correlation-based processing previously
adopted, e.g., in the radar-communication (RadCom) literature, which yields
high sidelobe level depending on the symbols modulated onto the orthogonal
subchirps. In this context, a mathematical formulation for the aforementioned
channel estimation approach is introduced. Additionally, extensions to
multi-user/multiple-input multiple-output and RadCom operations are proposed.
Finally, the performance of the proposed schemes is analyzed, and the presented
discussion is supported by simulation and measurement results. In summary, all
proposed OCDM-based schemes yield comparable radar sensing performance to their
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing counterpart, while achieving
improved peak-to-average power ratio and, in the RadCom case, communication
performance.

hyperspectral imaging with a focus on connecting the architecture of the

the process of measuring light reflected or emitted by a material as a function
wavelength. Molecular bonds present in the material have vibrational
frequencies which affect the amount of light measured at each wavelength. Thus
the measured spectrum contains information about the particular chemical
constituents and types of bonds. For example, chlorophyll reflects more light
in the near-IR rage (800-900nm) than in the red (625-675nm) range, and this
difference can be measured using a normalized vegetation difference index
(NDVI), which is commonly used to detect vegetation presence, health, and type
in imagery collected at these wavelengths. In this paper we show that the
weights in a Neural Network trained on different vegetation classes learn to
measure this difference in reflectance. We then show that a Neural Network
trained on a more complex set of ten different polymer materials will learn
spectral 'features' evident in the weights for the network, and these features
can be used to reliably distinguish between the different types of polymers.

by calculating the dimensionality of the absolute ground state of the classical
nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic $n$-vector model with arbitrary $n$,
describing interactions between spins that reside on the vertices of frustrated
molecules. Spins having more than three components may minimize the energy more
effectively against frustration by allowing bigger angles between
nearest-neighbors, leading to ground states in higher than three-dimensional
spin space. Platonic solids in three and four dimensions, which have equivalent
sites and consist of only one type of polygon, have lowest-energy
configurations in a number of spin dimensions equal to their real-space
dimensionality. The same is true for the Archimedean solids, which have
equivalent sites but consist of more than one type of polygon. Fullerene
molecules and geodesic icosahedra, whose sites are not equivalent, can produce
ground states in as many as five spin dimensions. It is also found that the
introduction of interactions in the next bigger dimension does not necessarily
lower the energy immediately, but it typically takes a finite coupling for this
to happen. Frustration is also characterized by the maximum value of the
ground-state energy when the exchange interactions are allowed to vary, which
reveals symmetry patterns in the magnetic behavior and that symmetry and
connectivity can play a more important role than molecular size in alleviating
frustration.

measure by a continuous generator, such as Generative Adversarial Networks

of such deep generative models. A key issue with these models is their tendency
to output samples outside of the support of the target distribution when
learning disconnected distributions. We investigate the relationship between
the performance of these models and the geometry of their latent space.
Building on recent developments in geometric measure theory, we prove a
sufficient condition for optimality in the case where the dimension of the
latent space is larger than the number of modes. Through experiments on GANs,
we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results and gain new insights
into the latent space geometry of these models. Additionally, we propose a
truncation method that enforces a simplicial cluster structure in the latent

  Solutions to the MMPHF problem are in widespread use in both theory and

  The best upper bound known for the problem encodes $DS$ in $O(n\log\log\log

to either improve the space upper bound or to show that this somewhat odd

  We achieve our lower bound by defining a graph $\mathbf{G}$ where the nodes
are the possible ${u \choose n}$ inputs and where two nodes are adjacent if
they cannot share the same $DS$. The size of $DS$ is then lower bounded by the

can be severely degenerated by the mismatch of the background of two oblique
illuminated images, yielding problematic phase recovery results. These
background mismatches may result from illumination patterns, inhomogeneous
media distribution, or other defocusing layers. In previous reports, the
background is manually calibrated which is time-consuming, and unstable, since
new calibrations are needed if any modification to the optical system was made.
It is also impossible to calibrate the background from the defocusing layers,
or for high dynamic observation as the background changes over time. To tackle
the mismatch of background and increases the experimental robustness, we
propose the Retinex-qDPC in which we use the images edge features as data
fidelity term yielding L2-Retinex-qDPC and L1-Retinex-qDPC for high
background-robustness qDPC reconstruction. The split Bregman method is used to
solve the L1-Retinex DPC. We compare both Retinex-qDPC models against
state-of-the-art DPC reconstruction algorithms including total-variation
regularized qDPC, and isotropic-qDPC using both simulated and experimental
data. Results show that the Retinex qDPC can significantly improve the phase
recovery quality by suppressing the impact of mismatch background. Within, the
L1-Retinex-qDPC is better than L2-Retinex and other state-of-the-art DPC
algorithms. In general, the Retinex-qDPC increases the experimental robustness
against background illumination without any modification of the optical system,
which will benefit all qDPC applications.

generative models to synthesize ECG data, which are beneficial to providing

disease-aware generative adversarial network for multi-view ECG synthesis
called ME-GAN, which attains panoptic electrocardio representations conditioned
on heart diseases and projects the representations onto multiple standard views
to yield ECG signals. Since ECG manifestations of heart diseases are often
localized in specific waveforms, we propose a new ""mixup normalization"" to
inject disease information precisely into suitable locations. In addition, we
propose a view discriminator to revert disordered ECG views into a
pre-determined order, supervising the generator to obtain ECG representing
correct view characteristics. Besides, a new metric, rFID, is presented to
assess the quality of the synthesized ECG signals. Comprehensive experiments
verify that our ME-GAN performs well on multi-view ECG signal synthesis with

one-third of all O&M costs thus making accurate detection of blade damages,

Traditionally, damage inspection has been a completely manual process thus
making it subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. Hence in this work, we
bring more objectivity, scalability, and repeatability in our damage inspection
process, using deep learning, to miss fewer cracks. We build a deep learning
model trained on a large dataset of blade damages, collected by our drone-based
inspection, to correctly detect cracks. Our model is already in production and
has processed more than a million damages with a recall of 0.96. We also focus
on model interpretability using class activation maps to get a peek into the
model workings. The model not only performs as good as human experts but also
better in certain tricky cases. Thus, in this work, we aim to increase wind

from an image which are likely to contain target, typically done by comparing
one or more spectra for the desired target material to each pixel in the image.
Target identification is the process of target detection incorporating an
additional process to identify more specifically the material that is present
in each pixel that scored high in detection. Detection is generally a 2-class
problem of target vs. background, and identification is a many class problem
including target, background, and additional know materials. The identification
process we present is probabilistic and hierarchical which provides
transparency to the process and produces trustworthy output. In this paper we
show that target identification has a much lower false alarm rate than
detection alone, and provide a detailed explanation of a robust identification
method using probabilistic hierarchical classification that handles the vague
categories of materials that depend on users which are different than the
specific physical categories of chemical constituents. Identification is often
done by comparing mixtures of materials including the target spectra to
mixtures of materials that do not include the target spectra, possibly with
other steps. (band combinations, feature checking, background removal, etc.)
Standard linear regression does not handle these problems well because the
number of regressors (identification spectra) is greater than the number of
feature variables (bands), and there are multiple correlated spectra. Our
proposed method handles these challenges efficiently and provides additional
important practical information in the form of hierarchical probabilities
computed from Bayesian model averaging.

different body shapes, acting styles, and habits, damaging the model's

existing domain adaptation approaches, they typically assume that the test data

fuse the domain-invariant and domain-specific representations to improve the

domain-invariant representations enhance the transferability across domains and
domain-specific representations leverage the model discrimination power from

effectiveness. Furthermore, we apply AFFAR to a real application, i.e., the
diagnosis of Children's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder~(ADHD), which

neuroscience, which argues that the cortex forms unsupervised world models by
implementing a hierarchical process of prediction error minimization. PC
networks (PCNs) are trained in two phases. First, neural activities are updated
to optimize the network's response to external stimuli. Second, synaptic
weights are updated to consolidate this change in activity -- an algorithm
called \emph{prospective configuration}. While previous work has shown how in
various limits, PCNs can be found to approximate backpropagation (BP), recent
work has demonstrated that PCNs operating in this standard regime, which does
not approximate BP, nevertheless obtain competitive training and generalization
performance to BP-trained networks while outperforming them on tasks such as
online, few-shot, and continual learning, where brains are known to excel.
Despite this promising empirical performance, little is understood
theoretically about the properties and dynamics of PCNs in this regime. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of
PCNs trained with prospective configuration. We first derive analytical results
concerning the inference equilibrium for PCNs and a previously unknown close
connection relationship to target propagation (TP). Secondly, we provide a
theoretical analysis of learning in PCNs as a variant of generalized
expectation-maximization and use that to prove the convergence of PCNs to
critical points of the BP loss function, thus showing that deep PCNs can, in
theory, achieve the same generalization performance as BP, while maintaining
their unique advantages.

Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach, where all tasks mentioned above are learned
jointly with dialog-tailored hierarchical modeling. We experiment on the DAIC
and DailyDialog corpora-both contain dialogs in English-and show important
improvements over state-ofthe-art on depression detection (at best 70.6% F 1),
which demonstrates the correlation of depression with emotion and dialog
organization and the power of MTL to leverage information from different
sources.

success, recent studies demonstrate that PrLMs are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. By generating adversarial examples with slight perturbations on
different levels (sentence / word / character), adversarial attacks can fool
PrLMs to generate incorrect predictions, which questions the robustness of
PrLMs. However, we find that most existing textual adversarial examples are
unnatural, which can be easily distinguished by both human and machine. Based
on a general anomaly detector, we propose a novel metric (Degree of Anomaly) as
a constraint to enable current adversarial attack approaches to generate more
natural and imperceptible adversarial examples. Under this new constraint, the
success rate of existing attacks drastically decreases, which reveals that the
robustness of PrLMs is not as fragile as they claimed. In addition, we find
that four types of randomization can invalidate a large portion of textual
adversarial examples. Based on anomaly detector and randomization, we design a
universal defense framework, which is among the first to perform textual
adversarial defense without knowing the specific attack. Empirical results show
that our universal defense framework achieves comparable or even higher
after-attack accuracy with other specific defenses, while preserving higher
original accuracy at the same time. Our work discloses the essence of textual
adversarial attacks, and indicates that (1) further works of adversarial
attacks should focus more on how to overcome the detection and resist the
randomization, otherwise their adversarial examples would be easily detected
and invalidated; and (2) compared with the unnatural and perceptible
adversarial examples, it is those undetectable adversarial examples that pose
real risks for PrLMs and require more attention for future robustness-enhancing
strategies.

generating Big Data on Twitter related to the sharing of information, news,
views, opinions, ideas, feedback, and experiences about the COVID-19 pandemic,
with a specific focus on the Omicron variant, which is the globally dominant
variant of SARS-CoV-2 at this time. A total of 12028 tweets about the Omicron
variant were studied, and the specific characteristics of tweets that were
analyzed include - sentiment, language, source, type, and embedded URLs. The
findings of this study are manifold. First, from sentiment analysis, it was
observed that 50.5% of tweets had a neutral emotion. The other emotions - bad,
good, terrible, and great were found in 15.6%, 14.0%, 12.5%, and 7.5% of the
tweets, respectively. Second, the findings of language interpretation showed
that 65.9% of the tweets were posted in English. It was followed by Spanish,
French, Italian, and other languages. Third, the findings from source tracking
showed that Twitter for Android was associated with 35.2% of tweets. It was
followed by Twitter Web App, Twitter for iPhone, Twitter for iPad, and other
sources. Fourth, studying the type of tweets revealed that retweets accounted
for 60.8% of the tweets, it was followed by original tweets and replies that
accounted for 19.8% and 19.4% of the tweets, respectively. Fifth, in terms of
embedded URL analysis, the most common domain embedded in the tweets was found
to be twitter.com, which was followed by biorxiv.org, nature.com, and other
domains. Finally, to support similar research in this field, we have developed
a Twitter dataset that comprises more than 500,000 tweets about the SARS-CoV-2
omicron variant since the first detected case of this variant on November 24,
2021.

  in sparse distributed data?","15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  It is generally assumed that the brain uses something akin to sparse
distributed representations. These representations, however, are
high-dimensional and consequently they affect classification performance of
traditional Machine Learning models due to ""the curse of dimensionality"". In
tasks for which there is a vast amount of labeled data, Deep Networks seem to
solve this issue with many layers and a non-Hebbian backpropagation algorithm.
The brain, however, seems to be able to solve the problem with few layers. In
this work, we hypothesize that this happens by using Hebbian learning.
Actually, the Hebbian-like learning rule of Restricted Boltzmann Machines
learns the input patterns asymmetrically. It exclusively learns the correlation
between non-zero values and ignores the zeros, which represent the vast
majority of the input dimensionality. By ignoring the zeros ""the curse of
dimensionality"" problem can be avoided. To test our hypothesis, we generated
several sparse datasets and compared the performance of a Restricted Boltzmann
Machine classifier with some Backprop-trained networks. The experiments using
these codes confirm our initial intuition as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine
shows a good generalization performance, while the Neural Networks trained with
the backpropagation algorithm overfit the training data.

a number of different gauges known for the three-dimensional electromagnetic
field. For multi-dimensional spaces of non-zero curvature the governing
equations for the multi-dimensional electromagnetic field are written in

gravity in the presence of electromagnetic field have been re-written in the

Maxwell equations in the two- and one-dimensional spaces.
