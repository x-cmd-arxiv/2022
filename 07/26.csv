  Understand What's Real?",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the classic signal-to-symbol barrier in light of the remarkable
ability of deep neural networks to generate realistic synthetic data. DeepFakes
and spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and
its abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a
biological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract
concept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but
trivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of
training data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other
hand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly
larger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite
dataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be
""understood"" by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic
gradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information
complexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no
means of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through
continuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as
abstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects
can be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical
concepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which
the ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active
perception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting
visual more than acoustic or chemical perception. Finally, we conclude that
binding physical entities to digital identities is possible in finite time with
finite resources, solving in principle the signal-to-symbol barrier problem,
but we highlight the need for continuous validation.

important role for the amount of hydrogen available to nuclear burning in
convective cores of stars. The best way to model this effect is still debated.
Aims. We suggest an improved model for the computation of the dissipation rate
of turbulent kinetic energy which can be used in non-local models of stellar
convection and can readily be implemented and self-consistently used in 1D
stellar evolution calculations. Methods. We review the physics underlying
various models to compute the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy,
{\epsilon}, in local and particularly in non-local models of convection in
stellar astrophysics. The different contributions to the dissipation rate and
their dependence on local stratification and on non-local transport are
analysed and a new method to account for at least some of these physical
mechanisms is suggested. Results. We show how the new approach influences
predictions of stellar models of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars and how
these changes differ from other modifications of the non-local convection model
that focus on the ratio of horizontal to vertical (turbulent) kinetic energy.
Conclusions. The new model is shown to allow for a physically more complete
description of convective overshooting and mixing in massive stars. Dissipation
by buoyancy waves is found to be a key ingredient which has to be accounted for
in non-local models of turbulent convection.

consider the diversity of samples in the initial dataset selection algorithm.
Also, we propose a novel active learning query strategy, which uses
diversity-based sampling on consistency-based embeddings. By considering the
consistency information with the diversity in the consistency-based embedding
scheme, the proposed method could select more informative samples for labeling

coherent drives. Our results show that the dual incoherent pumping with no
coherent drive can lead to amplification of the cavity fields with strong
inter-mode antibunching but no entanglement. Though only coherent drives with
no incoherent pumping can produce entangled photon-pairs, the entangled cavity
fields can not be amplified beyond a certain limit using only coherent drives.
However, the use of even small incoherent pumping in the presence of the
coherent drives can amplify the generated entangled photon-pairs significantly.

flow, where the plasma follows the magnetic field lines in the force-free
regime. The flow entering the magnetosphere is accelerated by the gravity of
the star and then decelerated in a shock located above its surface. For a large
mass accretion rate, most of the radiation comes from the
radiation-pressure-dominated region below the shock, known as accretion column.
Though the one-dimensional, stationary structure of this flow has been studied
for many years, its global dynamics was hardly ever considered before.
Considering the time-dependent structure of an accretion column allows us to
test the stability of the existing stationary analytic solution, as well as its
possible variability modes, and check the validity of its boundary conditions.
Using a conservative scheme, we perform one-dimensional time-dependent
simulations of an ideal radiative MHD flow inside an aligned dipolar
magnetosphere. We assume that magnetic stresses dominate the momentum balance
in general. However, along a given field line, the motion is essentially
hydrodynamic, with gravity, centrifugal force, and radiation pressure acting as
mass forces. When thermal pressure locally exceeds magnetic pressure, the flow
is assumed to lose mass. Position of the shock agrees well with the theoretical
predictions, though at higher luminosities, there is a limit set by advection
effects: if more than 2/3 of the released power is advected with the flow, the
analytic solution becomes self-inconsistent, and the column starts leaking at a
finite height. Depending on the geometry, this breakdown may broaden the
column, mass-load the field lines, and produce radiation-driven, mildly
relativistic ejecta. Approaching the equilibrium position, the shock front
experiences damped oscillations at a frequency close to the inverse sound
propagation time.

corresponding VLSI designs but properly customizing standard cell libraries
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of the VLSI designs.
This paper presents an automatic standard-cell library extension framework,
AutoCellLibX. It can find a set of standard cell cluster pattern candidates
from the post-technology mapping gate-level netlist, with the consideration of
standard cell characteristics and technology mapping constraints, based on our
high-efficiency frequent subgraph mining algorithm. Meanwhile, to maximize the
area benefit of standard cell customization for the given gate-level netlist,
AutoCellLibX includes our proposed pattern combination algorithm which can
iteratively find a set of gate-level patterns from numerous candidates as the
extension part of the given initial standard cell library. To the best of our
knowledge, AutoCellLibX is the first automated standard cell extension
framework that closes the optimization loop between the analysis of gate-level
netlist and standard cell library customization for VLSI design productivity.
The experiments with FreePDK45 library and benchmarks from various domains show
that AutoCellLibX can generate the library extension with up to 5 custom
standard cells within 1.1 hours for each of the 31 benchmark designs and the
resultant extension of the standard cell library can save design area by 4.49%

of mode collapse and enhances scalability by using multiple generators, each
one of them concurrently trained on a single data label. The use of the
Wasserstein metric also reduces the risk of cycling by stabilizing the training
of each generator. We illustrate the approach on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and
ImageNet1k datasets, three standard benchmark image datasets, maintaining the
original resolution of the images for each dataset. Performance is assessed in
terms of scalability and final accuracy within a limited fixed computational
time and computational resources. To measure accuracy, we use the inception
score, the Frechet inception distance, and image quality. An improvement in
inception score and Frechet inception distance is shown in comparison to
previous results obtained by performing the parallel approach on deep
convolutional conditional generative adversarial neural networks (DC-CGANs) as
well as an improvement of image quality of the new images created by the GANs
approach. Weak scaling is attained on both datasets using up to 2,000 NVIDIA

uncovered that FL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which aim at injecting a
sub-task into the FL without corrupting the performance of the main task.
Single-shot backdoor attack achieves high accuracy on both the main task and
backdoor sub-task when injected at the FL model convergence. However, the
early-injected single-shot backdoor attack is ineffective because: (1) the
maximum backdoor effectiveness is not reached at injection because of the
dilution effect from normal local updates; (2) the backdoor effect decreases
quickly as the backdoor will be overwritten by the newcoming normal local
updates. In this paper, we strengthen the early-injected single-shot backdoor
attack utilizing FL model information leakage. We show that the FL convergence
can be expedited if the client trains on a dataset that mimics the distribution
and gradients of the whole population. Based on this observation, we proposed a
two-phase backdoor attack, which includes a preliminary phase for the
subsequent backdoor attack. In the preliminary phase, the attacker-controlled
client first launches a whole population distribution inference attack and then
trains on a locally crafted dataset that is aligned with both the gradient and
inferred distribution. Benefiting from the preliminary phase, the later
injected backdoor achieves better effectiveness as the backdoor effect will be
less likely to be diluted by the normal model updates. Extensive experiments
are conducted on MNIST dataset under various data heterogeneity settings to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack. Results show that
the proposed backdoor outperforms existing backdoor attacks in both success
rate and longevity, even when defense mechanisms are in place.

cyber-physical attacks (CCPAs) damage the power grid's physical infrastructure
and use a simultaneous cyber attack to mask its effect. This work proposes a
novel approach to detect such attacks and identify the location of the line
outages (due to the physical attack). The proposed approach consists of three
parts. Firstly, moving target defense (MTD) is applied to expose the physical
attack by actively perturbing transmission line reactance via distributed
flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. MTD invalidates the
attackers' knowledge required to mask their physical attack. Secondly,
convolution neural networks (CNNs) are applied to localize line outage position
from the compromised measurements. Finally, model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)
is used to accelerate the training speed of CNN following the topology
reconfigurations (due to MTD) and reduce the data/retraining time requirements.
Simulations are carried out using IEEE test systems. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively localize line outages in

topological insulators whose realizations rely on position-dependent control of
evolution operators. Owing to the ease of manipulating multiple degrees of
freedom of photons, we provide an optical setup of split-step operators which
in combination with position-dependent coin (PDC) operation can accomplish a
table-top setup of generalized split-step walks. Also, we propose an optical
implementation for PDC operation that allows, for instance, to realize electric
quantum walks, control localization dynamics, and emulate space-time curvature

exoplanet and a primary observational target, TRAPPIST-1e presents an
interesting case of climate bistability. We find that the atmospheric
circulation on TRAPPIST-1e can exist in two distinct regimes for a 1~bar
nitrogen-dominated atmosphere. One is characterized by a single strong
equatorial prograde jet and a large day-night temperature difference; the other
is characterized by a pair of mid-latitude prograde jets and a relatively small
day-night contrast. The circulation regime appears to be highly sensitive to
the model setup, including initial and surface boundary conditions, as well as
physical parameterizations of convection and cloud radiative effects. We focus
on the emergence of the atmospheric circulation during the early stages of
simulations and show that the regime bistability is associated with a delicate
balance between the zonally asymmetric heating, mean overturning circulation,
and mid-latitude baroclinic instability. The relative strength of these
processes places the GCM simulations on different branches of the evolution of
atmospheric dynamics. The resulting steady states of the two regimes have
consistent differences in the amount of water content and clouds, affecting the
water absorption bands as well as the continuum level in the transmission
spectrum, although they are too small to be detected with current technology.
Nevertheless, this regime bistability affects the surface temperature,
especially on the night side of the planet, and presents an interesting case
for understanding atmospheric dynamics and highlights uncertainty in 3D GCM
results, motivating more multi-model studies.

reconstructed magnetic field evaluated on the training data. The
divergence-free condition is incorporated as a constrain in the cost function
allowing the method to achieve arbitrarily small errors in the magnetic field

proposed method exhibits a significant reduction of the computational

These parameters include surface temperature and pressure, temperature profile
as a function of distance from the surface, composition of the minor species

surface temperature, temperature gradients with altitude, and surface pressure.
The importance of temperature gradients in JWST observations shows that a

grasping of everyday objects. We conclude that a simple algorithm based on a
proportional controller will suffice for many grasping applications, provided
the relevant fingertips exhibit high sensitivity. In a quantified assessment,
we also demonstrate that, due in part to the sensor distribution, the
BioTac-based fingertip performs better than the WTS-FT device, in enabling
lifting of loads up to 850g, and that the simple proportional controller can
adapt the grasp even when the object is exposed to significant external
vibrational challenges.

the Festina Lente criteria ($\Lambda_c \gtrsim H$) from swampland principles,
are investigated for a holographic theory using the Karch-Randall setup. A
purely gravitational description admits unstable de Sitter extremum, and the
requirement of Festina Lente translates into requirements of a perturbative
gravitational dual, but prohibits an arbitrarily small hierarchy for other
parameters fixed. With an additional scalar sector, the theory admits
metastable de Sitter minima, and the requirement of Festina Lente imposes
constraints on the parameters. For some range of parameters where Festina Lente
could be constraining, the de Sitter minimum is very close to decay, thus
invalidating the applicability. Further consequences of the finite lifetime of
the dS extrema and the relation with related swampland conjectures are
investigated, and no contradictions are found. These results make case for the
consistency and utility of the Karch-Randall setup, clarify the implications of
Festina Lente for holographic theories, and connect Festina Lente to other

local strong-line metallicity calibrations. We find that none of the considered
diagnostics match simultaneously the observed relations between metallicity and
strong-line ratios for the three sources, implying that a proper re-assessment
of the calibrations may be needed at these redshifts. On the mass-metallicity
plane, the two galaxies at z~7.6 (log(M*/M_sun) = 8.1, 8.7) have metallicities
that are consistent with the extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation at
z~2-3, while the least massive galaxy at z~8.5 (log(M*/M_sun) = 7.8) shows
instead a significantly lower metallicity . The three galaxies show different
level of offset relative to the Fundamental Metallicity Relation, with two of
them (at z~7.6) being marginally consistent, while the z~8.5 source deviating
significantly, being probably far from the smooth equilibrium between gas
flows, star formation and metal enrichment in place at later epochs.

models to automatically label the ADME paragraphs in the pharmacokinetics
section from the FDA-approved drug labeling to facilitate PSG assessment. We
applied a transfer learning approach by fine-tuning the pre-trained
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to develop
a novel application of ADME semantic labeling, which can automatically retrieve
ADME paragraphs from drug labeling instead of manual work. We demonstrated that
fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model can outperform the conventional machine
learning techniques, achieving up to 11.6% absolute F1 improvement. To our
knowledge, we were the first to successfully apply BERT to solve the ADME
semantic labeling task. We further assessed the relative contribution of
pre-training and fine-tuning to the overall performance of the BERT model in
the ADME semantic labeling task using a series of analysis methods such as
attention similarity and layer-based ablations. Our analysis revealed that the
information learned via fine-tuning is focused on task-specific knowledge in
the top layers of the BERT, whereas the benefit from the pre-trained BERT model
is from the bottom layers.

evaluate polynomial expressions in homomorphism densities on kernels $W$, i.e.,
symmetric, bounded, and measurable functions $W$ from $[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$.
In 2011, Hatami and Norin proved a fundamental result that it is undecidable to
determine the validity of polynomial inequalities in homomorphism densities for
graphons (i.e., the case where the range of $W$ is $[0,1]$, which corresponds
to unweighted graphs, or equivalently, to graphs with edge weights between $0$
and $1$). The corresponding problem for more general sets of kernels, e.g., for
all kernels or for kernels with range $[-1,1]$, remains open. For any $a > 0$,
we show undecidability of polynomial inequalities for any set of kernels which
contains all kernels with range $\{0,a\}$. This result also answers a question
raised by Lov\'asz about finding computationally effective certificates for the

find that a black hole mass $\gtrsim 10^{7.8}~\textrm{M}_\odot$ is required to
power a jet with mechanical power greater than the radiative luminosity of the

velocities and other relativistic effects arising from a perturbed spacetime
background. In addition, study of correlation functions of tracers in Fourier

assumed that line-of-sight (LOS) vectors are parallel. In this work we show
that a simple perturbative procedure can be employed for a fast evaluation of

multipoles of the galaxy power spectrum with those from non-integrated and
integrated relativistic corrections and estimate their possible contamination

corrections in the presence of nonlinear terms at one-loop order. For the
bispectrum, we show that wide-angle effects alone, even with fully symmetric
choices of LOS, give rise to imaginary, odd-parity multipoles of the galaxy

Bessel beams have a long focal depth, which in this scenario is counteracted by
the increase in randomness enabling tunability of the axial resolution between

that the mass diminishes when the magnetic field appears, for small values of

the case when we have only an electric field, the mass always grow with the

inverse electric catalysis (IEC) for the cases where only a magnetic field or
only an electric field are present, respectively. In both cases, taken

perturbations. The image classifications can be easily fooled by adding
artificial small and imperceptible perturbations to input images. As one of the
most effective defense strategies, adversarial training was proposed to address
the vulnerability of classification models, where the adversarial examples are
created and injected into training data during training. The attack and defense
of classification models have been intensively studied in past years. Semantic
segmentation, as an extension of classifications, has also received great
attention recently. Recent work shows a large number of attack iterations are
required to create effective adversarial examples to fool segmentation models.
The observation makes both robustness evaluation and adversarial training on
segmentation models challenging. In this work, we propose an effective and
efficient segmentation attack method, dubbed SegPGD. Besides, we provide a
convergence analysis to show the proposed SegPGD can create more effective
adversarial examples than PGD under the same number of attack iterations.
Furthermore, we propose to apply our SegPGD as the underlying attack method for
segmentation adversarial training. Since SegPGD can create more effective
adversarial examples, the adversarial training with our SegPGD can boost the
robustness of segmentation models. Our proposals are also verified with
experiments on popular Segmentation model architectures and standard

we propose a simple DG approach for ViTs, coined as self-distillation for ViTs.
It reduces the overfitting of source domains by easing the learning of
input-output mapping problem through curating non-zero entropy supervisory
signals for intermediate transformer blocks. Further, it does not introduce any
new parameters and can be seamlessly plugged into the modular composition of
different ViTs. We empirically demonstrate notable performance gains with

power spectrum to within 1% up to $k=0.4 \;(0.3) \,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in real
(redshift) space at redshifts $z=0,1$. Looking at counts in cells, we find an
excellent agreement between the theory and simulations for cells as small as 5
$h^{-1}$ Mpc. These results are in line with expectations from perturbation
theory and they imply that a perturbative description of the HI field is
sufficiently accurate given the characteristics of upcoming 21cm intensity
mapping surveys. Additionally, we study the statistical properties of the model
error - the difference between the truth and the model. We show that on large
scales this error is nearly Gaussian and that it has a flat power spectrum,
with amplitude significantly lower than the standard noise inferred from the HI
power spectrum. We explain the origin of this discrepancy, discuss its
implications for the HI power spectrum Fisher matrix forecasts and argue that
it motivates the HI field-level cosmological inference. On small scales in
redshift space we use the difference between the model and the truth as a proxy
for the Fingers-of-God effect. This allows us to estimate the nonlinear

flexible models into interpretable analytic expressions. We recover common GW
population models such as a power-law-plus-Gaussian, and find a new empirical
population model which combines accuracy and simplicity. This demonstrates a
strategy to automatically discover interpretable population models in the
ever-growing GW catalog, which can potentially be applied to other
astrophysical phenomena.

under the Fermi level, which is one of the highest doping levels ever obtained

of an induced spin-orbit coupling. This system provides a playground to study
the interaction between a novel magnetic order mediated by pi-band states, and
a divergent density of states at the Fermi level.

central focus of jet substructure, leading to the introduction of numerous
observables and calculations to high perturbative accuracy. At the same time,
there have been many attempts to fully exploit the jet radiation pattern using
tools from statistics and machine learning. We propose a new approach that
combines a deep analytic understanding of jet substructure with the optimality
promised by machine learning and statistics. After specifying an approximation
to the full emission phase space, we show how to construct the optimal
observable for a given classification task. This procedure is demonstrated for
the case of quark and gluons jets, where we show how to systematically capture
sub-eikonal corrections in the splitting functions, and prove that linear
combinations of weighted multiplicity is the optimal observable. In addition to
providing a new and powerful framework for systematically improving jet
substructure observables, we demonstrate the performance of several quark
versus gluon jet tagging observables in parton-level Monte Carlo simulations,
and find that they perform at or near the level of a deep neural network
classifier. Combined with the rapid recent progress in the development of
higher order parton showers, we believe that our approach provides a basis for
systematically exploiting subleading effects in jet substructure analyses at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and beyond.

considered to act as a uniform-shear Chang-Refsdal lens on one of the two
images produced by the host star that comes close to the angular Einstein
radius of the planet, leaving the other image unaffected. However, this
uniform-shear approximation is only valid for isolated planetary caustics and
breaks down in the resonant regime. Recently, the planetary-caustic degeneracy
arising from the above formalism is found to generalize to the regime of
central and resonant caustics, indicating that the perturbative picture and
Chang-Refsdal lens approximation may have been under-explored in the past.
Here, I introduce a new variable-shear Chang-Refsdal lens approximation, which
not only supports central and resonant caustics, but also enables full
magnification maps to be calculated analytically. Moreover, I introduce the
generalized perturbative picture, which relaxes the required proximity between
the planet and the image being perturbed in the previous work. Specifically,
the planet always perturbs the image in the same half of the lens plane as the
planet itself, leaving the other image largely unaffected. It is demonstrated
how this new framework results in the offset degeneracy as a consequence of
physical symmetry. The generalized perturbative picture also points to an
approach to solve the two-body lens equation semi-analytically. The analytic
and semi-analytic microlensing solutions associated with this work may allow
for substantially faster light-curve calculations and modeling of observed
events. A python implementation is provided.

Additionally, we calculate the sensitivities of future direct and indirect

the C$\nu$B reference frame may not be aligned with that of the Earth. The
Pauli exclusion principle strongly disfavours overdensities $\eta_\nu \gg 1$ at
small neutrino masses, but allows for overdensities $\eta_{\nu}\lesssim 125$ at
the KATRIN mass bound $m_{\nu} \simeq 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. On the other hand,
cosmology strongly favours $0.2 \lesssim \eta_{\nu} \lesssim 3.5$ in all

C$\nu$B without a significant overdensity for neutrino masses $m_{\nu} \gtrsim
50\,\mathrm{meV}$, but require an overdensity $\eta_{\nu} \gtrsim 3\times 10^5$

equation in one space dimension for sine-wave initial conditions. These so far
undetected complex singularities are arranged in an eye shape centered around
the origin in time. Interestingly, since the eye is squashed along the
imaginary time axis, complex-time singularities can become physically relevant
at times well before the first real singularity -- the pre-shock. Indeed,
employing a time-Taylor representation for the velocity around $t=0$, loss of
convergence occurs roughly at 2/3 of the pre-shock time for the considered
single- and multi-mode models. Furthermore, the loss of convergence is
accompanied by the appearance of initially localized resonant behaviour which,
as we claim, is a temporal manifestation of the so-called tyger phenomenon,
reported in Galerkin-truncated implementations of inviscid fluids [Ray et al.,
Phys. Rev. E 84, 016301 (2011)]. We support our findings of early-time tygers
with two complementary and independent means, namely by an asymptotic analysis
of the time-Taylor series for the velocity, as well as by a novel singularity
theory that employs Lagrangian coordinates.
  Finally, we apply two methods that reduce the amplitude of early-time tygers,
one is tyger purging which removes large Fourier modes from the velocity, and
is a variant of a procedure known in the literature. The other method realizes
an iterative UV completion, which, most interestingly, iteratively restores the
conservation of energy once the Taylor series for the velocity diverges. Our
techniques are straightforwardly adapted to higher dimensions and/or applied to
other equations of hydrodynamics.

for many fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, as well as a microscopic

The fundamental postulate of mapping FQH states of electrons to integer quantum
Hall (IQH) states of CFs, however, was not formally established. The Landau
level (LL) projection needed for the microscopic calculations is in some sense
uncontrolled and unpredictable. We rigorously derive the unitary relationship
between electrons and the CFs, showing the latter naturally emerge from special
interactions within a single LL, without resorting to any projection by hand.
In this framework, all FQH states topologically equivalent to those described
by the conventional CF theory (e.g. the Jain series) have exact model
Hamiltonians that can be explicitly derived, and we can easily generalise to
FQH states from interacting CFs. Our derivations reveal fundamental connections
between the CF theory and the pseudopotential/Jack polynomial constructions,
and argue that all Abelian CF states are physically equivalent to the IQH
states, while a plethora of non-Abelian CF states can be systematically

exists an excess of high-density cE-bearing subhalos close to massive halos.

2 (DR2), a study of 168 nearby ($\bar z$ = 0.04, $z$ < 0.6) active galactic
nuclei (AGN) from the all-sky Swift Burst Array Telescope X-ray survey observed
with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter in the near-infrared (NIR; 0.8 - 2.4
$\mu$m). We find that 49/109 (45%) Seyfert 2 and 35/58 (60%) Seyfert 1 galaxies
observed with VLT/X-shooter show at least one NIR high-ionization coronal line
(CL, ionization potential $\chi$ > 100 eV). Comparing the emission of the [Si
vi] $\lambda$1.9640 CL with the X-ray emission for the DR2 AGN, we find a
significantly tighter correlation, with a lower scatter (0.37 dex) than for the
optical [O iii] $\lambda$5007 line (0.71 dex). We do not find any correlation
between CL emission and the X-ray photon index $\Gamma$. We find a clear trend
of line blueshifts with increasing ionization potential in several CLs, such as
[Si vi] $\lambda$1.9640, [Si x] $\lambda$1.4300, [S viii] $\lambda$0.9915, and
[S ix] $\lambda$1.2520, indicating the radial structure of the CL region.
Finally, we find a strong underestimation bias in black hole mass measurements
of Sy 1.9 using broad H$\alpha$ due to the presence of significant dust
obscuration. In contrast, the broad Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emission lines are
in agreement with the $M$-$\sigma$ relation. Based on the combined DR1 and DR2
X-shooter sample, the NIR BASS sample now comprises 266 AGN with rest-frame NIR
spectroscopic observations, the largest set assembled to date.

  topological amplification","21 pages, 10 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Non-Hermitian (NH) lattice Hamiltonians display a unique kind of energy gap
and extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions. Due to the NH skin effect, the
separation between edge and bulk states is blurred and the (conventional)
bulk-boundary correspondence is lost. Here, we restore the bulk-boundary
correspondence for the most paradigmatic class of NH Hamiltonians, namely those
with one complex band and without symmetries. We obtain the desired NH
Hamiltonian from the (mean-field) unconditional evolution of driven-dissipative
cavity arrays, in which NH terms -- in the form of non-reciprocal hopping
amplitudes, gain and loss -- are explicitly modeled via coupling to (engineered
and non-engineered) reservoirs. This approach removes the arbitrariness in the
definition of the topological invariant, as point-gapped spectra differing by a
complex-energy shift are not treated as equivalent; the origin of the complex
plane provides a common reference (base point) for the evaluation of the
topological invariant. This implies that topologically non-trivial Hamiltonians
are only a strict subset of those with a point gap and that the NH skin effect
does not have a topological origin. We analyze the NH Hamiltonians so obtained
via the singular value decomposition, which allows to express the NH
bulk-boundary correspondence in the following simple form: an integer value
$\nu$ of the topological invariant defined in the bulk corresponds to $\vert
\nu\vert$ singular vectors exponentially localized at the system edge under
open boundary conditions, in which the sign of $\nu$ determines which edge.
Non-trivial topology manifests as directional amplification of a coherent input
with gain exponential in system size. Our work solves an outstanding problem in
the theory of NH topological phases and opens up new avenues in topological
photonics.

$455$ clusters within a redshift range of $0.1<z<1.2$, of which $177$ systems
are covered by the public data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey that
enables uniform weak-lensing cluster mass constraints. With minimal

relations between the cluster halo mass and the observables, which include the
X-ray count rate, the optical richness, and the weak-lensing mass, and (2) the
X-ray selection in terms of the completeness function $\mathtt{C}$. Using the
richness distribution of the clusters, we directly measure the X-ray
completeness and adopt those measurements as informative priors for the

the constraint on the equation of state parameter of the dark energy of $w =

from the $Planck$ mission, the galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering analysis of
the Dark Energy Survey, and the cluster abundance analysis of the SPT-SZ survey

clouds is crucial for the understanding of how stars form. Under the typical
conditions of infrared dark clouds, CO is removed from the gas phase and
trapped on to the surface of dust grains by the so-called depletion process.
This suggests that the CO depletion factor ($f_{\rm D}$) can be a useful
chemical indicator for identifying cold and dense regions (i.e., prestellar
cores). We have used the 1.3 mm continuum and C$^{18}$O(2-1) data observed at
the resolution of $\sim$5000 au in the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass
Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) to construct averaged maps of $f_{\rm D}$ in
twelve clumps to characterise the earliest stages of the high-mass star
formation process. The average $f_{\rm D}$ determined for 277 of the 294 ASHES
cores follows an unexpected increase from the prestellar to the protostellar
stage. If we exclude the temperature effect due to the slight variations in the
NH$_3$ kinetic temperature among different cores, we explain this result as a
dependence primarily on the average gas density, which increases in cores where
protostellar conditions prevail. This shows that $f_{\rm D}$ determined in
high-mass star-forming regions at the core scale is insufficient to distinguish
among prestellar and protostellar conditions for the individual cores, and
should be complemented by information provided by additional tracers. However,
we confirm that the clump-averaged $f_{\rm D}$ values correlates with the
luminosity-to-mass ratio of each source, which is known to trace the evolution
of the star formation process.

energy, magnetization, and extrinsic spin-orbit strength. The field-like SOT
decreases with increasing disorder strength while the damping-like SOT is
independent of the impurity density. With experimental observation in mind we
also determine the role of extrinsic spin-orbit scattering on the anomalous
Hall effect. Our results suggest extrinsic spin-orbit scattering is a
significant contributor to the surface SOT stemming from the Edelstein effect
when the magnetization is out of the plane.

prestellar cores typically find supercritical mass-to-flux ratios, suggesting
that the magnetic field is insufficient to prevent gravitational collapse.
These measurements suffer from significant uncertainties; an alternative
approach is to utilise the sensitivity of prestellar chemistry to the
evolutionary history, and indirectly constrain the degree of magnetic support.
We combine non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prestellar cores with
time-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer modelling, producing synthetic
observations of the model cores in several commonly-observed molecular lines.
We find that molecules strongly affected by freeze-out, such as CS and HCN,
typically have much lower line intensities in magnetically subcritical models
compared to supercritical ones, due to the longer collapse timescales.
Subcritical models also produce much narrower lines for all species
investigated. Accounting for a range of core properties, ages and viewing
angles, we find that supercritical models are unable to reproduce the
distribution of CS and N$_2$H$^+$ line strengths and widths seen in an
observational sample, whereas subcritical models are in good agreement with the
available data. This suggests that despite presently having supercritical
mass-to-flux ratios, prestellar cores form as magnetically subcritical objects.

a stochastic transport. Once linearised around the mean flow and expressed in
the Fourier domain, the model has proven its efficiency to predict the
structure of the streaks of streamwise velocity in turbulent channel flows. It
has been in particular demonstrated that the stochastic transport by unresolved
incoherent turbulence allows to better reproduce the streaks through lift-up
mechanism. In the present paper, we focus on the study of streamwise-elongated
structures, energetic in the buffer and logarithmic layers. In the buffer
layer, elongated streamwise vortices, named rolls, are seen to result from
coherent wave-wave non-linear interactions, which have been neglected in the
stochastic linear framework. We propose a way to account for the effect of
these interactions in the stochastic model by introducing a stochastic forcing,
which replace the missing non-linear terms. In addition, we propose an
iterative strategy in order to ensure that the stochastic noise is decorrelated
from the solution, as prescribed by the modelling hypotheses. We explore the
prediction abilities of this more complete model in the buffer and logarithmic
layers of channel flows at $Re_\tau=180$, $Re_\tau=550$ and $Re_\tau=1000$. We
show an improvement of predictions compared to resolvent analysis with eddy
viscosity, especially in the logarithmic layer.

field-induced ordered phase, in particular to look for quasi-2D physics arising
from the layered structure and from the different bilayer types. From neutron

out with the NIMROD code including time-dependent magnetic field boundary
conditions to simulate the effect of the coil. Further modeling in some cases
uses the ASCOT5 code to calculate advection and diffusion coefficients for
runaway electrons based on the NIMROD-calculated fields, and the DREAM code to
compute the runaway evolution in the presence of these transport coefficients.
Compared with similar modeling in Tinguely, et al [2021 Nucl. Fusion 61
124003], considerably more conservative assumptions are made with the ASCOT5
results, zeroing low levels of transport, particularly in regions in which
closed flux surfaces have reformed. Of three coil geometries considered in
SPARC, only the $n=1$ coil is found to have sufficient resonant components to
suppress the runaway current growth. Without the new conservative transport
assumptions, full suppression of the RE current is maintained when the TQ MHD
is included in the simulation or when the RE current is limited to 250kA, but
when transport in closed flux regions is fully suppressed, these scenarios
allow RE beams on the order of 1-2MA to appear. Additional modeling is
performed to consider the effects of the close ideal wall. In DIII-D, the
current quench is modeled for both limited and diverted equilibrium shapes. In
the limited shape, the onset of stochasticity is found to be insensitive to the
coil current amplitude and governed largely by the evolution of the
safety-factor profile. In both devices, prediction of the q-profile evolution
is seen to be critical to predicting the later time effects of the coil.

argument~\cite{derrick1964comments}, the complexity of the resulting identity
is system dependent. In particular, the contribution of the Einstein-Hilbert

Gibbons-Hawking-York term needs to be taken into account

depends on the metric, it is expected that a ``convenient'' gauge that
trivializes the gravitational action contribution exists. While in spherical

providing us with insight on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the early
universe. It is believed that the heavy-ion collision experiments at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have
created the QGP medium by colliding two heavy nuclei at nearly the speed of
light. Since the collision happens really fast, we can not observe the QGP
directly. Instead, we look at the hundreds or even thousands of final hadrons
coming out of the collision. In particular, jet and heavy flavor observables
are excellent probes of the transport properties of such a medium. On the
theoretical side, computational models are essential to make the connections
between the final observables and the plasma. Previously studies have employed
a comprehensive multistage modeling approach of both the probes and the medium.
  In this dissertation, heavy quarks are investigated as probes pf the QGP.
First, the framework that describes the evolution of both soft and hard
particles during the collision is discussed, which includes initial condition,
hydrodynamical expansion, parton transport, hadronization, and hadronic
rescattering. It has recently been organized into the Jet Energy-loss
Tomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope
(JETSCAPE) framework, which allows people to study heavy-ion collision in a
more systematic manner.
  To study the energy loss of hard partons inside the QGP medium, the linear
Boltzmann transport model (LBT) and in medium DGLAP evolution (implemented in
the MATTER model) are combined and have achieved a simultaneous description of
both charged hadron, D meson, and inclusive jet observables. To further extract
the transport coefficients, a Bayesian analysis is conducted which constrains
the parameters in the transport models.

sufficient to confidently predict the developer's next edit, and thus IDEs
generate many suggestions at a location. Therefore, IDEs generally do not
actively offer suggestions and instead, the developer is usually required to
click on a specific icon or menu and then select from a large list of potential

which fills the virial volume of our Galaxy. These interactions should produce
guaranteed fluxes of energetic diffuse neutrinos and photons observable at the
Earth. This neutrino flux would be a plausible contribution to the spectrum
measured by the IceCube neutrino observatory: the energy emitted in this way is
weakly constrained from cascade gamma rays, since the cascades have no time to
develop, but the arrival directions of the neutrinos do not point to the
Galactic disk, in agreement with observations. However, previous studies
reported very different estimates of the corresponding neutrino flux, so it was
unclear if this contribution to the observed spectrum is essential. Here we
readdress the calculation of this diffuse neutrino flux component under various
assumptions about the cosmic-ray spectrum and propagation in the circumgalactic
medium. We find that even with these variations, this contribution to the

  23-27, 2022",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The modern viewpoint is that the Standard Model is the leading part of an
effective field theory that obeys the symmetry $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y$. Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, it is generally assumed that
this symmetry is realized linearly (SMEFT), but a nonlinear realization (e.g.,
HEFT) is still possible. The two differ in their predictions for the size of
certain low-energy dimension-6 four-fermion operators: for these, HEFT allows
$O(1)$ couplings, while in SMEFT they are suppressed by a factor
$v^2/\Lambda_{\rm NP}^2$, where $v$ is the Higgs vev. In this talk, I argue
that (i) such non-SMEFT operators contribute to both $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$
and $b \to c \,\tau^- {\bar\nu}_\tau$, transitions involved in the present-day
$B$ anomalies, (ii) the contributions to $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ are
constrained to be small, at the SMEFT level, and (iii) the contribution to $b
\to c \,\tau^- {\bar\nu}_\tau$ can be sizeable. I show that the angular
distribution in ${\bar B} \to D^* (\to D \pi') \, \tau^{-} (\to \pi^- \nu_\tau)
{\bar\nu}_\tau$ contains enough information to extract the coefficients of all
new-physics operators. The measurement of this angular distribution can tell us
if non-SMEFT new physics is present.

models have only been addressed recently; most of these works however neglect
atrial contraction. Indeed, as atria are characterized by a complex physiology
influenced by the ventricular function, developing computational models able to
capture the physiological atrial function and atrioventricular interaction is
very challenging. In this paper, we propose a biophysically detailed
electromechanical model of the whole human heart that considers both atrial and
ventricular contraction. Our model includes: i) an anatomically accurate
whole-heart geometry; ii) a comprehensive myocardial fiber architecture; iii) a
biophysically detailed microscale model for the active force generation; iv) a
0D closed-loop model of the circulatory system; v) the fundamental interactions
among the different core models; vi) specific constitutive laws and model
parameters for each cardiac region. Concerning the numerical discretization, we
propose an efficient segregated-intergrid-staggered scheme and we employ
recently developed stabilization techniques that are crucial to obtain a stable
formulation in a four-chamber scenario. We are able to reproduce the healthy
cardiac function for all the heart chambers, in terms of pressure-volume loops,
time evolution of pressures, volumes and fluxes, and three-dimensional cardiac
deformation, with unprecedented matching (to the best of our knowledge) with
the expected physiology. We also show the importance of considering atrial
contraction, fibers-stretch-rate feedback and suitable stabilization
techniques, by comparing the results obtained with and without these features
in the model. The proposed model represents the state-of-the-art
electromechanical model of the iHEART ERC project and is a fundamental step
toward the building of physics-based digital twins of the human heart.

improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state through measurements
of large-scale structure at high redshift ($0.8<z<2.5$), while serving as a
state-of-the-art fast radio burst detector. Bright galactic foregrounds
contaminate the 400--800~MHz HIRAX frequency band, so meeting the science goals
will require precise instrument characterization. In this paper we describe
characterization of the HIRAX antenna, focusing on measurements of the antenna
beam and antenna noise temperature.
  Beam measurements of the current HIRAX antenna design were performed in an
anechoic chamber and compared to simulations. We report measurement techniques
and results, which find a broad and symmetric antenna beam for $\nu <$650MHz,
and elevated cross-polarization levels and beam asymmetries for $\nu >$700MHz.
Noise temperature measurements of the HIRAX feeds were performed in a custom
apparatus built at Yale. In this system, identical loads, one cryogenic and the
other at room temperature, are used to take a differential (Y-factor)
measurement from which the noise of the system is inferred. Several measurement
sets have been conducted using the system, involving CHIME feeds as well as
four of the HIRAX active feeds. These measurements give the first noise
temperature measurements of the HIRAX feed, revealing a $\sim$60K noise
temperature (relative to 30K target) with 40K peak- to-peak frequency-dependent
features, and provide the first demonstration of feed repeatability. Both
findings inform current and future feed designs.

against a potentially adversarial opponent who can choose a single best policy
in hindsight after observing the full policy sequence. Our algorithms feature a
combination of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-type optimism and fictitious play
under the scope of simultaneous policy optimization in a non-stationary
environment. When both players adopt the proposed algorithms, their overall
optimality gap is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$.

tensor form factors for the $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ decay, across the full
physical range of momentum transfer. We use the highly improved staggered quark
(HISQ) formalism for all valence quarks on eight ensembles of gluon field
configurations generated by the MILC collaboration. These include four flavours
of HISQ quarks in the sea, with three ensembles having the light $u/d$ quarks
at physical masses. In the first fully relativistic calculation of these form
factors, we use the heavy-HISQ method. This allows us to determine the form
factors as a function of heavy quark mass from the $c$ to the $b$, and so we
also obtain new results for the $D\to K$ tensor form factor. The advantage of
the relativistic formalism is that we can match the lattice weak currents to
their continuum counterparts much more accurately than in previous
calculations; our scalar and vector currents are renormalised fully
nonperturbatively and we use a well-matched intermediate momentum-subtraction
scheme for our tensor current. Our scalar and vector $B\to K$ form factors have
uncertainties of less than 4% across the entire physical $q^2$ range and the
uncertainty in our tensor form factor is less than 7%. Our heavy-HISQ method

earlier HPQCD results for the same quark weak transition but for heavier
mesons.

discs based on a Novikov-Thorne temperature radial profile. We also considered
the case where the temperature profile is modified by a colour-correction
factor. We assumed that the X-ray luminosity is equal to the accretion power
that is dissipated to the disc below a transition radius. The half-light radius
of X-ray illuminated radii can be up to some three to four times greater than
the radius of a standard disc, even for a non-spinning black hole, due to the
fact that the absorbed X-rays act as a secondary source of energy, increasing
the disc temperature. Non-illuminated discs are consistent with observations,
but only at the 2.5sigma level. On the other hand, X-ray illuminated discs can
explain both the half-light radius-black hole mass as well as the
luminosity-black hole mass relation in AGN, for a wide range of physical
parameters. In addition, we show that the observed X-ray luminosity of the
gravitationally lensed quasars is fully consistent with the X-ray luminosity
that is necessary for heating the disc. X-ray disc illumination was proposed
many years ago to explain various features that are commonly observed in the
X-ray spectra of AGN. Recently, we showed that X-ray illumination of accretion
disc can also explain the observed UV/optical time-lags in AGN, while in this

F150W and HST F160W, which signal a Ly-alpha break near the red edge of both
filters, implying z~12. This object (Maisie's Galaxy) exhibits F115W-F200W >
1.9 mag (2-sigma lower limit) with a blue continuum slope, resulting in 99.6%
of the photo-z PDF favoring z > 11. All data quality images show no artifacts
at the candidate's position, and independent analyses consistently find a
strong preference for z > 11. Its colors are inconsistent with Galactic stars,
and it is resolved (r_h = 340 +/- 14 pc). Maisie's Galaxy has log M*/Msol ~ 8.5
and is highly star-forming (log sSFR ~ -8.2 yr^-1), with a blue rest-UV color
(beta ~ -2.5) indicating little dust though not extremely low metallicity.
While the presence of this source is in tension with most predictions, it
agrees with empirical extrapolations assuming UV luminosity functions which
smoothly decline with increasing redshift. Should followup spectroscopy
validate this redshift, our Universe was already aglow with galaxies less than
400 Myr after the Big Bang.

microbiome - the collection of microbes that reside in our gut - in regulating
our mood and behaviour. This phenomenon is referred to as the
microbiome-gut-brain axis. While our techniques to measure the presence and
abundance of these microbes have been steadily improving, the analysis of
microbiome data is non-trivial.
  Here, we present a perspective on the concepts and foundations of data
analysis and interpretation of microbiome experiments with a focus on the
microbiome-gut-brain axis domain. We give an overview of foundational
considerations prior to commencing analysis alongside the core microbiome
analysis approaches of alpha diversity, beta diversity, differential feature
abundance and functional inference. We emphasize the compositional data
analysis (CoDA) paradigm.
  Further, this perspective features an extensive and heavily annotated
microbiome analysis in R in the supplementary materials, as a resource for new
and experienced bioinformaticians alike.

geometry can host complex noncolinear magnetization patterns. By tuning the
interlayer exchange coupling between a layer accommodating magnetic vortex
state and an out-of-plane magnetized layer, one can efficiently realize new
topological chiral textures such as cone state vortices and circular stripe
domains. We study how the number of circular stripes can be controlled by both
the interlayer exchange coupling and the sample geometrical parameters. By
varying geometrical parameters, a continuous phase transition between the
homogeneous state, cone state vortex, circular stripe domains, and the
imprinted vortex takes place, which is analysed by full scale micromagnetic
simulations. The analytical description provides an intuitive pictures of the
magnetization textures in each of these phases. The possibility to realize
switching between different states allows for engineering magnetic textures
with possible applications in spintronic devices.

produced at atmospheric pressure under a high electrical field. The strong and
broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of plasma-activated liquids (PALs) is now
well known. The proven applicability of machine learning (ML) in the medical
field is encouraging for its application in the field of plasma medicine as
well. Thus, ML applications on PALs could present a new perspective to better
understand the influences of various parameters on their antimicrobial effects.
In this paper, comparative supervised ML models are presented by using
previously obtained data to qualitatively predict the in vitro antimicrobial
activity of PALs. A literature search was performed and data is collected from
33 relevant articles. After the required preprocessing steps, two supervised ML
methods, namely classification, and regression are applied to data to obtain
microbial inactivation (MI) predictions. For classification, MI is labeled in
four categories and for regression, MI is used as a continuous variable. Two
different robust cross-validation strategies are conducted for classification
and regression models to evaluate the proposed method; repeated stratified
k-fold cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation, respectively. We also
investigate the effect of different features on models. The results
demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Random Forest Classifier (oRFC)
and Random Forest Regressor (oRFR) provided better results than other models
for the classification and regression, respectively. Finally, the best test
accuracy of 82.68% for oRFC and R2 of 0.75 for the oRFR are obtained. ML
techniques could contribute to a better understanding of plasma parameters that
have a dominant role in the desired antimicrobial effect. Furthermore, such
findings may contribute to the definition of a plasma dose in the future.

highly sensitive to outliers, M-estimators have become popular as a means to

prove that, for sufficiently smooth general loss functions defining the
M-estimators in generalized linear mixed models, the tail probability of the

exponential bound. This implies an exponential rate of consistency of these
M-estimators under appropriate assumptions, generalizing the existing
exponential consistency results from univariate to multivariate responses. We
have illustrated this theoretical result further for the special examples of
the maximum likelihood estimator and the robust minimum density power

AGAPECert can include a blockchain to guarantee ordering of events, while
keeping a core privacy model where private data is not shared outside of the

propose a compromise between separable and unstructured covariance estimation.
We show how the set of covariance matrices may be uniquely parametrized in

our approach involves two steps: 1) the surfaces are represented as varifolds,
this representation induces metrics equivariant to rigid motions and invariant
to parametrization; 2) the sequences of 3D shapes are represented by Gram
matrices derived from their infinite dimensional Hankel matrices. The problem
of comparison of two 3D sequences of human is formulated as a comparison of two

formation histories over cosmic time, yet such environmental effects remain
elusive at high redshifts. We update this environmental process by adopting an
advanced measure for cluster in-fall time using kinematics and reveal that
galaxies experience a gradual decline of star formation after they fall into
cluster environments up to $z \sim 1$. This conclusion is drawn from a uniform
analysis of a remarkably large sample of 105 clusters and 1626
spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies from the SPT and ACT
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys at 0.26 $< z <$ 1.13. Intriguingly, we find clear
evidence for a gradual increase in the mean age ($\sim$ 0.71 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr
based on a 4000 Angstrom break, $\rm D_{\rm n}4000$) of the galaxy's stellar
populations with the time spent in the cluster environment. This environmental
quenching effect is found regardless of galaxy luminosity (faint or bright) and
redshift (low-$z$ or high-$z$), although the exact stellar age of galaxies
depends on both parameters at fixed environmental effect. Such a systematic
increase of $\rm D_{\rm n}4000$ with in-fall proxy would suggest that galaxies
that were accreted into hosts earlier were quenched earlier, due to longer
exposure to environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping and
strangulation. Thus, our results provide new insights into environmental
quenching effects spanning a large range in cosmic time ($\sim 5.2$ Gyr,
$z=0.26-1.13$) and demonstrate the power of using a kinematically-derived
in-fall time proxy.

stress in the Nb thin films. In terms of lateral dimensions, the size of the
omega phase of Nb range from 10 to 100 nm, which is comparable to the coherence
length of Nb (~40 nm). In terms of overall volume fraction, ~1 vol.% of the Nb
grains exhibit this omega phase. We also find that the omega phase in Nb is not
observed in large grain Nb samples, suggesting that the phase transition can be
suppressed through reducing the grain boundary density, which may serve as a
source of strain and dislocations in this system. The current finding may
indicate that the Nb thin film is prone to the omega phase transition due to

characterizing their bulk densities, and internal compositions. The Transiting

for transits of extrasolar planets detected by RV. In this work, we present the
results of the search for transits of planets detected with the radial velocity

with super-Earths and Neptunes planets on orbits with periods shorter than 30
days. This cut is intended to keep objects with a relatively high transit
probability, and is also consistent with duration of TESS observations on a
single sector. Given the summed geometric transit probabilities, the expected
number of transiting planets is $3.4 \pm 1.8$. The sample contains two known
transiting planets. We report null results for the remaining 66 out of 68

conflicting goals of service owners and platform providers. Service owners
intending to maintain Service Level Objectives (SLO) for themselves typically
request a conservative amount of resources. Platform providers want to increase
operational efficiency to reduce capital and operating costs. Achieving both
operational efficiency and SLO for individual services at the same time is
challenging due to the diversity in service workload characteristics, resource
usage patterns that are dependent on input load, heterogeneity in platform,
memory, I/O, and network architecture, and resource bundling.
  This paper presents a tunable approach to resource allocation that accounts
for both dynamic service resource needs and platform heterogeneity. In
addition, an online K-Means-based service classification method is used in
conjunction with an offline sensitivity component. Our tunable approach allows
trading resource utilization efficiency for absolute SLO guarantees based on
the service owners' sensitivity to its SLO. We evaluate our tunable resource
allocator at scale in a private cloud environment with mostly latency-critical
workloads. When tuning for operational efficiency, we demonstrate up to ~50%
reduction in required machines; ~40% reduction in Total-Cost-of-Ownership
(TCO); and ~60% reduction in CPU and memory fragmentation, but at the cost of
increasing the number of tasks experiencing degradation of SLO by up to ~25%
compared to the baseline. When tuning for SLO, by introducing
interference-aware colocation, we can tune the solver to reduce tasks
experiencing degradation of SLO by up to ~22% compared to the baseline, but at
an additional cost of ~30% in terms of the number of hosts. We highlight this
trade-off between TCO and SLO violations, and offer tuning based on the
requirements of the platform owners.

enabled the detection of gas-phase complex organic molecules (COMs) across a
variety of environments. Many of the detected species are expected to form on
the icy surface of interstellar grains and transfer later into the gas phase.
Therefore, icy material is regarded as a primordial source of COMs in the ISM.
Upcoming JWST observations of interstellar ices in star-forming regions will
reveal IR features of frozen molecules with unprecedented resolution and
sensitivity. To identify COM features in the JWST data, lab IR spectra of ices
for conditions that simulate interstellar environments are needed. This work
presents FTIR spectra (500-4000 cm$^{-1}$/20-2.5$\mu$m, with a resolution of 1
cm$^{-1}$) of methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN, aka acetonitrile) mixed with H$_2$O,
CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$, at temperatures from 15-150 K. The refractive
index of pure amorphous CH$_3$CN ice at 15K and the band strength, peak
position, and FWHM of selected IR bands are also measured. These bands are: the
CH$_3$ sym stretching at 2940.9 cm$^{-1}$, the CN stretching at 2252.2

at 1410 cm$^{-1}$ , the CH$_3$ sym def. at 1374.5 cm$^{-1}$, and the CH$_3$
rock at 1041.6 cm$^{-1}$. The lab spectra of CH$_3$CN are compared to
observations of ices toward W33A and three low-mass YSOs. Since an unambiguous
identification of CH$_3$CN is not possible, upper limits for the CH$_3$CN

imbalance has risen to be one of the central issues in real logistic scenarios.
In marine transportation, this trade imbalance leads to Empty Container
Repositioning (ECR) problems. Once the freight has been delivered from an
exporting country to an importing one, the laden will turn into empty
containers that need to be repositioned to satisfy new goods requests in
exporting countries. In such problems, the performance that any cooperative
repositioning policy can achieve strictly depends on the routes that vessels
will follow (i.e., fleet deployment). Historically, Operation Research (OR)
approaches were proposed to jointly optimize the repositioning policy along
with the fleet of vessels. However, the stochasticity of future supply and
demand of containers, together with black-box and non-linear constraints that
are present within the environment, make these approaches unsuitable for these
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Configurable
Semi-POMDPs, to model this type of problems. Furthermore, we provide a
two-stage learning algorithm, ""Configure & Conquer"" (CC), that first configures
the environment by finding an approximation of the optimal fleet deployment
strategy, and then ""conquers"" it by learning an ECR policy in this tuned
environmental setting. We validate our approach in large and real-world
instances of the problem. Our experiments highlight that CC avoids the pitfalls
of OR methods and that it is successful at optimizing both the ECR policy and
the fleet of vessels, leading to superior performance in world trade
environments.

but the relationship between initial and late-time density is not local. Our
method leverages standard reconstruction as a preprocessing step, which inverts
bulk gravitational flows sourced over very large scales, transforming the
residual reconstruction problem from long-range to local and making it ideally
suited for a CNN. We develop additional techniques to account for redshift
distortions, which warp the density fields measured by galaxy surveys. Our
method improves the range of scales of high-fidelity reconstruction by a factor
of 2 in wavenumber above standard reconstruction, corresponding to a factor of
8 increase in the number of well-reconstructed modes. In addition, our method
almost completely eliminates the anisotropy caused by redshift distortions. As

highly turbulent. This poses a number of numerical challenges for the modelling
of convection in stellar interiors. We include an effective turbulence model
into a 1D stellar evolution code in order to treat non-local effects within the
same theory. We use a turbulent convection model which relies on the solution
of second order moment equations. We implement this into a state of the art 1D
stellar evolution code. To overcome a deficit in the original form of the
model, we take the dissipation due to buoyancy waves in the overshooting zone
into account. We compute stellar models of intermediate mass main-sequence
stars between 1.5 and 8 $M_\odot$. Overshoot mixing from the convective core
and modified temperature gradients within and above it emerge naturally as a
solution of the turbulent convection model equations. For a given set of model
parameters the overshooting extent determined from the turbulent convection
model is comparable to other overshooting descriptions, the free parameters of
which had been adjusted to match observations. The relative size of the mixed
cores decreases with decreasing stellar mass without additional adjustments. We
find that the dissipation by buoyancy waves constitutes a necessary and

property testing, both for its theoretical appeal, as well as for its
applications in other fields of Computer Science. The original distribution
testing model relies on samples drawn independently from the distribution to be
tested. However, when testing distributions over the $n$-dimensional Hamming
cube $\left\{0,1\right\}^{n}$ for a large $n$, even reading a few samples is
infeasible. To address this, Goldreich and Ron [ITCS 2022] have defined a model
called the huge object model, in which the samples may only be queried in a few
places.
  In this work, we initiate a study of a general class of properties in the
huge object model, those that are invariant under a permutation of the indices
of the vectors in $\left\{0,1\right\}^{n}$, while still not being necessarily
fully symmetric as per the definition used in traditional distribution testing.
  We prove that every index-invariant property satisfying a bounded
VC-dimension restriction admits a property tester with a number of queries
independent of n. To complement this result, we argue that satisfying only
index-invariance or only a VC-dimension bound is insufficient to guarantee a
tester whose query complexity is independent of n. Moreover, we prove that the
dependency of sample and query complexities of our tester on the VC-dimension
is tight. As a second part of this work, we address the question of the number
of queries required for non-adaptive testing. We show that it can be at most
quadratic in the number of queries required for an adaptive tester of
index-invariant properties. This is in contrast with the tight exponential gap
for general non-index-invariant properties. Finally, we provide an
index-invariant property for which the quadratic gap between adaptive and
non-adaptive query complexities for testing is almost tight.

with input and state constraints. Model Predictive Control performance heavily
depends on the accuracy of the open-loop prediction. For systems with

properties of the model and disturbance uncertainties. Here we are interested
in situations where such information is only available through realizations of
the system trajectories. We propose a general scenario-based optimization
framework for stochastic control of a linear system affected by additive
disturbance, when the dynamics are only approximately known. The main
contribution is in the derivation of an upper bound on the number of scenarios
required to provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the solution to
the deterministic scenario-based finite horizon optimal control problem. We
provide a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of the proposed method

proposed approach leverages sampling, it does not rely on the explicit
knowledge of the model or disturbance distributions, making it applicable in a
wide variety of contexts.

the attention of the scientific community due to highly unconventional physical

behaviors such as wake-up phenomena and an extreme sensitivity to electrode and

from the Planck data. To achieve this goal, we extend the computation of
scattering coefficients to the Healpix pixelation and introduce
cross-statistics that allow us to make use of half-mission maps as well as the
correlation between dust temperature and polarization. Introducing a general
framework, we develop an algorithm that uses the scattering statistics to
separate dust polarization from data noise. The separation is validated on mock
data, before being applied to the SRoll2 Planck maps at N_side = 256. The
validation shows that the statistics of the dust emission, including its
non-Gaussian properties, are recovered until l < 700, where, at high Galactic
latitudes, the dust power is smaller than that of the dust by two orders of
magnitude. On scales where the dust power is lower than one tenth of that of
the noise, structures in the output maps have comparable statistics but are not
spatially coincident with those of the input maps. Our results on \Planck\ data
are significant milestones opening new perspectives for statistical studies of
dust polarization and for the simulation of Galactic polarized foregrounds. The
Planck denoised maps is available (see

train machine learning (ML) models. State-of-the-art SSL methods can achieve
comparable performance to supervised learning by leveraging much fewer labeled
data. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of SSL.
In this work, we take a different angle by studying the training data privacy
of SSL. Specifically, we propose the first data augmentation-based membership
inference attacks against ML models trained by SSL. Given a data sample and the
black-box access to a model, the goal of membership inference attack is to
determine whether the data sample belongs to the training dataset of the model.
Our evaluation shows that the proposed attack can consistently outperform
existing membership inference attacks and achieves the best performance against
the model trained by SSL. Moreover, we uncover that the reason for membership
leakage in SSL is different from the commonly believed one in supervised
learning, i.e., overfitting (the gap between training and testing accuracy). We
observe that the SSL model is well generalized to the testing data (with almost
0 overfitting) but ''memorizes'' the training data by giving a more confident
prediction regardless of its correctness. We also explore early stopping as a
countermeasure to prevent membership inference attacks against SSL. The results
show that early stopping can mitigate the membership inference attack, but with
the cost of model's utility degradation.

complications, yet even with preoperative imaging, correct selection remains a
challenge. With limited feedback during surgery, it is difficult to verify
correct deployment. We propose the use of integrated impedance measurements and
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) imaging to assess the deformation of the
balloon and determine the size and shape of the surrounding lumen. Previous
work using single impedance measurements, or pressure data and analytical
models, whilst demonstrating high sizing accuracy, have assumed a circular
cross section. Here we extend these methods by adding a multitude of electrodes
to detect elliptical and occluded lumen and obtain EIT images to localise
deformations. Using a 14 Fr (5.3 mm) catheter as an example, numerical
simulations were performed to find the optimal electrode configuration of two
rings of 8 electrodes spaced 10 mm apart. The simulations predicted that the
maximum detectable aspect ratio decreased from 0.9 for a 14mm balloon to 0.5 at
30mm. The sizing and ellipticity detection results were verified
experimentally. A prototype robotic balloon catheter was constructed to
automatically inflate a compliant balloon while simultaneously recording EIT
and pressure data. Data were collected in experiments replicating stenotic
vessels with an elliptical and asymmetrical profile, and the widening of a
lumen during angioplasty. After calibration, the system was able to correctly
localise the occlusion and detect aspect ratios of 0.75. EIT images further

quite critical for understanding human behavior. Despite the significant
progress in human pose estimation in the recent years, which are often based on
single images or videos, human motion estimation on live stream videos is still
a rarely-touched area considering its special requirements for real-time output
and temporal consistency. To address this problem, we present a temporally
embedded 3D human body pose and shape estimation (TePose) method to improve the
accuracy and temporal consistency of pose estimation in live stream videos.
TePose uses previous predictions as a bridge to feedback the error for better
estimation in the current frame and to learn the correspondence between data
frames and predictions in the history. A multi-scale spatio-temporal graph
convolutional network is presented as the motion discriminator for adversarial
training using datasets without any 3D labeling. We propose a sequential data
loading strategy to meet the special start-to-end data processing requirement
of live stream. We demonstrate the importance of each proposed module with
extensive experiments. The results show the effectiveness of TePose on
widely-used human pose benchmarks with state-of-the-art performance.

inadequate in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving or healthcare.
In these settings, having the ability to abstain from making a prediction on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data can be as important as correctly classifying
in-distribution data. We introduce $p$-DkNN, a novel inference procedure that
takes a trained deep neural network and analyzes the similarity structures of
its intermediate hidden representations to compute $p$-values associated with
the end-to-end model prediction. The intuition is that statistical tests
performed on latent representations can serve not only as a classifier, but
also offer a statistically well-founded estimation of uncertainty. $p$-DkNN is
scalable and leverages the composition of representations learned by hidden
layers, which makes deep representation learning successful. Our theoretical
analysis builds on Neyman-Pearson classification and connects it to recent
advances in selective classification (reject option). We demonstrate
advantageous trade-offs between abstaining from predicting on OOD inputs and
maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution inputs. We find that $p$-DkNN
forces adaptive attackers crafting adversarial examples, a form of worst-case
OOD inputs, to introduce semantically meaningful changes to the inputs.

that the rotation lifted the degeneracy of Landau levels. When electrons are
confined in a two-dimensional ring, which is modeled by a hard wall potential,
the eigenstates are described by Landau states as long as the eigenstates are
not too close to the edges of the ring. On the other hand, near the edges of
the ring, the energies increase monotonically. These states are known as edge
states. Edge states have an important effect on the physical properties of the
ring. Thus, we analyze the Fermi energy and magnetization. In the specific case
of magnetization, we consider two approaches. In the first, we obtain an
analytical result for magnetization but without considering rotation. Numerical
results showed the de Haas-Van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations. In the second, we

  Introduction to consistent linear coupling method","46 pages, 35 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most essential concept in concurrent multiscale methods involving
atomistic-continuum coupling is how to define the relation between atomistic
and continuum regions. A well-known coupling method that has been frequently
employed in different concurrent multiscale methods such as Quasicontinuum is
the strong compatibility coupling (SCC). Although the SCC is a highly accurate
coupling method, it constrains the mesh generation and restricts the reduction
of computational cost. In this paper, first, we explain the notion of coupling
models through the interface in the context of continuum mechanics for
quasi-static problems. Then, the SCC is relaxed to overcome the downsides in
the following approaches: a surface approximation approach and a force
approximation approach. Based on the latter, we develop a brand new coupling
method called consistent linear coupling (CLC). Overall, six different coupling
schemes are introduced in line with the surface and force approximation
approaches. The schemes are compared in terms of solving quasi-static 3D
elastic nanoscale contact between an aluminum substrate and a diamond
semi-sphere. Numerical results reveal that the CLC-based schemes are more
accurate when compared with the surface approximation schemes. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that by decreasing the size of interface elements, the accuracy of
the CLC converges to and even exceeds the accuracy of SCC, but nevertheless
with significantly less computational cost. In other words, in contrast to the
SCC, the accuracy of the CLC is tunable, and it can be optimized proportional
to the computational cost and accuracy. Finally, we sketch the idea of how the
CLC can make the consistency near the atomistic-continuum interface by
eliminating ghost forces. The energy of a one-dimensional atomic chain with a
finite range of interaction is relaxed to validate the CLC method.

into a dot array. Compared with the conventional uniform flash where the signal
is overwhelmed by the noise everywhere, patterned flash provides stronger

post-processing to resolve important objects and details. Additionally, the
patterned flash projects texture onto the scene, which can be treated as a

  Indoor Environments",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Visual relocalization has been a widely discussed problem in 3D vision: given
a pre-constructed 3D visual map, the 6 DoF (Degrees-of-Freedom) pose of a query
image is estimated. Relocalization in large-scale indoor environments enables
attractive applications such as augmented reality and robot navigation.
However, appearance changes fast in such environments when the camera moves,
which is challenging for the relocalization system. To address this problem, we
propose a virtual view synthesis-based approach, RenderNet, to enrich the
database and refine poses regarding this particular scenario. Instead of
rendering real images which requires high-quality 3D models, we opt to directly
render the needed global and local features of virtual viewpoints and apply
them in the subsequent image retrieval and feature matching operations
respectively. The proposed method can largely improve the performance in
large-scale indoor environments, e.g., achieving an improvement of 7.1\% and
12.2\% on the Inloc dataset.

network information to suggest alternate routes to drivers is making it more
difficult for researchers and government transportation agencies to understand
and predict the dynamics of congested transportation systems. Computer
simulation is a key capability for these organizations to analyze hypothetical
scenarios; however, the complexity of transportation systems makes it
challenging for them to simulate very large geographical regions, such as
multi-city metropolitan areas. In this paper, we describe the Mobiliti traffic
simulator, which includes mechanisms to capture congestion delays, timing
constraints, and link storage capacity constraints. The simulator is designed
to support distributed memory parallel execution and be scalable on
high-performance computing platforms. We introduce a method to model dynamic
rerouting behavior with the addition of vehicle controller actors and reroute
request events. We demonstrate the potential of the simulator by analyzing the
impact of varying the population penetration rate of dynamic rerouting on the
San Francisco Bay Area road network. Using high-performance parallel computing,
we can simulate a day of the San Francisco Bay Area with 19 million vehicle
trips with 50 percent dynamic rerouting penetration over a road network with
0.5 million nodes and 1 million links in less than three minutes. We present an
analysis of system-level impacts when changing the dynamic rerouting
penetration rate and examine the varying effects on different functional
classes and geographical regions. Finally, we present a validation of the
simulation results compared to real world data.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, formulated as a consumption-investment problem
that aims to strike the optimal balance between a participant's (or agent's)
utility from holding/trading stakes and utility from consumption. We present
solutions via dynamic programming and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equations. When the utility functions are linear or convex, we derive
close-form solutions and show that the bang-bang strategy is optimal (i.e.,
always buy or sell at full capacity). Furthermore, we bring out the explicit
connection between the rate of return in trading/holding stakes and the
participant's risk-adjusted valuation of the stakes. In particular, we show
when a participant is risk-neutral or risk-seeking, corresponding to the
risk-adjusted valuation being a martingale or a sub-martingale, the optimal
strategy must be to either buy all the time, sell all the time, or first buy
then sell, and with both buying and selling executed at full capacity. We also
propose a risk-control version of the consumption-investment problem; and for a
special case, the ''stake-parity'' problem, we show a mean-reverting strategy

accurate"" electronic wavefunctions (and energies) via a truncated full
configuration interaction (CI) procedure which arguably circumvents the large
matrix diagonalization that is the core problem of full CI and is also central
to modern selective CI approaches. This is accomplished simply by following the
standard/ubiquitous Davidson method in its ""direct"" form -- wherein, in each
iteration, the electronic Hamiltonian operator is applied directly in second
quantization to the Ritz vector/wavefunction from the prior iteration -- except
that (in this work) only a small portion of the resultant expansion vector is
actually even computed (through application of only a similarly small portion
of the Hamiltonian). Specifically, at each iteration of this truncated Davidson
approach, the new expansion vector is taken to be twice as large as that from
the prior iteration. In this manner, a small set of highly truncated expansion
vectors (say 10--30) of increasing precision is incrementally constructed,
forming a small subspace within which diagonalization of the Hamiltonian yields
clear, consistent, and monotonically variational convergence to the approximate
full CI limit. The good efficiency in which convergence to the level of
chemical accuracy (1.6 mHartree) is achieved suggests, at least for the
demonstrated problem sizes -- Hilbert spaces of $10^{18}$ and wavefunctions of
$10^8$ determinants -- that this truncated Davidson methodology can serve as a
replacement of standard CI and complete-active space (CAS) approaches, in
circumstances where only a few chemically-significant digits of accuracy are
required and/or meaningful in view of ever-present basis set limitations.

social media misinformation does not investigate how ordinary users - the

anxiety, tensions, or divisions misinformation creates. Studying the aspects of
creation, diffusion and amplification also overlooks how misinformation is
internalized by users on social media and thus is quick to prescribe
""inoculation"" strategies for the presumed lack of immunity to misinformation.
How users grapple with social media content to develop ""natural immunity"" as a
precursor to misinformation resilience remains an open question. We have
identified at least five folk models that conceptualize misinformation as
either: political (counter)argumentation, out-of-context narratives, inherently
fallacious information, external propaganda, or simply entertainment. We use
the rich conceptualizations embodied in these folk models to uncover how social

how confirmation bias affects opinions when agents exchange information over a

a public sequence of potentially ambiguous signals and interpret it according
to a rule that includes confirmation bias. First, this study shows that
regardless of level of ambiguity both for people or networked society, only two
types of opinions can be formed, and both are biased. However, one opinion type
is less biased than the other depending on the state of the world. The size of
both biases depends on the ambiguity level and relative magnitude of the state
and confirmation biases. Hence, long-run learning is not attained even when
people impartially interpret ambiguity. Finally, analytically confirming the
probability of emergence of the less-biased consensus when people are connected
and have different priors is difficult. Hence, I used simulations to analyze
its determinants and found three main results: i) some network topologies are
more conducive to consensus efficiency, ii) some degree of partisanship
enhances consensus efficiency even under confirmation bias and iii)
open-mindedness (i.e. when partisans agree to exchange opinions with opposing
partisans) might inhibit efficiency in some cases.

different levels of granularity. By treating each amino acid as a node in graph
modeling as well as harnessing the inherent hierarchies, our ProNet is more
effective and efficient than existing methods. We also show that, given a base
3D graph network that is complete, our ProNet representations are also complete
at all levels. Experimental results show that ProNet outperforms recent methods
on most datasets. In addition, results indicate that different downstream tasks
may require representations at different levels. Our code is publicly available
as part of the DIG library (\url{https://github.com/divelab/DIG}).

KM2A, WCDA and WFCTA. The flux variations of cosmic ray air showers were
studied by analyzing the KM2A data during the thunderstorm on 10 June 2021. The
number of shower events that meet the trigger conditions increases
significantly in atmospheric electric fields, with maximum fractional increase
of 20%. The variations of trigger rates (increases or decreases) are found to
be strongly dependent on the primary zenith angle. The flux of secondary
particles increases significantly, following a similar trend with that of the
shower events. To better understand the observed behavior, Monte Carlo
simulations are performed with CORSIKA and G4KM2A (a code based on GEANT4). We
find that the experimental data (in saturated negative fields) are in good
agreement with simulations, assuming the presence of a uniform upward electric
field of 700 V/cm with a thickness of 1500 m in the atmosphere above the
observation level. Due to the acceleration/deceleration and deflection by the
atmospheric electric field, the number of secondary particles with energy above
the detector threshold is modified, resulting in the changes in shower
detection rate.

maximum influence of an observation, which can be difficult in the absence of
exogenous bounds on the input data or the estimator, especially in high
dimensional settings. This paper shows that standard notions of statistical
depth, i.e., halfspace depth and regression depth, are particularly
advantageous in this regard, both in the sense that the maximum influence of a
single observation is easy to analyze and that this value is typically low.
This is used to motivate new approximate DP location and regression estimators
using the maximizers of these two notions of statistical depth. A more
computationally efficient variant of the approximate DP regression estimator is
also provided. Also, to avoid requiring that users specify a priori bounds on
the estimates and/or the observations, variants of these DP mechanisms are
described that satisfy random differential privacy (RDP), which is a relaxation
of differential privacy provided by Hall, Wasserman, and Rinaldo (2013). We
also provide simulations of the two DP regression methods proposed here. The
proposed estimators appear to perform favorably relative to the existing DP
regression methods we consider in these simulations when either the sample size
is at least 100-200 or the privacy-loss budget is sufficiently high.

understanding the fragmentation process prior to star formation. Radio
interferometric observations of CCS 22.3 GHz emission, from the starless core
TMC-1C, have been carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to
search for Zeeman splitting of the line in order to constrain the magnetic
field strength. Toward a region offset from the dust peak, we report a
detection of the Zeeman splitting of the CCS 2_1 - 1_0 transition, with an
inferred magnetic field of ~2 mG. If we interpret the dust peak to be the core
of TMC-1C, and the region where we have made a detection of the magnetic field
to be the envelope, then our observed value for the magnetic field is
consistent with a subcritical mass-to-flux ratio envelope around a core with
supercritical mass-to-flux ratio. The ambipolar diffusion timescale for the
formation of the core is consistent with the relevant timescale based on
chemical modeling of the TMC-1C core. This work demonstrates the potential of
deep CCS observation to carry out future measurements of magnetic field
strengths in dense molecular clouds and, in turn, understand the role of the

demonstrate that SIOA predicts high amplification associated with wavelengths
corresponding to the characteristic oblique turbulent bands in this regime.
SIOA also identifies quasi-horizontal flow structures resembling the

that the classical Miles-Howard stability criterion ($Ri_b\leq 1/4$) is

amplified flow structures are determined by the product $PrRi_b$. For $Pr\gg
1$, SIOA identifies another quasi-horizontal flow structure that we show is
principally associated with density perturbations. We further demonstrate the
dominance of this density-associated flow structure in the high $Pr$ limit by
constructing analytical scaling arguments for the amplification in terms of
$Re$ and $Pr$ under the assumptions of unstratified flow (with $Ri_b=0$) and
streamwise invariance.

vertically homogeneous modes in spectral space are found to cause a slow
aggregation to a pair of convective supergranules that eventually fill the
whole horizontally extended, three-dimensional, turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection layer when a heat flux is prescribed at the top and bottom. An
additional weak rotation of the layer around the vertical axis stops this
aggregation at a scale that is smaller than the lateral domain extension and
ceases the inverse cascade for the thermal variance. The inverse cascade for
the kinetic energy remains intact, even for times at which the root mean square
values of temperature and velocity have reached the statistically steady state.
This kinetic energy inverse cascade sustains the horizontally extended
convection patterns which are best visible in the temperature field. The
resulting characteristic length of the aggregated convection patterns depends
on the thermal driving and linearly on the strength of rotation. Our study
demonstrates the importance of inverse energy cascades beyond the

boundary heat fluxes as typically present in natural geo- and astrophysical

addresses this critical question and demonstrates the potential of
high-harmonic spectroscopy in probing intertwined phonon-electron dynamics in

graphene and a circularly polarised pulse is employed to probe the excited

Moreover, sidebands associated with the prominent harmonic peaks are generated
as a result of the coherent dynamics. It is found that the symmetries and the

Complementarily, we perform source reconstruction and spectral analysis of

non-thermal emission, is presented for a subset of geyser jets. These active

sensitive to large inter-frame displacements. In this paper we propose a fast
and effective non-local 3D tracking method. Based on the observation that
erroneous local minimum are mostly due to the out-of-plane rotation, we propose
a hybrid approach combining non-local and local optimizations for different
parameters, resulting in efficient non-local search in the 6D pose space. In
addition, a precomputed robust contour-based tracking method is proposed for
the pose optimization. By using long search lines with multiple candidate
correspondences, it can adapt to different frame displacements without the need
of coarse-to-fine search. After the pre-computation, pose updates can be
conducted very fast, enabling the non-local optimization to run in real time.
Our method outperforms all previous methods for both small and large
displacements. For large displacements, the accuracy is greatly improved
($81.7\% \;\text{v.s.}\; 19.4\%$). At the same time, real-time speed ($>$50fps)

  Segmentation","Accepted by ACM MM 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object referred by a
given language expression. Existing works typically require compressed video
bitstream to be decoded to RGB frames before being segmented, which increases
computation and storage requirements and ultimately slows the inference down.
This may hamper its application in real-world computing resource limited
scenarios, such as autonomous cars and drones. To alleviate this problem, in
this paper, we explore the referring object segmentation task on compressed
videos, namely on the original video data flow. Besides the inherent difficulty
of the video referring object segmentation task itself, obtaining
discriminative representation from compressed video is also rather challenging.
To address this problem, we propose a multi-attention network which consists of
dual-path dual-attention module and a query-based cross-modal Transformer
module. Specifically, the dual-path dual-attention module is designed to
extract effective representation from compressed data in three modalities,
i.e., I-frame, Motion Vector and Residual. The query-based cross-modal
Transformer firstly models the correlation between linguistic and visual
modalities, and then the fused multi-modality features are used to guide object
queries to generate a content-aware dynamic kernel and to predict final
segmentation masks. Different from previous works, we propose to learn just one
kernel, which thus removes the complicated post mask-matching procedure of
existing methods. Extensive promising experimental results on three challenging
datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared against several
state-of-the-art methods which are proposed for processing RGB data. Source

inaccurate and unstable due to truncation errors and numerical roundoff errors.
Hence, numerical simulations of wave-like systems lacking proper handling of
these numerical issues often fail to represent the physical characteristics of
wave phenomena. This challenge gets even more intricate for multiscale
modelling, especially in multiple dimensions. When using the usual collocated
grid, about two-thirds of the resolved wave modes are incorrect with
significant dispersion. But, numerical schemes on staggered grids (with
alternating variable arrangement) are significantly less dispersive and
preserve much of the wave characteristics. Also, the group velocity of the
energy propagation in the numerical waves on a staggered grid is in the correct
direction, in contrast to the collocated grid. For high accuracy and to
preserve much of the wave characteristics, this article extends the concept of
staggered grids in full-domain modelling to multidimensional multiscale
modelling. Specifically, this article develops 120 multiscale staggered grids
and demonstrates their stability, accuracy, and wave-preserving characteristic
for equation-free multiscale modelling of weakly damped linear waves. But most
characteristics of the developed multiscale staggered grids must also hold in
general for multiscale modelling of many complex spatio-temporal physical

that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking, a unique transition in non-Hermitian
open systems, enhances regions in which bosons can be regarded as
distinguishable. This means that classical computers can sample the boson
distributions efficiently in these regions by sampling the distribution of
distinguishable particles. In a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase, we find one
dynamical transition upon which the distribution of bosons deviates from that
of distinguishable particles, when bosons are initially put at distant sites.
If the system enters a $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, the threshold time for the
transition is suddenly prolonged, since dynamics of each boson is diffusive
(ballistic) in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) phase.
Furthermore, the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase also exhibits a notable dynamical
transition on a longer time scale, at which the bosons again become
distinguishable. This transition, and hence the classical easiness of sampling
bosons in long times, are true for generic postselected non-unitary quantum
dynamics, while it is absent in unitary dynamics of isolated quantum systems.
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking can also be characterized by the efficiency of
a classical algorithm based on the rank of matrices, which can (cannot)

hash learning methods as a way to achieve efficient and flexible cross-modal
retrieval of massive multimedia data have received a lot of attention from the
current Web resource retrieval research community. Existing supervised hashing
methods simply transform label information into pairwise similarity information
to guide hash learning, leading to a potential risk of semantic error in the
face of multi-label data. In addition, most existing hash optimization methods
solve NP-hard optimization problems by employing approximate approximation
strategies based on relaxation strategies, leading to a large quantization
error. In order to address above obstacles, we present a simple yet efficient
Adaptive Asymmetric Label-guided Hashing, named A2LH, for Multimedia Search.
Specifically, A2LH is a two-step hashing method. In the first step, we design
an association representation model between the different modality
representations and semantic label representation separately, and use the
semantic label representation as an intermediate bridge to solve the semantic
gap existing between different modalities. In addition, we present an efficient
discrete optimization algorithm for solving the quantization error problem
caused by relaxation-based optimization algorithms. In the second step, we
leverage the generated hash codes to learn the hash mapping functions. The
experimental results show that our proposed method achieves optimal performance
on all compared baseline methods.

a combination of barriers that can slow or stall growth. Moreover, particles
that grow massive enough to decouple from the gas are subject to inward radial
drift which could lead to the depletion of most disk solids before
planetesimals can form. Compact particle growth is probably not realistic.
Rather, it is more likely that grains grow as fractal aggregates which may
overcome this so-called radial drift barrier because they remain more coupled
to the gas than compact particles of equal mass. We model fractal aggregate
growth and compaction in a viscously evolving solar-like nebula for a range of
turbulent intensities $\alpha_{\rm{t}} = 10^{-5}-10^{-2}$. We do find that
radial drift is less influential for porous aggregates over much of their
growth phase; however, outside the water snowline fractal aggregates can grow
to much larger masses with larger Stokes numbers more quickly than compact
particles, leading to rapid inward radial drift. As a result, disk solids
outside the snowline out to $\sim 10-20$ AU are depleted earlier than in
compact growth models, but outside $\sim 20$ AU material is retained much
longer because aggregate Stokes numbers there remain lower initially.
Nevertheless, we conclude even fractal models will lose most disk solids
without the intervention of some leap-frog planetesimal forming mechanism such
as the Streaming Instability (SI), though conditions for the SI are generally
never satisfied, except for a brief period %for a brief stage around $\sim 0.2$
Myr at the snowline for $\alpha_{\rm{t}}=10^{-5}$.

shoes) to users, but they often suffer from two issues: significant interaction
sparsity and a large output space. In this work, we extend multi-round
conversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR, which uses
a conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences
on tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across
multiple rounds, is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback
and narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of
bundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task
named Bundle MCR. We first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling,
consultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we
propose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items,
(2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware
conversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a
two-stage training strategy. In an offline pre-training stage, Bunt is trained
using multiple cloze tasks to mimic bundle interactions in conversations. Then
in an online fine-tuning stage, Bunt agents are enhanced by user interactions.
Our experiments on multiple offline datasets as well as the human evaluation
show the value of extending MCR frameworks to bundle settings and the
effectiveness of our Bunt design.

models of fractal aggregate and solid, compact particle growth in a viscously
evolving solar-like nebula for a range of turbulent intensities
$\alpha_{\rm{t}} = 10^{-5}-10^{-2}$. Here, we examine how disk composition in
these same models changes with time. We find that advection and diffusion of
small grains and vapor, and radial inward drift for larger compact particles
and fractal aggregates, naturally lead to diverse outcomes for planetesimal
composition. Larger particles can undergo substantial inward radial migration
due to gas drag before being collisionally fragmented or partially evaporating
at various temperatures. This leads to enhancement of the associated volatile
in both vapor inside, and solids outside, their respective evaporation fronts,
or ``snowlines''. In cases of lower $\alpha_{\rm{t}}$, we see narrow belts of
volatile or supervolatile material develop in the outer nebula, which could be
connected to the bands of ``pebbles"" seen by ALMA. Volatile bands, which
migrate inwards as the disk cools, can persist over long timescales as their
gas phase continues to advect or diffuse outward across its evaporation front.
These belts could be sites where supervolatile-rich planetesimals form, such as
the rare CO-rich and water-poor comets; giant planets formed just outside the
H$_2$O snowline may be enhanced in water.

methods in regular finance can estimate credit scores and default

the following unique characteristics: a) under-explored (developing) areas such
as rural Africa do not have sufficient prior loan data for microfinance
institutions (MFIs) to establish a credit scoring system; b) microfinance
applicants may have difficulty providing sufficient information for MFIs to
accurately predict default probabilities; and c) many MFIs use group liability
(instead of collateral) to secure repayment. Here, we present a novel
control-theoretic model of microfinance that accounts for these
characteristics. We construct an algorithm to learn microfinance decision
policies that achieve financial inclusion, fairness, social welfare, and
sustainability. We characterize the convergence conditions to Pareto-optimum
and the convergence speeds. We demonstrate, in numerous real and synthetic
datasets, that the proposed method accounts for the complexities induced by
group liability to produce robust decisions before sufficient loans are given
to establish credit scoring systems and for applicants whose default
probability cannot be accurately estimated due to missing information. To the
best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to connect microfinance and

Assume it holds for $n-1$ and prove it holds for $n$, where $n\geq 3$. If there
are $2n-3$ faulty links and they are all incident with a common node, then we
choose some dimension such that there is one or two faulty links and no
prescribed link in this dimension; Otherwise, we choose some dimension such
that the total number of faulty links and prescribed links does not exceed $1$.
No matter which case, partition $BH_n$ into $4$ disjoint copies of $BH_{n-1}$
along the above chosen dimension. Results: On the basis of the above partition
of $BH_n$, in this manuscript, we complete the proof for the case that there is
at most one faulty link in the above chosen dimension.

originally discovered in non-interacting systems to interacting many-body

prototypical Lieb-Liniger Bose gas with imaginary vector potential. We show
that this non-Hermitian many-body model can also be exactly solved through
Bethe ansatz. By solving the Bethe ansatz equations accurately, the explicit
eigenfunction is obtained, and the model's density profiles and momentum
distributions are calculated to characterize the NHSE quantitatively. We find
that the NHSE is gradually suppressed on the repulsive side but does not vanish
as the repulsive interaction strength increases. On the attractive side, the
NSHE for bound-state solutions is enhanced as interaction strength grows. In
contrast, for the scattering state the NHSE shows a non-monotonic behavior in
the attractive side. Our work provides the first example of the NHSE in exactly
solvable many-body systems, and we envision that it can be extended to other
non-Hermitian many-body systems, especially to integrable models.

multienergy attenuation map for the interior of an object and extends the
traditional image volume into a 4D form. Compared with traditional CT based on
energy-integrating detectors, spectral CT can make full use of spectral
information, resulting in high resolution and providing accurate material
quantification. Numerous model-based iterative reconstruction methods have been
proposed for spectral CT reconstruction. However, these methods usually suffer
from difficulties such as laborious parameter selection and expensive
computational costs. In addition, due to the image similarity of different
energy bins, spectral CT usually implies a strong low-rank prior, which has
been widely adopted in current iterative reconstruction models. Singular value
thresholding (SVT) is an effective algorithm to solve the low-rank constrained
model. However, the SVT method requires manual selection of thresholds, which
may lead to suboptimal results. To relieve these problems, in this paper, we
propose a Sparse and lOw-rank UnroLling Network for spectral CT image

data-driven manner. Furthermore, a Taylor expansion-based neural network
backpropagation method is introduced to improve the numerical stability. The

composite subject to a biaxial stress state at a crack tip, specifically in
which one stress component is compressive and parallel to the crack. Based on
an experimental technique previously coined as The Gap Test and Bazant's Type
II Size Effect Law, it is found that there is a monotonic decrease in the Mode
I fracture energy as the crack parallel compressive stress increases. Compared
to the nominal value of fracture energy, where no crack parallel compression is
applied, the fracture energy is observed to decrease by up to 37% for a
compressive stress equal to 44% of the compressive failure limit of the
composite. This weakening effect is attributed to splitting cracks that are
induced at the crack tip due to the crack parallel compression, which are
identified via crack tip photomicroscopy. This is a novel result that
challenges the century old hypothesis of fracture energy being a constant
material property and further, shows for the first time that crack parallel
compression leads to a composite structure being dangerously weaker than
expected. The experimental campaign is also buttressed with a computational
campaign that provides a framework capable of capturing the effects of crack
parallel compression. Through the use of the crack band model, which correctly
characterizes the fracture process zone tensorially, coupled with a fully
tensorial damage law, the simulated results provide satisfactory agreement with
the experimental data. Conversely, when a reduced tensorial damage law defines
the crack band it is shown that the structural strength and fracture energy are
dangerously overpredicted. This emphasizes the importance of using a crack band
model coupled with a fully tensorial damage law to accurately predict fracture

$n\times n$ similarity matrix for optimization, which makes the memory and
computation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable
Cross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues. It firstly introduces a
collective matrix factorization to learn a common latent space from the
kernelized features of different modalities, and then transforms the similarity
matrix optimization to a distance-distance difference problem minimization with
the help of semantic labels and common latent space. Hence, the computational
complexity of the $n\times n$ asymmetric optimization is relieved. In the
generation of hash codes we also employ an orthogonal constraint of label
information, which is indispensable for search accuracy. So the redundancy of
computation can be much reduced. For efficient optimization and scalable to
large-scale datasets, we adopt the two-step approach rather than optimizing
simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Wiki,

XRF imaging, which uses a raster scan to acquire spectra across artworks,
provides the opportunity for spatial analysis of pigment distributions based on
their elemental composition. However, conventional XRF-based pigment
identification relies on time-consuming elemental mapping by expert
interpretations of measured spectra. To reduce the reliance on manual work,
recent studies have applied machine learning techniques to cluster similar XRF
spectra in data analysis and to identify the most likely pigments.
Nevertheless, it is still challenging for automatic pigment identification
strategies to directly tackle the complex structure of real paintings, e.g.
pigment mixtures and layered pigments. In addition, pixel-wise pigment
identification based on XRF imaging remains an obstacle due to the high noise
level compared with averaged spectra. Therefore, we developed a
deep-learning-based end-to-end pigment identification framework to fully
automate the pigment identification process. In particular, it offers high
sensitivity to the underlying pigments and to the pigments with a low
concentration, therefore enabling satisfying results in mapping the pigments

embedded in graph structure data under a strategy of hierarchical abstracting.
In this metric, it is necessary to decode the optimal encoding tree, i.e., the
optimal hierarchical abstracting. In dynamic graph scenarios, we usually need
to measure the structural entropy of the updated graph at any given time.
However, the current structural entropy methods do not support the efficient
incremental updating of an encoding tree. To address this issue, we propose a
novel incremental measurement method of structural entropy for dynamic graphs.
First, we present two new dynamic adjustment strategies for one- and
two-dimensional encoding trees. Second, we propose a new metric, namely Global
Invariant, to approximate the updated structural entropy in the computational
complexity of O(1). Besides, we define another metric, namely Local Difference,
as the difference between the updated structural entropy and the Global
Invariant, whose computational complexity is O(n). Third, new efficient
incremental algorithms, Incre-1dSE and Incre-2dSE, are designed for computing
the updated one- and two-dimensional structural entropy. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that the Local Difference and its first-order absolute
moment converge to 0 in order of O(log m/m). We conduct sufficient experiments
under dynamic graph datasets generated by Hawkes Process, Triad Closure

predictions from the teacher model have seriously limited its performance. In
this work, we propose a new Pseudo-Labeling framework for semi-supervised 3D
object detection, by enhancing the teacher model to a proficient one with
several necessary designs. First, to improve the recall of pseudo labels, a
Spatialtemporal Ensemble (STE) module is proposed to generate sufficient seed
boxes. Second, to improve the precision of recalled boxes, a Clusteringbased
Box Voting (CBV) module is designed to get aggregated votes from the clustered
seed boxes. This also eliminates the necessity of sophisticated thresholds to
select pseudo labels. Furthermore, to reduce the negative influence of wrongly
pseudo-labeled samples during the training, a soft supervision signal is
proposed by considering Box-wise Contrastive Learning (BCL). The effectiveness
of our model is verified on both ONCE and Waymo datasets. For example, on ONCE,
our approach significantly improves the baseline by 9.51 mAP. Moreover, with
half annotations, our model outperforms the oracle model with full annotations
on Waymo.

prepares a quantum many-body pure state in thermal or prethermal equilibrium.
The main physical intuition underlying the method is that the information on
the equilibrium states can be efficiently encoded/extracted by focusing on only
a few local observables, relying on the typicality of equilibrium states.
Instead of resorting to the expensive preparation protocol that adopts global
features such as the quantum state fidelity, we show that the equilibrium
states can be efficiently prepared only by learning the expectation values of
local observables. We demonstrate our method by preparing two illustrative
examples: Gibbs ensembles in non-integrable systems and generalized Gibbs
ensembles in integrable systems. Pure states prepared solely from local
observables are numerically shown to successfully encode the macroscopic
properties of the equilibrium states. Furthermore, we find that the preparation
errors, with respect to the system size, decay exponentially for Gibbs
ensembles and polynomially for generalized Gibbs ensembles, which are in
agreement with the finite-size fluctuation within thermodynamic ensembles. Our
method paves a path toward studying the thermodynamic and statistical
properties of quantum many-body systems in quantum hardware.

forming regions identified in the rest-UV. In this paper, we investigate the
internal structure of 12 of the most luminous $z\simeq 6-8$ galaxies in the EGS
field observed with recent {\it JWST}/NIRCam imaging. The systems appear clumpy
in the rest-UV, with more than half of the light coming from $\simeq 10^7$ to
10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$ star forming complexes that are $\simeq 150$ - 480 pc in
size. The clumps tend to be dominated by young stars (median = 36 Myr), but we
also find large variations in clump ages within individual galaxies. The
[OIII]+H$\beta$ EW varies significantly across individual galaxies (reflecting
differences in stellar and gas properties), but the HII regions largely track
the UV-bright complexes. Perhaps surprisingly, the rest-optical continuum is
just as clumpy as the UV, and we do not find older (and redder) nuclear stellar
components that were previously undetected or faint in the UV. The majority of
the stellar mass in bright $6<z<8$ galaxies appears to be contained in the
$\gtrsim 150$ pc-scale clumpy star forming complexes, reflecting the very
active phase of assembly that is common in reionization-era galaxies.

challenge of subsequent analyses is to recast the wealth of information into an

The classic localization problem tackles this question, transforming local

where pairwise distances are only available for bipartite data comprising two
classes of entries (such as antibody-virus interactions, drug-cell potency, or

localization and examine how each method behaves in the presence of noise,
outliers, and partially-observed data. As a proof of concept, we apply these

necessitates weakly inhibiting other viruses, and quantify how often

utility to learn transferable features for a range of downstream tasks by

employed separate encoders for each modality. However, recent work suggests
that transformers can support learning across multiple modalities and allow
knowledge sharing. Inspired by this, we investigate a variety of
Modality-Shared Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (MS-CLIP) frameworks.
More specifically, we question how many parameters of a transformer model can
be shared across modalities during contrastive pre-training, and rigorously
examine architectural design choices that position the proportion of parameters
shared along a spectrum. In studied conditions, we observe that a mostly
unified encoder for vision and language signals outperforms all other
variations that separate more parameters. Additionally, we find that
light-weight modality-specific parallel modules further improve performance.
Experimental results show that the proposed MS-CLIP approach outperforms
vanilla CLIP by up to 13\% relative in zero-shot ImageNet classification
(pre-trained on YFCC-100M), while simultaneously supporting a reduction of
parameters. In addition, our approach outperforms vanilla CLIP by 1.6 points in
linear probing on a collection of 24 downstream vision tasks. Furthermore, we
discover that sharing parameters leads to semantic concepts from different
modalities being encoded more closely in the embedding space, facilitating the
transferring of common semantic structure (e.g., attention patterns) from

orbits. First, we improve the fit to the dynamical stability criterion by
\citet{Mardling1999,Mardling2001} widely adopted in the previous literature.
Especially, we find that that the stability boundary is very sensitive to the
mutual inclination; coplanar retrograde triples and orthogonal triples are much
more stable and unstable, respectively, than coplanar prograde triples. Next,
we estimate the disruption timescales of triples satisfying the stability
condition up to $10^9$ times the inner orbital period. The timescales follow
the scaling predicted by \citet{Mushkin2020}, especially at high
$e_\mathrm{out}$ where their random walk model is most valid. We obtain an
improved empirical fit to the disruption timescales, which indicates that the
coplanar retrograde triples are significantly more stable than the previous
prediction. We furthermore find that the dependence on the mutual inclination
can be explained by the energy transfer model based on a parabolic encounter
approximation. We also show that the disruption timescales of triples are
highly sensitive to the tiny change of the initial parameters, reflecting the
genuine chaotic nature of the dynamics of those systems.

considered the convergence of this method and established some {\it a prior}
error bounds on the residual, the solution and the Largrange multiplier. In
this paper, we revisit the convergence of the GLTR method and try to improve
these bounds. First, we establish a sharper upper bound on the residual.
Second, we give a new bound on the distance between the approximation and the
exact solution, and show that the convergence of the approximation has nothing
to do with the associated spectral separation. Third, we present some
non-asymptotic bounds for the convergence of the Largrange multiplier, and
define a factor that plays an important role on the convergence of the
Largrange multiplier. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of

from a semimetallic to a semiconducting state by changing the transverse width
of the nanoribbon. Separation of spin-dependent conductances arises from the
effect of exchange field and the spin-orbit coupling, while zero-conductance
behaviors exhibit spin-dependent band gaps induced by the electric field. We
propose a device configuration of four-terminal tetragonal silicene nanoribbon
with two central channels. It is found that spin current can be controlled by
utilizing two switches. The switch with a high potential barrier can block
electrons flowing from the central scattering region into other terminals.
Interestingly, applying only one switch can realize spin-dependent zero
conductance and large spin polarization. Two switches can provide multiple
operations for controlling spin-dependent transport properties. The two-channel

paper aims to analyze the GD dynamics and the sharpness along the optimization
trajectory. Our analysis naturally divides the GD trajectory into four phases
depending on the change of the sharpness. We empirically identify the norm of
output layer weight as an interesting indicator of sharpness dynamics. Based on
this empirical observation, we attempt to theoretically and empirically explain
the dynamics of various key quantities that lead to the change of sharpness in

the macro-level guided-category knowledge and micro-level open-domain dialogue

resulting from a reversible Markov chain. A motivating application for studying
this problem is the estimation of the asymptotic variance in central limit
theorems for Markov chains. The asymptotic variance quantifies uncertainties in
averages of the form $M^{-1}\sum_{t=0}^{M-1}g(X_t)$, where $X_0,X_1,...$ are
iterates from a Markov chain. It is well known that the autocovariances from
reversible Markov chains can be represented as the moments of a unique positive
measure supported on $[-1,1]$. We propose a novel shape-constrained estimator
of the autocovariance sequence. Our approach is based on the key observation
that the representability of the autocovariance sequence as a moment sequence
imposes certain shape constraints, which we can exploit in the estimation
procedure. We examine the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator and
provide strong consistency guarantees for our estimator. In particular, for
reversible Markov chains satisfying a geometric drift condition, we show that
our estimator is strongly consistent for the true autocovariance sequence with
respect to an $\ell_2$ distance, and that our estimator leads to strongly
consistent estimates of the asymptotic variance. Finally, we perform empirical
studies to illustrate the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator as
well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator in comparison with
other current state-of-the-art methods for Markov chain Monte Carlo variance
estimation, including batch means, spectral variance estimators, and the
initial convex sequence estimator.

an algorithm with an improved convergence rate compared to the plain

  A further improvement in terms of efficiency is achieved by avoiding the
solution of a quadratic subproblem to compute a common step direction for all

different discretization of our inertial gradient-like dynamical system, we
obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method that does not require the

similar systems. Having data sorted can help produce query plans with
significantly lower run times. It also can provide other benefits like having
non-blocking operators which will produce data steadily (without bursts), or
operators with reduced memory footprint.
  Sorting may be required on any step of query processing, i.e., be it source
data or intermediate results. At the same time, the data to be sorted may not
fit into main memory. In this case, an external sort operator, which writes
intermediate results to disk, should be used.
  In this paper we consider an external sort operator of the comparison-based
sort type. We discuss its implementation and describe related design decisions.
Our aim is to study the impact on performance of a data structure used on the

  Results have shown that it is worthwhile to make an effort to implement an

  for Skin Lesion Classification","18 pages, 15 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The incidence rate for skin cancer has been steadily increasing throughout
the world, leading to it being a serious issue. Diagnosis at an early stage has
the potential to drastically reduce the harm caused by the disease, however,
the traditional biopsy is a labor-intensive and invasive procedure. In
addition, numerous rural communities do not have easy access to hospitals and
do not prefer visiting one for what they feel might be a minor issue. Using
machine learning and deep learning for skin cancer classification can increase
accessibility and reduce the discomforting procedures involved in the
traditional lesion detection process. These models can be wrapped in web or
mobile apps and serve a greater population. In this paper, two such models are
tested on the benchmark HAM10000 dataset of common skin lesions. They are
Random Forest with Stratified K-Fold Validation, and MobileNetV2 (throughout
the rest of the paper referred to as MobileNet). The MobileNet model was
trained separately using both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. A side-by-side
comparison of both deep learning and machine learning models and a comparison
of the same deep learning model on different frameworks for skin lesion
diagnosis in a resource-constrained mobile environment has not been conducted
before. The results indicate that each of these models fares better at
different classification tasks. For greater overall recall, accuracy, and
detection of malignant melanoma, the TensorFlow MobileNet was the better
choice. However, for detecting noncancerous skin lesions, the PyTorch MobileNet
proved to be better. Random Forest was the better algorithm when it came to
having a low computational cost with moderate correctness.

multi-view camera-only 3D detection, methods based on bird-eye-view or 3D
geometric representations can leverage the stereo cues from overlapped regions
between adjacent views and directly perform 3D detection without hand-crafted
post-processing. However, it lacks direct semantic supervision for 2D
backbones, which can be complemented by pretraining simple monocular-based
detectors. Our solution is a multi-view framework for 4D detection following
this paradigm. It is built upon a simple monocular detector FCOS3D++,
pretrained only with object annotations of Waymo, and converts multi-view
features to a 3D grid space to detect 3D objects thereon. A dual-path neck for
single-frame understanding and temporal stereo matching is devised to
incorporate multi-frame information. Our method finally achieves 49.75% mAPL
with a single model and wins 2nd place in the WOD challenge, without any
LiDAR-based depth supervision during training. The code will be released at

explanations of causal and non-causal semantics. This way, it will
significantly improve human understanding and confidence in the outcomes of
data analysis, facilitating accurate data interpretation and decision making in
the real world. XInsight is a three-module, end-to-end pipeline designed to
extract causal graphs, translate causal primitives into XDA semantics, and
quantify the quantitative contribution of each explanation to a data fact.
XInsight uses a set of design concepts and optimizations to address the
inherent difficulties associated with integrating causality into XDA.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets as well as a user study
demonstrate the highly promising capabilities of XInsight.

This work deals specifically with the automatic detection of contaminations

their eigenmodes, and the presence of exceptional points (EPs). Here, we derive
a closer form series expansion of the resolvent associated with an arbitrary

the underlying Hamiltonian. This in turn reveals an interesting and previously
overlocked feature of non-Hermitian systems, namely that their lineshape
scaling is dictated by how the input (excitation) and output (collection)
profiles are chosen. In particular, we demonstrate that a configuration with an
EP of order $M$ can exhibit a Lorentzian response or a super-Lorentzian
response of order $M_s$ with $M_s=2,3,\ldots,M$, depending on the choice of

software development. One major advantage of unit testing is the adjustable
trade-off between efficiency (i.e., testing effort) and effectiveness (i.e.,
fault-detection probability). To this end, various strategies have been
proposed to exploit this trade-off. In particular, test-suite reduction (TSR)
reduces the number of (presumably redundant) test cases while testing a single
program version. Regression-test selection (RTS) selects test cases for testing
consecutive program revisions. However, both TSR and RTS may influence -- or
even obstruct -- each others' performance when used in combination. For
instance, test cases discarded during TSR for a particular program version may
become relevant again for RTS. However, finding a combination of both
strategies leading to a reasonable trade-off throughout the version history of
a program is an open question. The goal of this paper is to gain a better
understanding of the interactions between TSR and RTS with respect to
efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we present a configurable framework
called RegreTS for automated unit-testing of C programs. The framework
comprises different strategies for TSR and RTS and possible combinations
thereof. We apply this framework to a collection of subject systems, delivering
several crucial insights. First, TSR has almost always a negative impact on the
effectiveness of RTS, yet a positive impact on efficiency. Second, test cases
revealing to testers the effect of program modifications between consecutive
program versions are far more effective than test cases simply covering
modified code parts, yet causing much more testing effort.

Here, we propose a statistical model based on physically-rooted contact
mechanics laws describing the micromechanics of individual junctions. The model
considers the quasi-static tangential loading, up to full sliding, of the
contact between a smooth rigid flat surface and a nominally flat linear elastic
rough surface comprising random independent spherical asperities, and accounts
for the coupling between adhesion and friction at the micro-junction level. The
model qualitatively reproduces both the macroscopic shear-induced contact area
reduction and, remarkably, the static friction peak without the need to
explicitly introduce two different friction levels. It also demonstrates how
the static friction peak and contact area evolution depend on the normal load
and certain key microscale interface properties such as surface energy, mode
mixity and frictional shear strength. ""Tougher"" interfaces (i.e. with larger
surface energy and smaller mode mixity parameter) are shown to result in a
larger real contact area and a more pronounced static friction peak. Overall,
this work provides important insights about how key microscale properties
operating at the asperity level can combine with the surface statistics to
reproduce important macroscopic responses observed in rough frictionalsoft

that can be optimally embedded into some member of $\mathscr{G}$. We provide a
necessary and sufficient condition for $B$ to be optimally spinor selective for
the genus $\mathscr{G}$, which generalizes previous existing optimal
selectivity criterions for Eichler orders as given by Arenas, Arenas-Carmona
and Contreras, and by Voight independently. This allows us to obtain a
refinement of the classical trace formula for optimal embeddings, which will be
called the spinor trace formula. When $\mathscr{G}$ is a genus of Eichler
orders, we extend Maclachlan's relative conductor formula for optimal
selectivity from Eichler orders of square-free levels to all Eichler orders.

technologies, such as quantum computing, require fast manipulations of quantum
systems in order to overcome the effect of decoherence. However, controlling
the speed of quantum dynamics is often very difficult due to both the lack of a
simple scaling property in the dynamics and the infinitely large parameter
space to be explored. Therefore, protocols for speed control based on
understanding on the dynamical properties of the system, such as non-trivial
scaling property, are highly desirable. Fast-forward scaling theory (FFST) was
originally developed to provide a way to accelerate, decelerate, stop and
reverse the dynamics of quantum systems. FFST has been extended in order to
accelerate quantum and classical adiabatic dynamics of various systems
including cold atoms, internal state of molecules, spins and solid-state
artificial atoms. This paper describes the basic concept of FFST and review the

the amplification of the curvature perturbations during the ultraslow-roll

remains to be scale invariant, which is consistent with the CMB observations,
and then it will have a transient $k^2$ growth and finally approach a $k^4$

enhanced to generate a sizable amount of primordial black holes. Furthermore,
when the high order correction in the dispersion relation of the curvature

been used in various interdisciplinary research projects with an increasing

out-of-core techniques for processing and visualization of volume data with

covers the orbital range between the 2/1 and 1/1 resonances with the planet. On
the other hand, the orbital space inner (closer to the host star) with respect
to the 2/1 resonance location is essentially long-term stable. This difference
arises because the adiabaticity parameter of subresonance multiplets
specifically depends on the particle's orbit size. The revealed effect may
control the structure of planetesimal disks in planetary systems: the orbital
zone between the 2/1 and 1/1 resonances with a planet should be normally free
from low-mass material (only that occasionally captured in the first-order 3/2

deal with high-dimensional data analysis. It was proposed as a tuning-free
robust approach for the high-dimensional regression and was demonstrated to
enjoy several statistical advantages over other approaches. The hdr lasso
problem is essentially an $L_1$-regularized optimization problem whose loss
function is Jaeckel's dispersion function with Wilcoxon scores. Due to the
nondifferentiability of the above loss function, many classical algorithms for
lasso-type problems are unable to solve this model. In this paper, inspired by
the adaptive sieving strategy for the exclusive lasso problem [23], we propose
an adaptive-sieving-based algorithm to solve the hdr lasso problem. The
proposed algorithm makes full use of the sparsity of the solution. In each
iteration, a subproblem with the same form as the original model is solved, but
in a much smaller size. We apply the proximal point algorithm to solve the
subproblem, which fully takes advantage of the two nonsmooth terms. Extensive

fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, most correction schemes rely on the
assumption that errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in space and time. In
superconducting qubits this assumption is drastically violated in the presence
of ionizing radiation, which creates bursts of high energy phonons in the
substrate. These phonons can break Cooper-pairs in the superconductor and,
thus, create quasiparticles over large areas, consequently reducing qubit
coherence across the quantum device in a correlated fashion. A potential
mitigation technique is to place large volumes of normal or superconducting
metal on the device, capable of reducing the phonon energy to below the
superconducting gap of the qubits. To investigate the effectiveness of this
method we fabricate a quantum device with four nominally identical
nanowire-based transmon qubits. On the device, half of the
niobium-titanium-nitride ground plane is replaced with aluminum (Al), which has
a significantly lower superconducting gap. We deterministically inject high
energy phonons into the substrate by voltage biasing a galvanically isolated
Josephson junction. In the presence of the low gap material, we find a factor
of 2-5 less degradation in the injection-dependent qubit lifetimes, and observe
that undesired excited qubit state population is mitigated by a similar factor.
We furthermore turn the Al normal with a magnetic field, finding no change in
the phonon-protection. This suggests that the efficacy of the protection in our
device is not limited by the size of the superconducting gap in the Al ground
plane. Our results provide a promising foundation for protecting
superconducting qubit processors against correlated errors from ionizing
radiation.

the high-energy spectrum of K2-3 with HST/COS and XMM-Newton, and use
empirically-driven estimates of Ly-alpha and extreme ultraviolet flux. We use
EXOFASTv2 to jointly fit radial velocity, transit, and SED data. This
constrains the K2-3 planet radii to 4% uncertainty and the masses of K2-3b and
c to 13% and 30%, respectively; K2-3d is not detected in RV measurements. K2-3b
and c are consistent with rocky cores surrounded by solar composition envelopes
(mass fractions of 0.36% and 0.07%), H2O envelopes (55% and 16%), or a mixture
of both. However, based on the high-energy output and estimated age of K2-3, it
is unlikely that K2-3b and c retain solar composition atmospheres. We pass the
planet parameters and high-energy stellar spectrum to atmospheric models.
Dialing the high-energy spectrum up and down by a factor of 10 produces
significant changes in trace molecule abundances, but not at a level detectable
with transmission spectroscopy. Though the K2-3 planets span the small planet
radius valley, the observed system architecture cannot be readily explained by
photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. We instead propose 1) the K2-3
planets are all volatile-rich, with K2-3d having a lower density than typical
of super-Earths, and/or 2) the K2-3 planet architecture results from more

to detect pulsars from long integration ($\sim$years) of archival data, as
reported by us earlier. Here we extend this method to include in the analysis
an additional $\sim$20% of the CZTI pixels that were earlier ignored due to
their lower gain values. Recent efforts have provided better and more secure

energy range. We compare the profiles of the Crab pulsar at different sub-bands
and show that the behaviour is consistent with the extended energy coverage. As
detailed spectroscopy over this full band remains difficult due to the limited

been experimentally identified, such as the Cooper pairs, excitons, and trions

Although the four-body irreducible entities have long been predicted
theoretically in a variety of physical systems alternatively as quadruplons,
quadrons, or quartets, the closely related experimental observation so far
seems to be restricted to the field of elementary particles (e.g. the recent
tetraquark at CERN). In this article, we present the first experimental
evidence for the existence of a four-body irreducible entity, the quadruplon,
involving two electrons and two holes in a monolayer of Molybdenum Ditelluride.
Using the optical pump-probe technique, we discovered a series of new spectral
features that are distinct from those of trions and bi-excitons. By solving the
four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in conjunction with the cluster expansion
approach, we are able to explain these spectral features in terms of the
four-body irreducible cluster or the quadruplons. In contrast to a bi-exciton
which consists of two weakly bound excitons, a quadruplon consists of two
electrons and two holes without the presence of an exciton. Our results provide
experimental evidences of the hitherto theorized four-body entities and thus
could impact the understanding of the structure of matter in a wide range of

based on event data. Process discovery, the most prominent category of process
mining techniques, aims to discover process models from event logs, however, it
leads to spaghetti models when working with real-life data. Therefore, several
clustering techniques have been proposed on top of traditional event logs
(i.e., event logs with a single case notion) to reduce the complexity of
process models and discover homogeneous subsets of cases. Nevertheless, in
real-life processes, particularly in the context of Business-to-Business (B2B)
processes, multiple objects are involved in a process. Recently, Object-Centric
Event Logs (OCELs) have been introduced to capture the information of such
processes, and several process discovery techniques have been developed on top
of OCELs. Yet, the output of the proposed discovery techniques on real OCELs
leads to more informative but also more complex models. In this paper, we
propose a clustering-based approach to cluster similar objects in OCELs to
simplify the obtained process models. Using a case study of a real B2B process,
we demonstrate that our approach reduces the complexity of the process models
and generates coherent subsets of objects which help the end-users gain

emission scenarios. In a recent study it has been argued that their peculiar
properties can be explained if emitting electrons are accelerated in a series
of oblique shocks induced by the recollimation of the relativistic jet.
However, new 3D simulations of recollimated, weakly magnetized jets reveal
that, in correspondence with the first recollimation shock, the flow develops a
rapidly growing instability, becomes highly turbulent and decelerates,
effectively hampering the formation of the multiple shock structure routinely
observed in 2D simulations. Building on these new findings, we propose here a
revised scenario for EHBL, in which the emission is produced by electrons
accelerated at the recollimation shock and subsequently further energized
through stochastic acceleration in the turbulent downstream flow. We apply a
simple version of this scenario to the prototypical EHBL 1ES 0229-200, showing
that the SED can be satisfactorily reproduced with standard values of the main
physical parameters.

images into their high-quality versions. A typical RealSR framework usually
includes the optimization of multiple criteria which are designed for different
image properties, by making the implicit assumption that the ground-truth
images can provide a good trade-off between different criteria. However, this
assumption could be easily violated in practice due to the inherent contrastive
relationship between different image properties. Contrastive learning (CL)
provides a promising recipe to relieve this problem by learning discriminative
features using the triplet contrastive losses. Though CL has achieved
significant success in many computer vision tasks, it is non-trivial to
introduce CL to RealSR due to the difficulty in defining valid positive image
pairs in this case. Inspired by the observation that the contrastive
relationship could also exist between the criteria, in this work, we propose a
novel training paradigm for RealSR, named Criteria Comparative Learning
(Cria-CL), by developing contrastive losses defined on criteria instead of
image patches. In addition, a spatial projector is proposed to obtain a good
view for Cria-CL in RealSR. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with the
typical weighted regression strategy, our method achieves a significant
improvement under similar parameter settings.

this point have addressed this problem with software engineering-specific
automated query reformulation techniques, which work without developer
involvement but are limited by the content of the original query. In other
words, these techniques automatically improve the existing query but can not
contribute new, previously unmentioned, concepts.
  Objective: In this paper, we propose a technique to guide software developers
in manually improving their own Web search queries. We examine a conversational
approach that follows unsuccessful queries with a clarification question aimed
at eliciting additional query terms, thus providing to the developer a clear
dimension along which the query could be improved.
  Methods: We describe a set of clarification questions derived from a corpus
of software developer queries and a neural approach to recommending them for a
newly issued query.
  Results: Our evaluation indicates that the recommendation technique is
accurate, predicting a valid clarification question 80% of the time and
outperforms simple baselines, as well as, state-of-the-art Learning To Rank

  Conclusion: As shown in the experimental results, the described approach is
capable at recommending appropriate clarification questions to software

$p$-dimensional analogue. Both cases are parametrised by a continuous ""spin""
$\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$.
  To motivate our construction, we first specialise to $q=i$, where we obtain a
modified XX Hamiltonian with unrolled quantum group symmetry, whose spectrum
and scaling limit is computed explicitly using free fermions. In the continuum,
this model is identified with the $(\eta,\xi)$ ghost CFT on the upper-half

Virasoro representations.
  Going back to generic $q$ we investigate the algebraic properties of the
underlying lattice algebras. We show that if $q^\alpha\notin\pm
q^{\mathbb{Z}}$, the new boundary coupling provides a faithful representation
of the blob algebra which is Schur-Weyl dual to $U_q\mathfrak{sl}_2$. Then,
modifying the boundary conditions on both the left and the right, we obtain a
representation of the universal two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra. The
generators and parameters of these representations are computed explicitly in
terms of $q$ and $\alpha$. Finally, we conjecture the general form of the
Schur-Weyl duality in this case.

evolution of planets and stars over long timescales. Tidally-forced inertial
waves (restored by the Coriolis acceleration) in the convective envelopes of
low-mass stars and giant gaseous planets contribute greatly to the tidal
dissipation when they are excited and subsequently damped (e.g. through viscous
friction), especially early in the life of a system. These waves are known to
be subject to nonlinear effects, including triggering differential rotation in
the form of zonal flows. In this study, we use a realistic tidal body forcing
to excite inertial waves through the residual action of the equilibrium tide in
the momentum equation for the waves. By performing 3D nonlinear hydrodynamical
simulations in adiabatic and incompressible convective shells, we investigate
how the addition of nonlinear terms affects the tidal flow properties, and the
energy and angular momentum redistribution. In particular, we identify and
justify the removal of terms responsible for unphysical angular momentum
evolution observed in a previous numerical study. Within our new set-up, we
observe the establishment of strong cylindrically-sheared zonal flows, which
modify the tidal dissipation rates from prior linear theoretical predictions.
We demonstrate that the effects of this differential rotation on the waves
neatly explains the discrepancies between linear and nonlinear dissipation
rates in many of our simulations. We also highlight the major role of both
corotation resonances and parametric instabilities of inertial waves, which are
observed for sufficiently high tidal forcing amplitudes or low viscosities, in
affecting the tidal flow response.

language questions about a video. Producing an answer requires understanding
the interplay across visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in
question. However, most leading VideoQA models work as black boxes, which make
the visual-linguistic alignment behind the answering process obscure. Such
black-box nature calls for visual explainability that reveals ``What part of
the video should the model look at to answer the question?''. Only a few works
present the visual explanations in a post-hoc fashion, which emulates the
target model's answering process via an additional method. Nonetheless, the
emulation struggles to faithfully exhibit the visual-linguistic alignment
during answering.
  Instead of post-hoc explainability, we focus on intrinsic interpretability to
make the answering process transparent. At its core is grounding the
question-critical cues as the causal scene to yield answers, while rolling out
the question-irrelevant information as the environment scene. Taking a causal
look at VideoQA, we devise a self-interpretable framework, Equivariant and
Invariant Grounding for Interpretable VideoQA (EIGV). Specifically, the
equivariant grounding encourages the answering to be sensitive to the semantic
changes in the causal scene and question; in contrast, the invariant grounding
enforces the answering to be insensitive to the changes in the environment
scene. By imposing them on the answering process, EIGV is able to distinguish
the causal scene from the environment information, and explicitly present the
visual-linguistic alignment. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
justify the superiority of EIGV in terms of accuracy and visual
interpretability over the leading baselines.

of ways. They occur more frequently close to solar maximum and declining phase,
are more common in larger solar cycles and show different patterns of
occurrence in odd- and even-numbered solar cycles. Our knowledge of the most
extreme space weather events, however, comes from the spikes in
cosmogenic-isotope ($^{14}$C, $^{10}$Be and $^{36}$Cl) records that are
attributed to significantly larger solar energetic particle (SEP) events than
have been observed during the space age. Despite both storms and SEPs being
driven by solar eruptive phenomena, the event-by-event correspondence between
extreme storms and extreme SEPs is low. Thus it should not be assumed a priori
that the solar cycle patterns found for storms also hold for SEPs and the
cosmogenic-isotope events. In this study we investigate the solar cycle trends
in the timing and magnitude of the 67 SEP ground-level enhancements (GLEs)
recorded by neutron monitors since the mid 1950s. Using a number of models of
GLE occurrence probability, we show that GLEs are around a factor four more
likely around solar maximum than around solar minimum, and that they
preferentially occur earlier in even-numbered solar cycles than in odd-numbered
cycles. There are insufficient data to conclusively determine whether larger
solar cycles produce more GLEs. Implications for putative space-weather events
in the cosmogenic-isotope records are discussed. We find that GLEs tend to
cluster within a few tens of days, likely due to particularly productive
individual active regions, and with approximately 11-year separations, owing to
the solar cycle ordering. But these timescales do not explain
cosmogenic-isotope spikes which require multiple extreme SEP events over
consecutive years.

to B9.5) and rotation rate (up to 350 km/s). We take advantage of the
multi-epoch observations to detect several binary systems or intrinsically
line-profile variables. A deconvolution algorithm is used to infer the current,
true (deprojected) rotational velocity distribution. We find a broad,
Gaussian-like distribution peaking around 200-250 km/s. Although some stars
populate the high-velocity tail, most stars in the cluster appear to rotate far
from critical. We discuss the chemical properties of the cluster, including the
low occurrence of abundance peculiarities in the late B stars and the paucity
of objects showing CN-cycle burning products at their surface. We argue that
the former result can largely be explained by the inhibition of diffusion
effects because of fast rotation, while the latter is generally in accord with
the predictions of single-star evolutionary models under the assumption of a
wide range of initial spin rates at the onset of main-sequence evolution.
However, we find some evidence for a less efficient mixing in two quite rapidly
rotating stars that are among the most massive objects in our sample. Finally,
we obtain a cluster age of ~20 Myrs through a detailed, star-to-star correction
of our results for the effect of stellar rotation. This is significantly older

patterns is indispensable for improving the decision-making of autonomous
vehicles, especially in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. This paper
develops a novel framework combining the hidden Markov model and graph
structure to identify the difference in dynamic interaction networks between
mandatory lane changes (MLC) and discretionary lane changes (DLC). A hidden
Markov model is developed to decompose LC interactions into homogenous segments
and reveal the temporal properties of these segments. Then, conditional mutual
information is used to quantify the interaction intensity, and the graph
structure is used to characterize the connectivity between vehicles. Finally,
the critical vehicle in each dynamic interaction network is identified. Based
on the LC events extracted from the INTERACTION dataset, the proposed
analytical framework is applied to modeling MLC and DLC under congested traffic
with levels of service E and F. The results show that there are multiple
heterogeneous dynamic interaction network structures in an LC process. A
comparison of MLC and DLC demonstrates that MLC are more complex, while DLC are
more random. The complexity of MLC is attributed to the intense interaction and
frequent transition of the interaction network structure, while the random DLC
demonstrate no obvious evolution rules and dominant vehicles in interaction
networks. The findings in this study are useful for understanding the
connectivity structure between vehicles in LC interactions, and for designing

how Feynman's path integral may be defined non-perturbatively, for such
theories, without a Wick rotation to imaginary time. We start by introducing a
class of smooth regulators which render interference integrals absolutely
convergent and thus unambiguous. The analyticity of the regulators allows us to
use Cauchy's theorem to deform the integration domain onto a set of relevant,
complex ""thimbles"" (or generalized steepest descent contours) each associated
with a classical saddle. The regulator can then be removed to obtain an exact,
non-perturbative representation. We show why the usual method of gradient flow,
used to identify relevant saddles and steepest descent ""thimbles"" for
finite-dimensional oscillatory integrals, fails in the infinite-dimensional
case. For the troublesome high frequency modes, we replace it with a method we
call ""eigenflow"" which we employ to identify the infinite-dimensional, complex
""eigenthimble"" over which the real time path integral is absolutely convergent.
We then bound the path integral over high frequency modes by the corresponding
Wiener measure for a free particle. Using the dominated convergence theorem we
infer that the interacting path integral defines a good measure. While the real
time path integral is more intricate than its Euclidean counterpart, it is
superior in several respects. It seems particularly well-suited to theories
such as quantum gravity where the classical theory is well developed but the
Euclidean path integral does not exist.

diffusion, with diffusion coefficient $D(x)=x$, in a potential

restricts the process to the positive side of the origin and therefore, Feller
diffusion can successfully model a vast array of phenomena in biological and
social sciences, where realization of negative values is forbidden. In our
analytically tractable model system, a particle that undergoes Feller diffusion
is subject to Poissonian resetting, i.e., taken back to its initial position at
a constant rate $r$, after random time epochs. We addressed the two distinct
cases that arise when the relative position of the absorbing boundary ($x_a$)
with respect to the initial position of the particle ($x_0$) differ, i.e., for
(a) $x_0<x_a$ and (b) $x_a<x_0$. We observe that for $x_0<x_a$, resetting
accelerates first-passage when $\theta<\theta_c$, where $\theta_c$ is a
critical value of $\theta$ that decreases when $x_a$ is moved away from the

probability distributions of the synchronous activity of large neuronal
populations. This method allows for finding the Boltzmann distribution with
single neuron biases and pairwise interactions that maximizes the entropy and
reproduces the empirical statistics of the recorded neuronal activity. Here we
apply this strategy to large populations of retinal output neurons (ganglion
cells) of different types, stimulated by multiple visual stimuli with their own
statistics. The activity of retinal output neurons is driven by both the inputs
from upstream neurons and the recurrent connections. We first apply the
standard inverse Ising model approach, and show that it accounts well for the
system's collective behavior when the input visual stimulus has short-ranged
spatial correlations, but fails for long-ranged ones. This happens because
stimuli with long-ranged spatial correlations synchronize the activity of
neurons over long distances. This effect cannot be accounted for by pairwise
interactions, and so by the pairwise Ising model. To solve this issue, we apply
a previously proposed framework that includes a temporal dependence in the
single neurons biases to model how neurons are driven in time by the stimulus.
Thanks to this addition, the stimulus effects are taken into account by the
biases, and the pairwise interactions allow for characterizing the network
effect in the population activity and for reproducing the structure of the
recurrent functional connections in the retinal architecture. We found that the
retinal architecture splits into weakly interacting subpopulations composed of
strongly interacting neurons. Overall, this temporal framework fixes the
problems of the standard, static, inverse Ising model and accounts for the
system's collective behavior, for stimuli with either short or long-range
correlations.

fields (from Digital Image Correlation) are locally matched to the kinematics
of one or multiple combined theoretical slip systems, based on the measured
crystal orientations. To identify the amounts of slip that conforms to the
measured kinematics, an optimization problem is solved for every datapoint
individually, resulting in a slip activity field for every considered slip
system. The identification framework is demonstrated and validated on an HCP
virtual experiment, for discrete and diffuse slip, incorporating 24 slip
systems. Experimental case studies on FCC and BCC metals show how full-field
identification of discrete slip, diffuse slip and cross-slip becomes feasible,
even when considering 48 slip systems for BCC. Moreover, the methodology is
extended into a dedicated cross-slip identification method, which directly
yields the orientation of the local slip plane trace orientation, purely based
on the measured kinematics and on one or two chosen slip directions. For even
more challenging cases revealing a persistent uncertainty in the slip
identification, a two-step identification approach can be employed, as is
demonstrated on a highly challenging HCP virtual experiment.

admission and routing of a single class of real-time transactions to multiple
heterogeneous clusters of web servers, each having its own queue and server
pool. Transactions come with response-time deadlines, staying until completion

incurred. Since computing an optimal policy is intractable, we aim to design
near optimal heuristic policies that are tractable for large-scale systems.
Four policies are developed: the static optimal Bernoulli-splitting (BS)
policy, and three index policies, based respectively on individually optimal
(IO) actions, one-step policy improvement (PI), and restless bandit (RB)
indexation. A computational study demonstrates that PI is the best of such

deep neural networks, are particularly vulnerable to attacks. One such
vulnerability that has been well studied is model extraction: a phenomenon in
which the attacker attempts to steal a victim's model by training a surrogate
model to mimic the decision boundaries of the victim model. Previous works have
demonstrated the effectiveness of such an attack and its devastating
consequences, but much of this work has been done primarily for image and text

{\em audio classification models}. We are motivated by an attacker whose goal
is to mimic the behavior of the victim's model trained to identify a speaker.
This is particularly problematic in security-sensitive domains such as
biometric authentication. We find that prior model extraction techniques, where
the attacker \textit{naively} uses a proxy dataset to attack a potential
victim's model, fail. We therefore propose the use of a generative model to
create a sufficiently large and diverse pool of synthetic attack queries. We
find that our approach is able to extract a victim's model trained on
\texttt{LibriSpeech} using queries synthesized with a proxy dataset based off

catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning. In this paper, we
propose one simple paradigm (named as S-Prompting) and two concrete approaches
to highly reduce the forgetting degree in one of the most typical continual
learning scenarios, i.e., domain increment learning (DIL). The key idea of the
paradigm is to learn prompts independently across domains with pre-trained
transformers, avoiding the use of exemplars that commonly appear in
conventional methods. This results in a win-win game where the prompting can
achieve the best for each domain. The independent prompting across domains only
requests one single cross-entropy loss for training and one simple K-NN
operation as a domain identifier for inference. The learning paradigm derives
an image prompt learning approach and a novel language-image prompt learning
approach. Owning an excellent scalability (0.03% parameter increase per
domain), the best of our approaches achieves a remarkable relative improvement
(an average of about 30%) over the best of the state-of-the-art exemplar-free
methods for three standard DIL tasks, and even surpasses the best of them
relatively by about 6% in average when they use exemplars. Source code is

and phenomenological modeling to investigate the complex charge-ordered states
that arise from interactions between the low-energy van Hove singularities
present in the electronic structure of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. We find two broad
classes of mixed iCDW-rCDW configurations: triple-$\mathbf{Q}$ iCDW,
triple-$\mathbf{Q}$ rCDW order, dubbed $3\mathbf{Q}$-$3\mathbf{Q}$, and
double-$\mathbf{Q}$ iCDW, single-$\mathbf{Q}$ rCDW order, dubbed
$2\mathbf{Q}$-$1\mathbf{Q}$. Moreover, we identify seven different types of
iCDW order, stemming from the different vanadium-orbital and kagome-sublattice
structures of the two pairs of van Hove singularities present above and below
the Fermi level. While the $2\mathbf{Q}$-$1\mathbf{Q}$ states trigger an
orthorhombic distortion that breaks the threefold rotational symmetry of the
kagome lattice, the $3\mathbf{Q}$-$3\mathbf{Q}$ states induce various types of
subsidiary uniform magnetic orders, from conventional ferromagnetism to
magnetic octupolar, magnetic toroidal, and even magnetic monopolar order. We
show that these exotic orders display unique magneto-striction,
magneto-electric, and magneto-electric-striction properties that can be probed
experimentally to identify which iCDW state is realized in these compounds. We
briefly discuss the impact of an out-of-plane modulation of the charge order

the Gaussian entanglement of formation. The behavior of these quantum

categories and object instances, e.g., ""sit on the chair"". The key challenge of
incorporating interaction semantics into the generation framework is to learn a
joint representation that effectively captures heterogeneous information,
including human body articulation, 3D object geometry, and the intent of the
interaction. To address this challenge, we design a novel transformer-based
generative model, in which the articulated 3D human body surface points and 3D
objects are jointly encoded in a unified latent space, and the semantics of the
interaction between the human and objects are embedded via positional encoding.
Furthermore, inspired by the compositional nature of interactions that humans
can simultaneously interact with multiple objects, we define interaction
semantics as the composition of varying numbers of atomic action-object pairs.
Our proposed generative model can naturally incorporate varying numbers of
atomic interactions, which enables synthesizing compositional human-scene
interactions without requiring composite interaction data. We extend the PROX
dataset with interaction semantic labels and scene instance segmentation to
evaluate our method and demonstrate that our method can generate realistic
human-scene interactions with semantic control. Our perceptual study shows that
our synthesized virtual humans can naturally interact with 3D scenes,
considerably outperforming existing methods. We name our method COINS, for

associated by a modality-aware spatial graph to detect the co-occurrence among

a deterministic scanning path, Multimodal-GuideNet allows for scanning
diversity by estimating the probability distribution of real scans. Experiments

skill requirements based on these methods using a U.K. dataset of job

the identified skills using wage regressions. Finally, we compare the different
methods by the wage variation they can explain, assuming that better-identified
skills will explain a higher fraction of the wage variation in the labor

they can explain only about 20% of the wage variation, while the LDA model
explains about 45% of it.

device applications. The state-of-the-art for high quality graphene devices is
based on heterostructures made with graphene encapsulated in $>80\,$nm-thick
flakes of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Unfortunately, scaling up multilayer
hBN while precisely controlling the number of layers remains an elusive
challenge, resulting in a rough material unable to enhance the mobility of
graphene. This leads to the pursuit of alternative, scalable materials, which
can be simultaneously used as substrate and encapsulant for graphene. Tungsten
disulfide (WS$_2$) is a transition metal dichalcogenide, which was successfully
grown in large ($\sim$mm-size) multi-layers by chemical vapour deposition.
However, the resistance \textit{vs} gate voltage characteristics when gating
graphene through WS$_2$ exhibit largely hysteretic shifts of the charge
neutrality point (CNP) in the order of $\Delta n\sim$2.6$\cdot$10$^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$, hindering the use of WS$_2$ as a reliable encapsulant. The
hysteresis originates due to the charge traps from sulfur vacancies present in
WS$_2$. In this work, we report for the first time the use of WS$_2$ as a
substrate and the overcoming of hysteresis issues by chemically treating WS$_2$
with a super-acid, which passivates these vacancies and strips the surface from
contaminants. The hysteresis is significantly reduced below the noise level by
at least a factor five (to $\Delta n<$5$\cdot$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) and,
simultaneously, the room-temperature mobility of WS$_2$-encapsulated graphene
is as high as $\sim$6.2$\cdot$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at a carrier
density $n$ $\sim$1$\cdot$ 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. Our results promote WS$_2$ to a
valid alternative to hBN as encapsulant for high-performance graphene devices.

Photochromic materials such as diarylethene derivatives exhibit semiconducting

nanofocusing, which allows the creation of a nanolight source at the apex of a

propagating plasmons. We utilized an aluminum tapered structure and realized
in-situ wavelength control between visible and UV light at the nanoscale. Using
this method, nanoscale optical switching between the two states of diarylethene
was demonstrated. The switching performance was confirmed for at least nine

learning and adaptive viral marketing, can be formulated as an adaptive
submodular maximization problem. Most of existing studies on adaptive
submodular optimization focus on either monotone case or non-monotone case.
Specifically, if the utility function is monotone and adaptive submodular,
\cite{golovin2011adaptive} developed a greedy policy that achieves a $(1-1/e)$
approximation ratio subject to a cardinality constraint. If the utility
function is non-monotone and adaptive submodular, \cite{tang2021beyond} showed
that a random greedy policy achieves a $1/e$ approximation ratio subject to a
cardinality constraint. In this work, we aim to generalize the above mentioned
results by studying the partial-monotone adaptive submodular maximization
problem. To this end, we introduce the notation of adaptive monotonicity ratio
$m\in[0,1]$ to measure the degree of monotonicity of a function. Our main
result is to show that a random greedy policy achieves an approximation ratio
of $m(1-1/e)+(1-m)(1/e)$ if the utility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and
adaptive submodular. Notably this result recovers the aforementioned $(1-1/e)$
and $1/e$ approximation ratios when $m = 0$ and $m = 1$, respectively. We
further extend our results to consider a knapsack constraint. We show that a
sampling-based policy achieves an approximation ratio of $(m+1)/10$ if the
utility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. One
important implication of our results is that even for a non-monotone utility
function, we still can achieve an approximation ratio close to $(1-1/e)$ if
this function is ``close'' to a monotone function. This leads to improved
performance bounds for many machine learning applications whose utility
functions are almost adaptive monotone.

localize human joints from images and videos. Pose representation is normally
limited to 3D joint positional/translational degrees of freedom (3DOFs),
however, a further three rotational DOFs (6DOFs) are required for many
potential biomechanical applications. Positional DOFs are insufficient to
analytically solve for joint rotational DOFs in a 3D human skeletal model.
Therefore, we propose a temporal inverse kinematics (IK) optimization technique
to infer joint orientations throughout a biomechanically informed, and
subject-specific kinematic chain. For this, we prescribe link directions from a
position-based 3D pose estimate. Sequential least squares quadratic programming
is used to solve a minimization problem that involves both frame-based pose
terms, and a temporal term. The solution space is constrained using joint DOFs,
and ranges of motion (ROMs). We generate 3D pose motion sequences to assess the
IK approach both for general accuracy, and accuracy in boundary cases. Our
temporal algorithm achieves 6DOF pose estimates with low Mean Per Joint Angular
Separation (MPJAS) errors (3.7{\deg}/joint overall, & 1.6{\deg}/joint for lower
limbs). With frame-by-frame IK we obtain low errors in the case of bent elbows
and knees, however, motion sequences with phases of extended/straight limbs
results in ambiguity in twist angle. With temporal IK, we reduce ambiguity for
these poses, resulting in lower average errors.

fraction ($\sim 20\%-30\%$) of starbursts cannot be matched to QPSBs or QGs.
The implications are: (1) some starbursts do not quench rapidly. (2)
Satellite-quenching mechanisms operating in high density environments cannot
account for most QPSBs. (3) The evolution from starbursts to QPSBs to QGs is
not the dominant path at $z < 0.2$. (4) Starbursts are not mainly triggered by

  Observations from Open-Source and Closed-Source Software Development","33 pages, 17 figures, journal submission",,,,"cs.SE cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In software development teams, developer turnover is among the primary
reasons for project failures as it leads to a great void of knowledge and
strain for the newcomers. Unfortunately, no established methods exist to
measure how knowledge is distributed among development teams. Knowing how this
knowledge evolves and is owned by key developers in a project helps managers
reduce risks caused by turnover. To this end, this paper introduces a novel,
realistic representation of domain knowledge distribution: the ConceptRealm. To
construct the ConceptRealm, we employ a latent Dirichlet allocation model to
represent textual features obtained from 300k issues and 1.3M comments from 518
open-source projects. We analyze whether the newly emerged issues and
developers share similar concepts or how aligned the developers' concepts are
with the team over time. We also investigate the impact of leaving members on
the frequency of concepts. Finally, we evaluate the soundness of our approach
to closed-source software, thus allowing the validation of the results from a
practical standpoint. We find out that the ConceptRealm can represent the
high-level domain knowledge within a team and can be utilized to predict the
alignment of developers with issues. We also observe that projects exhibit many
keepers independent of project maturity and that abruptly leaving keepers harm
the team's concept familiarity.

  adaptive occlusion sensitivity analysis","10 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a method for visually explaining the decision-making
process of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a temporal extension of
occlusion sensitivity analysis. The key idea here is to occlude a specific
volume of data by a 3D mask in an input 3D temporal-spatial data space and then
measure the change degree in the output score. The occluded volume data that
produces a larger change degree is regarded as a more critical element for
classification. However, while the occlusion sensitivity analysis is commonly
used to analyze single image classification, it is not so straightforward to
apply this idea to video classification as a simple fixed cuboid cannot deal
with the motions. To this end, we adapt the shape of a 3D occlusion mask to
complicated motions of target objects. Our flexible mask adaptation is
performed by considering the temporal continuity and spatial co-occurrence of
the optical flows extracted from the input video data. We further propose to
approximate our method by using the first-order partial derivative of the score
with respect to an input image to reduce its computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method through various and extensive comparisons with
the conventional methods in terms of the deletion/insertion metric and the
pointing metric on the UCF-101. The code is available at:

space transformation operation tends to cause the loss of some poisoned

to achieve the corresponding backdoor attack success rate. To solve the above
problems, we propose the idea of feature repair for the first time and
introduce the blind watermark technique to repair the poisoned features lost

consistent labeling, we propose a low-poisoning rate invisible backdoor attack

the new method enhances the mapping relationship between the source images with

thus achieving a high backdoor attack success rate with a very low poisoning
rate. Ultimately, the detailed experimental results show that the goal of
achieving a high success rate of backdoor attacks with a very low poisoning
rate is achieved on all MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet datasets.

permeability-enhancement observed experimentally at $\sim$nm-size radii remains
poorly understood, and suggests emergence of puzzling non-classical mechanisms.
Here we address water-CNT friction from a quantum-mechanical perspective, in
terms of water-energy loss upon phonon excitation. We find that combined weak
water-phonon coupling and selection rules hinder water-CNT scattering,
providing effective protection to water superflow, whereas comparison with a
semiclassical theory evidences a friction increase that can exceed the

archival data obtained with the XMM-Newton satellite, we modelled the spectra
with two blackbody components which we interpret as thermal emission from the
inner accretion flow and the regions around or beyond the spherization radius.
The luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation of each spectral component agrees
with the L proportional T^4 relationship expected from a thin disc model, which
suggests that the accretion rate is close to the Eddington limit. However,
there are some small deviations at the highest luminosities, possibly due to an
expansion of the disc and a contribution from the wind at higher accretion
rates. Assuming that such deviations are due to the crossing of the Eddington
or supercritical accretion rate, we estimate a compact object mass of 6-14
Msun, favouring a stellar-mass black hole as the accretor.

  Wireless Communications (March 2023)",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Future wireless networks are expected to support diverse mobile services,
including artificial intelligence (AI) services and ubiquitous data
transmissions. Federated learning (FL), as a revolutionary learning approach,
enables collaborative AI model training across distributed mobile edge devices.
By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels,
over-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices
over the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication
cost of FL. In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and
traditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network. We propose a
coexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication
framework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an OFDM
system. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee
a given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource
allocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the
coexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication
between the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the
challenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication
ratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The
analysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio
that minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to
converge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a
low-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource
allocation for both the FL devices and IT devices. Extensive numerical
simulations verify the superior performance of the proposed design for the
coexistence of FL and IT devices in wireless cellular systems.

as toy models to probe universal properties of conformal field theory (CFT)
using the gauge/gravity duality. In this context, we are particularly
interested in generalized quasi-topological gravities, i.e., theories whose
equations of motion for statically spherically symmetric solutions are of
second order at most. Here, we characterize the number of these theories
existing at a given curvature order and dimensions. Moreover, we show that any
effective higher-curvature theory is connected, via field redefinitions to some
generalized quasi-topological gravity. The situation is special for three
spacetime dimensions, as theories of this type have trivial equations of
motion. However, when matter fields are added into the picture, the equations
of motion become non-trivial, describing, among other solutions,
multiparametric generalizations of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole.
  From the CFT side, entanglement entropy arises as a prominent quantity that
encodes important information about the field theory, such as the type A and
type B trace anomalies in even dimensions and the sphere free energy of the
theory in odd dimensions when considering spherical entangling regions. As
entanglement entropy also includes divergences, we employ the Kounterterms
scheme to extract the physically relevant quantities. In the case of
three-dimensional CFTs dual to Einstein gravity, we show that the finite part
is isolated and can be written in terms of the Willmore energy, providing an
upper bound based on its properties. We extend this remarkable result to
arbitrary CFTs under consideration. Besides, we show the validity of the
Kounterterms scheme for general quadratic curvature gravity, extracting the
type A, type B anomalies of the theory in even dimensions and the sphere free
energy in odd ones.

nonsmooth optimization problems, in particular those arising in machine
learning. We propose a new primal-dual algorithm, in which the dual update is
randomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the
problem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen
dual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the
proximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A
nonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm
finds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth
functions, possibly composed with linear operators. We derive linear
convergence results in presence of strong convexity; these results are new even
in the deterministic case, when our algorithms reverts to the recently proposed
Primal-Dual Davis-Yin algorithm. Some randomized algorithms of the literature
are also recovered as particular cases (e.g., Point-SAGA). But our
randomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms
beyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the
convergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction
mechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is
used. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be significantly
reduced. Overall, randomness helps getting faster algorithms. This has long
been known for stochastic-gradient-type algorithms, and our work shows that
this fully applies in the more general primal-dual setting as well.

(p.k) for each category k. We propose three criteria to determine the minimum n
required in light of existing criteria developed for binary outcomes. The first
criteria aims to minimise the model overfitting. The second aims to minimise
the difference between the observed and adjusted R2 Nagelkerke. The third
criterion aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely. For criterion
(i), we show the sample size must be based on the anticipated Cox-snell R2 of
distinct one-to-one logistic regression models corresponding to the sub-models
of the multinomial logistic regression, rather than on the overall Cox-snell R2
of the multinomial logistic regression. We tested the performance of the
proposed criteria (i) through a simulation study, and found that it resulted in
the desired level of overfitting. Criterion (ii) and (iii) are natural
extensions from previously proposed criteria for binary outcomes. We illustrate
how to implement the sample size criteria through a worked example considering
the development of a multinomial risk prediction model for tumour type when
presented with an ovarian mass. Code is provided for the simulation and worked

cover the same time span in the signals. Together with this technique, we apply
the cross attention to aggregate the sequential information from the aligned

applying the global attention mechanism onto each modality. Then, the attention
weights of each modality are applied directly to the other modality in a
crossed way, so that the CAN gathers the audio and text information from the

shows that dust particles with a size of $\le 10\,{\rm \mu m}$ are coupled with

large grains significantly increase the dust-to-gas mass ratio around and

inner acceleration region (IAR) above the pulsar polar cap. The surface of the
polar cap is heated to temperatures around $10^6$ K and forms a partially
screened gap (PSG) due to thermionic emission of positively charged ions from
the stellar surface. The sparks lag behind the co-rotation speed during their
lifetimes due to variable $E$x$B$ drift. In a PSG the sparking discharges arise
in locations where the surface temperatures go below the critical level ($T_i$)
for ions to freely flow from the surface. The sparking commences due to the
large potential drop developing along the magnetic field lines in these lower
temperature regions and subsequently the back streaming particles heat the
surface to $T_i$. The temperature regulation requires the polar cap to be
tightly filled with sparks and a continuous presence of sparks is required
around its boundary since no heating is possible from the closed field line
region. We have estimated the time evolution of the sparking system in the IAR
which shows a gradual shift in the spark formation along two distinct
directions resembling clockwise and anti-clockwise motion in two halves of the
polar cap. Due to the differential shift of the sparking pattern in the two
halves, a central spark develops representing the core emission. The temporal
evolution of the sparking process was simulated for different orientations of
the non-dipolar polar cap and reproduced the diverse observational features
associated with subpulse drifting.

we aim to improve SDF models using priors provided by parametric

parametric models and use them to align SDFs in 3D space. We show that such

Although it has been suggested that Markov blankets are commonplace in sparsely

Here, we show in two different examples (a pair of coupled Lorenz systems and a
nonequilibrium Ising model) that sparse connectivity does not guarantee Markov
blankets in the steady-state density of nonequilibrium systems. Conversely, in
the nonequilibrium Ising model explored, the more distant from equilibrium the
system appears to be correlated with the distance from displaying a Markov

order to assume the presence of Markov blankets in the kind of nonequilibrium
processes describing the activity of living systems.

has a ``wrong-sign'' shift, making it somewhat more akin to a Helmholtz
operator, with lowest-energy modes arising from certain plane waves, than an
elliptic one. In this paper, we analyze and compare three finite-element
formulations for such PDEs, based on $H^2$-conforming elements, the $C^0$
interior penalty method, and a mixed finite-element formulation that explicitly
introduces approximations to the gradient of the solution and a Lagrange
multiplier. The conforming method is simple but is impractical to apply in
three dimensions; the interior-penalty method works well in two and three
dimensions but has lower-order convergence and (in preliminary experiments)
seems difficult to precondition; the mixed method uses more degrees of freedom,
but works well in both two and three dimensions, and is amenable to monolithic
multigrid preconditioning. Numerical results verify the finite-element
convergence for all discretizations, and illustrate the trade-offs between the

have a meaningful impact on the scaling relations as well as on the halo
morphology. The galaxy rotational velocity field (calculated with the velocity
of the gas disc and the acceleration fields) deviates from the typical values
of the Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) in GR. For a given stellar mass, f(R)
gravity tends to produce greater maximum velocities. On the other hand, the
mass in haloes in f(R) gravity is more concentrated than their counterparts in
GR. This trend changes when the concentration is calculated with the dynamical
density profile, which takes into account the unscreened outer regions of the
halo. Stellar discs interact with the overall potential well in the central
regions, modifying the morphology of the screening regions and reshaping them.
We find a trend for galaxies with a more dominant stellar disc to deviate
further from round screening regions. We find that small haloes are less
triaxial and more round in f(R) than their GR counterparts. The difference
between halo morphology becomes smaller in f(R) haloes whose inner regions are
screened. These results suggest possible observables that could unveil modified
gravity effects on galaxies in voids in future cosmological tests of gravity.

(DoA) and Time-of-Arrival (ToA) estimation in multipath environments. The
proposed ultra-wideband technique is based on phase-mode expansions and the use
of nearly frequency-invariant elliptical arrays. New possibilities open with
the present approach, as not only elliptical, but also circular and linear
(highly flattened) arrays can be considered with the same implementation.
Systematic selection/rejection of signals-of-interest/signals-not-of-interest
in smart wireless environments is possible, unlike with previous approaches
based on circular arrays. Concentric elliptical arrays of many sizes and
eccentricities can be jointly considered, with the subsequent improvement that
entails in DoA and ToA detection. This leads to the realization of
pseudo-random array patterns; namely, quasi-arbitrary geometries created from
the superposition of multiple elliptical arrays. Some simulation and
experimental tests (measurements in an anechoic chamber) are carried out for
several frequency bands to check the correct performance of the method. The
method is proven to give accurate estimations in all tested scenarios, and to
be robust against noise and position uncertainty in sensor placement.

problem that even state-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to

in real-world due to large camera-object distance. Because small objects occupy
only a small area in the input image (e.g., less than 10%), the information
extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision
making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working
at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the
performance of SOD deep learning based methods. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and
2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the
existing literature and provide a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture
of current research. We investigate how to improve the performance of small

by adjusting the process pressure. The system with sharper confinement displays
clearer quantum oscillations and Kondo-like temperature dependence of
resistance. OVs close to the surface behaving like a correlated Anderson
impurity is responsible for the Kondo behaviour. Quantum oscillations are less
prominent in the weakly confined system. A cross-over from weak-localization to
anti-localization with temperature is seen, but no Kondo behavior. The process
also results in a transparent conductor amenable to lithographic patterning.

IOLW safety layer has already been presented recently [1]. In this paper, the
overall attack surface of IOLW within its typical environment is analyzed and
attack preconditions are investigated to assess the effectiveness of different

the communication systems and the results are summarized. Also, interference of
security measures and functional safety principles within the communication are
investigated, which do not necessarily complement one another but may also have
contradictory requirements. This work is intended to discuss and propose
enhancements of the IOLW standard with additional security considerations in
future implementations.

  Clinical studies using real-world data may benefit from exploiting clinical
reports, a particularly rich albeit unstructured medium. To that end, natural
language processing can extract relevant information. Methods based on transfer
learning using pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art
results in most NLP applications; however, publicly available models lack
exposure to speciality-languages, especially in the medical field.
  Objective
  We aimed to evaluate the impact of adapting a language model to French
clinical reports on downstream medical NLP tasks.
  Methods
  We leveraged a corpus of 21M clinical reports collected from August 2017 to
July 2021 at the Greater Paris University Hospitals (APHP) to produce two
CamemBERT architectures on speciality language: one retrained from scratch and
the other using CamemBERT as its initialisation. We used two French annotated
medical datasets to compare our language models to the original CamemBERT
network, evaluating the statistical significance of improvement with the
Wilcoxon test.
  Results
  Our models pretrained on clinical reports increased the average F1-score on
APMed (an APHP-specific task) by 3 percentage points to 91%, a statistically
significant improvement. They also achieved performance comparable to the
original CamemBERT on QUAERO. These results hold true for the fine-tuned and
from-scratch versions alike, starting from very few pre-training samples.
  Conclusions
  We confirm previous literature showing that adapting generalist pre-train
language models such as CamenBERT on speciality corpora improves their
performance for downstream clinical NLP tasks. Our results suggest that
retraining from scratch does not induce a statistically significant performance
gain compared to fine-tuning.

unknown degradations by directly estimating them or learning the degradation
representations in a latent space. A potential limitation of these methods is
that they assume the unknown degradations can be simulated by the integration
of various handcrafted degradations (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which is not
necessarily true. The real-world degradations can be beyond the simulation
scope by the handcrafted degradations, which are referred to as novel
degradations. In this work, we propose to learn a latent representation space
for degradations, which can be generalized from handcrafted (base) degradations
to novel degradations. The obtained representations for a novel degradation in
this latent space are then leveraged to generate degraded images consistent
with the novel degradation to compose paired training data for SR model.
Furthermore, we perform variational inference to match the posterior of
degradations in latent representation space with a prior distribution (e.g.,
Gaussian distribution). Consequently, we are able to sample more high-quality
representations for a novel degradation to augment the training data for SR
model. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets to validate the effectiveness and advantages of our method for blind
super-resolution with novel degradations.

paper uses songs as a case study to study the multiple facets of uniqueness and
their relationship with success. We first unpack the multiple facets of a
song's novelty or uniqueness and, next, measure its impact on a song's
popularity. We employ a series of statistical models to study the relationship
between a song's popularity and novelty associated with its lyrics, chord
progressions, or audio properties. Our analyses performed on a dataset of over
fifty thousand songs find a consistently negative association between all types
of song novelty and popularity. Overall we found a song's lyrics uniqueness to
have the most significant association with its popularity. However, audio
uniqueness was the strongest predictor of a song's popularity, conditional on
the song's genre. We further found the theme and repetitiveness of a song's
lyrics to mediate the relationship between the song's popularity and novelty.
Broadly, our results contradict the ""optimal distinctiveness theory"" (balance

multiple dimensions along which a cultural product's uniqueness could manifest.

structure of charged compact stars have been derived and solved numerically for
a gravity model with $f(R,T)= R+ 2\beta T$. For simplicity, we assume that the
charge density is proportional to the energy density, namely, $\rho_{\rm ch} =
\alpha \rho$. It is demonstrated that matter-geometry coupling constant $\beta$
and the charge parameter $\alpha$ affect the total gravitational mass and the

For a better understanding of text in scenes, it is more desired to detect
contextual text blocks (CTBs) which consist of one or multiple integral text
units (e.g., characters, words, or phrases) in natural reading order and
transmit certain complete text messages. This paper presents contextual text
detection, a new setup that detects CTBs for better understanding of texts in
scenes. We formulate the new setup by a dual detection task which first detects
integral text units and then groups them into a CTB. To this end, we design a
novel scene text clustering technique that treats integral text units as tokens
and groups them (belonging to the same CTB) into an ordered token sequence. In
addition, we create two datasets SCUT-CTW-Context and ReCTS-Context to
facilitate future research, where each CTB is well annotated by an ordered
sequence of integral text units. Further, we introduce three metrics that
measure contextual text detection in local accuracy, continuity, and global
accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method accurately detects CTBs

the ratio of the number of observations to the number of parameters has been
found to be quite small for the commonly used winning margin power rating
(WMPR) model. This usually leads to imprecise estimates and inaccurate
predictions in such a three-on-three game. With the finding of a clustering
feature in estimated robot strengths, a more flexible model with latent
clusters of robots was proposed to alleviate overparameterization of the WMPR
model. Since its structure can be regarded as a dimension reduction of the
parameter space in the WMPR model, the identification of clusters of robot
strengths is naturally transformed into a model selection problem. Instead of
comparing a huge number of competing models, we develop an effective method to
estimate the number of clusters, clusters of robots, and robot strengths. The
new method consists of two parts: (i) a combination of hierarchical and
non-hierarchical classifications to determine candidate models; and (ii)
variant goodness-of-fit criteria to select optimal models. Different from
existing hierarchical classification systems, each step of ours is based on
estimated robot strengths from a candidate model in the preceding
non-hierarchical classification step. A great advantage of the designed
non-hierarchical classification system is to examine the possibility of
reassigning robots to other cluster sets of robots. To reduce the
overestimation of clusters by the mean squared prediction error criteria, the
corresponding BIC are established as alternatives for model selection. By
assembling these essential elements into a coherent whole, a systematic
procedure is presented to perform the estimation. In addition, we propose two
indices to measure the nested relation between cluster sets of two models and
monotonic association between robot strengths of two models.

demonstrate that many assumptions specific to Earth-based life, e.g. specific

explore a simple model of a single-species microbial biosphere that produces

biological parameters has a large impact on the biosphere's total population,
such changes have only a minimal impact on the strength of the resulting

model to include more accurate microbial energy harvesting and show that
adjusting microbe parameters can lead to a regime change where the biosphere
becomes limited by energy availability and no longer fully exploits the
available H2, impacting the strength of the resulting biosignature. We
demonstrate that, for a nutrient limited biosphere, identifying the limiting
nutrient, understanding the abiotic processes that control its abundance, and
determining the biosphere's ability to exploit it, are more fundamental for
making type I biosignature predictions than the details of the population

the positive operator-valued measurements (POVM) invasiveness before and after
the boosts. While the relativistic principle is universal and requires Lorentz
invariance of quantum correlations in the entire system, we have found specific
partitions where quantum correlations stored in particular subsystems are not
invariant. We calculate quantum discords corresponding of the states before and
after applying a boost, and observe that the state gains extra discord after
the boost. When analyzing the invasiveness of the POVMs, we have found that the
POVM applied to the initial entangled state reduces the discord to zero.
However, discord of the boosted state survives after the same POVM. Thus we
conclude that the quantum discord generated by Lorentz boost is robust
concerning the protective POVM, while the measurement exerts an invasive effect

training samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category
embeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new
class for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge,
thus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale. Significantly,
these two designs provide representation capability for classes with sufficient

($\delta J$). In spite of the complex structure of this material, first
principle calculations show that its magnetic properties are only controlled by
the nearest neighbor's Heisenberg exchange interaction, and other interactions
do not affect spin arrangements in the ground state. Thus, this material is
considered a suitable candidate for studying electron correlation in spin
glasses. Using a replica-exchange framework, Monte Carlo simulations indicate
that no phase transition is observed when magnetic susceptibility changes with
temperature. Based on $\delta J$ and the spin Hamiltonian, 2.6 (K) is obtained
as the phase transition temperature.

propose a density-driven higher-order topological phase transition in a
two-dimensional amorphous system. We demonstrate that the amorphous system
hosts a topological trivial phase at low density. With an increase in the
density of lattice sites, the topological trivial phase converts to a
higher-order topological phase characterized by a quantized quadrupole moment
and the existence of topological corner states. Furthermore, we confirm that
the density-driven higher-order topological phase transition is size dependent.
In addition, our results should be general and equally applicable to
three-dimensional amorphous systems. Our findings may greatly enrich the study
of higher-order topological states in amorphous systems.

discrete-time delay estimation method in Laguerre-domain, i.e. with the delay
block input and output signals being represented by the corresponding Laguerre
series. A novel Laguerre domain disturbance model is devised, which allows the
involved signals to be square-summable sequences and is suitable in a number of
important applications. The relation to two commonly used time-domain
disturbance models is clarified. Furthermore, by forming the input signal in a
certain way, the signal shape of an additive output disturbance can be
estimated and utilized for noise reduction. It is demonstrated that a

labels to group tracking results for per-class evaluation. Similarly, MOT

two prevalent strategies in MOT implicitly assume that the classification
performance is near-perfect. However, this is far from the case in recent
large-scale MOT datasets, which contain large numbers of classes with many rare

classification leads to sub-optimal tracking and inadequate benchmarking of
trackers. We address these issues by disentangling classification from
tracking. We introduce a new metric, Track Every Thing Accuracy (TETA),
breaking tracking measurement into three sub-factors: localization,
association, and classification, allowing comprehensive benchmarking of
tracking performance even under inaccurate classification. TETA also deals with
the challenging incomplete annotation problem in large-scale tracking datasets.
We further introduce a Track Every Thing tracker (TETer), that performs
association using Class Exemplar Matching (CEM). Our experiments show that TETA
evaluates trackers more comprehensively, and TETer achieves significant
improvements on the challenging large-scale datasets BDD100K and TAO compared
to the state-of-the-art.

training and improves performance without any runtime cost. However, the
overhead during training is often overlooked, and yet reducing time and memory
overhead during training is increasingly important in the giant models' era.
This paper proposes an efficient self-distillation method named Zipf's Label
Smoothing (Zipf's LS), which uses the on-the-fly prediction of a network to
generate soft supervision that conforms to Zipf distribution without using any
contrastive samples or auxiliary parameters. Our idea comes from an empirical
observation that when the network is duly trained the output values of a
network's final softmax layer, after sorting by the magnitude and averaged
across samples, should follow a distribution reminiscent to Zipf's Law in the
word frequency statistics of natural languages. By enforcing this property on
the sample level and throughout the whole training period, we find that the
prediction accuracy can be greatly improved. Using ResNet50 on the INAT21
fine-grained classification dataset, our technique achieves +3.61% accuracy
gain compared to the vanilla baseline, and 0.88% more gain against the previous
label smoothing or self-distillation strategies. The implementation is publicly

  Visualisations",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Explaining decisions made by deep neural networks is a rapidly advancing
research topic. In recent years, several approaches have attempted to provide
visual explanations of decisions made by neural networks designed for
structured 2D image input data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
generate coarse visual explanations of networks designed to classify
unstructured 3D data, namely point clouds. Our method uses gradients flowing
back to the final feature map layers and maps these values as contributions of
the corresponding points in the input point cloud. Due to dimensionality
disagreement and lack of spatial consistency between input points and final
feature maps, our approach combines gradients with points dropping to compute
explanations of different parts of the point cloud iteratively. The generality
of our approach is tested on various point cloud classification networks,
including 'single object' networks PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and a 'scene'
network VoteNet. Our method generates symmetric explanation maps that highlight
important regions and provide insight into the decision-making process of
network architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation of trust and
interpretability of our explanation method against comparative approaches using
quantitative, quantitative and human studies. All our code is implemented in
PyTorch and will be made publicly available.

  Super-Resolution","accpted by ECCV2022",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lookup table (LUT) has shown its efficacy in low-level vision tasks due to
the valuable characteristics of low computational cost and hardware
independence. However, recent attempts to address the problem of single image
super-resolution (SISR) with lookup tables are highly constrained by the small
receptive field size. Besides, their frameworks of single-layer lookup tables
limit the extension and generalization capacities of the model. In this paper,
we propose a framework of series-parallel lookup tables (SPLUT) to alleviate
the above issues and achieve efficient image super-resolution. On the one hand,
we cascade multiple lookup tables to enlarge the receptive field of each
extracted feature vector. On the other hand, we propose a parallel network
which includes two branches of cascaded lookup tables which process different
components of the input low-resolution images. By doing so, the two branches
collaborate with each other and compensate for the precision loss of
discretizing input pixels when establishing lookup tables. Compared to previous
lookup table-based methods, our framework has stronger representation abilities
with more flexible architectures. Furthermore, we no longer need interpolation
methods which introduce redundant computations so that our method can achieve
faster inference speed. Extensive experimental results on five popular
benchmark datasets show that our method obtains superior SISR performance in a
more efficient way. The code is available at https://github.com/zhjy2016/SPLUT.

given its economy compared to multi-sensor settings. It is notably difficult as
a single image can not provide any clues for predicting absolute depth values.
Motivated by binocular methods for 3D object detection, we take advantage of
the strong geometry structure provided by camera ego-motion for accurate object
depth estimation and detection. We first make a theoretical analysis on this
general two-view case and notice two challenges: 1) Cumulative errors from
multiple estimations that make the direct prediction intractable; 2) Inherent
dilemmas caused by static cameras and matching ambiguity. Accordingly, we
establish the stereo correspondence with a geometry-aware cost volume as the
alternative for depth estimation and further compensate it with monocular
understanding to address the second problem. Our framework, named Depth from
Motion (DfM), then uses the established geometry to lift 2D image features to
the 3D space and detects 3D objects thereon. We also present a pose-free DfM to
make it usable when the camera pose is unavailable. Our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the KITTI benchmark. Detailed
quantitative and qualitative analyses also validate our theoretical

the emergence of drifting-rotating waves ({\sc drw}) that capture, in a
relatively small domain, the main features of coherent structures typically
observed in developed turbulence. The transitional dynamics of the subcritical
region, far below the first instability of the laminar circular Couette flow,
is determined by the upper and lower branches of {\sc drw} solutions originated
at saddle-node bifurcations. The mechanism whereby these solutions
self-sustain, and the chaotic dynamics they induce, are conspicuously
reminiscent of other subcritical shear flows. Remarkably, the flow properties
of {\sc drw} persist even as the Reynolds number is increased beyond the linear
stability threshold of the base flow. Simulations in a narrow parallelogram

with negative clinical outcomes. Because of limited and delayed data sharing,
CF programs need a reliable method to track infection rates. There are three
complex structures in CF registry data: recurrent infections, missing data, and
multilevel correlation due to repeated measures within a patient and
patient-to-patient transmissions. A step-by-step analysis pipeline was proposed
to develop and validate a risk-adjusted model to help healthcare programs
monitor the number of recurrent events while taking into account missing data

the mixed-effect Andersen-Gill model (the frailty model), adjusted for

number of events where the variability of the prediction was estimated from
three identified sources. The coverage of the estimated confidence intervals
was used to evaluate model performance. Simulation results indicated that the

paper, we explore the generalizable knowledge distillation for the efficient
segmentation of cross-domain medical images. Considering the domain gaps
between different medical datasets, we propose the Model-Specific Alignment

customized Alignment Consistency Training (ACT) strategy is designed to promote
the MSAN training. Considering the domain-invariant representative vectors in
MSAN, we propose two generalizable knowledge distillation schemes for
cross-domain distillation, Dual Contrastive Graph Distillation (DCGD) and
Domain-Invariant Cross Distillation (DICD). Specifically, in DCGD, two types of
implicit contrastive graphs are designed to represent the intra-coupling and
inter-coupling semantic correlations from the perspective of data distribution.
In DICD, the domain-invariant semantic vectors from the two models (i.e.,
teacher and student) are leveraged to cross-reconstruct features by the header
exchange of MSAN, which achieves improvement in the generalization of both the
encoder and decoder in the student model. Furthermore, a metric named Frechet
Semantic Distance (FSD) is tailored to verify the effectiveness of the
regularized domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on the

our method, in terms of performance and generalization on lightweight

to introduce more general promise problems, which reduce to the known Fourier

the conclusion that a continuous variable system is necessary to implement the

protoplanetary discs contains rings in the dust continuum. These rings are the
locations where pebbles accumulate, which is beneficial for planetesimal
formation and subsequent planet assembly. We investigate the viability of
planet formation inside ALMA rings in which pebbles are trapped by either a
Gaussian-shape pressure bump or by the strong dust backreaction. Planetesimals
form at the midplane of the ring via streaming instability. By conducting
N-body simulations, we study the growth of these planetesimals by collisional
mergers and pebble accretion. Thanks to the high concentration of pebbles in
the ring, the growth of planetesimals by pebble accretion becomes efficient as
soon as they are born. We find that planet migration plays a decisive role in
the evolution of rings and planets. For discs where planets can migrate inward
from the ring, a steady state is reached where the ring spawns ${\sim}20
M_\oplus$ planetary cores as long as rings are fed with materials from the
outer disc. The ring acts as a long-lived planet factory and it can explain the
'fine-tuned' optical depths of the observed dust rings in the DSHARP large
program. In contrast, in the absence of a planet removal mechanism (migration),
a single massive planet will form and destroy the ring. A wide and massive
planetesimals belt will be left at the location of the planet-forming ring.
Planet formation in rings may explain the mature planetary systems observed
inside debris discs.

received significant attention, as their current electric energy systems are
not only expensive, but are also highly polluting due to the prevalence of
diesel generators. In addition, RCs' inherent geographic characteristics impose
a series of challenges that must be considered when planning their electricity
supply. Thus, in this paper, an optimization model for the long-term planning
of RC Microgrids (MGs) including Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Energy
Storage Systems (ESSs) is proposed, with the objective of reducing costs and
emissions. The proposed model considers lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen
systems as part of ESSs technologies. The model is used to investigate the
feasibility of integrating RESs and ESSs in an MG in Sanikiluaq, an RC in the
Nunavut territory in Northern Canada. The results show that wind resources
along with solar and storage technologies can play a key role in satisfying RC
electricity demand, while significantly reducing costs and Greenhouse Gas
Emissions (GHG). In addition, insights on sustainable and affordable policies
for RC MGs are provided.

sample binding sites on set of water clusters and to compute accurate BEs.
Using our protocol, we computed 21 BE distributions of interstellar molecules

The distributions contain between 225 and 250 unique binding sites. We apply a

values are broadly in line with ours, even though in some cases significant
differences can be appreciated. We show how the use of different BE values
impact a typical problem in astrophysics, such as the computation of snow lines

Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the small-strain response of
arbitrarily curved shells. To this end, the shell midsurface is described by a
chart, from which the mechanical fields are derived in a curvilinear coordinate
frame by adopting Naghdi's shell theory. Unlike in typical PINN applications,
the corresponding strong or weak form must therefore be solved in a
non-Euclidean domain. We investigate the performance of the proposed PINN in
three distinct scenarios, including the well-known Scordelis-Lo roof setting
widely used to test FE shell elements against locking. Results show that the
PINN can accurately identify the solution field in all three benchmarks if the
equations are presented in their weak form, while it may fail to do so when
using the strong form. In the thin-thickness limit, where classical methods are
susceptible to locking, training time notably increases as the differences in
scaling of the membrane, shear, and bending energies lead to adverse numerical
stiffness in the gradient flow dynamics. Nevertheless, the PINN can accurately
match the ground truth and performs well in the Scordelis-Lo roof benchmark,
highlighting its potential for a drastically simplified alternative to

asynchronous, primal, first-order algorithm to minimize a sum of $L$-smooth and

Our key insight is based on modeling the local gradient updates and gossip
communication procedures with separate independent Poisson Point Processes.
This allows us to decouple the computation and communication steps, which can
be run in parallel, while making the whole approach completely asynchronous,
leading to communication acceleration compared to synchronous approaches. Our
new method employs primal gradients and does not use a multi-consensus inner
loop nor other ad-hoc mechanisms such as Error Feedback, Gradient Tracking, or
a Proximal operator. By relating the inverse of the smallest positive
eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix $\chi_1$ and the maximal resistance
$\chi_2\leq \chi_1$ of the graph to a sufficient minimal communication rate
between the nodes of the network, we show that our algorithm requires
$\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ local gradients
and only
$\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\chi_1\chi_2}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$
communications to reach a precision $\epsilon$, up to logarithmic terms. Thus,
we simultaneously obtain an accelerated rate for both computations and
communications, leading to an improvement over state-of-the-art works, our
simulations further validating the strength of our relatively unconstrained

77 GHz automotive radars is proposed. The radiator contour is modeled with a
sinusoidal spline-shaped (SS) profile characterized by a reduced number of
geometrical descriptors, but still able to guarantee a high flexibility in the
modeling for fulfilling challenging user-defined requirements. The SS-EFA
descriptors are effectively and efficiently optimized with a customized
implementation of the System-by-Design (SbD) paradigm. The synthesized EFA
layout, integrated within a linear arrangement of identical replicas to account
for the integration into the real radar system, exhibits suitable impedance
matching, isolation, polarization purity, and stability of the beam
shaping/pointing within the target band [76:78][GHz]. The experimental
assessment, carried out with a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) system on a
printed circuit board (PCB)-manufactured prototype, assess the reliability of
the outcomes from the full-wave (FW) simulations as well as the suitability of
the synthesized SS-EFA for automotive radars.

  Recognition",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework for emotion recognition using
EEG data that outperforms state-of-the-art models while keeping the model size
small and computationally efficient. The framework consists of two stages; the
first stage involves constructing efficient models named EEGNet, which is
inspired by the state-of-the-art efficient architecture and employs
inverted-residual blocks that contain depthwise separable convolutional layers.
The EEGNet models on both valence and arousal labels achieve the average
classification accuracy of 90%, 96.6%, and 99.5% with only 6.4k, 14k, and 25k
parameters, respectively. In terms of accuracy and storage cost, these models
outperform the previous state-of-the-art result by up to 9%. In the second
stage, we binarize these models to further compress them and deploy them easily
on edge devices. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) typically degrade model
accuracy. We improve the EEGNet binarized models in this paper by introducing
three novel methods and achieving a 20\% improvement over the baseline binary
models. The proposed binarized EEGNet models achieve accuracies of 81%, 95%,
and 99% with storage costs of 0.11Mbits, 0.28Mbits, and 0.46Mbits,
respectively. Those models help deploy a precise human emotion recognition
system on the edge environment.

this area focused on the derivation of identifiability conditions. We propose
instead a first algorithm to address both identifiable and unidentifiable
queries. We prove that, in spite of the missingness induced by the selection
bias, the likelihood of the available data is unimodal. This enables us to use
the causal expectation-maximisation scheme to obtain the values of causal
queries in the identifiable case, and to compute bounds otherwise. Experiments
demonstrate the approach to be practically viable. Theoretical convergence

we used the publicly available US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

case scenarios using a support vector regression machine learning model, we
found that poverty, lack of physical activity, education, and unemployment were
the most important predictive variables that contribute to obesity in Memphis,

urban population health. The expanded UPHO feature incorporates an additional

are often interested in classifying neurons based on their receptive field
properties. Statistical models provide powerful tools for determining the
factors influencing neural spiking activity and classifying individual neurons.
However, as neural recording technologies have advanced to produce simultaneous
spiking data from massive populations, classical statistical methods often lack
the computational efficiency required to handle such data. Machine learning
(ML) approaches are known for enabling efficient large scale data analyses;
however, they typically require massive training sets with balanced data, along
with accurate labels to fit well. Additionally, model assessment and
interpretation are often more challenging for ML than for classical statistical
methods. To address these challenges, we develop an integrated framework,
combining statistical modeling and machine learning approaches to identify the
coding properties of neurons from large populations. In order to demonstrate
this framework, we apply these methods to data from a population of neurons
recorded from rat hippocampus to characterize the distribution of spatial
receptive fields in this region.
