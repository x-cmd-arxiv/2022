  control: application to coronary bypass graft",,,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an optimal flow control problem in a patient-specific coronary
artery bypass graft with the aim of matching the blood flow velocity with given
measurements as the Reynolds number varies in a physiological range. Blood flow
is modelled with the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The
geometry consists in a stenosed left anterior descending artery where a single
bypass is performed with the right internal thoracic artery. The control
variable is the unknown value of the normal stress at the outlet boundary,
which is need for a correct set-up of the outlet boundary condition. For the
numerical solution of the parametric optimal flow control problem, we develop a
data-driven reduced order method that combines proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) with neural networks. We present numerical results showing that our
data-driven approach leads to a substantial speed-up with respect to a more
classical POD-Galerkin strategy proposed in [59], while having comparable
accuracy.

  Regularized Crack Face Contact",,,"10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104994",,"math.AP cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Phase-field models are a leading approach for realistic fracture problems.
They treat the crack as a second phase and use gradient terms to smear out the
crack faces, enabling the use of standard numerical methods for simulations.
This regularization causes cracks to occupy a finite volume in the reference,
and leads to the inability to appropriately model the closing or contacting --
without healing -- of crack faces. Specifically, the classical idealized crack
face tractions are that the shear component is zero, and that the normal
component is zero when the crack opens and identical to the intact material
when the crack closes. Phase-field fracture models do not replicate this
behavior.
  This work addresses this shortcoming by introducing an effective crack energy
density that endows the regularized (finite volume) phase-field crack with the
effective properties of an idealized sharp crack. The approach is based on
applying the QR (upper triangular) decomposition of the deformation gradient
tensor in the basis of the crack, enabling a transparent identification of the
crack deformation modes. By then relaxing over those modes that do not cost
energy, an effective energy is obtained that has the intact response when the
crack faces close and zero energy when the crack faces are open.
  A highlight of this approach is that it lies completely in the setting of
finite deformation, enabling potential application to soft materials and other
settings with large deformation or rotations. The model is applied to
numerically study representative complex loadings, including (1) cyclic loading
on a cavity in a soft solid that shows the growth and closing of cracks in
complex stress states; and (2) cyclic shear that shows a complex pattern of
crack branching driven by the closure of cracks.

  Federated Learning","Accepted at ICLR","International Conference on Learning Representations 2023",,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  An oft-cited challenge of federated learning is the presence of
heterogeneity. \emph{Data heterogeneity} refers to the fact that data from
different clients may follow very different distributions. \emph{System
heterogeneity} refers to client devices having different system capabilities. A
considerable number of federated optimization methods address this challenge.
In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start federated training from
random initialization. However, in many practical applications of federated
learning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be
used to pre-train a model before starting federated training. Using four
standard federated learning benchmark datasets, we empirically study the impact
of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning. Unsurprisingly,
starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a
target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40\%)
than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we
also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization
reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend future
work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods to evaluate the
performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. This
study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of
heterogeneity in federated optimization. \footnote{Our code is available at:

gravitational-wave sources because their evolution is governed not just by
general relativity and tides, but also by mass transfer. While the black hole
and neutron star binaries observed with ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors are driven to inspiral due to the emission of gravitational
radiation--manifesting as a ""chirp-like"" gravitational-wave signal--the
astrophysical processes at work in double white dwarf (DWD) systems can cause
the inspiral to stall and even reverse into an outspiral. The dynamics of the
DWD outspiral thus encode information about tides, which tell us about the
behaviour of electron-degenerate matter. We carry out a population study to
determine the effect of the strength of tides on the distributions of the DWD
binary parameters that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be
able to constrain. We find that the strength of tidal coupling parameterized
via the tidal synchronization timescale at the onset of mass transfer affects
the distribution of gravitational-wave frequencies and frequency derivatives
for detectably mass-transferring DWD systems. Using a hierarchical Bayesian
framework informed by binary population synthesis simulations, we demonstrate
how this parameter can be inferred using LISA observations. By measuring the
population properties of DWDs, LISA will be able to probe the behavior of
electron-degenerate matter.

the CIB with galaxy samples covering the range $z\lesssim2$ to measure the
bias-weighted star-formation rate (SFR) density $\langle b\rho_{\rm

complementary to direct measurements of the SFR density $\rho_{\rm SFR}$,
giving a higher weight to more massive haloes, and thus provides additional
information to constrain the physical properties of star formation. Using
cross-correlations of the CIB with galaxies from the DESI Legacy Survey and the
extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we obtain high
signal-to-noise ratio measurements of $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which
we then use to place constraints on halo-based models of the star-formation
history. We fit halo-based SFR models to our data and compare the recovered
$\rho_{\rm SFR}$ with direct measurements of this quantity. We find a
qualitatively good agreement between both independent datasets, although the
details depend on the specific halo model assumed. This constitutes a useful
robustness test for the physical interpretation of the CIB, and reinforces the
role of CIB maps as valuable astrophysical probes of the large-scale structure.
We report our measurements of $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$ as well as a
thorough account of their statistical uncertainties, which can be used to

  Games","NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For common notions of correlated equilibrium in extensive-form games,
computing an optimal (e.g., welfare-maximizing) equilibrium is NP-hard. Other
equilibrium notions -- communication (Forges 1986) and certification (Forges &
Koessler 2005) equilibria -- augment the game with a mediator that has the
power to both send and receive messages to and from the players -- and, in
particular, to remember the messages. In this paper, we investigate both
notions in extensive-form games from a computational lens. We show that optimal
equilibria in both notions can be computed in polynomial time, the latter under
a natural additional assumption known in the literature. Our proof works by
constructing a mediator-augmented game of polynomial size that explicitly
represents the mediator's decisions and actions. Our framework allows us to
define an entire family of equilibria by varying the mediator's information
partition, the players' ability to lie, and the players' ability to deviate.
From this perspective, we show that other notions of equilibrium, such as
extensive-form correlated equilibrium, correspond to the mediator having
imperfect recall. This shows that, at least among all these equilibrium
notions, the hardness of computation is driven by the mediator's imperfect
recall. As special cases of our general construction, we recover 1) the
polynomial-time algorithm of Conitzer & Sandholm (2004) for automated mechanism
design in Bayes-Nash equilibria and 2) the correlation DAG algorithm of Zhang
et al (2022) for optimal correlation. Our algorithm is especially scalable when
the equilibrium notion is what we define as the full-certification equilibrium,
where players cannot lie about their information but they can be silent. We
back up our theoretical claims with experiments on a suite of standard
benchmark games.

efficient solar cells, bright light-emitting devices, and quantum sources of
light. Quantifying heterogeneity and understanding coupling between dots is
critical for these applications. We use double-nanohole optical trapping to
size individual dots and correlate to emission energy shifts from quantum
confinement. We were able to assemble a second dot in the trap, which allows us
to observe the coupling between dots. We observe a systematic red-shift of 1.1
$\pm$ 0.6 meV in the emission wavelength. Theoretical analysis shows that the
observed shift is consistent with resonant energy transfer and is unusually
large due to moderate-to-large quantum confinement in PQDs. This demonstrates
the promise of PQDs for entanglement in quantum information applications. This
work enables future in situ control of PQD growth as well as studies of the
coupling between small PQD assemblies with quantum information applications in
mind.

equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) matter by confronting it with
astrophysics observations, but ultimately also to infer the NS composition.
Nevertheless, the composition of the NS core is likely to remain uncertain
unless we have an accurate determination of the nuclear symmetry energy at
supra saturation density ($\rho>\rho_0$). We investigate how the nucleonic
direct Urca (dUrca) processes can be used as an effective probe to constraint
the high density nuclear symmetry energy. A large number of minimally
constrained EOSs has been constructed by applying a Bayesian approach to study
the correlations of the symmetry energy at different densities with a few
selected properties of a NS. The nuclear symmetry energy above the baryon
density 0.5 fm$^{-3}$ ($\sim 3 \rho_0$) is found to be strongly correlated with
NS mass at which the onset of nucleonic dUrca neutrino cooling takes place in
the core. This allows us to constrain the high density behavior of nuclear
symmetry energy within narrow bounds. {The pure neutron matter pressure
constraint from chiral effective field theory rules out the onset of nucleonic
dUrca in stars with a mass $\lesssim$ 1.4 $M_\odot$.} The onset of dUrca inside
1.6 M$_\odot$ to 1.8 M$_\odot$ NS implies a slope of the symmetry energy $L$ at
$\sim 2.5~\rho_0$, respectively, between 54 and 48 MeV.

disjoint simply-connected closed regions and a one-to-one mapping of the

only if the line segment connecting the two corresponding points does not
intersect any obstacle. The obstacle number of a graph is the smallest number
of obstacles in an obstacle representation of the graph in the plane such that
all obstacles are simple polygons.
  It is known that the obstacle number of each $n$-vertex graph is $O(n \log
n)$ [Balko, Cibulka, and Valtr, 2018] and that there are $n$-vertex graphs
whose obstacle number is $\Omega(n/(\log\log n)^2)$ [Dujmovi\'c and Morin,
2015]. We improve this lower bound to $\Omega(n/\log\log n)$ for simple
polygons and to $\Omega(n)$ for convex polygons.
  To obtain these stronger bounds, we improve known estimates on the number of
$n$-vertex graphs with bounded obstacle number, solving a conjecture by
Dujmovi\'c and Morin. We also show that if the drawing of some $n$-vertex graph
is given as part of the input, then for some drawings $\Omega(n^2)$ obstacles
are required to turn them into an obstacle representation of the graph. Our
bounds are asymptotically tight in several instances.
  We complement these combinatorial bounds by two complexity results. First, we
show that computing the obstacle number of a graph $G$ is fixed-parameter
tractable in the vertex cover number of $G$. Second, we show that, given a
graph $G$ and a simple polygon $P$, it is NP-hard to decide whether $G$ admits

with Cloudy models consisting of an HII region plus a photodissociation region
(PDR) component, varying the stellar age, the initial density (at the
illuminated edge of the cloud), and the ionization parameter. We introduce a
new parameter, cPDR, to quantify the proportion of emission arising from PDRs
and that with an origin in HII regions along each line of sight. We use the
ratio ([CII]+[OI])/[OIII] as a proxy for the ratio of PDR versus HII region
emission, and compare it to [OIII]/24mu. The use of [OIII]/24mu and [OIII]/70mu
together allows us to constrain the models most efficiently. We find a
correlation over at least 3 orders of magnitude in [OIII]88mu and 24mu
continuum in spatially resolved maps of the Magellanic Cloud regions as well as
unresolved galaxy-wide low metallicity galaxies of the Dwarf Galaxy Survey.
Most of the regions have low proportions of PDRs along the lines of sight (<
12%), while a limited area of some of the mapped regions can reach 30 to 50%.
For most lines of sight within the star-forming regions we have studied in the
Magellanic Clouds, HII regions are the dominant phase. We propose the use of
the correlation between the [OIII]88mu and 24mu continuum as a new predictive
tool to estimate, for example, the [OIII]88mu emission when the 24mu continuum
is available or inversely. This can be useful to prepare for ALMA observations
of [OIII]88mu in high-z galaxies. This simple and novel method may also provide
a way to disentangle different phases along the line of sight, when other 3D

that $d(w,u) \neq d(w,v)$. The {\sc Metric Dimension} problem takes as input a

to be \NP-hard~[GT~61 in Garey and Johnson's book]. In the realm of
parameterized complexity, Hartung and Nichterlein~[CCC~2013] proved that the
problem is \W[2]-hard when parameterized by the natural parameter $k$. They
also observed that it is \FPT\ when parameterized by the vertex cover number
and asked about its complexity under \emph{smaller} parameters, in particular
the feedback vertex set number. We answer this question by proving that {\sc
Metric Dimension} is \W[1]-hard when parameterized by the combined parameter
feedback vertex set number plus pathwidth. This also improves the result of
Bonnet and Purohit~[IPEC 2019] which states that the problem is \W[1]-hard

distance to co-cluster, both of which are smaller parameters than the vertex

not observed sufficient explorations for how imposing fairness constraints fare
at an instance level. Building on the concept of influence function, a measure

predictive performance, this work studies the influence of training examples

decomposed into a kernelized combination of training examples. One promising

we propose to use a highly multimode fiber and equal modal excitation to
suppress the thermo-optical nonlinearity and instability. Our numerical
simulations and theoretical analysis predict a significant reduction of dynamic

coherent seed is narrower than the spectral correlation width of the multimode
fiber, the amplified light maintains high spatial coherence and can be
transformed to any target pattern or focused to a diffraction-limited spot by a
spatial mask at either input or output end of the amplifier. Our method
simultaneously achieves high average power, narrow spectral width, and good
beam quality, which are desired for fiber amplifiers in many applications.

for the HI line width as a function of the stellar and neutral hydrogen mass
distributions in a galaxy using kinematic modelling, and the other for the
galaxy's total baryonic mass using the technique of inverse subhalo abundance
matching. We hence quantify the constraining power on halo properties of

find good agreement between the two sets of posteriors, although there is a
sizeable population of low-line width galaxies that favour significantly
smaller dynamical masses than expected from abundance matching (especially for
cuspy halo profiles). Abundance matching provides significantly more stringent
bounds on halo properties than the HI line width, even with a
mass--concentration prior included, although combining the two provides a mean
gain of 40% for the sample when fitting an NFW profile. We also use our
kinematic posteriors to construct a baryonic mass--halo mass relation, which we

to assist with AIS segmentation. However, most previous symmetry-based work
mixed different types of asymmetries when evaluating their contribution to AIS.
In this paper, we propose a novel Asymmetry Disentanglement Network (ADN) to
automatically separate pathological asymmetries and intrinsic anatomical
asymmetries in NCCTs for more effective and interpretable AIS segmentation. ADN
first performs asymmetry disentanglement based on input NCCTs, which produces
different types of 3D asymmetry maps. Then a synthetic,
intrinsic-asymmetry-compensated and pathology-asymmetry-salient NCCT volume is
generated and later used as input to a segmentation network. The training of
ADN incorporates domain knowledge and adopts a tissue-type aware regularization
loss function to encourage clinically-meaningful pathological asymmetry
extraction. Coupled with an unsupervised 3D transformation network, ADN
achieves state-of-the-art AIS segmentation performance on a public NCCT
dataset. In addition to the superior performance, we believe the learned
clinically-interpretable asymmetry maps can also provide insights towards a
better understanding of AIS assessment. Our code is available at

matter power spectrum, the halo-matter cross spectrum and the halo bispectrum
monopole. This analysis is the first to include small, non-linear scales, up to
$k_\mathrm{max}=0.5 \mathrm{h/Mpc}$, and to explore whether these scales can
break degeneracies with cosmological and nuisance parameters making use of
thousands of N-body simulations. We perform all the halo measurements in
redshift space with a single sample comprised of all halos with mass $>3.2
\times 10^{13}~h^{-1}M_\odot$. For local PNG, measurements of the scale
dependent bias effect from the power spectrum using sample variance
cancellation provide significantly tighter constraints than measurements of the
halo bispectrum. In this case measurements of the small scales add minimal
additional constraining power. In contrast, the information on equilateral and
orthogonal PNG is primarily accessible through the bispectrum. For these
shapes, small scale measurements increase the constraining power of the halo
bispectrum by up to $\times4$, though the addition of scales beyond $k\approx
0.3 \mathrm{h/Mpc}$ improves constraints largely through reducing degeneracies
between PNG and the other parameters. These degeneracies are even more
powerfully mitigated through combining power spectrum and bispectrum
measurements. However even with combined measurements and small scale
information, equilateral non-Gaussianity remains highly degenerate with
$\sigma_8$ and our bias model.

states, henceforth, they are electrically conductive along their boundaries.
Bismuth selenide ($Bi_2Se_3$) is one of the most promising topological
insulators. However, a major drawback is its n-type nature arising from its
natural doping, which makes the transport in the bulk dominant. This effect can
be overcome by shifting the chemical potential into the bandgap, turning the
transport of the surface states to be more pronounced than the bulk
counterpart. In this work, $Bi_2Se_3$ was grown by molecular beam epitaxy and
doped with 0.8, 2, 7, and 14 at. % of Ga, with the aim of shifting the chemical
potential into the bandgap. The structural, morphological, and electronic
properties of the Ga doped $Bi_2Se_3$ are studied. Raman and X-ray diffraction
measurements confirmed the incorporation of the dopants into the crystal
structure. Transport and magnetoresistance measurements in the temperature
range of 1.5 to 300 K show that Ga-doped $Bi_2Se_3$ is n-type with a bulk
charge carrier concentration of $10^{19} cm^{-3}$. Remarkably, magnetotransport
of the weak antilocalization effect (WAL) measurements confirm the existence of
surface states up to a doping percentage of 2 at. % of Ga and coherence length
values between 50-800 nm, which envisages the possibility of topological
superconductivity in this material.

atmospheric boundary layers and the fatigue life of wind turbines. Due to
turbulence, a difficulty in the simulation of the forest effects is that flow
statistical and fluctuating content should be accurately resolved using a
turbulence-resolved CFD method, which requires a large amount of computing time
and resources. In this paper, we demonstrate a fast but accurate simulation
platform that uses a lattice Boltzmann method with large eddy simulation on
Graphic Processing Units (GPU). The simulation tool is the open-source program,
GASCANS, developed at the University of Manchester. The simulation platform is
validated based on canonical wall-bounded turbulent flows. A forest is modelled
in the form of body forces injected near the wall. Since a uniform cell size is
applied throughout the computational domain, the averaged first-layer cell
height over the wall reaches to $\langle \Delta y^+\rangle = 165$. Simulation
results agree well with previous experiments and numerical data obtained from
finite volume methods. We demonstrate that good results are possible without
the use of a wall-function, since the forest forces overwhelm wall friction.
This is shown to hold as long as the forest region is resolved with several
cells. In addition to the GPU speedup, the approximations also significantly
benefit the computation efficiency.

than the characteristic length scale of the microstructural heterogeneities in
the material leading to computationally expensive and time-consuming
calculations. The recent advances in deep learning based image super-resolution

work aims at developing a physics-informed deep learning based super-resolution

simultaneously satisfying the (highly nonlinear) governing laws. The approach

that this rapid phase is followed by a subsequent slow-down where the

be explained by the merging of previously disconnected sites that occurred

a parallel beam. A crystal monochromator selects the 4.51 keV line, which is
expanded to the final size by a crystal asymmetrically cut with respect to the
crystalline planes. [...] After characterization, the BEaTriX beam has the
nominal dimensions of 170 mm x 60 mm, with a vertical divergence of 1.65 arcsec
and a horizontal divergence varying between 2.7 and 3.45 arcsec, depending on
the monochromator setting: either high collimation or high intensity. The flux
per area unit varies from 10 to 50 photons/s/cm2 from one configuration to the
other. The BEaTriX beam performance was tested using an SPO MM, whose entrance
pupil was fully illuminated by the expanded beam, and its focus was directly
imaged onto the camera. The first light test returned a PSF and an EA in full
agreement with expectations. As of today, the 4.51 keV beamline of BEaTriX is
operational and can characterize modular X-ray optics, measuring their PSF and

modeling of clothing - one of the core aspects of human self-expression -
remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art physical simulation methods can
generate realistically behaving clothing geometry at interactive rates.
Modeling photorealistic appearance, however, usually requires physically-based
rendering which is too expensive for interactive applications. On the other
hand, data-driven deep appearance models are capable of efficiently producing
realistic appearance, but struggle at synthesizing geometry of highly dynamic
clothing and handling challenging body-clothing configurations. To this end, we
introduce pose-driven avatars with explicit modeling of clothing that exhibit
both photorealistic appearance learned from real-world data and realistic
clothing dynamics. The key idea is to introduce a neural clothing appearance
model that operates on top of explicit geometry: at training time we use
high-fidelity tracking, whereas at animation time we rely on physically
simulated geometry. Our core contribution is a physically-inspired appearance
network, capable of generating photorealistic appearance with view-dependent
and dynamic shadowing effects even for unseen body-clothing configurations. We
conduct a thorough evaluation of our model and demonstrate diverse animation
results on several subjects and different types of clothing. Unlike previous
work on photorealistic full-body avatars, our approach can produce much richer
dynamics and more realistic deformations even for many examples of loose
clothing. We also demonstrate that our formulation naturally allows clothing to
be used with avatars of different people while staying fully animatable, thus
enabling, for the first time, photorealistic avatars with novel clothing.

lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full
back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose
Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit
quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to
skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The
algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny
Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse
updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our
framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of

software updates). We first highlight the non-stationary nature of the data,
using a basic per-feature analysis, t-SNE, and an Optimal Transport approach

propose AnoShift, a protocol splitting the data in IID, NEAR, and FAR testing
splits. We validate the performance degradation over time with diverse models,
ranging from classical approaches to deep learning. Finally, we show that by
acknowledging the distribution shift problem and properly addressing it, the
performance can be improved compared to the classical training which assumes

classified as neutrally stable, yet have responses that grow or decay in time.
Previously, King et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 1, 2016, 073604:1-19) and Huber et
al. (IMA J. Appl. Math., 85, 2020, 309-340) examined the one-dimensional (1D)

operators to two spatial dimensions (2D) and examine the resulting solutions.
We find that the increase of dimension leads to long-time behaviour where the
magnitude is reduced by a factor of $t^{\frac{-1}{2}}$ from the 1D solutions.
Thus, regions of the solution which grew algebraically as $t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in
1D now are algebraically neutral in 2D, whereas regions which decay
(algebraically or exponentially) in 1D now decay more quickly in 2D.
Additionally, we find that these two linear operators admit long-time solutions

physics is the computation of correlation functions of non-equilibrium states.
Here we develop the method to compute real-time correlation functions in a
holographic theory in the limit in which the state hydrodynamizes, in the
context of the Bjorken flow. Firstly, we provide a new and simple proof that
the horizon cap prescription of Crossley-Glorioso-Liu for implementing the
thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour in the bulk is consistent with the KMS
periodicity and the ingoing boundary condition for the retarded propagator at
any arbitrary frequency and momentum. The generalization to the hydrodynamic
Bjorken flow is achieved by a Weyl rescaling in which the dual black hole's
event horizon attains a constant surface gravity and area at late time although
the directions longitudinal and transverse to the flow expands and contract
respectively. The dual state's temperature and entropy density thus become
constants (instead of undergoing perfect fluid expansion) although no
time-translation symmetry ever emerges. Undoing the Weyl rescaling, the
correlation functions can be computed systematically in a large proper time
expansion in inverse powers of the average of the two reparametrized proper
time arguments. The horizon cap has to be pinned to the non-equilibrium event
horizon so that regularity and consistency conditions are satisfied. This
mirrors causality of Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the limit of perfect fluid
expansion, the Schwinger-Keldysh correlation functions with reparametrized
spacetime arguments are simply thermal at an appropriate temperature. A
generalized bi-local thermal structure holds to all orders. We argue that the
Stokes data for the hydrodynamic correlation functions can decode the quantum
fluctuations behind the evolving event horizon, and thus the initial data.

water as a whole, giving a constraint on bulk water inventories. Here we
predict mantle water capacities from the thermodynamically-limited solubility
of water in their constituent minerals. We report the variability of mantle
water capacity due to (i) host star refractory element abundances that set
mineralogy, (ii) realistic mantle temperature scenarios, and (iii) planet mass.
We find that planets large enough to stabilise perovskite almost unfailingly
have a dry lower mantle, topped by a high-water-capacity transition zone which
may act as a bottleneck for water transport within the planet's interior.
Because the pressure of the ringwoodite-perovskite phase boundary defining the
lower mantle is roughly insensitive to planet mass, the relative contribution
of the upper mantle reservoir will diminish with increasing planet mass. Large
rocky planets therefore have disproportionately small mantle water capacities.
In practice, our results would represent initial water concentration profiles
in planetary mantles where their primordial magma oceans are water-saturated.
We suggest that a considerable proportion of massive rocky planets' accreted
water budgets would form surface oceans or atmospheric water vapour immediately
after magma ocean solidification, possibly diminishing the likelihood of these
planets hosting land. This work is a step towards understanding planetary deep
water cycling, thermal evolution as mediated by rheology and melting, and the
frequency of waterworlds.

stratospheric/high tropospheric clouds at 15-20 km that could substantially
limit the observable depth of the underlying atmosphere. We use solar
occultations of Earth's atmosphere to create synthetic JWST transit spectra of
Earth analogs orbiting dwarf stars. Unlike previous investigations, we consider
both clear and cloudy sightlines from the SCISAT satellite. We find that the
maximum difference in effective thickness of the atmosphere between a clear and
globally cloudy atmosphere is 8.5 km at 2.28 microns with a resolution of 0.02
microns. After incorporating the effects of refraction and Pandexo's noise
modeling, we find that JWST would not be able to detect Earth like
stratospheric clouds if an exo-Earth was present in the TRAPPIST-1 system, as
the cloud spectrum differs from the clear spectrum by a maximum of 10 ppm.
These stratospheric clouds are also not robustly detected by TauREx when
performing spectral retrieval for a cloudy TRAPPIST-1 planet. However, if an
Earth size planet were to orbit in a white dwarf's habitable zone, then, we
predict that JWST's NIRSpec would be able to detect its stratospheric clouds

measured in units of the fine structure constant, can be used to extract a
spectral function that frequency-integrates to the Chern number, offering a
simple optical experiment to measure it. This method is subsequently
generalized to finite temperature and locally on every lattice site by a linear
response theory, which helps to extract the Chern marker that maps the Chern
number to lattice sites. The long range response in our theory corresponds to a
Chern correlator that acts like the internal fluctuation of the Chern marker,
and is found to be enhanced in the topologically nontrivial phase. Finally,
from the Fourier transform of the valence band Berry curvature, a nonlocal
Chern marker is further introduced, whose decay length diverges at topological
phase transitions and therefore serves as a faithful indicator of the
transitions, and moreover can be interpreted as a Wannier state correlation
function. The concepts discussed in this work explore multi-faceted aspects of

classification of energy band crossings in crystalline solids, with an emphasis
on symmetry-enforced band crossings that feature a nonsymmorphic-symmetry

a topological M\""obius insulator with massless surface modes that resemble the

fields and quantum particles behave in a superposition of spacetimes seems
beyond the reach of theoretical and experimental investigations. Here we use an
extension of the quantum reference frame formalism to address this question for
the Klein-Gordon field residing on a superposition of conformally equivalent
metrics. Based on the group structure of ``quantum conformal transformations'',
we construct an explicit quantum operator that can map states describing a
quantum field on a superposition of spacetimes to states representing a quantum
field with a superposition of masses on a Minkowski background. This
constitutes an extended symmetry principle, namely invariance under quantum
conformal transformations. The latter allows to build an understanding of
superpositions of diffeomorphically non-equivalent spacetimes by relating them
to a more intuitive superposition of quantum fields on curved spacetime.
Furthermore, it can be used to import the phenomenon of particle production in
curved spacetime to its conformally equivalent counterpart, thus revealing new
features in modified Minkowski spacetime.

efficiently on classical computers and requires a polynomial number of

accomplished by measuring the distribution of their tail directions with
respect to their host's center, and their distribution in a projected
velocity-radius phase-diagram. We then model these observed distributions using
a fast and flexible approach where JF tails are painted onto dark matter halos
according to a simple parameterised prescription, and perform a Bayesian
analysis to estimate the parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using observational mocks, and then apply it to a known observational
sample of 106 JF galaxies with radio continuum tails located inside 68 hosts
such as groups and clusters. We find that, typically, the radio continuum tails
become visible on first infall when the galaxy reaches roughly three quarters
of r$_{200}$, and the tails remain visible for a few hundred Myr after
pericenter passage. Lower mass galaxies in more massive hosts tend to form
visible tails further out and their tails disappear more quickly after
pericenter. We argue that this indicates they are more sensitive to ram
pressure stripping. With upcoming large area surveys of JF galaxies in
progress, this is a promising new method to constrain the environmental
conditions in which visible JF tails exist.

the statistical assessment that the observed system has two precessing spins.
We find that the recently developed generalization of the effective precession
spin parameter $\chi_\mathrm{p}$ is a well-suited estimator to this task. With
this estimator, the occurrence of two precessing spins is a necessary (though
not sufficient) condition to obtain values $1<\chi_\mathrm{p}\leq 2$. Confident
measurements of gravitational-wave sources with $\chi_\mathrm{p}$ values in
this range can be taken as a conservative assessment that the binary presents
two precessing spins. We investigate this argument using a large set of >100
software injections assuming anticipated LIGO/Virgo sensitivities for the
upcoming fourth observing run, O4. Our results are very encouraging, suggesting
that, if such binaries exist in nature and merge at a sufficient rate, current
interferometers are likely to deliver the first confident detection of merging
black holes with two precessing spins. We investigate prior effects and
waveform systematics and, though these need to be better investigated, did not

average star-formation rate (SFR) of $8.07\pm0.82 M_\odot yr^{-1}$. Combining
our average HI mass and average SFR estimates yields an HI depletion timescale
of $1.70\pm0.29$ Gyr, for star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$, $\approx3$
times lower than that of local galaxies. We thus find that, although

depletion timescale is likely to cause quenching of their star-formation

extremely challenging. In this paper, we present DeepSpeed Inference, a
comprehensive system solution for transformer model inference to address the

inference solution to minimize latency while maximizing the throughput of both
dense and sparse transformer models when they fit in aggregate GPU memory, and
(2) a heterogeneous inference solution that leverages CPU and NVMe memory in
addition to the GPU memory and compute to enable high inference throughput with
large models which do not fit in aggregate GPU memory. DeepSpeed Inference
reduces latency by up to 7.3X over the state-of-the-art for latency-oriented
scenarios and increases throughput by over 1.5x for throughput-oriented
scenarios. Moreover, it enables trillion parameter scale inference under
real-time latency constraints by leveraging hundreds of GPUs, an unprecedented
scale for inference. It can inference 25x larger models than with GPU-only
solutions, while delivering a high throughput of 84 TFLOPS (over $50\%$ of

of midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) was severely degraded
due to reduced student interaction from isolation and remote learning. Brigade
leadership decided that reassignment of some students from their previous
companies to new companies could facilitate new leadership bonds for the next
academic year. All students in the classes of 2023 and 2024 are reassigned from
their previous companies to new companies with the Brigade Reassignment Problem
(BRP). The first goal of BRP is to minimize the number of students reassigned
to their current company. The second goal seeks to improve the homogeneity of
each company in terms of average metrics defined by brigade leadership. We
create three similar mathematical programming models to achieve different goals
of the BRP. The first model focuses on the first goal and quickly obtains an
optimal solution. A second model focuses on the second goal and obtains
high-quality feasible solutions. A third model combines the two goals and
obtains an optimal solution within seven hours. USNA leadership implemented
results from the first model to reassign the classes of 2023 and 2024 to new
companies for the next academic year.

predictive control (MPC) problems with state and input constraints. The

of this paper is the construction of time-varying yet separable constraint
margins ensuring recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of sub-optimal
parallel MPC in a general setting, which also includes state constraints.
Moreover, it is shown how to tradeoff online run-time guarantees versus the
conservatism that is introduced by the tightened state constraints. The
corresponding performance of the proposed method as well as the cost of the
recursive feasibility guarantees is analyzed in the context of controlling a
large-scale mechatronic system. This is illustrated by numerical experiments
for a large-scale control system with more than 100 states and 60 control
inputs leading to run-times in the millisecond range.

research exploring the utility optimization schemes and the privacy-preserving

make the first attempt to conduct FL-based NILM focusing on both the utility
optimization and the privacy-preserving by developing a distributed and
privacy-preserving NILM (DP2-NILM) framework and carrying out comparative
experiments on practical NILM scenarios based on real-world smart meter
datasets. Specifically, two alternative federated learning strategies are
examined in the utility optimization schemes, i.e., the FedAvg and the FedProx.
Moreover, different levels of privacy guarantees, i.e., the local differential
privacy federated learning and the global differential privacy federated
learning are provided in the DP2-NILM. Extensive comparison experiments are
conducted on three real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed framework.

out by millimetre-wave spectroscopy under field-free conditions and in the
presence of weak static electric fields. The Stark effect mixes states with
different values of the orbital-angular-momentum quantum number $\ell$ and
leads to quadratic Stark shifts of low-$\ell$ states and to linear Stark shifts
of the nearly degenerate manifold of high-$\ell$ states. Transitions to the
Stark manifold were observed for the principal numbers 50 and 70, at fields
below 50 mV/cm, with linewidths below 500~kHz. The energy-level structure was
calculated using a matrix-diagonalisation approach, in which the zero-field
positions of the $\ell\leq 3$ Rydberg states were obtained either from
multichannel-quantum-defect-theory calculations or experiment, and those of the
$\ell\geq 4$ Rydberg states from a long-range core-polarisation model. This
approach offers the advantage of including rovibronic channel interactions
through the MQDT treatment while retaining the advantages of a spherical basis
for the determination of the off-diagonal elements of the Stark operator.
Comparison of experimental and calculated transition frequencies enabled the
quantitative description of the Stark manifolds, with residuals typically below
50 kHz. We demonstrate how the procedure leads to quantum defects and binding
energies of high Rydberg states with unprecedented accuracy, opening up new
prospects for the determination of ionisation energies in molecules.

focused-ion-beam irradiation. This allows us to rapidly transfer the nanoscale
design patterns to the YIG medium, without patterning the material by etching.
We measured the effective saturation magnetization corresponding to the FIB
dose levels in advance and used this mapping to translate the designed
scatterer to the required dose levels. Our demonstration serves as a proof of
concept for a workflow that can be used to realize more sophisticated spin-wave
devices with complex functionality, e.g., spin-wave signal processors, or
neuromorphic devices.

research in visualizing and understanding their internal mechanics with the end

multimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it
challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the
internal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to
fill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of
multimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages:
(1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream
modeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities
relate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and
cross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4)
multimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a
prediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models,
tasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6
real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together
enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable
concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications,
and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly
available, will be regularly updated with new interpretation tools and metrics,

the so called Weyl vector. The Weyl gravity is obtained by constructing the

invariant. It is found that such solution may exist provided there exists the
direct interaction between the Weyl vector and the matter fields. Assuming the
matter Lagrangian is that of the perfect fluid, we found how such an
interaction can be implemented. Due to the existence of quadratic curvature
terms and the direct interaction the perfect fluid particles may be created
straight from the vacuum, and we found the expression for the rate of their
production which appeared to be conformal invariant. In the case of creating
the universe ``from nothing'' in the vacuum state, we investigated the problem,
whether this vacuum may persist or not. It is shown that the vacuum may persist
with respect to producing the non-dust matter (with positive pressure), but
cannot resist to producing the dust particles. These particles, being
non-interactive, may be considered as the candidates for dark matter.

low-mass stars known as Classical T Tauri stars remains an open task.
Month-long, continuous light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (\textit{TESS}) have become available for hundreds of T Tauri stars.
With this vast data set, identifying connections between the variability
observed by \TESS and short-timescale accretion variability is valuable for
characterizing the accretion process. To this end, we obtained short-cadence
\TESS observations of 14 T Tauri stars in the Taurus star-formation region
along with simultaneous ground-based, UBVRI-band photometry to be used as
accretion diagnostics. In addition, we combine our dataset with previously
published simultaneous NUV-NIR \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} spectra for one
member of the sample. We find evidence that much of the short-timescale
variability observed in the \TESS light curves can be attributed to changes in
the accretion rate, but note significant scatter between separate nights and
objects. We identify hints of time lags within our dataset that increase at
shorter wavelengths which we suggest may be evidence of longitudinal density
stratification of the accretion column. Our results highlight that
contemporaneous, multi-wavelength observations remain critical for providing

solutions in $f(T)$ gravity with certain symmetries. As is well-known, vacuum
spherically symmetric diagonal tetrads lead to rather boring cases of constant
torsion scalars. We extend this statement to other possible horizon topologies,
namely, spherical, hyperbolic and planar horizons. All such cases are forced to
have constant torsion scalars to satisfy the anti-symmetric part of the field
equations. We give a full classification of possible vacuum static solutions of
this sort. Furthermore, we discuss addition of time-dependence in all the above
cases. We also show that if all the components of a diagonal tetrad depend only
on one coordinate, then the anti-symmetric part of the field equations is
automatically satisfied. This result applies to the flat horizon case with
Cartesian coordinates. For solutions with a planar symmetry (or a flat
horizon), one can naturally use Cartesian coordinates on the horizon. In this

non-trivial solutions. This is a novel and very interesting feature of these
constructions. We present two new exact solutions, the first is a magnetic
Black Hole which is the magnetic dual of a known electrically charged Black

$\approx36$ arcmin in angular size and has a nearly circular shape. Clear
variations in spectral shape of the X-ray emission across the object are
detected, with the emission from the inner (within 9') and outer (9'-18') parts
dominated by iron and oxygen/neon lines, respectively. The non-equilibrium
plasma emission model is capable of describing the spectrum of the outer part
with the initial gas temperature 0.1 keV, final temperature 0.5 keV and the
ionization age $\sim 2\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The observed spectrum of the
inner region is more complicated (plausibly due to the contribution of the
outer shell) and requires substantial overabundance of iron for all models we
have tried. The derived X-ray absorption equals to $(4-6)\times10^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$, locating the object at the distance beyond 1.5 kpc, and implying its
age $\sim(5-30)\times1000$ yrs. No bright radio, infrared, H$_\alpha$ or

distributions in the expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fireball. We employ a
semi-classical charmonium transport approach where regeneration processes
explicitly account for the time-dependent spectra of charm quarks via Langevin
simulations of their diffusion. The inelastic charmonium rates and charm-quark
transport coefficients are computed from the same charm-medium interaction. The
latter is modeled by perturbative rates, augmented with a $K$-factor to
represent nonperturbative interaction strength and interference effect. Using
central 5.02~TeV Pb-Pb collisions as a test case we find that a good
description of the measured $J/\psi$ yield and its transverse-momentum
dependence can be achieved if a large $K\gtrsim5$ is employed while smaller
values lead to marked discrepancies. This is in line with open-charm
phenomenology in URHICs, where nonperturbative interactions of similar strength
are required. Our approach establishes a common transport framework for a
microscopic description of open and hidden heavy-flavor (HF) observables that
incorporates both nonperturbative and non-equilibrium effects, and thus
enhances the mutual constraints from experiment on the extraction of transport
properties of the QGP.

Recently, machine learning models have been created to predict risk of

exists to predict this risk across all patients. We developed a bi-directional
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network that is able to use readily available
insurance data (inpatient visits, outpatient visits, and drug prescriptions) to
predict 30 day re-admission for any admitted patient, regardless of reason. The
top-performing model achieved an ROC AUC of 0.763 (0.011) when using
historical, inpatient, and post-discharge data. The LSTM model significantly
outperformed a baseline random forest classifier, indicating that understanding
the sequence of events is important for model prediction. Incorporation of
30-days of historical data also significantly improved model performance
compared to inpatient data alone, indicating that a patients clinical history
prior to admission, including outpatient visits and pharmacy data is a strong
contributor to readmission. Our results demonstrate that a machine learning
model is able to predict risk of inpatient readmission with reasonable accuracy
for all patients using structured insurance billing data. Because billing data

deployed to identify patients at risk for readmission before they are

Due to its high annotation cost, researchers have developed many UDA methods
for semantic segmentation, which assume no labeled sample is available in the
target domain. We question the practicality of this assumption for two reasons.
First, after training a model with a UDA method, we must somehow verify the
model before deployment. Second, UDA methods have at least a few
hyper-parameters that need to be determined. The surest solution to these is to
evaluate the model using validation data, i.e., a certain amount of labeled
target-domain samples. This question about the basic assumption of UDA leads us
to rethink UDA from a data-centric point of view. Specifically, we assume we
have access to a minimum level of labeled data. Then, we ask how much is
necessary to find good hyper-parameters of existing UDA methods. We then
consider what if we use the same data for supervised training of the same
model, e.g., finetuning. We conducted experiments to answer these questions
with popular scenarios, {GTA5, SYNTHIA}$\rightarrow$Cityscapes. We found that
i) choosing good hyper-parameters needs only a few labeled images for some UDA

in the two outlet channels, leading to the formation of three daughter
droplets, rather than at the center of the junction for conventional
T-junctions which leads to two daughter droplets. It is demonstrated that this
new mechanism is driven by surface tension, and a design rule for the
T-junction geometry is proposed. A model for low values of the capillary number
$Ca$ is developed to predict the formation and growth of an underlying carrier
fluid pocket that accounts for this lateral breakup mechanism. At higher values
of $Ca$, the conventional regime of central breakup becomes dominant again. The
competition between the new and the conventional regime is explored.
Altogether, this novel droplet formation method at T-junction provides the
functionality of alternating droplet size and composition, which can be
important for the design of new microfluidic tools.

metal surface by a thin NaCl film, can be switched from a broad emission
spectrum, revealing the plasmonic modes of the cavity, to a narrow band

dominates the spectra in the high-voltage region in which the inelastic rate is
low, demonstrating that the excitons cannot be created by an inelastic tunnel

While edit distance calculates the ""global"" mismatch, that is, the number of

measures are best expressed in terms of the adjacency matrices: the mismatch
between graphs is expressed as the difference of their adjacency matrices
(under an optimal alignment), and we measure it by applying some matrix norm.
Roughly speaking, global measures like graph edit distance correspond to
entrywise matrix norms like the Frobenius norm and local measures correspond to
operator norms like the spectral norm. We prove a number of strong NP-hardness

$W$ and $Z$ bosons -- the carriers of the strong, electromagnetic, and weak
forces -- are studied in detail. Interactions with three third-generation
matter particles (bottom ($b$) and top ($t$) quarks, and tau leptons ($\tau$))
are well measured and indications of interactions with a second-generation
particle (muons, $\mu$) are emerging. These tests reveal that the Higgs boson

have demonstrated rapid progress toward achieving thermonuclear ignition using
capsule designs with cryogenic fuel layers. The ignition physics for these
layered capsules involves a complex interplay between the dynamically forming
hot spot and the dense surrounding fuel. Using analytic theory and numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that the mass ablation rate into the hot spot
depends sensitively upon the temperature of the dense fuel, resulting in
ablative inflows up to ~4x faster than previous estimates. This produces an
enthalpy flux into the hot spot that plays a critical role in controlling the
hot spot temperature, the ignition threshold, and the subsequent burn
propagation. The net influence of mass ablation on the ignition threshold is
regulated by a dimensionless parameter that depends upon the temperature of the
dense fuel. As a consequence, the ignition threshold is sensitive to any
mechanism that heats the dense fuel, such as neutrons or radiation emitted from
the hot spot. These predictions are confirmed using radiation hydrodynamic
simulations for a series of capsules near ignition conditions. This analysis
may have relevance for understanding the variable performance of recent
experiments and for guiding new capsule designs toward higher fusion yields.

In both cases the charger is considered to be an open dissipative system. Our
optimization takes into account the experimentally viable problem of turning-on

significantly boosts both power and efficiency of the charging process in

the central Ta atom of the charge density wave of the 1T phase, where the
localized magnetic moment is held. Furthermore, the evolution of the electronic

the possibility of controlling the polarity and chirality of equilibrium domain
structures by a homogeneous external electric field in a nanosized
ferroelectric core covered with an ultra-thin shell of screening charge. Under
certain screening lengths and core sizes, the minimum of the LGD energy, which
consists of Landau-Devonshire energy, Ginzburg polarization gradient energy,
and electrostatic terms, leads to the spontaneous appearance of stable
labyrinth domain structures in the core. The labyrinths evolve from an initial
polarization distribution consisting of arbitrarily small randomly oriented
nanodomains. The equilibrium labyrinth structure is weakly influenced by
details of the initial polarization distribution, such that one can obtain a
quasi-continuum of nearly degenerate labyrinth structures, whose number is
limited only by the mesh discretization density. Applying a homogeneous
electric field to a nanoparticle with labyrinth domains, and subsequently
removing it, allows inducing changes to the labyrinth structure, as the maze
polarity is controlled by a field projection on the particle polar axis. Under
specific conditions of the screening charge relaxation, the quasi-static
dielectric susceptibility of the labyrinth structure can be negative,
potentially leading to a negative capacitance effect. Considering the general
validity of the LGD approach, we expect that an electric field control of
labyrinth domains is possible in many spatially-confined nanosized ferroics,
which can be potentially interesting for advanced cryptography and modern
nanoelectronics.

next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. An important property for

approach to calculate the mobility from first principles relies on the
interpolation of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix. However, it
neglects the scattering by the dynamical quadrupoles generated by phonons,
limiting its accuracy. Here we present a first-principles method to incorporate
the quadrupole scattering, which results in a much better interpolation quality
and thus a more accurate mobility as exemplified by monolayer MoS2 and InSe.
This method also allows for a natural incorporation of the effects of the free
carriers, enabling us to efficiently compute the screened EPC and thus the
mobility for doped semiconductors. Particularly, we find that the electron
mobility of InSe is more sensitive to the carrier concentration than that of
MoS2 due to the stronger long-range scattering in intrinsic InSe. With
increasing electron concentration, the InSe mobility can reach ~4 times of the
intrinsic value, then decrease owing to the involvement of heavier electronic
states. Our work provides accurate and efficient methods to calculate the

  Jin","Language model compression with weighted low-rank factorization","ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Factorizing a large matrix into small matrices is a popular strategy for
model compression. Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a vital role in
this compression strategy, approximating a learned matrix with fewer
parameters. However, SVD minimizes the squared error toward reconstructing the
original matrix without gauging the importance of the parameters, potentially
giving a larger reconstruction error for those who affect the task accuracy
more. In other words, the optimization objective of SVD is not aligned with the
trained model's task accuracy. We analyze this previously unexplored problem,
make observations, and address it by introducing Fisher information to weigh
the importance of parameters affecting the model prediction. This idea leads to
our method: Fisher-Weighted SVD (FWSVD). Although the factorized matrices from
our approach do not result in smaller reconstruction errors, we find that our
resulting task accuracy is much closer to the original model's performance. We
perform analysis with the transformer-based language models, showing our
weighted SVD largely alleviates the mismatched optimization objectives and can
maintain model performance with a higher compression rate. Our method can
directly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than
other compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training.
Moreover, the evaluation of compressing an already compact model shows our
method can further reduce 9% to 30% parameters with an insignificant impact on
task accuracy.

prediction and report generation. However, the majority of captioning models
still rely on the heavy computational object detector or feature extractor to
extract regional features. In addition, the detection model requires additional
bounding box annotation which is costly and needs skilled annotators. These
lead to inference delay and limit the captioning model to deploy in real-time
robotic surgery. For this purpose, we design an end-to-end detector and feature
extractor-free captioning model by utilizing the patch-based shifted window
technique. We propose Shifted Window-Based Multi-Layer Perceptrons Transformer
Captioning model (SwinMLP-TranCAP) with faster inference speed and less
computation. SwinMLP-TranCAP replaces the multi-head attention module with
window-based multi-head MLP. Such deployments primarily focus on image
understanding tasks, but very few works investigate the caption generation
task. SwinMLP-TranCAP is also extended into a video version for video
captioning tasks using 3D patches and windows. Compared with previous
detector-based or feature extractor-based models, our models greatly simplify
the architecture design while maintaining performance on two surgical datasets.

are bounded sets that the subsystems negotiate in the form of parametric

formal theoretical guarantees on robustness of STL satisfaction. The

  Our source code is available at
  https://github.com/XinshaoAmosWang/ProSelfLC-AT",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  There is a family of label modification approaches including self and
non-self label correction (LC), and output regularisation. They are widely used
for training robust deep neural networks (DNNs), but have not been
mathematically and thoroughly analysed together. We study them and discover
three key issues: (1) We are more interested in adopting Self LC as it
leverages its own knowledge and requires no auxiliary models. However, it is
unclear how to adaptively trust a learner as the training proceeds. (2) Some
methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy (i.e., high-confidence)
predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better. (3) Using the standard
training setting, a learned model becomes less confident when severe noise
exists. Self LC using high-entropy knowledge would generate high-entropy
targets.
  To resolve the issue (1), inspired by a well-accepted finding, i.e., deep
neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise, we propose a
novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to the
learning time and prediction entropy. Concretely, for any data point, we
progressively and adaptively trust its predicted probability distribution
versus its annotated one if a network has been trained for a relatively long
time and the prediction is of low entropy. For the issue (2), the effectiveness
of ProSelfLC defends entropy minimisation. By ProSelfLC, we empirically prove
that it is more effective to redefine a semantic low-entropy state and optimise
the learner toward it. To address the issue (3), we decrease the entropy of
self knowledge using a low temperature before exploiting it to correct labels,
so that the revised labels redefine low-entropy target probability
distributions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments
in both clean and noisy settings, and on both image and protein datasets.

the drain-source-bias dependencies of the measured photoresponse showed a clear
transition between plasmonic detection under periodic electron density

under highly doped conditions without depleted regions. We identified the
photothermoelectric detection that we observed as a new type of unipolar
mechanism in which only electrons or holes contribute to rectifying the THz
radiation under current-driven conditions. These two detection mechanisms
coexist in a certain wide transcendent range of the applied bias voltages. It
was also clearly manifested that the temporal photoresponse of the plasmonic

whereas the maximal photoresponsivity of the photothermoelectric detection is
almost twice as high as that of the plasmonic detection under the applied

be promising for use in 6G- and 7G-class high-speed wireless communication

process, where three $\alpha$ particles fuse to form $^{12}$C in the excited
Hoyle state, which can then decay to the ground state. The rate of carbon
production in stars depends on the radiative width of the Hoyle state. The
radiative width can be deduced by combining three separately measured
quantities, one of which is the $E0$ decay branching ratio. The $E0$ branching
ratio can be measured by exciting the Hoyle state in the $^{12}$C$(p,p')$
reaction and measuring the pair decay of its Hoyle state and first $2^+$ state.
  Purpose: To reduce the uncertainties in the carbon production rate in the
universe by measuring a set of proton angular distributions for the population
of the Hoyle state ($0^+_2$) and $2^+_1$ state in $^{12}$C in $^{12}$C$(p,p')$
reactions between 10.20 and 10.70 MeV, used in the determination of the $E0$
branching ratio of the Hoyle state.
  Method: Proton angular distributions populating the ground, first $2^+$, and
the Hoyle states in $^{12}$C were measured in $^{12}$C(p,p') reactions with a
silicon detector array covering $22^\circ<\theta<158^\circ$ in 14 energy steps
between 10.20 and 10.70 MeV with a thin ($60\ \mu$g/cm$^2$) $^{nat}$C target.
  Results: Total cross-sections for each state were extracted and the
population ratio between the $2^+_1$ and Hoyle state determined at each energy
step. By appropriately averaging these cross-sections and taking their ratio,
the equivalent population ratio can be extracted applicable for any thick
$^{12}$C target used in pair-conversion measurements.
  Conclusions: We present a general data set of high-precision $^{12}$C$(p,p')$
cross-sections that make uncertainties resulting from the population of the
$2^+_1$ and $0^+_2$ states by proton inelastic scattering negligible for any
future measurements of the $E0$ branching ratio in $^{12}$C.

offer similar advantages under distributional shifts. We find that, across

improvements are more significant than those afforded by even very large
ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational costs. However, these
improvements are relatively small compared to the outstanding issues in
distributionally-robust deep learning. Epinets may be a useful tool in the
toolbox, but they are far from the complete solution.

their superconductivity, with $T_c$ ranging from 4.5 to 6.3 K, was investigated
via electrical-resistivity-, magnetic-susceptibility-, and specific-heat
measurements. The upper critical fields $\mu_0H_\mathrm{c2}$ $\sim$ 7 T were
determined mostly from measurements of the electrical resistivity in applied
magnetic fields. The microscopic electronic properties were investigated by
means of muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) techniques. In the normal state, NMR relaxation data indicate
an almost ideal metallic behavior, confirmed by band-structure calculations,
which suggest a relatively high electronic density of states at the Fermi
level, dominated by the Zr 4$d$ orbitals. The low-temperature superfluid
density, obtained via transverse-field $\mu$SR, suggests a fully-gapped
superconducting state in Zr$_5$Pt$_3$ and Zr$_5$Pt$_3$C$_{0.3}$, with a
zero-temperature gap $\Delta_0$ = 1.20 and 0.60 meV and a magnetic penetration
depth $\lambda_0$ = 333 and 493 nm, respectively. The exponential dependence of
the NMR relaxation rates below $T_c$ further supports a nodeless
superconductivity. The absence of spontaneous magnetic fields below the onset
of superconductivity, as determined from zero-field $\mu$SR measurements,
confirms a preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state of
Zr$_5$Pt$_3$C$_x$. In contrast to a previous study, our $\mu$SR and NMR results

analytical framework for error performance of CNOMA schemes under practical

canceler (SIC), imperfect channel estimation (ICSI), and hardware impairments
(HWI) at the transceivers. We derive bit error rate (BER) expressions in CNOMA
schemes whether the direct links between source and users exist or not which
is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first study in the open
literature. For comparisons, we also provide BER expression for downlink NOMA
with practical constraints which has also not been given in literature, yet.
The theoretical BER expressions are validated with computer simulations where
the perfect-match is observed. Finally, we discuss the effects of the system
parameters (e.g., power allocation, HWI level) on the performance of CNOMA

artificial hard negative samples for \textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning, namely \textbf{CGC}, which has a different perspective compared to
those sampling-based strategies. We utilize counterfactual mechanism to produce
hard negative samples, which ensures that the generated samples are similar to,
but have labels that different from the positive sample. The proposed method
achieves satisfying results on several datasets compared to some traditional
unsupervised graph learning methods and some SOTA graph contrastive learning
methods. We also conduct some supplementary experiments to give an extensive
illustration of the proposed method, including the performances of CGC with
different hard negative samples and evaluations for hard negative samples
generated with different similarity measurements.

segmentation models: to what extent, how often, and on which samples a model's
predictions can be used/trusted. We first propose a measure,
Correctness-Confidence Rank Correlation (CCRC), to capture how predictions'
confidence estimates correlate with their correctness scores in rank. A model
with a high value of CCRC means its prediction confidences reliably suggest
which samples' predictions are more likely to be correct. Since CCRC does not
capture the actual prediction correctness, it alone is insufficient to indicate
whether a prediction model is both accurate and reliable to use in practice.
Therefore, we further propose another method, Usable Region Estimate (URE),
which simultaneously quantifies predictions' correctness and reliability of
confidence assessments in one estimate. URE provides concrete information on to
what extent a model's predictions are usable. In addition, the sizes of usable
regions (UR) can be utilized to compare models: A model with a larger UR can be
taken as a more usable and hence better model. Experiments on six datasets

model-size dependence of differentially private convex learning and raises the
following research question: When does the performance of differentially
private learning not degrade with increasing model size? We identify that the
magnitudes of gradients projected onto subspaces is a key factor that
determines performance. To precisely characterize this for private convex
learning, we introduce a condition on the objective that we term
\emph{restricted Lipschitz continuity} and derive improved bounds for the
excess empirical and population risks that are dimension-independent under
additional conditions. We empirically show that in private fine-tuning of large
language models, gradients obtained during fine-tuning are mostly controlled by
a few principal components. This behavior is similar to conditions under which
we obtain dimension-independent bounds in convex settings. Our theoretical and

oscillates with an increase of the disorder strength. Finally, numerical
results elucidate that the derivative of the normalized participation ratio

the first 15 days of outburst, the spin-period appears to have increased by
0.014(1)%. This increase probably arose from the sudden loss of
high-angular-momentum gas (""the nova explosion"") from the rotating, magnetic
white dwarf. Both periodic signals appeared remarkably early in the outburst,
which we attribute to the extreme speed with which the nova evolved (and became
transparent to radiation from the inner binary). After that very fast initial
increase of ~71 ms, the spin-period commenced a steady decrease of ~160 ms/year

due to high accretion torques from very high mass-transfer rates, which might

language interfaces (NLIs) for end-users to flexibly specify and interact with
visualizations. However, these toolkits currently only support one-off
utterances, with minimal capability to facilitate a multi-turn dialog between
the user and the system. Developing NLIs with such conversational interaction
capabilities remains a challenging task, requiring implementations of low-level
NLP techniques to process a new query as an intent to follow-up on an older
query. We extend an existing Python-based toolkit, NL4DV, that processes an NL
query about a tabular dataset and returns an analytic specification containing
data attributes, analytic tasks, and relevant visualizations, modeled as a JSON
object. Specifically, NL4DV now enables developers to facilitate multiple
simultaneous conversations about a dataset and resolve associated ambiguities,
augmenting new conversational information into the output JSON object. We
demonstrate these capabilities through three examples: (1) an NLI to learn
aspects of the Vega-Lite grammar, (2) a mind mapping application to create
free-flowing conversations, and (3) a chatbot to answer questions and resolve
ambiguities.

self-supervised text recognition methods attempted to utilize unlabeled real

learn to recognize the texts through both reading and writing, we propose to
learn discrimination and generation by integrating contrastive learning and
masked image modeling in our self-supervised method. The contrastive learning
branch is adopted to learn the discrimination of text images, which imitates
the reading behavior of humans. Meanwhile, masked image modeling is firstly
introduced for text recognition to learn the context generation of the text
images, which is similar to the writing behavior. The experimental results show
that our method outperforms previous self-supervised text recognition methods
by 10.2%-20.2% on irregular scene text recognition datasets. Moreover, our
proposed text recognizer exceeds previous state-of-the-art text recognition

around QSOs is still under debate which has significant implications for galaxy
formation and evolution. In this paper, we study Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around two
high redshift QSOs, SDSS J141935.58+525710.7 at $z=3.218$ (hereafter QSO1) and
SDSS J141813.40+525240.4 at $z=3.287$ (hereafter QSO2), from the miniJPAS

from the miniJPAS survey and SDSS spectra, we analyzed their morphology,
nature, and origin. We report the serendipitous detection of double-core Ly\al\
morphology around two QSOs which is rarely seen among other QSOs. The
separations of the two Ly\al~cores are 11.07 $\pm$ 2.26 kpcs (1.47 $\pm$
0.3$^{\prime\prime}$) and 9.73 $\pm$ 1.55 kpcs (1.31 $\pm$
0.21$^{\prime\prime}$) with Ly$\alpha$~line luminosities of $\sim$ 3.35 $\times
10^{44}$ erg s $^{-1} $ and $\sim$ 6.99 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s $^{-1}$ for
QSO1 and QSO2, respectively. The miniJPAS NB images show evidence of extended
Ly$\alpha$ and CIV morphology for both QSOs and extended HeII morphology for
QSO1. These two QSOs may be potential candidates for the new enormous Lyman
alpha nebula (ELAN) found from the miniJPAS survey due to their extended
morphology in the shallow depth and relatively high Ly$\alpha$ luminosities. We
suggest that galactic outflows are the major powering mechanism for the
double-core Ly$\alpha$ morphology. Considering the relatively shallow exposures
of miniJPAS, the objects found here could be the tip of the iceberg of a
promising number of such objects that will be uncovered in the upcoming full
J-PAS survey and deep IFU observations with 8-10m telescopes will be essential
for constraining the underlying physical mechanism that is responsible for the
double-cored morphology.

hexagonal structures with almost zero planar buckling, $\Delta$. By tuning the
$\Delta$, the strong $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bond through sp$^2$ hybridization
of a flat form of these monolayers can be changed to a stronger
$\sigma\text{-}\pi$ bond through sp$^3$ hybridization. Consequently, the band
gaps of the monolayers are tuned due to a dislocation of the $s$- and
$p$-orbitals towards the Fermi energy. The band gaps decrease with increasing
$\Delta$ for those flat monolayers, which have a band gap greater than $1.0$
eV, while no noticeable change or a flat dispersion of the band gap is seen for
the flat monolayers, that have a band gap less than $1.0$ eV. The decreased
band gap causes a decrease in the excitation energy, and thus the static
dielectric function, refractive index, and the optical conductivity are
increased. In contrast, the flat band gap dispersion of few monolayers in the
group III-Nitride induces a reduction in the static dielectric function, the
refractive index, and the optical conductivity. We therefore confirm that
tuning of the planar buckling can be used to control the physical properties of
these monolayers, both for an enhancement and a reduction of the optical
properties. These results are of interest for the design of optoelectric

We introduce Asymmetric Budget Split, a novel methodology for valid measurement

creates small asymmetries in ad budget allocation across comparable partitions

harmonically trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas in the quasicondensate
regime using a finite-temperature classical field approach. By characterising
the oscillations via the dynamics of the density profile's rms width over long
time, we find that the rms width displays beating of two distinct frequencies.
This means that 1D Bose gas oscillates not at a single breathing mode
frequency, as found in previous studies, but as a superposition of two distinct
breathing modes, one oscillating at frequency close to $\simeq\!\sqrt{3}\omega$
and the other at $\simeq\!2\omega$, where $\omega$ is the trap frequency. The
breathing mode at $\sim\!\sqrt{3}\omega$ dominates the beating at lower
temperatures, deep in the quasicondensate regime, and can be attributed to the
oscillations of the bulk of the density distribution comprised of particles
populating low-energy, highly-occupied states. The breathing mode at
$\simeq\!2\omega$, on the other hand, dominates the beating at higher
temperatures, close to the nearly ideal, degenerate Bose gas regime, and is
attributed to the oscillations of the tails of the density distribution
comprised of thermal particles in higher energy states. The two breathing modes
have distinct damping rates, with the damping rate of the bulk component being
approximately four times larger than that of the tails component.

Neural Parameterization (NeP), a hybrid representation that provides the

parameterizing the 3D geometry into 2D texture space. We enable geometric
editability by introducing an explicit linear deformation blending layer. The
deformation is controlled by a set of sparse key points, which can be
explicitly and intuitively displaced to edit the geometry. For appearance, we
develop a hybrid 2D texture consisting of an explicit texture map for easy

topological solitons have negative energy due to topological terms originating
from the chiral magnetic or vortical effect and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

in the vacuum through quantum tunneling in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions, by using
a complex $\phi^4$ (or the axion) model with a topological term proportional to
an external field, which is a simplification of low-energy theories of the
above systems. In $2+1$ dimensions, a pair of a vortex and an anti-vortex is
connected by a linear soliton, while in $3+1$ dimensions, a vortex is
string-like, a soliton is wall-like, and a disk of a soliton wall is bounded by
a string loop. Since the tension of solitons can be effectively negative due to
the topological term, such a composite configuration of a finite size is
created by quantum tunneling and subsequently grows rapidly. We estimate the
nucleation probability analytically in the thin-defect approximation and fully
calculate it numerically using the relaxation (gradient flow) method. The
nucleation probability is maximized when the direction of the soliton is
perpendicular to the external field. We find a good agreement between the

popular route to large-scale quantum computers capable of accurate computation
even in the presence of noise. Its popularity is, in part, because the
fault-tolerance or accuracy threshold for surface codes is believed to be less
stringent than competing schemes. This threshold is the noise level below which
computational accuracy can be increased by increasing physical resources for
noise removal, and is an important engineering target for realising quantum
devices. The current conclusions about surface code thresholds are, however,
drawn largely from studies of probabilistic noise. While a natural assumption,
current devices experience noise beyond such a model, raising the question of
whether conventional statements about the thresholds apply. Here, we attempt to
extend past proof techniques to derive the fault-tolerance threshold for
surface codes subjected to general noise with no particular structure.
Surprisingly, we found no nontrivial threshold, i.e., there is no guarantee the
surface code prescription works for general noise. While this is not a proof
that the scheme fails, we argue that current proof techniques are likely unable
to provide an answer. A genuinely new idea is needed, to reaffirm the
feasibility of surface code quantum computing.

complete SAPT(VQE) interaction energies up to second order. The SAPT
interaction energy terms are computed as first-level observables with no
subtraction of monomer energies invoked, and the only quantum observations
needed are the the VQE one- and two-particle density matrices. We find
empirically that SAPT(VQE) can provide accurate interaction energies even with
coarsely optimized, low circuit depth wavefunctions from the quantum computer,
simulated through ideal statevectors. The errors on the total interaction
energy are orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding VQE total energy

latency requirements, which offloads computation tasks generated in user
equipments (UEs) to the edge to reduce the processing latency. However, it
incorporates the task transmission latency, which may become the bottleneck of
latency requirements. Data compression (DC) has been considered as one of the
promising techniques to reduce the transmission latency. By compressing the
computation tasks before transmitting, the transmission delay is reduced due to
the shrink transmitted data size, and the original computing task can be
retrieved by employing data decompressing (DD) at the edge nodes or the centre
cloud. Nevertheless, the DC and DD incorporate extra processing latency, and
the latency performance has not been investigated in the large-scale DC-enabled
F-RAN. Therefore, in this work, the successful data compression probability
(SDCP) is defined to analyse the latency performance of the F-RAN. Moreover, to
analyse the effect of compression offloading ratio (COR), a novel hybrid
compression mode is proposed based on the queueing theory. Based on this, the
closed-form result of SDCP in the large-scale DC-enabled F-RAN is derived by
combining the Matern cluster process and M/G/1 queueing model, and validated by
Monte Carlo simulations. Based on the derived SDCP results, the effects of COR
on the SDCP is analysed numerically. The results show that the SDCP with the
optimal COR can be enhanced with a maximum value of 0.3 and 0.55 as compared
with the cases of compressing all computing tasks at the edge and at the UE,
respectively. Moreover, for the system requiring the minimal latency, the
proposed hybrid compression mode can alleviate the requirement on the backhaul

First, we study geodesics in this wormhole spacetime, in the presence of a

shows the presence of displacement and velocity memory effects. Motivated by
the same, we study the memory effects at null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs
formalism, adapted for braneworld wormhole. Our analysis provides a non-trivial
change of the Bondi mass after the passage of a burst of gravitational
radiation and hence manifests the memory effect at null infinity. In both of
these exercises, the presence of extra dimension and the wormhole nature of the

gravitational wave detectors will be able to probe the memory effect, the
present work provides another avenue to search for compact objects other than

detour this problem by splitting a model and communicating the hidden

Notwithstanding, the smashed data of ViT are as large as and as similar as the

significantly from the corresponding observed frequencies due to the

certain combinations of frequencies -- known as frequency ratios -- are largely
unaffected by the uncertain physical processes as they are mostly sensitive to
the stellar core. Furthermore, the seismic signature of helium ionization
provides envelope properties while being almost independent of the outermost
layers. We have developed an advanced stellar modelling approach in which we
complement frequency ratios with parameters of the helium ionization zone while
taking into account all possible correlations to put the most stringent
constraints on the stellar internal structure. We have tested the method using
the Kepler benchmark star 16 Cyg A and have investigated the potential of the
helium glitch parameters to constrain the basic stellar properties in detail.
It has been explicitly shown that the initial helium abundance and
mixing-length parameters are well constrained within our framework, reducing
systematic uncertainties on stellar mass and age arising for instance from the
well-known anti-correlation between the mass and initial helium abundance. The
modelling of six additional Kepler stars including 16 Cyg B reinforces the
above findings and also confirms that our approach is mostly independent from
model uncertainties associated with the near-surface layers. Our method is
relatively computationally expensive, however, it provides stellar masses,
radii and ages precisely in an automated manner, paving the way for analysing
numerous stars observed in the future during the ESA PLATO mission.

build differentiable estimators of the eGeMAPS and then use them to fine-tune
existing speech enhancement systems. Our approach is generic and can be applied
to any existing deep learning based enhancement systems to further improve the

of kaon condensation in the hyperon-mixed matter and equation of state for the
developed ($Y+K$) phase: One is the contact interaction scheme related to the
nonlinear effective chiral Lagrangian. The other is the meson-exchange scheme,
where the interaction vertices between the kaon field and baryons are described
by exchange of mesons (sigma, sigma^* mesons for scalar coupling, and omega,
rho, phi mesons for vector coupling). It is shown that in the meson exchange
scheme, the contribution from the nonlinear scalar self-interaction gives rise
to a repulsive effect for kaon effective energy, pushing up the onset density
of kaon condensation as compared with the case of the contact interaction
scheme. In general, the difference of kaon-baryon dynamics between the contact
interaction scheme and the meson-exchange scheme relies on the specific forms
of the nonlinear self-interacting meson terms. It is shown that the nonlinear
self-interacting term is not relevant to repulsive energy leading to stiffening
of the equation of state at high densities and that it cannot be compensated
with large attractive energy due to the appearance of the ($Y$+$K$) phase in
the case of the contact interaction scheme. We also discuss in the contact

structures such as bridges, weirs and dams. This is especially true during
floods, where significant backwater effects or diversion of flow out of bank
can result. However, within contemporary industry practice, linear features
such as bridges are often modelled using coarse approximations, empirically
based methods or are omitted entirely. Presented within this paper is a novel
Riemann solver which is capable of modelling the influence of such features
within hydrodynamic flood models using finite volume schemes to solve the
shallow water equations. The solution procedure represents structures at the
interface between neighbouring cells and uses a combination of internal
boundary conditions and a different form of the conservation laws in the
adjacent cells to resolve numerical fluxes across the interface. Since the
procedure only applies to the cells adjacent to the interface at which a
structure is being modelled, the method is therefore potentially compatible
with existing hydrodynamic models. Comparisons with validation data collected
from a state of the art research flume demonstrate that the solver is suitable
for modelling a range of flow conditions and structure configurations such as
bridges and gates.

i.e., Synthesis-As-Training, to learn the correlation between the eye region
features and the gaze angle. As a result, we can use the learned latent space
for gaze animation with semantic interpolation in this space. Moreover, to
alleviate both the memory and the computational costs in the training and the
inference stage, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Module (CFM) integrated with GCM

technique that trains ML models in a distributed setting without data ever
leaving the host device, would be a better alternative to the centralized
option. In this ML technique, only parameters and certain metadata would be
communicated. In spite of that, there still exist attacks that can infer user
data using the parameters and metadata. A fully privacy-preserving solution
involves homomorphically encrypting (HE) the data communicated. This paper will

calculations, when the chemical potential difference is adjusted to make the

period $3$ in the ground state of the model, while the spin excitation has a
small energy gap. Moreover, the electron pair-pair correlation has a
quasi-long-range behavior, indicating an instability of superconductivity even
at half-filling. As a comparison, the same method is applied to a pure
two-legged Hubbard model with $1/3$ hole doping in which the period-3 charge

the free electron chain of the three-legged ladder plays the role of a charge

mass is in the range $4\,\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim 1\,\text{MeV}$. We give
an overview of such $f (R)$ gravity theory minimally coupled to the Standard
Model. Similarly to other dark-matter models based on scalar fields, this model
has the issue of initial conditions. Firstly, the initial conditions for the
scalaron are to be tuned in order to produce the observed amount of dark
matter. Secondly, the primordial spatial inhomogeneities in the field are to be
sufficiently small because they generate entropy (or isocurvature)
perturbations, which are constrained by observations. We consider these issues
in the present paper. The initial conditions for the scalaron presumably emerge
at the inflationary stage. We point out that the homogeneous part of the
scalaron initial value is largely unpredictable because of quantum diffusion
during inflation. Thus, to account for the observed amount of dark matter, one
has to resort to anthropic considerations. Observational constraints on the
primordial spatial inhomogeneity of the scalaron are translated into upper
bounds on the energy scale of inflation, which happen to be low but not too
restrictive.

statistical reconstruction of short-exposure speckle images. Combining the
rapidity of Shift-Add and the accuracy of speckle masking, this paper proposes
a novel reconstruction algorithm-NASIR (Non-rigid Alignment based Solar Image
Reconstruction). NASIR reconstructs the phase of the object image at each
frequency by building a computational model between geometric distortion and
intensity distribution and reconstructs the modulus of the object image on the
aligned speckle images by speckle interferometry. We analyzed the performance
of NASIR by using the correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and coefficient
of variation of intensity profile (CVoIP) in processing data obtained by the
NVST (1m New Vacuum Solar Telescope). The reconstruction experiments and
analysis results show that the quality of images reconstructed by NASIR is
close to speckle masking when the seeing is good, while NASIR has excellent
robustness when the seeing condition becomes worse. Furthermore, NASIR
reconstructs the entire field of view in parallel in one go, without phase
recursion and block-by-block reconstruction, so its computation time is less
than half that of speckle masking. Therefore, we consider NASIR is a robust and
high-quality fast reconstruction method that can serve as an effective tool for
data filtering and quick look.

generation mechanism of whistler waves by a combination of Landau-resonant and
cyclotron-resonant wave-particle interactions of electrons in response to the
large-scale evolution of a magnetic hole. As the magnetic hole converges, a
pair of counter-streaming electron beams form near the hole's center as a
consequence of the combined action of betatron and Fermi effects. The beams
trigger the generation of slightly-oblique whistler waves. Our conceptual

homogeneous reactor. Parameterization of these models is known a priori which
allows for benchmarking with the local PCA approach. We further extend the
application of local PCA to a more challenging case of a turbulent non-premixed
$n$-heptane/air jet flame for which the parameterization is no longer obvious.
Our results suggest that meaningful parameterization can be obtained also for
more complex datasets. We show that local PCA finds variables that can be

attack, another famous threat to DNNs, has not been studied for deep hashing

introduce a label-based contrastive learning network LabCLN to exploit the
semantic characteristics of different labels, which are subsequently used for
confusing and misleading the target model to learn the embedded trigger. We
finally explore the mechanism of backdoor attacks on image retrieval in the

$\eta\to+\infty$ (large dissipation). Surprisingly, at the limit
$\eta\to+\infty$, we show that no energy is absorbed by the inclusion. This is
due to the so-called skin-effect phenomenon and can be explained by the fact
that the field no longer penetrates into the highly dissipative inclusion.
These results guarantee that in monomode regime, the amplitude of the

situation where this minimum is zero, that is when the device acts as a perfect

in the B20-type compounds, in a three-dimensional itinerant magnet. As opposed
to widely used Monte Carlo simulations, we employ a neural-network-based
approach for exploring the ground state spin configuration in a
noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. Further, we address the topological Hall
conductivity, associated with nonzero scalar spin chirality, in the itinerant
magnet due to the coupling to the spin hedgehog lattice, and provide the
evidence of magneto-optic Kerr effect.

their potential for terahertz dynamics, deflection free motion, and improved

source for learning to localize and repair real bugs. However, the absence of
large scale bug fix collections has made it difficult to effectively exploit
real bug fixes in the training of larger neural models in the past. In
contrast, artificial bugs -- produced by mutating existing source code -- can
be easily obtained at a sufficient scale and are therefore often preferred in
the training of existing approaches. Still, localization and repair models that
are trained on artificial bugs usually underperform when faced with real bugs.
This raises the question whether bug localization and repair models trained on
real bug fixes are more effective in localizing and repairing real bugs.
  We address this question by introducing RealiT, a pre-train-and-fine-tune
approach for effectively learning to localize and repair real bugs from real
bug fixes. RealiT is first pre-trained on a large number of artificial bugs
produced by traditional mutation operators and then fine-tuned on a smaller set
of real bug fixes. Fine-tuning does not require any modifications of the
learning algorithm and hence can be easily adopted in various training
scenarios for bug localization or repair (even when real training data is
scarce). In addition, we found that training on real bug fixes with RealiT is
empirically powerful by nearly doubling the localization performance of an
existing model on real bugs while maintaining or even improving the repair
performance.

to the interaction of turbulent convection and rotation. Aims: The aim of the
study is to investigate the effects of the thermal Prandtl number on the
transition from anti-solar (slow equator, fast poles) to solar-like (fast
equator, slow poles) differential rotation. Methods: Three-dimensional
hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations in semi-global spherical wedge
geometry are used to model convection zones of solar-like stars. Results: The
overall convective velocity amplitude increases as the Prandtl number decreases
in accordance with earlier studies. The transition from anti-solar to
solar-like differential rotation is insensitive to the Prandtl number for
Prandtl numbers below unity but for Prandtl numbers greater than unity,
solar-like differential rotation becomes significantly harder to excite.
Magnetic fields and more turbulent regimes with higher fluid and magnetic
Reynolds numbers help in achieving solar-like differential rotation in
near-transition cases. Solar-like differential rotation occurs only in cases
with radially outward angular momentum transport at the equator. The dominant
contribution to such outward transport near the equator is due to prograde
propagating thermal Rossby waves. Conclusions: The differential rotation is
sensitive to the Prandtl number only for large Prandtl numbers in the parameter
regime explored in the current study. Magnetic fields have a greater effect on
the differential rotation, although the inferred presence of a small-scale
dynamo does not lead to drastically different results in the present study. The
dominance of the thermal Rossby waves in the simulations is puzzling given the
non-detection in the Sun. The current simulations are shown to be incompatible
with the currently prevailing mean-field theory of differential rotation.

compactifications. The first investigates bounds put by the Weak Gravity
Conjecture in the setting of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories arising
from Type IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications. The second application studies flux
potentials in asymptotic regimes in complex structure moduli space, where we
develop two schemes for moduli stabilization. The first scheme sets up an
approximation procedure for finding flux vacua divided in three steps: the
sl(2)-approximation, the nilpotent orbit approximation, and the fully corrected
result. The second scheme constructs flux vacua with a small flux
superpotential by using essential exponential corrections controlled by
asymptotic Hodge theory.

system. By considering Lyapunov stability notions and applying limit and
invariance results for set-valued correspondences, necessary conditions are
derived for convergence of a receding horizon map to a periodic equilibrium of
the aggregative game. This result is achieved for any (feasible) initial

distributed learning over multiple EHRs databases without sharing patient-level

differential privacy property and thus reducing the risk of information
leaking. The proposed approach, without sharing the raw patient level data,
allows for proper statistical inference and can accommodate sparse regressions.

Gauge-Invariant Vacuum expectation value Scheme (GIVS). The tadpole scheme
matters in higher-order predictions of observables if not all free parameters
are fixed by renormalization conditions based on S-matrix elements, such as in
MSbar renormalization. In contrast to previously used tadpole schemes, the GIVS
unifies the properties of gauge invariance and perturbative stability. The
application of the GIVS to the Standard Model, for instance, leads to very
moderate electroweak corrections in the conversion of on-shell-renormalized to
MSbar-renormalized masses. Moreover, in models with extended Higgs sectors, the
GIVS is less prone to perturbative instabilities in the MSbar renormalization
of Higgs mixing angles than observed for the traditional gauge-independent
tadpole treatment. We illustrate this by considering the next-to-leading-order

challenge of small $n$ and large $p$ that is often encountered in analysis of

However, the set of important features may not always be the same across all
datasets. Although some existing integrative learning methods allow
heterogeneous sparsity structure where a subset of datasets can have zero
coefficients for some selected features, they tend to yield reduced efficiency,
reinstating the problem of losing weak important signals. We propose a new
integrative learning approach which can not only aggregate important signals
well in homogeneous sparsity structure, but also substantially alleviate the
problem of losing weak important signals in heterogeneous sparsity structure.
Our approach exploits a priori known graphical structure of features and
encourages joint selection of features that are connected in the graph.
Integrating such prior information over multiple datasets enhances the power,
while also accounting for the heterogeneity across datasets. Theoretical

substantially affect COM abundances. Two grain collision velocities were
considered - 10 and 50 meters per second, corresponding to realistic grain
relative speeds arising from ambipolar diffusion and turbulence, respectively.
From the smaller grains, the collisions are assumed to remove a spherical cap
with height equal to 1/3 and 1 ice mantle thickness, respectively. We find that
the turbulence-induced desorption can elevate the gas-phase abundances of COMs
by several orders of magnitude, reproducing observed COM abundances within an
order of magnitude. Importantly, the high gaseous COM abundances are attained
for long time-scales of up to 1 Myr and for a rather low methanol ice

switches its behavior from antichemotactic to chemotactic. The origin of the
emergent chemotaxis is the cooperative exploration of activity gradient by the
two particles. While one of the particles moves into higher activity regions,

particles with charged Brownian particles under magnetic field and show that
despite the fundamental similarity in terms of their odd-diffusive behavior,
their dynamics and chemotactic behavior are generally not equivalent. We
demonstrate this explicitly in a dimer composed of oppositely charged active

that can occur in an information system application. The interplay of
pre-conditions and post-conditions determines a semantically justified partial
order of the defined actions and serves to enforce integrity constraints. This
form of specification allows the use of plan-generation algorithms to
investigate, before the system is adopted, whether the proposed specification
allows all desirable use cases, and effectively disallows undesirable ones.
Especially for legacy applications, implemented without a prior specification,
Process Mining techniques were employed to derive an implicit Petri net model
from the analysis of a large number of traces registered in an execution log.
However, if the system just begins to be used, and has a still empty execution
log, this sort of process mining discovery would not be feasible. This paper
explains how the Petri net model can be directly derived from the situation
calculus specification rules. The main gist is to provide evidence that the two
models are complementary, not only because the Petri net model is derivable
from the situation calculus model, but also in view of the distinct advantages
of the two models. While the situation calculus model leads to planning and
simulated execution prior to implementation, the Petri net model can be
designed to run in a restrictive mode, allowing an intuitive visualization of
the workable sequences. As proof of concept, the paper describes a prototype to
demonstrate the methods and applies it to two examples: a published request
processing application used to introduce process mining notions; and an
analogously structured trial by combat application taken from a popular movie.
The prototype includes an interactive dramatization component, which enacts the
second application.

videos(SDRTV-to-HDRTV). Previous approaches use global feature modulation for
SDRTV-to-HDRTV. Feature modulation scales and shifts the features in the
original feature space, which has limited mapping capability. In addition, the
global image mapping cannot restore detail in HDR frames due to the luminance
differences in different regions of SDR frames. To resolve the appeal, we
propose a two-stage solution. The first stage is a hierarchical Dynamic Context
feature mapping (HDCFM) model. HDCFM learns the SDR frame to HDR frame mapping
function via hierarchical feature modulation (HME and HM ) module and a dynamic
context feature transformation (DCT) module. The HME estimates the feature
modulation vector, HM is capable of hierarchical feature modulation, consisting
of global feature modulation in series with local feature modulation, and is
capable of adaptive mapping of local image features. The DCT module constructs
a feature transformation module in conjunction with the context, which is
capable of adaptively generating a feature transformation matrix for feature
mapping. Compared with simple feature scaling and shifting, the DCT module can
map features into a new feature space and thus has a more excellent feature
mapping capability. In the second stage, we introduce a patch
discriminator-based context generation model PDCG to obtain subjective quality
enhancement of over-exposed regions. PDCG can solve the problem that the model
is challenging to train due to the proportion of overexposed regions of the
image. The proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art objective and
subjective quality results. Specifically, HDCFM achieves a PSNR gain of 0.81 dB
at a parameter of about 100K. The number of parameters is 1/14th of the
previous state-of-the-art methods. The test code will be released soon.

from the data. The differential constraints of fluid mechanics are recast in
the language of constant rank differential operators. Adapting abstract results

is probably cold (CDM). However, modifications to the standard CDM model may be
required by the small-scale observations, and DM may be self-interacting (SIDM)
or warm (WDM). Here we show that the diffractive lensing of gravitational waves
(GWs) from binary black hole mergers by small halos ($\sim10^3-10^6M_\odot$;
mini-halos) may serve as a clean probe to the nature of DM, free from the
contamination of baryonic processes in the DM studies based on dwarf/satellite
galaxies. The expected lensed GW signals and event rates resulting from CDM,
WDM, and SIDM models are significantly different from each other, because of
the differences in halo density profiles and abundances predicted by these
models. We estimate the detection rates of such lensed GW events for a number
of current and future GW detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Observatories (LIGO), the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Cosmic
Explorer (CE), Gravitational-wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (GLOC), the
Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO), and the Big
Bang Observer (BBO). We find that GLOC may detect one such events per year
assuming the CDM model, DECIGO (BBO) may detect more than several (hundreds of)
such events per year, by assuming the CDM, WDM (with mass $>30$\,keV) or SIDM
model, suggesting that the DM nature may be strongly constrained by DECIGO and
BBO via the detection of diffractive lensed GW events by mini-halos. Other GW
detectors are unlikely to detect a significant number of such events within a
limited observational time period. However, if the inner slope of the mini-halo
density profile is sufficiently steeper than the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile, e.g., the pseudo-Jaffe profile, one may be able to detect one to more
than hundred such GW events by ET and CE.

In particular, a weight system can be associated to any metrized Lie algebra,

large scene variations or textureless scenes. To gain robustness to such
situations, most previous studies have attempted to encode the global contexts
of a scene via graph neural networks or transformers. However, these contexts
do not explicitly represent high-level contextual information, such as
structural shapes or semantic instances; therefore, the encoded features are
still not sufficiently discriminative in challenging scenes. We propose a novel
image-matching method that applies a topic-modeling strategy to encode
high-level contexts in images. The proposed method trains latent semantic
instances called topics. It explicitly models an image as a multinomial
distribution of topics, and then performs probabilistic feature matching. This
approach improves the robustness of matching by focusing on the same semantic
areas between the images. In addition, the inferred topics provide
interpretability for matching the results, making our method explainable.
Extensive experiments on outdoor and indoor datasets show that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging cases.

work is to enable extensive transport theory applications that accounts fully
for the interplay between electric-field-induced interband and intraband
coherence, and Bloch-state scattering. The quasiparticle bands are treated in a
completely general manner that allows for arbitrary forms of the intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and could be extended to the extrinsic SOC. According
to the previous results, in the presence of the disorder potential, the
interband response in conductors in addition to an intrinsic contribution due
to the entire Fermi sea that captures, among other effects, the Berry curvature
contribution to wave-packet dynamics includes an anomalous contribution caused
by scattering that is sensitive to the presence of the Fermi surface. To
demonstrate the rich physics captured by our theory, the relaxation time matrix
for different strength order is considered and at the same time we explicitly
solve for some electric-field response properties of simple disordered Rashba

more clearly than before, thanks to the revised periods and distances. We
demonstrate the value of the period-luminosity diagram in distinguishing delta
Scuti stars from short-period RR Lyrae stars, and we find several new examples
of high-frequency delta Scuti stars with regular sequences of overtone modes,
including XX Pyx and 29 Cyg. Finally, we revisit the sample of delta Scuti
stars observed by Kepler and show that they follow a tight period-density
relation, with a pulsation constant for the fundamental mode of Q = 0.0315 d.

assessment, that is consistent with human perceptual scores. Modern neural
text-to-speech models require a vast amount of clean training data, which is
why many solutions switch from single speaker models to solutions trained on
examples from many different speakers. Multi-speaker models bring new
possibilities, such as a faster creation of new voices, but also a new problem
- speaker leakage, where the speaker identity of a synthesized example might
not match those of the target speaker. Currently, the only way to discover this
issue is through costly perceptual evaluations. In this work, we propose an
automatic method for assessment of speaker similarity. For that purpose, we
extend the recent work on speaker verification systems and evaluate how
different metrics and speaker embeddings models reflect Multiple Stimuli with
Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) scores. Our experiments show that we can
train a model to predict speaker similarity MUSHRA scores from speaker

Our point is that such effects do emerge from position ($\hat{q}_i$) and/or
momentum ($\hat{p}_i$) noncommutativity, i.e., from
$[\hat{q}_i,\,\hat{q}_j]\neq 0$ and/or $[\hat{p}_i,\,\hat{p}_j]\neq 0$ (for

$2$-dim noncommutative quantum harmonic oscillator through a procedure
supported by the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal framework. This allows for the
understanding of how the phase-space noncommutativity drives the amplitude of
periodic oscillations identified as time crystals. A natural extension of our

arise.

provides the continuous mapping for many critical applications, like the
attribute estimation, object detection, segmentation and non-rigid
registration. However, previous studies mainly took the case-wise criteria,
like the mean square errors, as the optimization objectives. They ignored the
very important population-wise correlation criterion, which is exactly the
final evaluation metric in many tasks. In this work, we propose to revisit the
classic regression tasks with novel investigations on directly optimizing the
fine-grained correlation losses. We mainly explore two complementary
correlation indexes as learnable losses: Pearson linear correlation (PLC) and
Spearman rank correlation (SRC). The contributions of this paper are two folds.
First, for the PLC on global level, we propose a strategy to make it robust
against the outliers and regularize the key distribution factors. These efforts
significantly stabilize the learning and magnify the efficacy of PLC. Second,
for the SRC on local level, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to ease the
learning of the exact ranking order among samples. Specifically, we convert the
learning for the ranking of samples into the learning of similarity
relationships among samples. We extensively validate our method on two typical
ultrasound image regression tasks, including the image quality assessment and
bio-metric measurement. Experiments prove that, with the fine-grained guidance
in directly optimizing the correlation, the regression performances are
significantly improved. Our proposed correlation losses are general and can be
extended to more important applications.

is measured to be $1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$. Cross-sections for gluon-gluon
fusion, vector-boson fusion, associated production with a $W$ or $Z$ boson, and
top associated production processes are reported. An upper limit of 10 times
the Standard Model prediction is set for the associated production process of a

of the top quark Yukawa coupling. Higgs boson production is further
characterized through measurements of Simplified Template Cross-Sections

STXS cross-sections are compatible with their Standard Model predictions, with
a $p$-value of 93%. The measurements are also used to set constraints on Higgs
boson coupling strengths, as well as on new interactions beyond the Standard

however their main goal can always be summarised as ""connecting relevant
content to interested users"". Personalized recommendation algorithms achieve
this goal by first building a profile of the user, either implicitly or
explicitly, and then matching items with this profile to find relevant content.
The more interpretable the profile and this ""matching function"" are, the easier
it is to provide users with accurate and intuitive explanations, and also to
let them interact with the system. Indeed, for a user to see what the system
has already learned about her interests is of key importance for her to provide
feedback to the system and to guide it towards better understanding her
preferences.
  To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model
that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata, which is arguably
the most interpretable domain for end users. Our method is hence inherently
transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a
linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method
seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can
directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained
browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests.
  We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application
for discovering cultural events in Belgium. Additionally, the performance of
the model is evaluated with offline experiments, both static and with simulated
feedback, and compared to several state-of-the-art and state-of-practice
baselines.

shortcomings, we focus on the inverse problem; training models on only
uncontaminated emissions thereby learning to discriminate RFI from all known
astronomical signals and system noise. We use Nearest-Latent-Neighbours (NLN) -
an algorithm that utilises both the reconstructions and latent distances to the
nearest-neighbours in the latent space of generative autoencoding models for
novelty detection. The uncontaminated regions are selected using weak-labels in
the form of RFI flags (generated by classical RFI flagging methods) available
from most radio astronomical data archives at no additional cost. We evaluate
performance on two independent datasets, one simulated from the HERA telescope

strong impact on band gaps or optical spectra. Commonly used frameworks for
electron-phonon energy corrections are the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory and the
Fr\""ohlich model. While the latter shows qualitative agreement with experiment
for many polar materials, its simplicity should bring hard limits to its
applicability in real materials. Improvements can be made by introducing a
generalized version of the model, which considers anisotropic and degenerate
electronic bands, and multiple phonon branches. In this work, we search for
trends and outliers on over a thousand materials in existing databases of
phonon and electron band structures. We use our results to identify the limits
of applicability of the standard Fr\""olich model by comparing to the
generalized version, and by testing its basic hypothesis of a large radius for
the polaronic wavefunction and the corresponding atomic displacement cloud.

also a significant fraction of the materials for which the perturbative
treatment cannot be applied and/or for which the size of the self-trapping

emerged recently concerns binary systems that appear to contain a normal B-type
star with an unseen companion, believed to be a black hole. On closer

significantly improves the detection of outlying observations in

conceptual ambiguities prevalent throughout the literature. Our experiments

trade-off exists between objectives. Key to solving such problems is to exploit
sparse dependency structures that exist between agents. For example, in wind
farm control a trade-off exists between maximising power and minimising stress
on the systems components. Dependencies between turbines arise due to the wake
effect. We model such sparse dependencies between agents as a multi-objective
coordination graph (MO-CoG). In multi-objective reinforcement learning a
utility function is typically used to model a users preferences over
objectives, which may be unknown a priori. In such settings a set of optimal
policies must be computed. Which policies are optimal depends on which
optimality criterion applies. If the utility function of a user is derived from
multiple executions of a policy, the scalarised expected returns (SER) must be
optimised. If the utility of a user is derived from a single execution of a
policy, the expected scalarised returns (ESR) criterion must be optimised. For
example, wind farms are subjected to constraints and regulations that must be
adhered to at all times, therefore the ESR criterion must be optimised. For
MO-CoGs, the state-of-the-art algorithms can only compute a set of optimal
policies for the SER criterion, leaving the ESR criterion understudied. To
compute a set of optimal polices under the ESR criterion, also known as the ESR
set, distributions over the returns must be maintained. Therefore, to compute a
set of optimal policies under the ESR criterion for MO-CoGs, we present a novel
distributional multi-objective variable elimination (DMOVE) algorithm. We
evaluate DMOVE in realistic wind farm simulations. Given the returns in
real-world wind farm settings are continuous, we utilise a model known as
real-NVP to learn the continuous return distributions to calculate the ESR set.

carefully designed smart contracts and a distributed file system to store

results that are competitive with conventional optimization algorithms at
reduced run times. However, deep neural networks generally require plenty of
labeled training data and are vulnerable to domain shifts between training and
test data. While typical intensity shifts can be mitigated by keypoint-based
registration, these methods still suffer from geometric domain shifts, for
instance, due to different fields of view. As a remedy, in this work, we
present a novel approach to geometric domain adaptation for image registration,
adapting a model from a labeled source to an unlabeled target domain. We build
on a keypoint-based registration model, combining graph convolutions for
geometric feature learning with loopy belief optimization, and propose to
reduce the domain shift through self-ensembling. To this end, we embed the
model into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We extend the Mean Teacher to this
context by 1) adapting the stochastic augmentation scheme and 2) combining
learned feature extraction with differentiable optimization. This enables us to
guide the learning process in the unlabeled target domain by enforcing
consistent predictions of the learning student and the temporally averaged
teacher model. We evaluate the method for exhale-to-inhale lung CT registration
under two challenging adaptation scenarios (DIR-Lab 4D CT to COPD, COPD to
Learn2Reg). Our method consistently improves on the baseline model by 50%/47%

synthetic binary catalogs for gravitational-wave progenitors studies. We
describe how to build multi-channel merger rates and describe their associated
probabilities focusing on stellar progenitor properties. We introduce a method
to quantify the match between the phenomenological reconstruction of merger
rates with synthetic catalogs. We detail the implementation of synthetic
catalogs for multi-channel hierarchical Bayesian inference, highlighting
computational aspects and issues related to hyper-prior choice. We find that
when inferring stellar progenitors' properties from gravitational-wave
observations, the relative efficiency in compact objects production should be
taken into account. Finally, by simulating binary black hole detections with
LIGO and Virgo sensitivity expected for the O4 observing run, we present two
case studies related to the inference of the common envelope efficiency and

nonisothermal phase transitions with a nonconserved order parameter that takes

approximation of a thermodynamically consistent system, is inspired by the
theories developed by Green and Naghdi. It consists of two nonlinearly coupled
partial differential equations that govern the phase dynamics and the universal
balance law for internal energy, written in terms of the phase variable and the
so-called thermal displacement, i.e., a primitive with respect to time of
temperature. We extend recent results obtained for optimal control problems in
which the free energy governing the phase transition was differentiable (i.e.,
of regular or logarithmic type) to the nonsmooth case of a double obstacle
potential. As is well known, in this nondifferentiable case standard methods to
establish the existence of appropriate Lagrange multipliers fail. This
difficulty is overcome utilizing of the so-called deep quench approach.
Namely,the double obstacle potential is approximated by a family of
(differentiable) logarithmic ones for which the existence of optimal controls
and first-order necessary conditions of optimality in terms of the adjoint
state variables and a variational inequality are known. By proving appropriate
bounds for the adjoint states of the approximating systems, we can pass to the

establishing meaningful first-order necessary optimality conditions also for

such shortcomings are (i) their computational inefficiency relative to
classical numerical methods, and (ii) the non-interpretability of a trained DNN
model. In this work we present ASPINN, an anisotropic extension of our earlier
work called SPINN--Sparse, Physics-informed, and Interpretable Neural
Networks--to solve PDEs that addresses both these issues. ASPINNs generalize
radial basis function networks. We demonstrate using a variety of examples
involving elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs that the special architecture we propose
is more efficient than generic DNNs, while at the same time being directly
interpretable. Further, they improve upon the SPINN models we proposed earlier
in that fewer nodes are require to capture the solution using ASPINN than using
SPINN, thanks to the anisotropy of the local zones of influence of each node.
The interpretability of ASPINN translates to a ready visualization of their
weights and biases, thereby yielding more insight into the nature of the
trained model. This in turn provides a systematic procedure to improve the
architecture based on the quality of the computed solution. ASPINNs thus serve
as an effective bridge between classical numerical algorithms and modern DNN

ASPINNs into a form that is closer to that of supervised learning algorithms.

select the preferred action, potentially causing the agent to select a less

Shimura's recollection, he had conjectured more than the holomorphic Lefschetz
fixed point theorem. He said he had made a conjecture for a holomorphic
correspondence, but he could not remember the statement. This paper is an
exploration of Shimura's forgotten conjecture, first for a smooth
correspondence, then for a holomorphic correspondence in the form of two
conjectures and finally in the form of an open problem involving an extension
to holomorphic vector bundles over two varieties and the calculation of the
trace of a Hecke correspondence.

critical effect on the performance of a model. Various solutions exist but
their impact on the convergence of the learning dynamics is not understood.
Here, we elucidate the significant negative impact of data imbalance on
learning, showing that the learning curves for minority and majority classes
follow sub-optimal trajectories when training with a gradient-based optimizer.
This slowdown is related to the imbalance ratio and can be traced back to a
competition between the optimization of different classes. Our main
contribution is the analysis of the convergence of full-batch (GD) and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and of variants that renormalize the
contribution of each per-class gradient. We find that GD is not guaranteed to
decrease the loss for each class but that this problem can be addressed by
performing a per-class normalization of the gradient. With SGD, class imbalance
has an additional effect on the direction of the gradients: the minority class
suffers from a higher directional noise, which reduces the effectiveness of the
per-class gradient normalization. Our findings not only allow us to understand
the potential and limitations of strategies involving the per-class gradients,
but also the reason for the effectiveness of previously used solutions for
class imbalance such as oversampling.

proposed in 2016 by Kone\v{c}n\'{y} et al. and McMahan et al. as a viable

FL mitigates the privacy risks associated with centralized data collection.

cases, the ordered LASSO model and its variants with some commonly used
nonconvex sparsity-inducing regularizers. The presence of both the
sparsity-inducing regularizer and the constraint set poses challenges on the
design of efficient algorithms. In this paper, by exploiting absolute-value

a new algorithm, called the Doubly Majorized Algorithm (DMA), for this class of

coordinate transformation in each iteration, and hence can be performed
efficiently. Without invoking any commonly used constraint qualification
conditions such as those based on horizon subdifferentials, we show that any
accumulation point of the sequence generated by DMA is a so-called $\psi_{\rm

the notion of $L$-stationarity. We also show that any global minimizer of our

We develop Transformer-based models, each varying in how they incorporate the

Evaluation across metrics and datasets demonstrates that blueprint models are
more factual than alternatives which do not resort to planning and allow
tighter control of the generation output.

high energy flares and possible stellar CMEs. Here, we conducted two
observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Pathfinder Telescope (ASKAP)
totalling 26 hours and scheduled to overlap with the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 36 field, utilising the wide fields of view of
both telescopes to search for multiple M dwarfs. We detected variable radio
emission in Stokes I centered at 888 MHz from four known active M dwarfs. Two
of these sources were also detected with Stokes V circular polarisation. When
examining the detected radio emission characteristics, we were not able
distinguish between the models for either electron cyclotron maser or
gyrosynchrotron emission. These detections add to the growing number of M
dwarfs observed with variable low frequency emission.

Benjamin and Bennett's bijection between coprime and non-coprime pairs, which

Euclid's algorithm ran backward). This allows us to break our analysis of the
quotients in three parts, namely the enumeration and count of: (1) sequences of
constant terms, (2) sequences of degrees, and (3) sequences of intermediate
terms. For (1), we show that the sequences of constant terms form a regular
language, and use classic results from algebraic language theory to count them.
Concerning (2), we remark that the sequences of degrees correspond to
compositions of natural numbers, which have a simple combinatorial description.
Finally, we show that for (3) the intermediate terms can be freely chosen.
Putting these three obeservations together, we devise a combinatorial algorithm
to enumerate all such coprime pairs of a given degree, and present an

  Modelling Lexical Decision with Linear Discriminative Learning","44 pages, 13 figures; revised version",,,,"cs.CL q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Trial-to-trial effects have been found in a number of studies, indicating

case are priming effects which have been modelled successfully with

continuously learning during experiments. This study investigates whether
trial-to-trial learning can be detected in an unprimed lexical decision
experiment. We used the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM; Baayen et al.,
2019), a model of the mental lexicon with meaning representations from
distributional semantics, which models error-driven incremental learning with
the Widrow-Hoff rule. We used data from the British Lexicon Project (BLP;
Keuleers et al., 2012) and simulated the lexical decision experiment with the
DLM on a trial-by-trial basis for each subject individually. Then, reaction
times were predicted with Generalised Additive Models (GAMs), using measures
derived from the DLM simulations as predictors. We extracted measures from two
simulations per subject (one with learning updates between trials and one
without), and used them as input to two GAMs. Learning-based models showed
better model fit than the non-learning ones for the majority of subjects. Our
measures also provide insights into lexical processing and individual
differences. This demonstrates the potential of the DLM to model behavioural
data and leads to the conclusion that trial-to-trial learning can indeed be
detected in unprimed lexical decision. Our results support the possibility that
our lexical knowledge is subject to continuous changes.

conduction model require an adaptation, i.e. the dependence of thermophysical
parameters of the model on the temperature is to be identified for each
specific material to be heated. This problem is most often solved by
approximation of the tabular data on the measurements of the required
parameters, which can be found in the literature, by means of regression
equations. But, for example, considering the steel heating process, this
approach is difficult to be implemented due to the lack of tabular discrete
measurements for many grades of steel, such as alloyed ones. In this paper, the
new approach is proposed, which is based on a solution of a related variational
problem. Its main idea is to substitute the adaptation process in the classical
sense (i.e., to find the dependencies of thermophysical parameters on
temperature) with 'supervised learning' of a mesh model on the basis of the
technological data received from the plant. The equations to adjust the
parameters of the transient heat conduction model, which are related to the
thermophysical coefficients, have been derived. A numerical experiment is
conducted for steel of a particular group of grades, for which enough both
technological as well as tabular data are available. As a result, the 'trained'
mesh model, which has not received explicitly any information about the
physical and chemical properties of the heated substance, demonstrated an
average error of 18.820 C, which is quite close to the average error of the
model adapted classically on the basis of the tabular data (18.10 C).

  Functional Coverage Closure",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) has been used to accelerate the closure of functional
coverage in simulation-based verification. A supervised ML algorithm, as a
prevalent option in the previous work, is used to bias the test generation or
filter the generated tests. However, for missing coverage events, these
algorithms lack the positive examples to learn from in the training phase.
Therefore, the tests generated or filtered by the algorithms cannot effectively
fill the coverage holes. This is more severe when verifying large-scale design
because the coverage space is larger and the functionalities are more complex.
This paper presents a configurable framework of test selection based on neural
networks (NN), which can achieve a similar coverage gain as random simulation
with far less simulation effort under three configurations of the framework.
Moreover, the performance of the framework is not limited by the number of
coverage events being hit. A commercial signal processing unit is used in the
experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared to the
random simulation, the framework can reduce up to 53.74% of simulation time to
reach 99% coverage level.

breakthroughs in recent years with the rising popularity of deep neural
network-based methods. However, standard fully-supervised approaches for
training such models require vast amounts of annotated data, imposing a
prohibitively high cost; especially in the clinical domain. Self-Supervised
Learning (SSL) methods, which have begun to gain traction in the general
computer vision community, represent a potential solution to these annotation
costs, allowing to learn useful representations from only unlabeled data.
Still, the effectiveness of SSL methods in more complex and impactful domains,
such as medicine and surgery, remains limited and unexplored. In this work, we
address this critical need by investigating four state-of-the-art SSL methods
(MoCo v2, SimCLR, DINO, SwAV) in the context of surgical computer vision. We
present an extensive analysis of the performance of these methods on the
Cholec80 dataset for two fundamental and popular tasks in surgical context
understanding, phase recognition and tool presence detection. We examine their
parameterization, then their behavior with respect to training data quantities
in semi-supervised settings. Correct transfer of these methods to surgery, as
described and conducted in this work, leads to substantial performance gains
over generic uses of SSL - up to 7.4% on phase recognition and 20% on tool
presence detection - as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised phase
recognition approaches by up to 14%. Further results obtained on a highly

disjoint cycles as possible from a certain family of cycles in a given planar

edge-disjoint, and the graph can be undirected or directed. The family of
cycles under consideration must satisfy two properties: it must be uncrossable
and allow for an oracle access that finds a weight-minimal cycle in that family
for given nonnegative edge weights or (in planar graphs) the union of all
remaining cycles in that family after deleting a given subset of edges.
  Our setting generalizes many problems that were studied separately in the
past. For example, three families that satisfy the above properties are (i) all
cycles in a directed or undirected graph, (ii) all odd cycles in an undirected
graph, and (iii) all cycles in an undirected graph that contain precisely one
demand edge, where the demand edges form a subset of the edge set. The latter
family (iii) corresponds to the classical disjoint paths problem in fully
planar and bounded-genus instances. While constant-factor approximation
algorithms were known for edge-disjoint paths in such instances, we improve the
constant in the planar case and obtain the first such algorithms for
vertex-disjoint paths. We also obtain approximate min-max theorems of the
Erd\H{o}s--P\'osa type. For example, the minimum feedback vertex set in a
planar digraph is at most 12 times the maximum number of vertex-disjoint
cycles.

approximate and separate the input circuit into multiple configuration blocks

restore full accuracy. By activating different blocks, the approximate circuit
is able to operate at different accuracy-power configurations. To improve the
scalability of our algorithm, we also provide a design space exploration scheme

of the driven electrolyte, and the chemotactic forces mediated by
fast-diffusing signals in the case of self-chemotactic systems. The results
presented here hint to the rich phenomenology of nonequilibrium effects that

auroral radio emission by the process of electron cyclotron maser emission
(ECME). Such stars have been given the name of Main-sequence Radio Pulse
emitters (MRPs). The phenomenon characterizing MRPs is very similar to that
exhibited by planets like the Jupiter. However, one important aspect in which
the MRPs differ from aurorae exhibited by planets is the upper cut-off
frequency of the ECME spectrum. While Jupiter's upper cut-off frequency was
found to correspond to its maximum surface magnetic field strength, the same
for MRPs are always found to be much smaller than the frequencies corresponding
to their maximum surface magnetic field strength. In this paper, we report the
wideband observations (0.4--4.0 GHz) of the MRPs HD 35298 that enabled us to
locate the upper cut-off frequency of its ECME spectrum. This makes HD 35298
the sixth MRP with a known constraint on the upper cut-off frequency. With
these information, for the first time we investigate into what could lead to
the premature cut-off. We review the existing scenarios attempting to explain
this effect, and arrive at the conclusion that none of them can satisfactorily
explain all the observations. We speculate that more than one physical
processes might be in play to produce the observed characteristics of ECME
cut-off for hot magnetic stars. Further observations, both for discovering more
hot magnetic stars producing ECME, and to precisely locate the upper cut-off,
will be critical to solve this problem.

  Quality",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Embedding knowledge graphs into low-dimensional spaces is a popular method
for applying approaches, such as link prediction or node classification, to
these databases. This embedding process is very costly in terms of both
computational time and space. Part of the reason for this is the optimisation
of hyperparameters, which involves repeatedly sampling, by random, guided, or
brute-force selection, from a large hyperparameter space and testing the
resulting embeddings for their quality. However, not all hyperparameters in
this search space will be equally important. In fact, with prior knowledge of
the relative importance of the hyperparameters, some could be eliminated from
the search altogether without significantly impacting the overall quality of
the outputted embeddings. To this end, we ran a Sobol sensitivity analysis to
evaluate the effects of tuning different hyperparameters on the variance of
embedding quality. This was achieved by performing thousands of embedding
trials, each time measuring the quality of embeddings produced by different
hyperparameter configurations. We regressed the embedding quality on those
hyperparameter configurations, using this model to generate Sobol sensitivity
indices for each of the hyperparameters. By evaluating the correlation between
Sobol indices, we find substantial variability in the hyperparameter
sensitivities between knowledge graphs, with differing dataset characteristics
being the probable cause of these inconsistencies. As an additional
contribution of this work we identify several relations in the UMLS knowledge
graph that may cause data leakage via inverse relations, and derive and present
UMLS-43, a leakage-robust variant of that graph.

the gap between real and synthesis videos. We validate our method on a large

the semantic mask to help deep models build intuitive and effective
reflections. This proxy translates and emphasizes the segmentation flaws. By
maximizing the structural similarity between the raw input and the proxy, the
reflection-on-action loop is closed with segmentation robustness improved.
RefSeg runs in the testing phase and is general for segmentation models.
Extensive validation on three medical image segmentation tasks with a public

RefSeg remarkably improves model robustness and reports state-of-the-art

neuromuscular Electromyography (EMG) signals. A single-right-hand driving mode
is particularly studied. For this driving mode, three different driving
postures are also evaluated. Then, a multi-task time-series transformer network
(MTS-Trans) is developed to predict the steering torques and driving postures.
To evaluate the multi-task learning performance, four different frameworks are
assessed. Twenty-one participants are involved in the driving simulator-based
experiment. The proposed model achieved accurate prediction results on the
future steering torque prediction and driving postures recognition for
single-hand driving modes. The proposed system can contribute to the
development of advanced driver steering assistant systems and ensure mutual
understanding between human drivers and intelligent vehicles.

probability to every subset of a collection of $n$ items. While conventionally
a DPP is parameterized by a symmetric kernel matrix, removing this symmetry
constraint, resulting in nonsymmetric DPPs (NDPPs), leads to significant
improvements in modeling power and predictive performance. Recent work has
studied an approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for
NDPPs restricted to size-$k$ subsets (called $k$-NDPPs). However, the runtime
of this approach is quadratic in $n$, making it infeasible for large-scale
settings. In this work, we develop a scalable MCMC sampling algorithm for
$k$-NDPPs with low-rank kernels, thus enabling runtime that is sublinear in
$n$. Our method is based on a state-of-the-art NDPP rejection sampling
algorithm, which we enhance with a novel approach for efficiently constructing
the proposal distribution. Furthermore, we extend our scalable $k$-NDPP
sampling algorithm to NDPPs without size constraints. Our resulting sampling
method has polynomial time complexity in the rank of the kernel, while the
existing approach has runtime that is exponential in the rank. With both a
theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets, we verify that our
scalable approximate sampling algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than
existing sampling approaches for $k$-NDPPs and NDPPs.

industries. However, robot motions are mostly planned and preprogrammed with a
notable lack of adaptivity to task changes. Even for slightly changed tasks,
the whole system must be reprogrammed by robotics experts. Therefore, it is
highly desirable to have a flexible motion planning method, with which robots
can adapt to specific task changes in unstructured environments, such as
production systems or warehouses, with little or no intervention from
non-expert personnel. In this paper, we propose a user-guided motion planning
algorithm in combination with the reinforcement learning (RL) method to enable
robots automatically generate their motion plans for new tasks by learning from
a few kinesthetic human demonstrations. To achieve adaptive motion plans for a
specific application environment, e.g., desk assembly or warehouse
loading/unloading, a library is built by abstracting features of common human
demonstrated tasks. The definition of semantical similarity between features in
the library and features of a new task is proposed and further used to
construct the reward function in RL. The RL policy can automatically generate
motion plans for a new task if it determines that new task constraints can be
satisfied with the current library and request additional human demonstrations.
Multiple experiments conducted on common tasks and scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed user-guided RL-assisted motion planning method is effective.

allocation of a scarce resource among competing agents over an infinite time.
Examples include deciding which ride hailing trip requests to serve during peak
demand, granting the right of way in intersections or lane mergers, or
admitting internet content to a regulated fast channel. We study a simplified
yet insightful formulation of these problems where at every instant two agents
from a large population get randomly matched to compete over the resource. The
intuitive interpretation of a karma mechanism is ""If I give in now, I will be
rewarded in the future."" Agents compete in an auction-like setting where they
bid units of karma, which circulates directly among them and is self-contained
in the system. We demonstrate that this allows a society of self-interested
agents to achieve high levels of efficiency without resorting to a (possibly
problematic) monetary pricing of the resource. We model karma mechanisms as
dynamic population games and guarantee the existence of a stationary Nash
equilibrium. We then analyze the performance at the stationary Nash equilibrium
numerically. For the case of homogeneous agents, we compare different mechanism
design choices, showing that it is possible to achieve an efficient and ex-post
fair allocation when the agents are future aware. Finally, we test the
robustness against agent heterogeneity and propose remedies to some of the
observed phenomena via karma redistribution.

four clusters hosting double radio relics, namely 8C 0212+703, Abell 3365, PLCK
G287.0+32.9, previously missing polarization studies, and ZwCl 2341+0000, for
which conflicting results have been reported. We used 1-2 GHz Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array observations. We also provide an updated compilation of known
double radio relics with important observed quantities. We studied their
polarization and Faraday rotation properties at 1.4 GHz and we searched for
correlations between fractional polarization and physical resolution, distance
from the cluster center, and shock Mach number. The weak correlations found
between these quantities are well reproduced by state-of-the-art
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of radio relics, confirming that merger
shock waves propagate in a turbulent medium with tangled magnetic fields. Both
external and internal Faraday depolarization should play a fundamental role in
determining the polarization properties of radio relics at 1.4 GHz. Although
the number of double radio relics with RM information is still low, their
Faraday rotation properties (i.e., rest-frame RM and RM dispersion below 40 rad
m$^{-2}$ and non-Gaussian RM distribution) can be explained in the scenario in
which shock waves with Mach numbers larger than 2.5 propagate along the plane
of the sky and compress the turbulent intra-cluster medium.

which a set of binary variables is subjected to a linear system of equations.
The cost function is a simple linear cost, measuring the Hamming distance with

problem exhibits a rich phenomenology. We show that different situations arise
depending on the random ensemble of linear systems. When each variable is
involved in at most two linear constraints, we show that the problem can be
partially solved analytically, in particular we show that upon convergence, the
zero-temperature limit of the cavity equations returns the optimal solution. We
then study the geometrical properties of more general random ensembles. In
particular we observe a range in the density of constraints at which the
systems enters a glassy phase where the cost function has many minima.
Interestingly, the algorithmic performances are only sensitive to another phase
transition affecting the structure of configurations allowed by the linear
constraints. We also extend our results to variables belonging to
$\text{GF}(q)$, the Galois Field of order $q$. We show that increasing the
value of $q$ allows to achieve a better optimum, which is confirmed by the

high-resolution spectra acquired with CAOS spectropolarimeter during seven
years, we were able to measure the radial velocities of their components and

the spectral types and atmospheric parameters of the components of these
spectroscopic binaries and found that two of these systems are composed of main
sequence stars, while the other four contain at least one evolved (giant or
subgiant) component, similar to other well-known RS CVn systems. The
subtraction of a photospheric template built up with spectra of non-active
stars of the same spectral type as those of the components of each system has
allowed us to investigate the chromospheric emission that fills in the
H$\alpha$ cores. We found that the colder component is normally the one with
the largest H$\alpha$ emission. None of the systems show a detectable
LiI$\lambda$6708 line, with the exception of TYC 4279-1821-1, which exhibits
high photospheric abundances in both components. Photometric time series from
the literature allowed us to assess that the five systems with a nearly
circular orbit have also photometric periods close or equal to the orbital
ones, indicating spin-orbit synchronization. For the system with a highly
eccentric orbit, a possible pseudo-synchronization with the periastron velocity

  Depth Forecasting","Accepted in ML4AD Workshop, NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a novel self-supervised method to anticipate the
depth estimate for a future, unobserved real-world urban scene. This work is
the first to explore self-supervised learning for estimation of monocular depth
of future unobserved frames of a video. Existing works rely on a large number
of annotated samples to generate the probabilistic prediction of depth for
unseen frames. However, this makes it unrealistic due to its requirement for
large amount of annotated depth samples of video. In addition, the
probabilistic nature of the case, where one past can have multiple future
outcomes often leads to incorrect depth estimates. Unlike previous methods, we
model the depth estimation of the unobserved frame as a view-synthesis problem,
which treats the depth estimate of the unseen video frame as an auxiliary task
while synthesizing back the views using learned pose. This approach is not only
cost effective - we do not use any ground truth depth for training (hence
practical) but also deterministic (a sequence of past frames map to an
immediate future). To address this task we first develop a novel depth
forecasting network DeFNet which estimates depth of unobserved future by
forecasting latent features. Second, we develop a channel-attention based pose
estimation network that estimates the pose of the unobserved frame. Using this
learned pose, estimated depth map is reconstructed back into the image domain,
thus forming a self-supervised solution. Our proposed approach shows
significant improvements in Abs Rel metric compared to state-of-the-art
alternatives on both short and mid-term forecasting setting, benchmarked on

exchange among practitioners, academia has contributed a significant body of

on the topic yielded novel techniques, often backed by industry evaluations.
However, practitioners hardly leverage these resources. In this paper, we

systematically eliminates the delocalization error in the density functional

much less computational cost. The QP energies from LOSC instead of commonly
used $G_{0}W_{0}$ and ev$GW$ are directly used in BSE. We show that the
BSE/LOSC approach greatly outperforms the commonly used BSE/$G_{0}W_{0}$
approach for predicting excitations with different characters. For the
calculations for Truhlar-Gagliardi test set containing valence, charge transfer
(CT) and Rydberg excitations, BSE/LOSC with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation
provides a comparable accuracy to time-dependent density functional theory

a promising and efficient approach to calculate excitation energies for

the topological structure of a dataset before clustering it can considerably
enhance cluster detection: theoretical arguments and empirical evidence show
that clustering embedding vectors, representing the structure of a data
manifold instead of the observed feature vectors themselves, is highly
beneficial. To demonstrate, we combine manifold learning method UMAP for
inferring the topological structure with density-based clustering method
DBSCAN. Synthetic and real data results show that this both simplifies and
improves clustering in a diverse set of low- and high-dimensional problems
including clusters of varying density and/or entangled shapes. Our approach
simplifies clustering because topological pre-processing consistently reduces
parameter sensitivity of DBSCAN. Clustering the resulting embeddings with
DBSCAN can then even outperform complex methods such as SPECTACL and
ClusterGAN. Finally, our investigation suggests that the crucial issue in
clustering does not appear to be the nominal dimension of the data or how many
irrelevant features it contains, but rather how \textit{separable} the clusters
are in the ambient observation space they are embedded in, which is usually the
(high-dimensional) Euclidean space defined by the features of the data. Our
approach is successful because we perform the cluster analysis after projecting
the data into a more suitable space that is optimized for separability, in some
sense.

flow and mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing can readily measure the
expression of a large number of protein or gene features across the millions of
cells in a multi-patient cohort. While bioinformatics approaches can be used to
link immune cell heterogeneity to external variables of interest, such as,
clinical outcome or experimental label, they often struggle to accommodate such
a large number of profiled cells. To ease this computational burden, a limited
number of cells are typically \emph{sketched} or subsampled from each patient.
However, existing sketching approaches fail to adequately subsample rare cells
from rare cell-populations, or fail to preserve the true frequencies of
particular immune cell-types. Here, we propose a novel sketching approach based
on Kernel Herding that selects a limited subsample of all cells while
preserving the underlying frequencies of immune cell-types. We tested our
approach on three flow and mass cytometry datasets and on one single-cell RNA
sequencing dataset and demonstrate that the sketched cells (1) more accurately
represent the overall cellular landscape and (2) facilitate increased
performance in downstream analysis tasks, such as classifying patients
according to their clinical outcome. An implementation of sketching with Kernel
Herding is publicly available at

finding new and innovative ways to solve real-world problems. One solution
comes by way of an intersection between healthcare, sports statistics, and data
sciences. Within the realm of Major League Baseball (MLB), pitchers are
regarded as the most important roster position. They often are among the
highest paid players and are crucial to a franchise's success, but they are
more at risk to suffer an injury that sidelines them for over a complete
season. The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a small ligament in the elbow
that controls the strength and stability of a pitcher's throwing arm. Due to
repetitive strain, it is not uncommon for pitchers to tear it partially or
completely during their careers. Repairing this injury requires UCL
reconstruction surgery, as known informally as Tommy John surgery. In this
podium abstract, we want to investigate whether we can use machine learning
techniques to predict UCL injury by analyzing online pitcher data.

Despite the benefits of learning vertex representations (i.e., embeddings) for
dynamic graphs, existing works merely view a dynamic graph as a sequence of
changes within the vertex connections, neglecting the crucial asynchronous
nature of such dynamics where the evolution of each local structure starts at
different times and lasts for various durations. To maintain asynchronous
structural evolutions within the graph, we innovatively formulate dynamic
graphs as temporal edge sequences associated with joining time of vertices
(ToV) and timespan of edges (ToE). Then, a time-aware Transformer is proposed
to embed vertices' dynamic connections and ToEs into the learned vertex
representations. Meanwhile, we treat each edge sequence as a whole and embed
its ToV of the first vertex to further encode the time-sensitive information.
Extensive evaluations on several datasets show that our approach outperforms
the state-of-the-art in a wide range of graph mining tasks. At the same time,
it is very efficient and scalable for embedding large-scale dynamic graphs.

interpretation challenging. Polarization control during measurement and data
fitting is used to decompose signals of melanin into their underlying molecular

especially when normalized for scale, India aims more than quadrupling wind and
solar by 2030. Simultaneously, coal dominates the electricity grid, providing
roughly three-quarters of electricity today. We present results from the first
of a kind model to handle high uncertainty, which uses parametric analysis
instead of stochastic analysis for grid balancing based on economic despatch
through 2030, covering 30-minute resolution granularity at a national level.
The model assumes a range of growing demand, supply options, prices, and other
uncertain inputs. It calculates the lowest cost portfolio across a spectrum of
parametric uncertainty. We apply simplifications to handle the intersection of
capacity planning with optimized despatch. Our results indicate that very high
RE scenarios are cost-effective, even if a measurable fraction would be surplus
and thus discarded (""curtailed""). We find that high RE without storage as well
as existing slack in coal- and gas-powered capacity are insufficient to meet
rising demand on a real-time basis, especially adding time-of-day balancing.
Storage technologies prove valuable but remain expensive compared to the 2019
portfolio mix, due to issues of duty cycling like seasonal variability, not
merely inherent high capital costs. However, examining alternatives to
batteries for future growth finds all solutions for peaking power are even more
expensive. For balancing at peak times, a smarter grid that applies demand
response may be cost-effective. We also find the need for more sophisticated
modelling with higher stochasticity across annual timeframes (especially year
on year changes in wind output, rainfall, and demand) along with uncertainty on
supply and load profiles (shapes).

nitride heater in a NACA0015 hydrofoil fabricated from copper. A cavitation
experiment was performed in a high-temperature water cavitation tunnel at the
Institute of Fluid Science, Tohoku University. The effect of heating on
cavitating flow was evaluated by changing the mainstream velocity and pressure,
namely the cavitation number, at a fixed heater power of 860 W. Results showed
that the heat transfer from the hydrofoil affected cavitating flow in terms of
the cavity length, cavity aspect, and periodicity. The effect on the cavity
length became stronger at a lower velocity owing to a higher hydrofoil
temperature. The variation in periodicity implied that the heating effect
reduced the unsteadiness of cavitation. A modified cavitation number was
proposed by considering the heat transfer from the heated wall. A thermal
correction term was derived by considering that the fluid temperature close to
the heated hydrofoil was affected by the turbulent convective heat transfer
between the mainstream and hydrofoil. The corrected cavitation number can be

detection as a method to do so. In the world of increasingly congested radio
frequencies, radars must adapt to avoid interference. Many radar systems employ
the prediction action cycle to proactively determine transmission mode while
spectrum sharing. This method constructs and implements a model of the
environment to predict unused frequencies, and then transmits in this predicted
availability. For these selection strategies, performance is directly reliant
on the quality of the underlying environmental models. In order to keep up with
a changing environment, these models can employ changepoint detection.
Changepoint detection is the identification of sudden changes, or changepoints,
in the distribution from which data is drawn. This information allows the
models to discard ""garbage"" data from a previous distribution, which has no
relation to the current state of the environment. In this work, bayesian online
changepoint detection (BOCD) is applied to the sense and predict algorithm to
increase the accuracy of its models and improve its performance. In the context
of spectrum sharing, these changepoints represent interferers leaving and
entering the spectral environment. The addition of changepoint detection allows
for dynamic and robust spectrum sharing even as interference patterns change
dramatically. BOCD is especially advantageous because it enables online
changepoint detection, allowing models to be updated continuously as data are
collected. This strategy can also be applied to many other predictive
algorithms that create models in a changing environment.

better facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end,
this study proposes a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate
adaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free intersection based on deep reinforcement
learning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework. The first layer uses a
centralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size of
each platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e.,
efficiency, fairness and energy saving). The second layer employs a
decentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple platoons passing through
the intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or
independent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an
efficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon
sizes and passing priorities respectively in the two layers. The model is
validated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).
The simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve
satisfactory convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in
response to varying traffic conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at
the intersection. By comparison with other control methods, the model manifests
its superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination
strategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on
reducing travel time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.

Casimir effect is an experimentally verified effect that is caused due to the
vacuum field fluctuations in quantum field theory. Since the Casimir effect
provides the negative energy density, thus this act as an ideal candidate for
the exotic matter needed for the stability of the wormhole. In this paper, we
study the Casimir effect on the wormhole geometry in modified symmetric

drives the gravitation interaction. We consider three systems of the Casimir
effect such as (i) two parallel plates, (ii) two parallel cylindrical plates,

experimentally feasible. Further, we studied the obtained wormhole solutions
for each case with energy conditions at the wormhole throat with radius $r_0$

  limit",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Formal XAI (explainable AI) is a growing area that focuses on computing
explanations with mathematical guarantees for the decisions made by ML models.
Inside formal XAI, one of the most studied cases is that of explaining the
choices taken by decision trees, as they are traditionally deemed as one of the
most interpretable classes of models. Recent work has focused on studying the
computation of ""sufficient reasons"", a kind of explanation in which given a
decision tree $T$ and an instance $x$, one explains the decision $T(x)$ by
providing a subset $y$ of the features of $x$ such that for any other instance
$z$ compatible with $y$, it holds that $T(z) = T(x)$, intuitively meaning that
the features in $y$ are already enough to fully justify the classification of
$x$ by $T$. It has been argued, however, that sufficient reasons constitute a
restrictive notion of explanation, and thus the community has started to study
their probabilistic counterpart, in which one requires that the probability of
$T(z) = T(x)$ must be at least some value $\delta \in (0, 1]$, where $z$ is a
random instance that is compatible with $y$. Our paper settles the
computational complexity of $\delta$-sufficient-reasons over decision trees,
showing that both (1) finding $\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal in
size, and (2) finding $\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal
inclusion-wise, do not admit polynomial-time algorithms (unless P=NP). This is
in stark contrast with the deterministic case ($\delta = 1$) where
inclusion-wise minimal sufficient-reasons are easy to compute. By doing this,
we answer two open problems originally raised by Izza et al. On the positive
side, we identify structural restrictions of decision trees that make the
problem tractable, and show how SAT solvers might be able to tackle these
problems in practical settings.

life, and computation, as it exhibits a balance between robustness and
adaptability. In classic models of complex systems where structure and dynamics
are considered homogeneous, criticality is restricted to phase transitions,
leading either to robust (ordered) or adaptive (chaotic) phases in most of the
parameter space. Many real-world complex systems, however, are not homogeneous.
Some elements change in time faster than others, with slower elements (usually
the most relevant) providing robustness, and faster ones being adaptive.
Structural patterns of connectivity are also typically heterogeneous,
characterized by few elements with many interactions and most elements with
only a few. Here we take a few traditionally homogeneous dynamical models and
explore their heterogeneous versions, finding evidence that heterogeneity
extends criticality. Thus, parameter fine-tuning is not necessary to reach a
phase transition and obtain the benefits of (homogeneous) criticality. Simply
adding heterogeneity can extend criticality, making the search/evolution of
complex systems faster and more reliable. Our results add theoretical support
for the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneity in physical, social, and
technological systems, as natural selection can exploit heterogeneity to evolve
complexity ""for free"". In artificial systems and biological design,
heterogeneity may also be used to extend the parameter range that allows for
criticality.
