adversarial examples and models stealing through extraction attacks pose
several security and privacy threats. Prior work proposes to use adversarial
training to secure models from adversarial examples that can evade the
classification of a model and deteriorate its performance. However, this
protection technique affects the model's decision boundary and its prediction
probabilities, hence it might raise model privacy risks. In fact, a malicious
user using only a query access to the prediction output of a model can extract
it and obtain a high-accuracy and high-fidelity surrogate model. To have a
greater extraction, these attacks leverage the prediction probabilities of the
victim model. Indeed, all previous work on extraction attacks do not take into
consideration the changes in the training process for security purposes. In
this paper, we propose a framework to assess extraction attacks on
adversarially trained models with vision datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the first to perform such evaluation. Through an
extensive empirical study, we demonstrate that adversarially trained models are
more vulnerable to extraction attacks than models obtained under natural
training circumstances. They can achieve up to $\times1.2$ higher accuracy and
agreement with a fraction lower than $\times0.75$ of the queries. We
additionally find that the adversarial robustness capability is transferable
through extraction attacks, i.e., extracted Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from
robust models show an enhanced accuracy to adversarial examples compared to
extracted DNNs from naturally trained (i.e. standard) models.

  Light-Effects Suppression","Accepted to ECCV2022","published ECCV2022",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Night images suffer not only from low light, but also from uneven
distributions of light. Most existing night visibility enhancement methods
focus mainly on enhancing low-light regions. This inevitably leads to over
enhancement and saturation in bright regions, such as those regions affected by
light effects (glare, floodlight, etc). To address this problem, we need to
suppress the light effects in bright regions while, at the same time, boosting
the intensity of dark regions. With this idea in mind, we introduce an
unsupervised method that integrates a layer decomposition network and a
light-effects suppression network. Given a single night image as input, our
decomposition network learns to decompose shading, reflectance and
light-effects layers, guided by unsupervised layer-specific prior losses. Our
light-effects suppression network further suppresses the light effects and, at
the same time, enhances the illumination in dark regions. This light-effects
suppression network exploits the estimated light-effects layer as the guidance
to focus on the light-effects regions. To recover the background details and
reduce hallucination/artefacts, we propose structure and high-frequency
consistency losses. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real images
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in suppressing night
light effects and boosting the intensity of dark regions.

today. A lot of possible solutions for it have already been proposed in the
last few years, with a lot of them using a lot of new and exotic physics ideas
to deal with the problem. But it was shown recently that the H0 tension might
not require new physics but only a more accurate discussion of measurements and
interestingly it was the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which was pivotal for
that revelation. Accordingly, if one observed the photon mass beyond the
indeterminacy through uncertainty then one could in principle reconcile the
tension. We examine this in a greater detail in this work by taking into
account modifications of the Compton wavelength, which was pivotal in the
initial discussion on the interconnection between uncertainty and the H0
tension. We mainly discuss two types of modifications, one based on generalized
uncertainty principles (GUP) and the other on higher dimensional physics
considerations. We firstly show that both minimal length and maximal momentum
GUP based modifications do not provide photon mass values on the required
scales and hence we cannot address the tension in this sense at all in this
case. We then show that one can get the photon mass to be on the required
scales even after incorporating higher dimensional effects, one cannot
reconcile the Hubble Tension in the same sense as in the (3+1) space-time case.
In this way, we show that certain new physics considerations cannot address the
H0 tension in the same sense as one can using the original Heisenberg
uncertainty principle in a (3+1) space-time.

be approached with delayed feedback. Finally, we show that the detectability

transmitter in multi-user massive MIMO systems operating in frequency division
duplexing (FDD). The wideband MIMO channel is a vector-valued random process
correlated in time, space (antennas), and frequency (subcarriers). The base
station (BS) broadcasts periodically beta_tr pilot symbols from its M antenna
ports to K single-antenna users (UEs). Correspondingly, the K UEs send feedback
messages about their channel state using beta_fb symbols in the uplink (UL).
Using results from remote rate-distortion theory, we show that, as snr reaches
infty, the optimal feedback strategy achieves a channel state estimation mean
squared error (MSE) that behaves as Theta(1) if beta_tr < r and as
Theta(snr^(-alpha)) when beta_tr >=r, where alpha = min(beta_fb/r, 1), where r
is the rank of the channel covariance matrix. The MSE-optimal rate-distortion
strategy implies encoding of long sequences of channel states, which would
yield completely stale CSI and therefore poor multiuser precoding performance.
Hence, we consider three practical one-shot CSI strategies with minimum
one-slot delay and analyze their large-SNR channel estimation MSE behavior.
These are: (1) digital feedback via entropy-coded scalar quantization (ECSQ),
(2) analog feedback (AF), and (3) local channel estimation at the UEs and
digital feedback. These schemes have different requirements in terms of
knowledge of the channel statistics at the UE and at the BS. In particular, the

of the small ELM characteristics achieved by increasing separatrix density via

change from high-n ideal ballooning modes to the intermediate-n
peeling-ballooning modes and eventually to peeling-ballooning stable plasmas in
the pedestal. Nonlinear simulations show that the fluctuation is saturated at a
high level for the lowest separatrix density. The elm size decreases with
increasing the separatrix density, until the fraction of this energy lost
during the ELM crash becomes less than 1% of the pedestal stored energy,
leading to small ELMs. Simulations indicate that small ELMs can be triggered
either by the marginally peeling-ballooning instability near the peak pressure
gradient position inside pedestal or by a local instability in the pedestal
foot with a larger separatrix density gradient. The pedestal collisionality
scan for type-I ELMs with steep pedestal density gradient shows that both
linear growth rate and elm size decrease with collisionality increasing. While
the pedestal collisionality and pedestal density width scan with a weak
pedestal density gradient indicate small ELMs can either be triggered by high-n
ballooning mode or by low-n peeling mode in low collisionality region 0.04~0.1.
The simulations indicate the weaker the linear unstable modes near marginal
stability with small linear growth rate, the lower nonlinearly saturated
fluctuation intensity and the smaller turbulence spreading from the linear
unstable zone to stable zone in the nonlinear saturation phase, leading to
small ELMs.

experimental realization of the first thermoelectric Josephson engine then
followed. Here, we give a more extended discussion and focus on the impact of
the Josephson contribution on thermoelectricity modulating the Cooper pairs
transport in a double-loop SQUID. When the Cooper pairs current prevails on the
quasiparticle one, the Josephson contribution short-circuits the junction
thereby screening the thermoelectric effect. We demonstrate that the
thermoelectric generation due to the pure quasiparticle transport is
phase-independent, once Josephson contribution is appropriately removed from
the net current measured. At the same time, we investigate an additional
metastable state at V\simeq0 determined by the presence of the Josephson

point correspondence on the myocardium region across different frames. In this
paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep statistic shape model to focus on
myocardium segmentation with both shape integrity and boundary correspondence
preserving. Specifically, myocardium shapes are represented by a fixed number
of points, whose variations are extracted by Principal Component Analysis
(PCA). Deep neural network is used to predict the transformation parameters
(both affine and deformation), which are then used to warp the mean point cloud
to the image domain. Furthermore, a differentiable rendering layer is
introduced to incorporate mask supervision into the framework to learn more
accurate point clouds. In this way, the proposed method is able to consistently
produce anatomically reasonable segmentation mask without post processing.
Additionally, the predicted point cloud guarantees boundary correspondence for
sequential images, which contributes to the downstream tasks, such as the
motion estimation of myocardium. We conduct several experiments to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.

approximately optimal performance from the leader's viewpoint and lead to an

the follower population to infinity, we arrive at the interesting result that
in this infinite-population regime the leader cannot design a smooth
""finite-energy"" incentive strategy, namely, a mean-field limit for such games
is not well-defined. As a way around this, we introduce a class of stochastic
Stackelberg games with a leader, a major follower, and a finite or infinite
population of minor followers, where the leader provides an incentive only for
the major follower, who in turn influences the rest of the followers through
her strategy. For this class of problems, we are able to establish the
existence of an incentive strategy with finitely many minor followers. We also
show that if the leader's strategy with finitely many minor followers converges
as their population size grows, then the limit defines an incentive strategy
for the corresponding mean-field Stackelberg game. Examples of quadratic
Gaussian games are provided to illustrate both positive and negative results.
In addition, as a byproduct of our analysis, we establish existence of a

Melbourne in Antarctica, designed to detect impulsive geomagnetic emission from
extensive air showers induced by ultra-high energy (UHE) particles beyond 0.1
EeV, including cosmic rays (CRs), Earth-skimming tau neutrinos, and
particularly, the ""ANITA anomalous events"" (AAEs) from near and below the
horizon, which origin remains uncertain and requires more experimental inputs
for clarification.
  The detection concept of TAROGE-M takes advantage of a high altitude with
synoptic view toward the horizon as an efficient signal collector, and the
radio quietness as well as strong and near vertical geomagnetic field in
Antarctica. This approach has a low energy threshold, high duty cycle, and is
easy to extend for quickly enlarging statistics. Here we report experimental
results from the first TAROGE-M station deployed in 2020, corresponding to
$25.3$-days of livetime. The station consists of six receiving antennas
operating at 180-450 MHz, and can reconstruct source directions with
$\sim0.3^\circ$ angular resolution. To demonstrate its ability to detect UHE
air showers, a search for CR signals in the data was conducted, resulting in
seven identified events. These events have a mean reconstructed energy of
$0.95_{-0.31}^{+0.46}$ EeV and zenith angles between $25^\circ-82^\circ$, with
both distributions agreeing with simulations. The estimated CR flux is also
consistent with results of other experiments. The TAROGE-M sensitivity to AAEs
is approximated by the tau neutrino exposure with simulations, suggesting
comparable sensitivity as ANITA's at $~1$ EeV energy with a few station-years
of operation. These first results verified the station design and performance
in a polar and high-altitude environment, and are promising for further
discovery of tau neutrinos and AAEs after an extension in the near future.

language models trained on a massive amount of plain text. While powerful,
deriving supervision from textual resources is still an open question. For
example, language model pretraining often neglects the rich, freely-available
structures in textual data. In this thesis, we describe three lines of work
that seek to improve the training and evaluation of neural models using
naturally-occurring supervision.
  We first investigate self-supervised training losses to help enhance the
performance of pretrained language models for various NLP tasks. Specifically,
we alter the sentence prediction loss to make it better suited to other
pretraining losses and more challenging to solve. We design an intermediate
finetuning step that uses self-supervised training to promote models' ability
in cross-task generalization.
  Then we describe methods to leverage the structures in Wikipedia and
paraphrases. In particular, we propose training losses to exploit hyperlinks,
article structures, and article category graphs for entity-, discourse-,
entailment-related knowledge. We propose a framework that uses paraphrase pairs
to disentangle semantics and syntax in sentence representations. We extend the
framework for a novel generation task that controls the syntax of output text
with a sentential exemplar.
  Lastly, we discuss our work on tailoring textual resources for establishing
challenging evaluation tasks. We introduce three datasets by defining novel
tasks using various fan-contributed websites, including a long-form
data-to-text generation dataset, a screenplay summarization dataset, and a
long-form story generation dataset. These datasets have unique characteristics
offering challenges to future work in their respective task settings.

reconstruction of a signal $f$ from its spectrogram, i.e., the magnitudes of
its STFT $$V_gf(x,\omega):=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)\overline{g(t-x)}e^{-2\pi
it\omega}dt,$$ and appears as a central problem in several applications,
including coherent diffraction imaging and audio processing. It is known that
for several window functions $g$, any function $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can be
reconstructed from the full spectrogram $|V_g f(\mathbb{R}^2)|$ but in practice
the reconstruction needs to be achieved only from discrete samples of
$|V_gf(\Lambda)|$, typically from a lattice $\Lambda=A\mathbb{Z}^2$. It turns
out that the sampled problem becomes much more subtle: recently established
discretization barriers state that uniqueness via lattice sampling is never
achievable in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, irrespective of the window function $g$ and
the density of the lattice. In the present paper we therefore initiate the
study of multi-window STFT phase retrieval. We discover a novel connection
between multi-window STFT phase retrieval and sampling in Fock space, allowing
us to establish uniqueness results on the recoverability of square-integrable
functions from spectrogram samples located on lattices. Precisely, we specify
conditions on window functions $g_1,\dots,g_4\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ such that
every $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is determined up to a global phase by
$$\left(|V_{g_1}f(A\mathbb{Z}^2)|,\ldots,|V_{g_4}f(A\mathbb{Z}^2)|\right)$$
whenever $A\in\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ satisfies the density condition $|\det
A|^{-1}\geq4$. For real-valued signals $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ it
suffices that $|\det A|^{-1}\geq2$. Corresponding results for irregular
sampling are also shown. Our results thereby overcome the aforementioned
discretization barriers and constitute the first ever general uniqueness result
for sampled STFT phase retrieval.

compressible, which is the main reason for the formation of a singularity for
the gradient of the velocity component parallel to rigid border. Slipping flows
are studied analytically in the framework of two- and three-dimensional
inviscid Prandtl equations. Criteria for a gradient catastrophe are found in
both cases. For 2D Prandtl equations breaking takes place both for the parallel
velocity along the boundary and for the vorticity gradient. For
three-dimensional Prandtl flows, breaking, i.e. the formation of a fold in a
finite time, occurs for the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor, as
well as for the antisymmetric part - vorticity. The problem of the formation of
velocity gradients for flows between two parallel plates is studied numerically
in the framework of two-dimensional Euler equations. It is shown that the
maximum velocity gradient grows exponentially with time on a rigid boundary
with a simultaneous increase in the vorticity gradient according to a double
exponential law. Careful analysis shows that this process is nothing more than
the folding, with a power-law relationship between the maximum velocity
gradient and its width: $% \max|u_x|\propto \ell^{-2/3}$.

The model allows for the independent variation of the marginalized

model, we study the effects of correlated stochastic noise on QAOA. We find
evidence that the performance of QAOA improves as the correlation time or
correlation length of the noise is increased at fixed local error
probabilities. This shows that noise correlations in themselves need not be
detrimental for NISQ algorithms such as QAOA.

depth completion from paired single image and sparse depth data have achieved
impressive performance in recent years. However, facing a new environment where
the test data occurs online and differs from the training data in the RGB image
content and depth sparsity, the trained model might suffer severe performance
drop. To encourage the trained model to work well in such conditions, we expect
it to be capable of adapting to the new environment continuously and
effectively. To achieve this, we propose MetaComp. It utilizes the
meta-learning technique to simulate adaptation policies during the training
phase, and then adapts the model to new environments in a self-supervised
manner in testing. Considering that the input is multi-modal data, it would be
challenging to adapt a model to variations in two modalities simultaneously,
due to significant differences in structure and form of the two modal data.
Therefore, we further propose to disentangle the adaptation procedure in the
basic meta-learning training into two steps, the first one focusing on the
depth sparsity while the second attending to the image content. During testing,
we take the same strategy to adapt the model online to new multi-modal data.
Experimental results and comprehensive ablations show that our MetaComp is
capable of adapting to the depth completion in a new environment effectively
and robust to changes in different modalities.

shown that reaction kinetics can introduce uncertainty in whether a single
donor will incorporate at all in a minimal 3-dimer lithographic window. In this
work, we explore the combined impact of lithographic variation and stochastic
kinetics on P incorporation as the size of such a window is increased. We
augment a kinetic model for PH$_3$ dissociation leading to P incorporation on
Si(100)-2$\times$1 to include barriers for reactions across distinct dimer
rows. Using this model, we demonstrate that even for a window consisting of
2$\times$3 silicon dimers, the probability that at least one donor incorporates
is nearly unity. We also examine the impact of size of the lithographic window,
finding that the incorporation fraction saturates to $\delta$-layer like
coverage as the circumference-to-area ratio approaches zero. We predict that
this incorporation fraction depends strongly on the dosage of the precursor,
and that the standard deviation of the number of incorporations scales as $\sim
\sqrt{n}$, as would be expected for a series of largely independent
incorporation events. Finally, we characterize an array of experimentally
prepared multi-donor lithographic windows and use our kinetic model to study
variability due to the observed lithographic roughness, predicting a negligible
impact on incorporation statistics. We find good agreement between our model
and the inferred incorporation in these windows from scanning tunneling
microscope measurements, indicating the robustness of atomic-precision advanced
manufacturing to errors in patterning for multi-donor patches.

with applications in many fields such as climate research, molecular dynamics,
biophysics, or wind power modeling. In the frequently used standard Langevin
equation, memory effects can be implemented through an additional hidden
component which functions as correlated noise, thus resulting in a
non-Markovian model. It can be seen as part of the model class of partially
observed diffusions which are usually adapted to observed data via Bayesian
estimation, whereby the difficulty of the unknown noise values is solved
through a Gibbs sampler. However, when regarding large data sets with a length
of $10^6$ or $10^7$ data points, sampling the distribution of the same amount
of latent variables is unfeasible. For the model discussed in this work, we
solve this issue through a direct derivation of the posterior distribution of
the Euler-Maruyama approximation of the model via analytical marginalization of
the latent variables. Yet, in the case of a nonlinear noise process, the
inverse problem of model estimation proves to be ill-posed and still
numerically expensive. We handle these complications by restricting the noise
to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which considerably reduces the ambiguity of
the estimation. Further, in this case, the estimation can be performed very
efficiently if the drift and diffusion functions of the observed component are
approximated in a piecewise constant manner. We illustrate the resulting
procedure of efficient Bayesian estimation of the considered non-Markovian
Langevin model by an example from turbulence.

glass temperature. Under such conditions, the standard assumption about the
equivalence of the most standard protocols (i.e.,\it{no big difference between

justified. In fact, we show here that the spin-glass coherence length behaves
differently in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC, magnetic field is turned on) and
thermoremanent-magnetization (TRM, magnetic field is turned off) protocols.
This conclusion is reached through experiments, carried out on two CuMn

dedicated supercomputer. In agreement with the predictions of a simple
dynamical model that assumes that the ultrametric tree of states survives the
switching-on of the magnetic field, we conclude that (all parameters being kept

implications for the extended principle of superposition, which, while holding
at $H = 0$, breaks down for finite magnetic fields. Preliminary simulation
results support this observation.

output as a 'generative multiplane image' (GMPI) and emphasize that its

alpha maps can be dynamically adjusted and can differ between training and

less than half a day at a resolution of $1024^2$. Our findings are consistent

is affected by radiative transfer effects including absorption, emission, and
scattering. Modeling these affects is essential for scientific remote sensing
measurements of the earth and atmosphere. For example, hyperspectral imagery is
a form of digital imagery collected with many, often hundreds, of wavelengths
of light in pixel. The amount of light measured at the sensor is the result of
emitted sunlight, atmospheric radiative transfer, and the reflectance off the
materials on the ground, all of which vary per wavelength resulting from
multiple physical phenomena. Therefore measurements of the ground spectra or
atmospheric constituents requires separating these different contributions per
wavelength. In this paper, we create an autoencoder similar to denoising
autoencoders treating the atmospheric affects as 'noise' and ground reflectance
as truth per spectrum. We generate hundreds of thousands of training samples by
taking random samples of spectra from laboratory measurements and adding
atmospheric affects using physics-based modelling via MODTRAN
(http://modtran.spectral.com/modtran\_home) by varying atmospheric inputs. This
process ideally could create an autoencoder that would separate atmospheric
effects and ground reflectance in hyperspectral imagery, a process called
atmospheric compensation which is difficult and time-consuming requiring a
combination of heuristic approximations, estimates of physical quantities, and
physical modelling. While the accuracy of our method is not as good as other
methods in the field, this an important first step in applying the growing
field of deep learning of physical principles to atmospheric compensation in
hyperspectral imagery and remote sensing.

distributions. Here, we leverage the new capabilities of the James Webb Space
Telescope to measure the 4.4$\mu$m sizes of ${\sim}1000$ galaxies with
$\log{\rm{M}_*/\rm{M}_\odot}\ge9$ and $1.0\le z \le 2.5$ from public CEERS

NIRCam imaging at 4.4$\mu$m ($\lambda_{\mathrm{rest}}\sim1.6\mu $m) with sizes
measured at $1.5\mu$m ($\lambda_{\mathrm{rest}}\sim5500$A). We find that, on
average, galaxy half-light radii are $\sim8$% smaller at 4.4$\mu$m than
1.5$\mu$m in this sample. This size difference is markedly stronger at higher
stellar masses and redder rest-frame $V-J$ colors: galaxies with ${\rm M}_*
\sim 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ have 4.4$\mu$m sizes that are $\sim 25$% smaller
than their 1.5$\mu$m sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy mass profiles are
significantly more compact than their rest-frame optical light profiles at
cosmic noon, and demonstrate that spatial variations in age and attenuation are
important, particularly for massive galaxies. The trend that we find here
impacts our understanding of the size growth and evolution of galaxies, and
suggests that previous studies based on rest-frame optical light may not have
captured the mass-weighted structural evolution of galaxies. This paper
represents a first step towards a new understanding of the morphologies of

Radiance Fields (NeRF), and has pushed the state-of-the-art on novel-view
synthesis considerably. The recent focus has been on models that overfit to a
single scene, and the few attempts to learn models that can synthesize novel
views of unseen scenes mostly consist of combining deep convolutional features
with a NeRF-like model. We propose a different paradigm, where no deep features
and no NeRF-like volume rendering are needed. Our method is capable of
predicting the color of a target ray in a novel scene directly, just from a
collection of patches sampled from the scene. We first leverage epipolar
geometry to extract patches along the epipolar lines of each reference view.
Each patch is linearly projected into a 1D feature vector and a sequence of
transformers process the collection. For positional encoding, we parameterize
rays as in a light field representation, with the crucial difference that the
coordinates are canonicalized with respect to the target ray, which makes our
method independent of the reference frame and improves generalization. We show
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on novel view synthesis of
unseen scenes even when being trained with considerably less data than prior
work.

vision due to its remarkable model capability. However, most prevailing ViT
models suffer from huge number of parameters, restricting their applicability

a new family of tiny and efficient small vision transformers pretrained on
large-scale datasets with our proposed fast distillation framework. The central
idea is to transfer knowledge from large pretrained models to small ones, while
enabling small models to get the dividends of massive pretraining data. More
specifically, we apply distillation during pretraining for knowledge transfer.
The logits of large teacher models are sparsified and stored in disk in advance
to save the memory cost and computation overheads. The tiny student
transformers are automatically scaled down from a large pretrained model with
computation and parameter constraints. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the efficacy of TinyViT. It achieves a top-1 accuracy of 84.8% on ImageNet-1k
with only 21M parameters, being comparable to Swin-B pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 4.2 times fewer parameters. Moreover, increasing image resolutions,
TinyViT can reach 86.5% accuracy, being slightly better than Swin-L while using
only 11% parameters. Last but not the least, we demonstrate a good transfer

instability (FFI) on long-term mass ejection from accretion disks formed after

composition of the disk ejecta, which subsequently undergoes $r$-process
nucleosynthesis upon expansion and cooling. Here we perform 28 time-dependent,
axisymmetric, viscous-hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around
hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) of variable lifetime, using a 3-species
neutrino leakage scheme for emission and an annular-lightbulb scheme for
absorption. We include neutrino flavor transformation due the FFI in a
parametric way, by modifying the absorbed neutrino fluxes and temperatures,
allowing for flavor mixing at various levels of flavor equilibration, and also
in a way that aims to respect the lepton-number preserving symmetry of the
neutrino self-interaction Hamiltonian. We find that for a promptly-formed black
hole (BH), the FFI lowers the average electron fraction of the disk outflow due
to a decrease in neutrino absorption, driven primarily by a drop in electron
neutrino/antineutrino flux upon flavor mixing. For a long-lived HMNS, the disk
emits more heavy lepton neutrinos and reabsorbs more electron neutrinos than
for a BH, with a smaller drop in flux compensated by a higher neutrino
temperature upon flavor mixing. The resulting outflow has a broader electron
fraction distribution, a more proton-rich peak, and undergoes stronger
radiative driving. Disks with intermediate HMNS lifetimes show results that
fall in between these two limits. In most cases, the impact of the FFI on the
outflow is moderate, with changes in mass ejection, average velocity, and
average electron fraction of order $\sim 10\%$, and changes in the

substructured conditions, as expected by the hierarchical model of star cluster
formation, even if the cluster were spatially smooth and centrally

clusters form monolithically. The Moran's $I$ statistic is applied to $N$-body
simulations of star clusters with different primordial spatial-velocity

statistic can be used to reliably quantify spatial-kinematic substructure, and
can be used to provide evidence as to whether the spatial-kinematic structure
of regions with ages $\lesssim$ 6 Myr is best reproduced by the hierarchical or
monolithic models of star formation. Moran's $I$ statistic is also able to
conclusively say whether the data are $not$ consistent with initial conditions
that lack kinematic substructure, such as the monolithic model, in regions with
ages up to, and potentially beyond, 10 Myrs. This can therefore provide a
kinematic signature of the star cluster formation process that is observable

consistent with the prediction of our best-fit model from quasar-Ly$\alpha$

these differences in narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line widths in the multi-order Chandra
HETG spectra to determine the spatial extent and intrinsic velocity width of
the emitting material in each object. We find that there is modest evidence for
spatially extended emission in each object, corresponding to extension of
$r\sim5-100$ pc. These distances are significantly larger than those inferred
from velocity widths assuming gravitational motions, which give $r\sim0.01-1$
pc. This implies that either the gas is emitting at a range of radii, with
smaller radii dominating the velocity width and larger radii dominating the
spatial extent, or that the gas is exhibiting non-gravitational motions, which
we suggest would be outflows due to slight excess redshift in the line and
velocities that exceed the freefall velocity. We also use the spatial extent
information to estimate the mass of the emitting gas by counting fluorescing
iron atoms, finding masses on the order of
$M_\mathrm{gas}\sim10^5-10^8\,M_\odot$. Future work with observatories like

gravitational lenses from interferometric data, specifically those taken with
the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which is observing the northern radio
sky at a frequency of 150 MHz, an angular resolution of 350 mas and a
sensitivity of 90 uJy beam-1 (1 sigma). We develop and test several
Convolutional Neural Networks to determine the probability and uncertainty of a
given sample being classified as a lensed or non-lensed event. By training and
testing on a simulated interferometric imaging data set that includes realistic
lensed and non-lensed radio sources, we find that it is possible to recover
95.3 per cent of the lensed samples (true positive rate), with a contamination
of just 0.008 per cent from non-lensed samples (false positive rate). Taking
the expected lensing probability into account results in a predicted sample
purity for lensed events of 92.2 per cent. We find that the network structure
is most robust when the maximum image separation between the lensed images is
greater than 3 times the synthesized beam size, and the lensed images have a
total flux density that is equivalent to at least a 20 sigma (point-source)
detection. For the ILT, this corresponds to a lens sample with Einstein radii
greater than 0.5 arcsec and a radio source population with 150 MHz flux
densities more than 2 mJy. By applying these criteria and our lens detection
algorithm we expect to discover the vast majority of galaxy-scale gravitational
lens systems contained within the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey.

uses functoriality of cobordism and naturality of the $\eta$-invariant to
relate anomalies in a group of interest to anomalies in other (finite or

examples motivated by flavour physics, including $S_3$, $A_4$, $Q_8$, and
$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_3)$. In the case of finite abelian groups, it is well
known that anomalies can be `truncated' in a way that has no effect on
low-energy physics, by means of a group extension. We extend this idea to
non-abelian symmetries. We show, for example, that a system with $A_4$ symmetry
can be rendered anomaly-free, with only one-third as many fermions as na\""ively

well-known model of quark and lepton masses utilising the

sizes. The model size dramatically affects the deployment cost and latency of
deep models. For instance, models like BERT cannot be deployed on edge devices
and mobiles due to their sheer size. As a result, most advances in Deep
Learning are yet to reach the edge. Model compression has sought much-deserved
attention in literature across natural language processing, vision, and
recommendation domains. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly
model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST)
hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by clubbing them through a lightweight
mapping. Notably, while clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache
hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access
pattern. ROAST is up to $\sim 25 \times$ faster to train and $\sim 50 \times$
faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet.
Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and
theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of
independent interest in itself. With ROAST, we present the first compressed
BERT, which is $100\times - 1000\times$ smaller but does not result in quality
degradation. These compression levels on universal architecture like

We have to choose an order to sequentially open these boxes, and each time we

a box, the box cannot be recalled. Our goal is to accept the $k$ largest of
these numbers, without necessarily opening all boxes. This is the free order
multiple-choice secretary problem. Free order variants were studied extensively
for the secretary and prophet problems. Kesselheim, Kleinberg, and Niazadeh KKN
(STOC'15) initiated a study of randomness-efficient algorithms (with the
cheapest order in terms of used random bits) for the free order secretary
problems.
  We present an algorithm for free order multiple-choice secretary, which is
simultaneously optimal for the competitive ratio and used amount of randomness.
I.e., we construct a distribution on orders with optimal entropy
$\Theta(\log\log n)$ such that a deterministic multiple-threshold algorithm is
$1-O(\sqrt{\log k/k})$-competitive. This improves in three ways the previous
best construction by KKN, whose competitive ratio is $1 - O(1/k^{1/3}) - o(1)$.
Our competitive ratio is (near)optimal for the multiple-choice secretary
problem; it works for exponentially larger parameter $k$; and our algorithm is
a simple deterministic multiple-threshold algorithm, while that in KKN is
randomized. We also prove a corresponding lower bound on the entropy of optimal
solutions for the multiple-choice secretary problem, matching entropy of our
algorithm, where no such previous lower bound was known.
  We obtain our algorithmic results with a host of new techniques, and with
these techniques we also improve significantly the previous results of KKN

within the Curci-Ferrari (CF) model at two-loop order and compare our results
to Landau-gauge lattice simulations of the same vertex function for the SU(2)
and SU(3) gauge groups in four dimensions. The parameters of the model being
adjusted by fitting the two-point functions to lattice data, our evaluation of
the three-gluon vertex arises as a pure prediction. We find that two-loop
corrections systematically improve the agreement between the model and the
lattice data as compared to earlier one-loop calculations, with a better
agreement in the SU(3) case, as already seen in previous studies [1,2]. We also
analyze the renormalization scheme dependence of our calculation. In all cases,
this dependence diminishes when two-loop corrections are included, which is
consistent with the perturbative CF paradigm. In addition, we study the low
momentum regime of the three-gluon vertex in relation with the possibility of
zero-crossing. Within the CF model, we show that the leading infrared behavior
of the exact vertex is given by the same linear logarithm that arises at
one-loop order, multiplied by the all orders cubic ghost dressing function at
zero-momentum (we provide similar exact results for other vertex functions). We
argue that this property remains true within the FP framework under the
assumption that the resummed gluon propagator features a decoupling behavior.
This shows that the zero-crossing is a property of the exact three-gluon vertex
function. Within the CF model, we find however that the scale of the
zero-crossing is considerably reduced when going from one- to two-loop order.
This seems consistent with some recent lattice simulations [3]. Our analysis
also allows us to support recent claims about the dominance of the tree-level
tensor component [4].

increasingly interested in data-driven tools to measure systemic risk and to
identify systemically important firms. Granger Causality (GC) based techniques
to build networks among financial firms using time series of their stock
returns have received significant attention in recent years. Existing GC
network methods model conditional means, and do not distinguish between
connectivity in lower and upper tails of the return distribution - an aspect
crucial for systemic risk analysis. We propose statistical methods that measure
connectivity in the financial sector using system-wide tail-based analysis and
is able to distinguish between connectivity in lower and upper tails of the
return distribution. This is achieved using bivariate and multivariate GC
analysis based on regular and Lasso penalized quantile regressions, an approach
we call quantile Granger causality (QGC). By considering centrality measures of
these financial networks, we can assess the build-up of systemic risk and
identify risk propagation channels. We provide an asymptotic theory of QGC
estimators under a quantile vector autoregressive model, and show its benefit
over regular GC analysis on simulated data. We apply our method to the monthly
stock returns of large U.S. firms and demonstrate that lower tail based
networks can detect systemically risky periods in historical data with higher
accuracy than mean-based networks. In a similar analysis of large Indian banks,
we find that upper and lower tail networks convey different information and
have the potential to distinguish between periods of high connectivity that are
governed by positive vs negative news in the market.

substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.

beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a
modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the
framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems
with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally
serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically
construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of
symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension.
This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric
quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as
well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while
dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and
analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of
the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional
topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a
holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding.
We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points,
which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and
transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual
systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like
symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite
Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We
predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically
compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions,
which we then verify numerically.

mediators with masses at the TeV scale. By using the latest LHC run-II data in
the monolepton ($e\nu$, $\mu\nu$, $\tau\nu$) and dilepton ($ee$, $\mu\mu$,
$\tau\tau$, $e\mu$, $e\tau$, $\mu\tau$) production channels, we derive
constraints on the SMEFT Wilson coefficients for semileptonic four-fermion and

possible leptoquark models. For the SMEFT, we discuss the range of validity of
the EFT description, the relevance of $\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^2)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^4)$ truncations, the impact of $d=8$ operators and the
effects of different quark-flavor alignments. Finally, as a highlight, we
extract for several New Physics scenarios the combined limits from high-$p_T$
processes, electroweak pole measurements and low-energy flavor data for the
$b\to c\tau\nu$ transition, showing the complementarity between these different
observables. Our results are compiled in {\tt HighPT}, a package in {\tt

individual base-learners due to differences in specifications and prediction
accuracies is avoided. Data including crash, traffic, and roadway inventory
were collected and integrated from 2013 to 2017. The data are split into

alternative methods considered. From a practical standpoint, stacking can
enhance prediction accuracy (compared to using only one base learner with a

first type of two-phase interface problem to be studied is the fluid-fluid
(two-phase flow) interface problem modeled by Navier-Stokes equations with
high-contrast physical parameters across the interface. The second one belongs
to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems modeled by Navier-Stokes
equations on one side of the interface and the structural equation on the other
side of the interface, both the fluid and the structure interact with each
other via the kinematic- and the dynamic interface conditions across the
interface. The DNN/meshfree method is respectively developed for the above
two-phase interface problems by representing solutions of PDEs using the DNNs'
structure and reformulating the dynamic interface problem as a least-squares
minimization problem based upon a space-time sampling point set. Approximation
error analyses are also carried out for each kind of interface problem, which
reveals an intrinsic strategy about how to efficiently build a sampling-point
training dataset to obtain a more accurate DNNs' approximation. In addition,
compared with traditional discretization approaches, the proposed DNN/meshfree
method and its error analysis technique can be smoothly extended to many other
dynamic interface problems with fixed interfaces. Numerical experiments are
conducted to illustrate the accuracies of the proposed DNN/meshfree method for

to upconvert near-infrared (IR) vector, vortex, and vector-vortex driving beams
that are tailored respectively in their Spin Angular Momentum (SAM), Orbital
Angular Momentum (OAM), and simultaneously in their SAM and OAM. We show that
HHG enables the controlled generation of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) vector beams
exhibiting various spatially-dependent polarization distributions, or EUV
vortex beams with a highly twisted phase. Moreover, we demonstrate the
generation of EUV vector-vortex beams (VVB) bearing combined characteristics of

affirm the topological charge scaling of the HHG beams with the harmonic order.
Interestingly, our work shows that HHG allows for a synchronous controlled

scenario of their applications at nanometric spatial and sub-femtosecond

learning MLPerf benchmark on recommendation data is a Deep Learning
Recommendation Model (DLRM) trained on a terabyte of click-through data. It
contains 100GB of embedding memory (25+Billion parameters). DLRMs, due to their
sheer size and the associated volume of data, face difficulty in training,
deploying for inference, and memory bottlenecks due to large embedding tables.
This paper analyzes and extensively evaluates a generic parameter sharing setup
(PSS) for compressing DLRM models. We show theoretical upper bounds on the
learnable memory requirements for achieving $(1 \pm \epsilon)$ approximations
to the embedding table. Our bounds indicate exponentially fewer parameters
suffice for good accuracy. To this end, we demonstrate a PSS DLRM reaching
10000$\times$ compression on criteo-tb without losing quality. Such a
compression, however, comes with a caveat. It requires 4.5 $\times$ more
iterations to reach the same saturation quality. The paper argues that this
tradeoff needs more investigations as it might be significantly favorable.
Leveraging the small size of the compressed model, we show a 4.3$\times$
improvement in training latency leading to similar overall training times.
Thus, in the tradeoff between system advantage of a small DLRM model vs. slower
convergence, we show that scales are tipped towards having a smaller DLRM

times.

Therefore, this work investigates the application of explainable AI (XAI)
algorithms to convolutional neural networks for vibration-based condition
monitoring. For this, various XAI algorithms are applied to classifications
based on the Fourier transform as well as the order analysis of the vibration
signal. The results are visualized as a function of the revolutions per minute
(RPM), in the shape of frequency-RPM maps and order-RPM maps. This allows to
assess the saliency given to features which depend on the rotation speed and
those with constant frequency. To compare the explanatory power of the XAI
methods, investigations are first carried out with a synthetic data set with
known class-specific characteristics. Then a real-world data set for
vibration-based imbalance classification on an electric motor, which runs at a
broad range of rotation speeds, is used. A special focus is put on the
consistency for variable periodicity of the data, which translates to a varying
rotation speed of a real-world machine. This work aims to show the different
strengths and weaknesses of the methods for this use case: GradCAM, LRP and
LIME with a new perturbation strategy.

are well established numerical methods utilizing operator semigroup theory for
the treatment of semilinear evolution equations whose principal linear part
involves a sectorial operator with angle greater than ${\pi}/2$ (meaning
essentially the holomorphy of the underlying semigroup). The present paper
contributes to this subject by relaxing on the sectoriality condition, but in
turn requiring that the semigroup operators act consistently on an
interpolation couple (or on a scale of Banach spaces). Our conditions (on the
semigroup and on the semilinearity) are inspired by the approach of T. Kato to
the local solvability of the Navier-Stokes equation, where the $L^p-L^r$
smoothing of the Stokes semigroup was fundamental. The present abstract
operator theoretic result is applicable for this latter problem (as was already
the result of Ostermann and Hochbruck), or more generally in the setting of
holomorphic semigroups, but also allows the consideration of examples, such as
non-analytic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups or the Navier-Stokes flow around
rotating bodies.

  Planar Jets",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The interplay between viscoelasticity and inertia in dilute polymer solutions
at high deformation rates can result in inertio-elastic instabilities. The
nonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with
significantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian
turbulence, termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). We explore EIT by studying
the dynamics of a submerged planar jet of a dilute aqueous polymer solution
injected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of schlieren
imaging and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). We show how fluid elasticity has a
nonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating
two distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or
stabilize the jet. In agreement with linear stability analyses of viscoelastic
jets, an inertio-elastic shear-layer instability emerges near the edge of the
jet for small levels of elasticity, independent of bulk undulations in the
fluid column. The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow,
resulting in a turbulence transition at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to
the nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition to turbulence
in a Newtonian jet. Increasing the fluid elasticity merges the shear-layer
instability into a bulk instability of the jet column. In this regime, elastic
tensile stresses generated in the shear layer act as an ""elastic membrane"" that
partially stabilizes the flow, retarding the transition to turbulence to higher
levels of inertia and greater distances from the nozzle. In the fully turbulent
state far from the nozzle, planar viscoelastic jets exhibit unique
spatio-temporal features associated with EIT. The time-averaged angle of jet
spreading, an Eulerian measure of the degree of entrainment, and the centerline
velocity of the jets both evolve self-similarly with distance from the nozzle.
The autocovariance of the schlieren images in the fully turbulent region of the
jets shows coherent structures that are elongated in the streamwise direction,
consistent with the suppression of streamwise vortices by elastic stresses.
These coherent structures give a higher spectral energy to small frequency
modes in EIT characterized by LDV measurements of the velocity fluctuations at
the jet centerline. Finally, our LDV measurements reveal a frequency spectrum
characterized by a $-3$ power-law exponent, different from the well-known
$-5/3$ power-law exponent characteristic of Newtonian turbulence.

task, images often contain pixels that are irrelevant to the task. For example,
if the task is looking for cars, pixels in the sky are not very useful.
Therefore, we propose that a CNN be modified to only operate on relevant pixels
to save computation and energy. We propose a method to study three popular
computer vision datasets, finding that 48% of pixels are irrelevant. We also
propose the focused convolution to modify a CNN's convolutional layers to
reject the pixels that are marked irrelevant. On an embedded device, we observe

lower-boundedness of the real part of the eigenvalue spectrum, corresponding to
an upper limit for the spectral dispersion curve, physically expressing the
relaxation rate of a disturbance as a function of the wave vector. We analyze
also Generalized Poisson-Kac processes possessing a continuum of stochastic
states parametrized with respect to the velocity. In this case, there exists a
critical value of the wavevector above which the point spectrum ceases to
exist, and the relaxation dynamics becomes controlled by the essential part of
the spectrum. This model can be extended to the quantum case and, in point of
fact, it represents a simple and highlighting example of a sub-quantum dynamics

low abundance of cold-water reservoirs in protoplanetary discs. On the other
hand, a handful of discs show emission of hot water transitions excited at
temperatures above a few hundred Kelvin. In particular, the protoplanetary
discs around the Herbig Ae stars HD 100546 and HD 163296 show opposite trends
in terms of cold versus hot water emission: in the first case, the ground-state
transitions are detected and the high-J lines are undetected, while the trend
is opposite in HD 163296. We performed a spectral analysis using the
thermo-chemical model DALI. We find that HD 163296 is characterised by a
water-rich (abundance $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$) hot inner disc (within the snowline)
and a water-poor ($< 10^{-10}$) outer disc: the relative abundance may be due
to the thermal desorption of icy grains that have migrated inward. Remarkably,
the size of the H$_2$O emitting region corresponds to a narrow dust gap visible
in the millimeter continuum at $r=10\,$au with ALMA. The low-J lines detected
in HD 100546 instead imply an abundance of a few $10^{-9}$ in the cold outer
disc ($> 40$ au). The emitting region of the cold H$_2$O transitions is
spatially coincident with that of the H$_2$O ice previously seen in the
near-infrared. Notably, millimetre observations with ALMA reveal the presence
of a large dust gap between nearly 40 and 150 au, likely opened by a massive
embedded protoplanet. In both discs, we find that the warm molecular layer in
the outer region (beyond the snow line) is highly depleted of water molecules,
implying an oxygen-poor chemical composition of the gas. We speculate that
gas-phase oxygen in the outer disc is readily depleted and its distribution in
the disc is tightly coupled to the dynamics of the dust grains.

GeV. Measurements were performed via the $\phi\rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}$ decay
channel at midrapidity $|\eta|<0.35$. Features of $\phi$-meson production
measured in Cu$+$Cu, Cu$+$Au, Au$+$Au, and U$+$U collisions were found to not
depend on the collision geometry, which was expected because the yields are
averaged over the azimuthal angle and follow the expected scaling with
nuclear-overlap size. The elliptic flow of the $\phi$ meson in Cu$+$Au,
Au$+$Au, and U$+$U collisions scales with second-order-participant eccentricity
and the length scale of the nuclear-overlap region (estimated with the number
of participating nucleons). At moderate $p_T$, $\phi$-meson production measured
in Cu$+$Au and U$+$U collisions is consistent with coalescence-model
predictions, whereas at high $p_T$ the production is in agreement with
expectations for in-medium energy loss of parent partons prior to their
fragmentation. The elliptic flow for $\phi$ mesons measured in Cu$+$Au and
U$+$U collisions is well described by a (2+1)D viscous-hydrodynamic model with
specific-shear viscosity $\eta/s=1/4\pi$.

loss and clutter interference for sensing. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the
2-dimension (2D) direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation of the sensing target

minimization problem into a trackable modified Fisher information matrix (FIM)
optimization problem. Both independent and coupled phase-shift models of STARS
are investigated: 1) For the independent phase-shift model, to address the
coupling of ISAC waveform and STARS coefficient in the modified FIM, an
efficient double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) framework is conceived; 2) For the coupled phase-shift
model, based on the PDD framework, a low complexity alternating optimization
algorithm is proposed to tackle coupled phase-shift constants by alternatively
optimizing amplitude and phase-shift coefficients in closed-form. Finally, the
numerical results demonstrate that: 1) STARS significantly outperforms the
conventional RIS in CRB under the communication constraints; 2) The coupled
phase-shift model achieves comparable performance to the independent one for
low communication requirements or sufficient STARS elements; 3) It is more
efficient to increase the number of passive elements of STARS rather than the
active elements of the sensor; 4) High sensing accuracy can be achieved by
STARS using the practical 2D maximum likelihood estimator compared with the

discuss the dynamical generation of excited open-charm mesons from the
scattering of pseudoscalar and vector charmed mesons off light mesons. We show
that a double-pole structure is predicted for the D0*(2300) state, as well as
for the D1(2430), while the Ds0*(2317) and the Ds1(2460) may be interpreted as

open heavy-flavor mesons in a hot medium. By means of an extension to finite
temperature of the unitarized effective interactions with the light mesons, we
obtain the in-medium spectral properties of the D, D*, Ds, and Ds* ground-state
mesons. We also analyze the temperature dependence of the masses and the decay
widths of the dynamically generated states. Additionally, we provide results
for the bottomed mesons by exploiting the heavy-quark spin-flavor symmetry of
the Lagrangian. We employ the temperature-dependent spectral functions to
compute charm Euclidean correlators. We also present calculations of off-shell

portion of the stably-stratified planetary boundary layer. The analysis uses
flow realizations from published large-eddy simulations (Sullivan et al., J
Atmos Sci 73(4):1815-1840, 2016) ranging in stability from neutral to nearly
z-less stratification. The coherent turbulent structure is well approximated as
a series of uniform momentum zones (UMZs) and uniform temperature zones (UTZs)
separated by thin layers of intense gradients that are significantly greater
than the mean. This pattern yields stairstep-like instantaneous flow profiles
whose shape is distinct from the mean profiles that emerge from long-term
averaging. However, the scaling of the stairstep organization is closely
related to the resulting mean profiles. The differences in velocity and
temperature across the thin gradient layers remain proportional to the surface
momentum and heat flux conditions regardless of stratification. The vertical
thickness of UMZs and UTZs is proportional to height above the surface for
neutral and weak stratification, but becomes thinner and less dependent on
height as the stability increases. Deviations from the logarithmic mean
profiles for velocity and temperature observed under neutral conditions are
therefore predominately due to the reduction in zone size with increasing
stratification, which is empirically captured by existing Monin-Obukhov
similarity relations for momentum and heat. The zone properties are
additionally used to explain trends in the turbulent Prandtl number, thus
providing a connection between the eddy organization, mean profiles, and
turbulent diffusivity in stably stratified conditions.

  Optimization","ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study a practical space-time video super-resolution (STVSR)
problem which aims at generating a high-framerate high-resolution sharp video
from a low-framerate low-resolution blurry video. Such problem often occurs
when recording a fast dynamic event with a low-framerate and low-resolution
camera, and the captured video would suffer from three typical issues: i)
motion blur occurs due to object/camera motions during exposure time; ii)
motion aliasing is unavoidable when the event temporal frequency exceeds the
Nyquist limit of temporal sampling; iii) high-frequency details are lost
because of the low spatial sampling rate. These issues can be alleviated by a
cascade of three separate sub-tasks, including video deblurring, frame
interpolation, and super-resolution, which, however, would fail to capture the
spatial and temporal correlations among video sequences. To address this, we
propose an interpretable STVSR framework by leveraging both model-based and
learning-based methods. Specifically, we formulate STVSR as a joint video
deblurring, frame interpolation, and super-resolution problem, and solve it as
two sub-problems in an alternate way. For the first sub-problem, we derive an
interpretable analytical solution and use it as a Fourier data transform layer.
Then, we propose a recurrent video enhancement layer for the second sub-problem
to further recover high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics and visual
quality.

number of a single magnetic element having the same valence state, in
principle, a ferrimagnetic state can still arise from the crystallographic
inequivalence of the host ions. However, experimental identification of such a
state as ferrimagnetic is not straightforward because of the tiny magnitude
expected for M and the requirement for a sophisticated technique to
differentiate similar magnetic sites. We report a synchrotron-based resonant
x-ray investigation at the Fe L2,3 edges on an epitaxial film of CaFe2O4, which
exhibits two magnetic phases with similar energies. We find that while one
phase of CaFe2O4 is antiferromagnetic, the other one is ferrimagnetic with an
antiparallel arrangement of an equal number of spins between two distinct
crystallographic sites with very similar local coordination environments. Our
results further indicate two distinct origins of an overall minute M; one is
intrinsic, from distinct Fe3+ sites, and the other one is extrinsic, arising
from defective Fe2+ likely forming weakly-coupled ferrimagnetic clusters. These
two origins are uncorrelated and have very different coercive fields. Hence,
this work provides a direct experimental demonstration of ferrimagnetism solely

This paper presents a versatile framework for conditional image generation
which incorporates the inductive bias of CNNs and powerful sequence modeling of
auto-regression that naturally leads to diverse image generation. Instead of
independently quantizing the features of multiple domains as in prior research,
we design an integrated quantization scheme with a variational regularizer that
mingles the feature discretization in multiple domains, and markedly boosts the
auto-regressive modeling performance. Notably, the variational regularizer
enables to regularize feature distributions in incomparable latent spaces by
penalizing the intra-domain variations of distributions. In addition, we design
a Gumbel sampling strategy that allows to incorporate distribution uncertainty
into the auto-regressive training procedure. The Gumbel sampling substantially
mitigates the exposure bias that often incurs misalignment between the training

reduce carbon emissions from power grids and slow down climate change.
Unfortunately, the most accessible renewable power sources, such as wind and
solar, are highly fluctuating and thus bring a lot of uncertainty to power grid
operations and challenge existing optimization and control policies. The
chance-constrained alternating current (AC) optimal power flow (OPF) framework
finds the minimum cost generation dispatch maintaining the power grid
operations within security limits with a prescribed probability. Unfortunately,
the AC-OPF problem's chance-constrained extension is non-convex,
computationally challenging, and requires knowledge of system parameters and
additional assumptions on the behavior of renewable distribution. Known linear
and convex approximations to the above problems, though tractable, are too
conservative for operational practice and do not consider uncertainty in system
parameters. This paper presents an alternative data-driven approach based on
Gaussian process (GP) regression to close this gap. The GP approach learns a
simple yet non-convex data-driven approximation to the AC power flow equations
that can incorporate uncertainty inputs. The latter is then used to determine
the solution of CC-OPF efficiently, by accounting for both input and parameter

pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) images are used as targets. However, the
diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy procedure is limited by the
operator-dependent skills and experience in sampling the targets, a sequential
decision making process that involves navigating an ultrasound probe and
placing a series of sampling needles for potentially multiple targets. This
work aims to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that optimises the
actions of continuous positioning of 2D ultrasound views and biopsy needles
with respect to a guiding template, such that the MR targets can be sampled
efficiently and sufficiently. We first formulate the task as a Markov decision
process (MDP) and construct an environment that allows the targeting actions to
be performed virtually for individual patients, based on their anatomy and
lesions derived from MR images. A patient-specific policy can thus be
optimised, before each biopsy procedure, by rewarding positive sampling in the
MDP environment. Experiment results from fifty four prostate cancer patients
show that the proposed RL-learned policies obtained a mean hit rate of 93% and
an average cancer core length of 11 mm, which compared favourably to two
alternative baseline strategies designed by humans, without hand-engineered
rewards that directly maximise these clinically relevant metrics. Perhaps more
interestingly, it is found that the RL agents learned strategies that were
adaptive to the lesion size, where spread of the needles was prioritised for
smaller lesions. Such a strategy has not been previously reported or commonly
adopted in clinical practice, but led to an overall superior targeting
performance when compared with intuitively designed strategies.

  Leakage",,,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In an open-bid auction, a bidder can know the budgets of other bidders. Thus,
a sealed-bid auction that hides bidding prices is desirable. However, in
previous sealed-bid auction protocols, it has been difficult to provide a
``fund binding'' property, which would guarantee that a bidder has funds more
than or equal to the bidding price and that the funds are forcibly withdrawn
when the bidder wins. Thus, such protocols are vulnerable to false bidding. As
a solution, many protocols employ a simple deposit method in which each bidder
sends a deposit to a smart contract, which is greater than or equal to the
bidding price, before the bidding phase. However, this deposit reveals the
maximum bidding price, and it is preferable to hide this information.
  In this paper, we propose a sealed-bid auction protocol that provides a fund
binding property. Our protocol not only hides the bidding price and a maximum
bidding price, but also provides fund binding, simultaneously. For hiding the
maximum bidding price, we pay attention to the fact that usual Ethereum
transactions and transactions for sending funds to a one-time address have the
same transaction structure, and it seems that they are indistinguishable. We
discuss how much bidding transactions are hidden. We also employ DECO (Zhang et
al,. CCS 2020) that proves the validity of the data to a verifier in which the
data are taken from a source without showing the data itself. Finally, we give
our implementation which shows transaction fees required and compare it to a
sealed-bid auction protocol employing the simple deposit method.

However, the underlying MZI devices in IPNNs are susceptible to uncertainties
stemming from optical lithographic variations and thermal crosstalk and can
experience imprecisions due to non-uniform MZI insertion loss and quantization
errors due to low-precision encoding in the tuned phase angles. In this paper,
we, for the first time, systematically characterize the impact of such
uncertainties and imprecisions (together referred to as imperfections) in IPNNs
using a bottom-up approach. We show that their impact on IPNN accuracy can vary
widely based on the tuned parameters (e.g., phase angles) of the affected
components, their physical location, and the nature and distribution of the
imperfections. To improve reliability measures, we identify critical IPNN
building blocks that, under imperfections, can lead to catastrophic degradation
in the classification accuracy. We show that under multiple simultaneous
imperfections, the IPNN inferencing accuracy can degrade by up to 46%, even
when the imperfection parameters are restricted within a small range. Our
results also indicate that the inferencing accuracy is sensitive to
imperfections affecting the MZIs in the linear layers next to the input layer

decoding method that identifies the noise effects corrupting code-words of
arbitrary code-books. In a joint detection and decoding framework, this work
demonstrates how GRAND can leverage crude soft information in received symbols
and channel state information to generate, through guesswork, soft bit
reliability outputs in log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). The LLRs are generated via
successive computations of Euclidean-distance metrics corresponding to
candidate noise-recovered words. Noting that the entropy of noise is much
smaller than that of information bits, a small number of noise effect guesses
generally suffices to hit a code-word, which allows generating LLRs for
critical bits; LLR saturation is applied to the remaining bits. In an iterative
(turbo) mode, the generated LLRs at a given soft-input, soft-output GRAND
iteration serve as enhanced a priori information that adapts noise-sequence
guess ordering in a subsequent iteration. Simulations demonstrate that a few
turbo-GRAND iterations match the performance of ML-detection-based soft-GRAND
in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels at a complexity cost that, on
average, grows linearly (instead of exponentially) with the number of symbols.

addition of links and nodes, in many real-world applications. Recent years have
witnessed the increasing attentions paid to dynamic graph neural networks for
modelling such graph data, where almost all the existing approaches assume that
when a new link is built, the embeddings of the neighbor nodes should be
updated by learning the temporal dynamics to propagate new information.
However, such approaches suffer from the limitation that if the node introduced
by a new connection contains noisy information, propagating its knowledge to
other nodes is not reliable and even leads to the collapse of the model. In
this paper, we propose AdaNet: a robust knowledge Adaptation framework via
reinforcement learning for dynamic graph neural Networks. In contrast to
previous approaches immediately updating the embeddings of the neighbor nodes
once adding a new link, AdaNet attempts to adaptively determine which nodes
should be updated because of the new link involved. Considering that the
decision whether to update the embedding of one neighbor node will have great
impact on other neighbor nodes, we thus formulate the selection of node update
as a sequence decision problem, and address this problem via reinforcement
learning. By this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes
for learning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our
knowledge, our approach constitutes the first attempt to explore robust
knowledge adaptation via reinforcement learning for dynamic graph neural
networks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AdaNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we perform the
experiments by adding different degrees of noise into the dataset,
quantitatively and qualitatively illustrating the robustness of AdaNet.

pairs which are new types of charge carriers other than single electrons in
normal metals. The theory established by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) in
1957 can successfully explain the phenomenon of superconductivity in many
single-element and alloy superconductors. Within the BCS scheme, the Cooper
pairs are formed by exchanging the virtual vibrations of lattice (phonons)
between two electrons with opposite momentum near the Fermi surface. The BCS
theory has dominated the field of superconductivity over 64 years. Many
superconductors discovered in past four decades, such as the heavy Fermion
superconductors, cuprates, iron pnictide/chalcogenide and nickelates seem,
however, to strongly violate the BCS picture. The most important issue is that,
perhaps the BCS picture based on electron-phonon coupling are the special case
for superconductivity, there are a lot of other reasons or routes for the
Cooper pairing and superconductivity. In this short overview paper, we will
summarize part of these progresses and try to guide readers to some new
possible schemes of superconductivity after the BCS paradigm. We also propose
several empirical rules for the exploration of high-temperature unconventional
superconductors.

predict the entailment. Since doctor-patient conversations are used in our

extremal trade-off between the girth - the number of hyperedges in the smallest
cycle or even cover (a subhypergraph with all degrees even) and size - the
number of hyperedges in a hypergraph. For graphs (i.e., $2$-uniform
hypergraphs), a bound tight up to the leading constant was proven in a
classical work of Alon, Hoory and Linial [AHL02]. For hypergraphs of uniformity
$k>2$, an appropriate generalization was conjectured by Feige [Fei08]. The
conjecture was settled up to an additional $\log^{4k+1} n$ factor in the size
in a recent work of Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar [GKM21]. Their argument
relies on a connection between the existence of short even covers and the
spectrum of a certain randomly signed Kikuchi matrix. Their analysis,
especially for the case of odd $k$, is significantly complicated.
  In this work, we present a substantially simpler and shorter proof of the
hypergraph Moore bound. Our key idea is the use of a new reweighted Kikuchi
matrix and an edge deletion step that allows us to drop several involved steps
in [GKM21]'s analysis such as combinatorial bucketing of rows of the Kikuchi
matrix and the use of the Schudy-Sviridenko polynomial concentration. Our
simpler proof also obtains tighter parameters: in particular, the argument
gives a new proof of the classical Moore bound of [AHL02] with no loss (the
proof in [GKM21] loses a $\log^3 n$ factor), and loses only a single
logarithmic factor for all $k>2$-uniform hypergraphs.
  As in [GKM21], our ideas naturally extend to yield a simpler proof of the
full trade-off for strongly refuting smoothed instances of constraint
satisfaction problems with similarly improved parameters.

translated into other tasks, or suffer from numerical instabilities. In this

Prediction (CRNP). CRNP is designed to require little adaptation to translate

distributional balance of covariates in observational studies with multi-valued
treatments. Our tests utilize graph structures ranging from Hamiltonian paths
that connect all of the data to nearest neighbor graphs that maximally
separates data into pairs. We consider algorithms that form minimal distance
graphs, such as optimal Hamiltonian paths or non-bipartite matching, or
approximate alternatives, such as greedy Hamiltonian paths or greedy nearest
neighbor graphs. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed
tests are able to detect the misspecification of matching models that other
methods miss. Contrary to intuition, we also find that tests ran on well-formed
approximate graphs do better in most cases than tests run on optimally formed
graphs, and that a properly formed test on an approximate nearest neighbor
graph performs best, on average. In a multi-valued treatment setting with
breast cancer data, these graph-based tests can also detect imbalances
otherwise missed by common matching diagnostics. We provide a new R package
graphTest to implement these methods and reproduce our results.

Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA), where the labeled
source domain contains all classes, but the classes in the unlabeled target
domain increase sequentially. This problem is challenging due to two
difficulties. First, source and target label sets are inconsistent at each time
step, which makes it difficult to conduct accurate domain alignment. Second,
previous target classes are unavailable in the current step, resulting in the
forgetting of previous knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Prototype-guided Continual Adaptation (ProCA) method, consisting of two
solution strategies. 1) Label prototype identification: we identify target
label prototypes by detecting shared classes with cumulative prediction
probabilities of target samples. 2) Prototype-based alignment and replay: based
on the identified label prototypes, we align both domains and enforce the model
to retain previous knowledge. With these two strategies, ProCA is able to adapt
the source model to a class-incremental unlabeled target domain effectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ProCA in
resolving CI-UDA. The source code is available at

which suffers from serious class-imbalance and hence poor performance on tail
classes with only a few samples. Owing to this paucity of samples, learning on
the tail classes is especially challenging for the fine-tuning when
transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task. In this work, we present
a simple modification of standard fine-tuning to cope with these challenges.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning: we first fine-tune the final
layer of the pretrained model with class-balanced reweighting loss, and then we
perform the standard fine-tuning. Our modification has several benefits: (1) it
leverages pretrained representations by only fine-tuning a small portion of the
model parameters while keeping the rest untouched; (2) it allows the model to
learn an initial representation of the specific task; and importantly (3) it
protects the learning of tail classes from being at a disadvantage during the
model updating. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets of both
two-class and multi-class tasks of text classification as well as a real-world
application to ADME (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion)

fine-tuning outperforms both fine-tuning with conventional loss and fine-tuning
with a reweighting loss on the above datasets.

segmentation. Given a few annotated point clouds exemplified a target class,
our goal is to segment all instances of this target class in a query point
cloud. This problem has a wide range of practical applications where point-wise
instance segmentation annotation is prohibitively expensive to collect. To
address this problem, we present Geodesic-Former -- the first geodesic-guided
transformer for 3D point cloud instance segmentation. The key idea is to
leverage the geodesic distance to tackle the density imbalance of LiDAR 3D
point clouds. The LiDAR 3D point clouds are dense near the object surface and
sparse or empty elsewhere making the Euclidean distance less effective to
distinguish different objects. The geodesic distance, on the other hand, is
more suitable since it encodes the scene's geometry which can be used as a
guiding signal for the attention mechanism in a transformer decoder to generate
kernels representing distinct features of instances. These kernels are then
used in a dynamic convolution to obtain the final instance masks. To evaluate
Geodesic-Former on the new task, we propose new splits of the two common 3D
point cloud instance segmentation datasets: ScannetV2 and S3DIS.
Geodesic-Former consistently outperforms strong baselines adapted from

systems with complex dynamics. Most existing data-driven simulators for
particle-based systems adopt graph neural networks (GNNs) as their network
backbones, as particles and their interactions can be naturally represented by
graph nodes and graph edges. However, while particle-based systems usually
contain hundreds even thousands of particles, the explicit modeling of particle
interactions as graph edges inevitably leads to a significant computational
overhead, due to the increased number of particle interactions. Consequently,
in this paper we propose a novel Transformer-based method, dubbed as
Transformer with Implicit Edges (TIE), to capture the rich semantics of
particle interactions in an edge-free manner. The core idea of TIE is to
decentralize the computation involving pair-wise particle interactions into
per-particle updates. This is achieved by adjusting the self-attention module
to resemble the update formula of graph edges in GNN. To improve the
generalization ability of TIE, we further amend TIE with learnable
material-specific abstract particles to disentangle global material-wise
semantics from local particle-wise semantics. We evaluate our model on diverse
domains of varying complexity and materials. Compared with existing GNN-based
methods, without bells and whistles, TIE achieves superior performance and
generalization across all these domains. Codes and models are available at

Morphogenesis of the central nervous system is of a vast topic that includes
important morphogenetic events such as neurulation and cortical folding. Here
we review three types of methods used to improve our understanding of
morphogenesis of the central nervous system: in vivo experiments, organoids (in
vitro), and computational models (in silico). The in vivo experiments are used
to explore cellular- and tissue-level mechanics and interpret them on the roles
of neurulation morphogenesis. Recent advances in human brain organoids have
provided new opportunities to study morphogenesis and neurogenesis to
compensate for the limitations of in vivo experiments, as organoid models are
able to recapitulate some critical neural morphogenetic processes during early
human brain development. Due to the complexity and costs of in vivo and in
vitro studies, a variety of computational models have been developed and used
to explain the formation and morphogenesis of brain structures. We review and
discuss the Pros and Cons of these methods and their usage in the studies on
morphogenesis of the central nervous system. Notably, none of these methods
alone is sufficient to unveil the biophysical mechanisms of morphogenesis, thus
calling for the interdisciplinary approaches using a combination of these
methods in order to test hypotheses and generate new insights on both normal

However, it is still largely unknown if the nature of the representations

lens of adversarial robustness. Our analysis of the problem reveals that CSL
has intrinsically higher sensitivity to perturbations over supervised learning.
We identify the uniform distribution of data representation over a unit
hypersphere in the CSL representation space as the key contributor to this
phenomenon. We establish that this is a result of the presence of false
negative pairs in the training process, which increases model sensitivity to
input perturbations. Our finding is supported by extensive experiments for
image and video classification using adversarial perturbations and other input
corruptions. We devise a strategy to detect and remove false negative pairs
that is simple, yet effective in improving model robustness with CSL training.
We close up to 68% of the robustness gap between CSL and its supervised
counterpart. Finally, we contribute to adversarial learning by incorporating
our method in CSL. We demonstrate an average gain of about 5% over two
different state-of-the-art methods in this domain.

Subsequently, EPC and corresponding $T_c$ are elucidated upon the dynamically

($\lambda$) and $T_c$ are 1.3 and 22.7 K, respectively. This $T_c$ is higher

token boundaries reduces the local context available near the token edges and
decreases inductive bias. To address this problem, we propose a 4D
Convolutional Swin Transformer, where a high-dimensional Swin Transformer is
preceded by a series of small-kernel convolutions that impart local context to
all pixels and introduce convolutional inductive bias. We additionally boost
aggregation performance by applying transformers within a pyramidal structure,
where aggregation at a coarser level guides aggregation at a finer level. Noise
in the transformer output is then filtered in the subsequent decoder with the
help of the query's appearance embedding. With this model, a new
state-of-the-art is set for all the standard benchmarks in few-shot

The two filters can remove corresponding QNMs from original time-domain
ringdowns, while changing early inspiral signals in a trivial way - merely a
time and phase shift. After filtering out dominant QNMs, we can visualize the
existence of various subdominant effects. For example, by applying our filters
to a GW150914-like numerical relativity (NR) waveform, we find second-order
effects in the (l = 4, m = 4), (l = 5, m = 4) and (l = 5, m = 5) harmonics; the

mode in the (l = 2,m = 1) harmonic due to a gravitational recoil. In another NR
simulation where two component spins are anti-aligned with the orbital angular
momentum, we also find retrograde modes. The filters are sensitive to the
remnant properties (i.e., mass and spin) and thus have a potential application
to future data analyses and parameter estimations. We also investigate the
stability of the full filter. Its connection to the instability of QNM spectra

records (EMRs) for secondary purposes to enhance the quality and safety of
healthcare delivery. EMRs tend to contain large amounts of valuable clinical
notes. Learning of embedding is a method for converting notes into a format
that makes them comparable. Transformer-based representation models have
recently made a great leap forward. These models are pre-trained on large
online datasets to understand natural language texts effectively. The quality
of a learning embedding is influenced by how clinical notes are used as input
to representation models. A clinical note has several sections with different
levels of information value. It is also common for healthcare providers to use
different expressions for the same concept. Existing methods use clinical notes
directly or with an initial preprocessing as input to representation models.
However, to learn a good embedding, we identified the most essential clinical
notes section. We then mapped the extracted concepts from selected sections to
the standard names in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We used the
standard phrases corresponding to the unique concepts as input for clinical
models. We performed experiments to measure the usefulness of the learned
embedding vectors in the task of hospital mortality prediction on a subset of
the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)

representation models produced better results with getting input generated by
standard names of extracted unique concepts compared to other input formats.

pressure of 12 GPa is reported. Their structural features have been studied by
Raman spectroscopy. The unusual vibration band containing a number of
pronounced maxima at about 1147, 1245, 1344, and 1456 cm-1 was detected in
Raman spectra. The band is confidently identified with the bending vibrational
modes of CHx groups terminating the nanodiamonds surface. Excessively intense
mode at 1344 cm-1 is explained by its coupling with the 1328 cm-1 diamond
phonons. The Raman band found is proposed to be used for express recognition of
ultrasmall nanodiamonds produced from adamantane and other hydrocarbons with a
high hydrogen content. Moreover, polarized CH bonds on a diamond surface are
sensitive to environmental conditions. This opens up opportunities for using
the diamond produced from adamantane as ultrasmall nanosensors in biology,
chemistry, and medicine

with a power law tail which have received considerable attention during the
last few years. This area of research is in its early stages and while several
aspects have become clear by now, there are a number of issues which have only
been partially understood or not understood at all. We first discuss the
aspects which are reasonably well known and then address in some detail the
issues which are only partially or not understood at all. We present a wide
class of higher (than sixth) order field theory models admitting implicit kink
as well as mirror kink solutions where the two tails facing each other have a
power law or a power-tower type fall off while the other two ends not facing
each other could have either an exponential or a power law tail. The models
admitting implicit kink solutions where the two ends facing each other have an
exponential tail while the other two ends have a power law tail are also
discussed. Moreover, we present several field theory models which admit
explicit kink solutions with a power law fall off. We note that in all the
polynomial models while the potential $V(\phi)$ is continuous, its derivative
is discontinuous. We also discuss one of the most important and only partially
understood issues of the kink-kink and the kink-antikink forces in case the
tails facing each other have a power law fall off. Finally, we briefly discuss
the kink-antikink collisions at finite velocity and present some open
questions.

  Vision (ECCV) 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Procedure learning involves identifying the key-steps and determining their
logical order to perform a task. Existing approaches commonly use third-person
videos for learning the procedure, making the manipulated object small in
appearance and often occluded by the actor, leading to significant errors. In
contrast, we observe that videos obtained from first-person (egocentric)
wearable cameras provide an unobstructed and clear view of the action. However,
procedure learning from egocentric videos is challenging because (a) the camera
view undergoes extreme changes due to the wearer's head motion, and (b) the
presence of unrelated frames due to the unconstrained nature of the videos. Due
to this, current state-of-the-art methods' assumptions that the actions occur
at approximately the same time and are of the same duration, do not hold.
Instead, we propose to use the signal provided by the temporal correspondences
between key-steps across videos. To this end, we present a novel
self-supervised Correspond and Cut (CnC) framework for procedure learning. CnC
identifies and utilizes the temporal correspondences between the key-steps
across multiple videos to learn the procedure. Our experiments show that CnC
outperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark ProceL and CrossTask datasets
by 5.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Furthermore, for procedure learning using
egocentric videos, we propose the EgoProceL dataset consisting of 62 hours of
videos captured by 130 subjects performing 16 tasks. The source code and the
dataset are available on the project page https://sid2697.github.io/egoprocel/.

generalizability of research that uses only geolocated data.We consider three
aspects: affect -- sentiment and emotions, content -- textual and non-textual,

with a random dataset of the same size, we show that geotagged posts on Twitter
exhibit significantly more positivity, are often about joyous and special
events such as weddings or graduations, convey more collectivism rather than
individualism, and contain more additional features such as hashtags or objects
in images, but at the same time generate substantially less engagement. These
findings suggest there exist significant differences in the messages conveyed
in geotagged posts. Our research carries important implications for future
research utilizing geolocation social media data.

the Correlation Clustering problem asks to partition $V$ into clusters to
minimize the number of $+$edges between different clusters plus the number of
$-$edges within the same cluster. Correlation Clustering has been used to model
a large number of clustering problems in practice, making it one of the most
widely studied clustering formulations. The approximability of Correlation
Clustering has been actively investigated [BBC04, CGW05, ACN08], culminating in
a $2.06$-approximation algorithm [CMSY15], based on rounding the standard LP
relaxation. Since the integrality gap for this formulation is 2, it has
remained a major open question to determine if the approximation factor of 2
can be reached, or even breached.
  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by showing that there
exists a $(1.994 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm based on
$O(1/\epsilon^2$) rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. In order to round a
solution to the Sherali-Adams relaxation, we adapt the {\em correlated
rounding} originally developed for CSPs [BRS11, GS11, RT12]. With this tool, we
reach an approximation ratio of $2+\epsilon$ for Correlation Clustering. To
breach this ratio, we go beyond the traditional triangle-based analysis by
employing a global charging scheme that amortizes the total cost of the
rounding across different triangles.

GeV$^2$, and cover the $x$ range from $10^{-4}$ to $1$. The single spin
asymmetries were extracted as a function of $x$ and $Q^2$, as well as the
semi-inclusive variables $z$, and $P_T$. They are obtained in azimuthal moments
in combinations of the azimuthal angles of the hadron transverse momentum and
transverse spin of the nucleon relative to the lepton scattering plane. The
initially unpolarized MonteCarlo was re-weighted in the true kinematic
variables, hadron types and parton flavors based on global fits of fixed target
SIDIS experiments and $e^+e^-$ annihilation data. The expected statistical
precision of such measurements is extrapolated to 10 fb$^{-1}$ and potential
systematic uncertainties are approximated given the deviations between true and
reconstructed yields. The impact on the knowledge of the Sivers functions,
transversity and tensor charges, and the Collins function has then been
evaluated in the same phenomenological extractions as in the Yellow Report. The
impact is found to be comparable to that obtained with the parameterized Yellow
Report detector and shows that the ECCE detector configuration can fulfill the
physics goals on these quantities.

segmentation that generalizes a model trained with source images and
corresponding ground-truth labels to a target domain. A key to domain adaptive
semantic segmentation is to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features
without target ground-truth labels. To this end, we propose a bi-directional
pixel-prototype contrastive learning framework that minimizes intra-class
variations of features for the same object class, while maximizing inter-class
variations for different ones, regardless of domains. Specifically, our
framework aligns pixel-level features and a prototype of the same object class
in target and source images (i.e., positive pairs), respectively, sets them
apart for different classes (i.e., negative pairs), and performs the alignment
and separation processes toward the other direction with pixel-level features
in the source image and a prototype in the target image. The cross-domain
matching encourages domain-invariant feature representations, while the
bidirectional pixel-prototype correspondences aggregate features for the same
object class, providing discriminative features. To establish training pairs
for contrastive learning, we propose to generate dynamic pseudo labels of
target images using a non-parametric label transfer, that is, pixel-prototype
correspondences across different domains. We also present a calibration method
compensating class-wise domain biases of prototypes gradually during training.

Leveraging a Twitter dataset of over 2 billion tweets collected continuously
over two years, we find that the public declaration of gender pronouns is on
the rise, with most people declaring as using she series pronouns, followed by
he series pronouns, and a smaller but considerable amount of non-binary
pronouns. From analyzing Twitter posts and sharing activities, we can discern
users who use gender pronouns from those who do not and also distinguish users
of various gender identities. We further illustrate the relationship between
explicit forms of social network exposure to gender pronouns and their eventual
gender pronoun adoption. This work carries crucial implications for

fairness and inclusion, as well as support against online harassment and

projected to multiple parallel planes at different heights, by using

the inference efficiency without extra time cost. Specifically, AIC and NAIC
models are first trained combined with shared visual encoders, forcing the
visual encoder to contain sufficient and valid future context; then the AIC
model is encouraged to capture the causal dynamics of cross-layer interchanging
from NAIC model on its unconfident words, which follows a teacher-student
paradigm and optimized with the distribution calibration training objective.
Empirical evidences demonstrate that our proposed approach clearly surpass the
state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations on
the MS COCO benchmark. The source code is available at:

  DNNs",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) has gained significant attraction for
datacenter networks due to its compatibility with conventional Ethernet-based
fabric. However, the RDMA protocol is efficient only on (nearly) lossless
networks, emphasizing the vital role of congestion control on RoCE networks.
Unfortunately, the native RoCE congestion control scheme, based on Priority
Flow Control (PFC), suffers from many drawbacks such as unfairness,
head-of-line-blocking, and deadlock. Therefore, in recent years many schemes
have been proposed to provide additional congestion control for RoCE networks
to minimize PFC drawbacks. However, these schemes are proposed for general
datacenter environments. In contrast to the general datacenters that are built
using commodity hardware and run general-purpose workloads, high-performance
distributed training platforms deploy high-end accelerators and network
components and exclusively run training workloads using collectives
(All-Reduce, All-To-All) communication libraries for communication.
Furthermore, these platforms usually have a private network, separating their
communication traffic from the rest of the datacenter traffic. Scalable
topology-aware collective algorithms are inherently designed to avoid incast
patterns and balance traffic optimally. These distinct features necessitate
revisiting previously proposed congestion control schemes for general-purpose
datacenter environments. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze some of the SOTA
RoCE congestion control schemes vs. PFC when running on distributed training
platforms. Our results indicate that previously proposed RoCE congestion
control schemes have little impact on the end-to-end performance of training
workloads, motivating the necessity of designing an optimized, yet
low-overhead, congestion control scheme based on the characteristics of
distributed training platforms and workloads.

  Adversarial Robustness","Accepted by ECCV 2022 oral presentation",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Adversarial training (AT) for robust representation learning and
self-supervised learning (SSL) for unsupervised representation learning are two
active research fields. Integrating AT into SSL, multiple prior works have
accomplished a highly significant yet challenging task: learning robust
representation without labels. A widely used framework is adversarial
contrastive learning which couples AT and SSL, and thus constitute a very
complex optimization problem. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer philosophy, we
conjecture that it might be simplified as well as improved by solving two
sub-problems: non-robust SSL and pseudo-supervised AT. This motivation shifts
the focus of the task from seeking an optimal integrating strategy for a
coupled problem to finding sub-solutions for sub-problems. With this said, this
work discards prior practices of directly introducing AT to SSL frameworks and
proposed a two-stage framework termed Decoupled Adversarial Contrastive
Learning (DeACL). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DeACL
achieves SOTA self-supervised adversarial robustness while significantly
reducing the training time, which validates its effectiveness and efficiency.
Moreover, our DeACL constitutes a more explainable solution, and its success
also bridges the gap with semi-supervised AT for exploiting unlabeled samples
for robust representation learning. The code is publicly accessible at

evolution, while at the same time allowing for the coexistence of discrete and
continuous variables. The spectral approach to geometry is then explained to
encompass two natural ingredients: the line element and the algebra. The
relation between these two is dictated by so-called higher Heisenberg
relations, from which both spin geometry and non-abelian gauge theory emerges.
Our exposition indicates some of the applications in physics, including
Pati--Salam unification beyond the Standard Model, the criticality of dimension

  replication and infection",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Budding allows virus replication and macromolecular secretion in cells. It
involves the formation of a bud, i.e. an outgrowth from the cell membrane that
evolves into an envelope. The largest energetic barrier to bud formation is
membrane deflection and is trespassed primarily thanks to nucleocapsid-membrane
adhesion. Transmembrane proteins (TPs), which later form the virus ligands, are
the main promotors of adhesion and can accommodate membrane bending thanks to
an induced spontaneous curvature. Adhesive TPs must diffuse across the membrane
from remote regions to gather on the bud surface, thus, diffusivity controls
the kinetics. This paper proposes a simple model to describe diffusion-mediated
budding unraveling important size limitations and size-dependent kinetics. The
predicted optimal virion radius, giving the fastest budding, is validated
against experiments for Coronavirus, HIV, Flu, and Hepatitis. Assuming
exponential replication of virions and hereditary size, the model can predict
the size distribution of a virus population. This is verified against
experiments for SARS-CoV-2. All the above comparisons rely on the premise that
budding poses the tightest size constraint. This is true in most cases, as
demonstrated in this paper, where the proposed model is extended to describe
virus infection via receptor- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and via
membrane fusion.

vertex, it can enter in any edge incident to the vertex. The cost is continuous
in each closed edge but not necessarily globally in the network. We shall
follow the Lagrangian approach studying relaxed equilibria which describe the
game in terms of a probability measure on admissible trajectories. The first
main result of this paper establishes the existence of a relaxed equilibrium.
The proof requires the existence of optimal trajectories and a closed graph
property for the map which associates to each point of the network the set of
optimal trajectories starting from that point.
  Each relaxed equilibrium gives rise to a cost for the agents and consequently

Different from them, we propose a Dynamic Ball Query (DBQ) network to

assign the feature transform with a suitable receptive field for each selected

in an end-to-end manner, which significantly reduces the computational cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can increase the inference
speed by 30%-100% on KITTI, Waymo, and ONCE datasets. Specifically, the
inference speed of our detector can reach 162 FPS on KITTI scene, and 30 FPS on
Waymo and ONCE scenes without performance degradation. Due to skipping the

placement of Forcemyography (FMG) sensors for FMG armbands in the application
of arm movement recognition. Firstly, based on graph theory, the armband is
modeled considering sensors' signals and connectivity. Then, a Graph-based

Afterward, the sensor placement optimization for FMG armbands is formulated and
an optimization algorithm with greedy local search is proposed. To study the
effectiveness of our optimization algorithm, a dataset for mechanical

experiments show that using only 4 sensors optimized with our algorithm can
help maintain a comparable recognition accuracy to using all sensors. Finally,
the optimized sensor placement result is verified from a physiological view.

proposes a real-time stereo indirect visual SLAM system, PLD-SLAM, which

spherical particles. Extending these standard simulation methodologies to the
non-spherical cases is non-trivial. To circumvent this problem, non-spherical
bodies are considered as a collection of constituent spherical objects. As the
number of these constituent objects becomes large, the computational burden to
simulate the system also increases. In this article, we propose an alternative
way to simulate non-circular rigid bodies in two dimensions having pairwise
repulsive interactions. Our approach is based on a machine learning (ML) based
model which predicts the overlap between two non-circular bodies. The machine
learning model is easy to train and the computation cost of its implementation
remains independent of the number of constituents disks used to represent a
non-circular rigid body. When used in MC simulation, our approach provides
significant speed up in comparison to the standard implementation where overlap
determination between two rigid bodies is done by calculating the distance of
their constituent disks. Our proposed ML based MC method provided very similar
structural features (in comparison to standard implementation) of the systems.
We believe this work is a very first step towards a time-efficient simulation
of non-spherical rigid bodies.

with the purpose of enhancing further the de-excitation description.
Experimental transition intensities from EGAF database are now included in the
FIFRELIN cascades, in order to improve the description of the higher energy
part of the spectrum. Furthermore, the angular correlations between {\gamma}
rays are now implemented in FIFRELIN, to account for the relative anisotropies
between them. In addition, conversion electrons are now treated more precisely
in the whole spectrum range, while the subsequent emission of X rays is also
accounted for. The impact of the aforementioned improvements in FIFRELIN is
tested by simulating neutron captures in various positions inside the STEREO
detector. A repository of up-to-date FIFRELIN simulations of the Gd isotopes is
made available for the community, with the possibility of expanding for other
isotopes which can be suitable for different applications.

provide the means for efficient particle acceleration. Indeed, they are
increasingly considered as being responsible for a significant fraction of
cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated within the Milky Way. Westerlund 1, the most
massive known young stellar cluster in our Galaxy is a prime candidate for
studying this hypothesis. While the very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray source HESS
J1646-458 has been detected in the vicinity of Westerlund 1 in the past, its
association could not be firmly identified. We aim to identify the physical
processes responsible for the $\gamma$-ray emission around Westerlund 1 and
thus to better understand the role of massive stellar clusters in the
acceleration of Galactic CRs. Using 164 hours of data recorded with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), we carried out a deep
spectromorphological study of the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458. We
furthermore employed H I and CO observations of the region to infer the
presence of gas that could serve as target material for interactions of
accelerated CRs. We detected large-scale ($\sim 2^\circ$ diameter) $\gamma$-ray
emission with a complex morphology, exhibiting a shell-like structure and
showing no significant variation with $\gamma$-ray energy. The combined energy
spectrum of the emission extends to several tens of TeV, and is uniform across
the entire source region. We did not find a clear correlation of the
$\gamma$-ray emission with gas clouds as identified through H I and CO
observations. We conclude that, of the known objects within the region, only
Westerlund 1 can explain the bulk of the $\gamma$-ray emission. Several CR
acceleration sites and mechanisms are conceivable, and discussed in detail.

and a suitable change of measure under which (a) the spines form a uniform
sample without replacement, as required, but additionally (b) there is $k$-size
biasing and discounting according to the population size. Our work
significantly extends the spine techniques developed in Harris, Johnston, and

vaccination campaign requires government policies and community engagement,
sharing experiences for social support, and voicing concerns to vaccine safety
and efficiency. The increasing use of online social platforms allows us to
trace large-scale communication and infer public opinion in real-time. We
collected more than 100 million vaccine-related tweets posted by 8 million
users and used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to perform automated topic
modeling of tweet texts during the vaccination campaign in Japan. We identified
15 topics grouped into 4 themes on Personal issue, Breaking news, Politics, and
Conspiracy and humour. The evolution of the popularity of themes revealed a
shift in public opinion, initially sharing the attention over personal issues
(individual aspect), collecting information from the news (knowledge
acquisition), and government criticisms, towards personal experiences once
confidence in the vaccination campaign was established. An interrupted time
series regression analysis showed that the Tokyo Olympic Games affected public
opinion more than other critical events but not the course of the vaccination.
Public opinion on politics was significantly affected by various events,
positively shifting the attention in the early stages of the vaccination
campaign and negatively later. Tweets about personal issues were mostly
retweeted when the vaccination reached the younger population. The associations
between the vaccination campaign stages and tweet themes suggest that the
public engagement in the social platform contributed to speedup vaccine uptake
by reducing anxiety via social learning and support.

evidence of evolution of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and and the matter fraction
$\Omega_m$. The inclusion of the SH0ES calibration can significantly compress
the parameter space of background dynamics of the universe and reduces the
constrained values of $\Omega_m$ in each bin. Interestingly, a possible local
solution of current $H_0$ tension is provided by the third bin, which gives
$H_0=71.6\pm4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. When not considering the calibration,

relation between the introduced map and the platform's ability to hover at
different orientations is developed. Correspondingly, the conditions for MRAVs
with tiltable propellers to realize and sustain static hovering are detailed. A
numerical metric is then introduced, which reflects the ability of MRAVs to
sustain static hovering at different orientations. A subclass of MRAVs with
tiltable propellers is defined as the Critically Statically Hoverable platforms
(CSH), where CSH platforms are MRAVs that cannot sustain static hovering with
fixed propellers, but can achieve static hovering with tilting propellers.
Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to test and validate the above
findings, and to demonstrate the effect of the proposed numerical metric on the

situation by enhancing a publicly available dataset of UK property owned by
offshore companies. We create a data processing pipeline which draws on several
datasets and machine learning techniques to create a parsed set of addresses
classified into six use classes. The enhanced dataset contains 138,000
properties 44,000 more than the original dataset. The majority are domestic
(95k), with a disproportionate amount of those in London (42k). The average
offshore domestic property in London is worth 1.33 million GBP collectively
this amounts to approximately 56 Billion GBP. We perform an in-depth analysis
of the offshore domestic property in London, comparing the price, distribution
and entropy/concentration with Airbnb property, low-use/empty property and
conventional domestic property. We estimate that the total amount of offshore,
low-use and airbnb property in London is between 144,000 and 164,000 and that
they are collectively worth between 145-174 billion GBP. Furthermore, offshore
domestic property is more expensive and has higher entropy/concentration than
all other property types. In addition, we identify two different types of
offshore property, nested and individual, which have different price and
distribution characteristics. Finally, we release the enhanced offshore
property dataset, the complete low-use London dataset and the pipeline for
creating the enhanced dataset to reduce the barriers to studying this topic.

called fast multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (FastMNMF). In
practice, however, neither the DNN nor the FastMNMF can be updated in a

the number of informative observations available for testing (or another
relevant parameter, such as the size of the target in an image) and $I$ is the
error rate. Such conditions depend on the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the
cumulant-generating function of the Data-Driven Decision Function (D3F, i.e.,
what is thresholded before the final binary decision is made) learned in the
training phase. As such, the D3F and, consequently, the related error rate $I$,
depend on the given training set, which is assumed of finite size.
Interestingly, these conditions can be verified and tested numerically
exploiting the available dataset, or a synthetic dataset, generated according
to the available information on the underlying statistical model. In other
words, the classification error probability convergence to zero and its rate
can be computed on a portion of the dataset available for training. Coherently
with the large deviations theory, we can also establish the convergence, for
$n$ large enough, of the normalized D3F statistic to a Gaussian distribution.
This property is exploited to set a desired asymptotic false alarm probability,
which empirically turns out to be accurate even for quite realistic values of
$n$. Furthermore, approximate error probability curves $\sim \zeta_n

forecasting model. Ironically, it is often ignored or misunderstood by
deep-learning based models, even those baselines which are state-of-the-art.
This behavior makes their inefficient, untenable and unstable. In this paper,
we rigorously analyze three prevalent but deficient/unfounded deep time series
forecasting mechanisms or methods from the view of time series properties,
including normalization methods, multivariate forecasting and input sequence
length. Corresponding corollaries and solutions are given on both empirical and
theoretical basis. We thereby propose a novel time series forecasting network,
i.e. RTNet, on the basis of aforementioned analysis. It is general enough to be
combined with both supervised and self-supervised forecasting format. Thanks to
the core idea of respecting time series properties, no matter in which
forecasting format, RTNet shows obviously superior forecasting performances
compared with dozens of other SOTA time series forecasting baselines in three
real-world benchmark datasets. By and large, it even occupies less time
complexity and memory usage while acquiring better forecasting accuracy. The

to its competitive performance in industrial application domains. As the core
of DL-enabled systems, deep neural networks (DNNs) need to be carefully
evaluated to ensure the produced models match the expected requirements. In
practice, the \emph{de facto standard} to assess the quality of DNNs in the
industry is to check their performance (accuracy) on a collected set of labeled
test data. However, preparing such labeled data is often not easy partly
because of the huge labeling effort, i.e., data labeling is labor-intensive,
especially with the massive new incoming unlabeled data every day. Recent
studies show that test selection for DNN is a promising direction that tackles
this issue by selecting minimal representative data to label and using these
data to assess the model. However, it still requires human effort and cannot be
automatic. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, named \textit{Aries},
that can estimate the performance of DNNs on new unlabeled data using only the
information obtained from the original test data. The key insight behind our
technique is that the model should have similar prediction accuracy on the data
which have similar distances to the decision boundary. We performed a
large-scale evaluation of our technique on two famous datasets, CIFAR-10 and
Tiny-ImageNet, four widely studied DNN models including ResNet101 and
DenseNet121, and 13 types of data transformation methods. Results show that the
estimated accuracy by \textit{Aries} is only 0.03\% -- 2.60\% off the true
accuracy. Besides, \textit{Aries} also outperforms the state-of-the-art
labeling-free methods in 50 out of 52 cases and selection-labeling-based
methods in 96 out of 128 cases.

crucial, as a great number of observables, like FCNC, only appear at the loop
level in the Standard Model and in many new physics scenarios. One possibility
to obtain the low-energy theory is by integrating out the heavy particles from

propagation, and proposes an object query propagation (QueryProp) framework for
high-performance video object detection. The proposed QueryProp contains two
propagation strategies: 1) query propagation is performed from sparse key
frames to dense non-key frames to reduce the redundant computation on non-key
frames; 2) query propagation is performed from previous key frames to the
current key frame to improve feature representation by temporal context
modeling. To further facilitate query propagation, an adaptive propagation gate

characterisation of pseudo $2$-factor isomorphic bipartite cubic graphs and
conjectured that $K_{3,3}$, the Heawood graph and the Pappus graph are the only

$30$ vertices which is pseudo $2$-factor isomorphic cubic and bipartite,
essentially $4$-edge-connected and cyclically $6$-edge-connected, thus refuting
the above conjecture. In this note, we describe how such a graph can be
constructed from the Heawood graph and the generalised Petersen graph
$GP(8,3)$, which are the Levi graphs of the Fano $7_3$ configuration and the
M\""obius-Kantor $8_3$ configuration, respectively. Such a description of
$\mathscr{G}$ allows us to understand its automorphism group, which has order
$144$, using both a geometrical and a graph theoretical approach
simultaneously. Moreover we illustrate the uniqueness of this graph.

3.6\,mm wavelengths in line and continuum emission.
  Results: The scope and outline of The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and

observed subregion in Cygnus X, namely the DR20 star formation site, which
comprises sources in a range of evolutionary stages from cold pristine gas
clumps to more evolved ultracompact H{\sc ii} regions. The data covering cloud
to cores scales at a linear spatial resolution of $<5000$\,au reveal several
kinematic cloud components that are likely part of several large-scale flows
onto the central cores. The temperature structure of the region is investigated
by means of the HCN/HNC intensity ratio and compared to dust-derived
temperatures. We find that the deuterated DCO$^+$ emission is almost
exclusively located toward regions at low temperatures below 20\,K.
Investigating the slopes of spatial power spectra of dense gas tracer intensity
distributions (HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$), we find comparatively
flat slopes between $-2.9$ and $-2.6$, consistent with high Mach numbers and/or

cope with large-scale distributed optimization problems in the arising machine
learning applications. Most exisiting works on DSG focus on ideal communication
between the cooperative agents such that the shared information between agents

significantly reduces the size of data. Compared with perfect data,
quantization poses fundamental challenges on loss of data accuracy, which
further impacts the convergence of the algorithms. To settle the problem, we
propose a generalized distributed subgradient method with random quantization,
which can be intepreted as a two time-scale stochastic approximation method. We
provide comprehensive results on the convergence of the algorithm and derive
upper bounds on the convergence rates in terms of the quantization bit,

especially in elderly people, lead to increased morbidity, decreased quality of
life and increased mortality. Being a silent disease before fracture,
osteoporosis often remains undiagnosed and untreated. Areal bone mineral
density (aBMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the
gold-standard method for osteoporosis diagnosis and hence also for future
fracture prediction (prognostic). However, the required special equipment is
not broadly available everywhere, in particular not to patients in developing
countries. We propose a deep learning classification model (FORM) that can
directly predict hip fracture risk from either plain radiographs (X-ray) or 2D
projection images of computed tomography (CT) data. Our method is fully
automated and therefore well suited for opportunistic screening settings,
identifying high risk patients in a broader population without additional
screening. FORM was trained and evaluated on X-rays and CT projections from the
Osteoporosis in Men (MrOS) study. 3108 X-rays (89 incident hip fractures) or
2150 CTs (80 incident hip fractures) with a 80/20 split were used. We show that
FORM can correctly predict the 10-year hip fracture risk with a validation AUC
of 81.44 +- 3.11% / 81.04 +- 5.54% (mean +- STD) including additional
information like age, BMI, fall history and health background across a 5-fold
cross validation on the X-ray and CT cohort, respectively. Our approach
significantly (p < 0.01) outperforms previous methods like Cox
Proportional-Hazards Model and \frax with 70.19 +- 6.58 and 74.72 +- 7.21

By precisely estimating human poses, the robot can provide an appropriate
response to the human. Most existing approaches use the optical flow, RNNs, or
CNNs to extract temporal features from videos. Despite the positive results of
these attempts, most of them only straightforwardly integrate features along
the temporal dimension, ignoring temporal correlations between joints. In
contrast to previous methods, we propose a plug-and-play kinematics modeling
module (KMM) based on the domain-cross attention mechanism to model the
temporal correlation between joints across different frames explicitly.
Specifically, the proposed KMM models the temporal correlation between any two
joints by calculating their temporal similarity. In this way, KMM can learn the
motion cues of each joint. Using the motion cues (temporal domain) and
historical positions of joints (spatial domain), KMM can infer the initial
positions of joints in the current frame in advance. In addition, we present a
kinematics modeling network (KIMNet) based on the KMM for obtaining the final
positions of joints by combining pose features and initial positions of joints.
By explicitly modeling temporal correlations between joints, KIMNet can infer
the occluded joints at present according to all joints at the previous moment.
Furthermore, the KMM is achieved through an attention mechanism, which allows
it to maintain the high resolution of features. Therefore, it can transfer rich
historical pose information to the current frame, which provides effective pose
information for locating occluded joints. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on two standard video-based pose estimation
benchmarks. Moreover, the proposed KIMNet shows some robustness to the
occlusion, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

aberrations, trailing, and other issues. It holds importance for various tasks:
improved astrometry, deblending of overlapping sources, faint source detection,
and identification of point sources near bright extended objects, such as
galaxies, to name a few. We conduct an empirical study by applying the Scaled
Gradient Projection (SGP) iterative image deconvolution algorithm to restore
distorted stellar shapes in our observed data. We investigate using a more
flexible divergence measure, the $\beta$-divergence, which contains the
commonly-used Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a special case and allows
automatic adaptation of the parameter $\beta$ to the data. An extensive set of
experiments comparing the performance of SGP and its $\beta$-divergence variant
($\beta$-SGP) is carried out on extracted star stamps and on images containing
multiple stars (both crowded and relatively sparser fields). We show a
consistent enhancement in the flux conservation across all considered scenarios
using $\beta$-SGP compared to SGP. Using a few quantifiable metrics such as the
Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) and ellipticity of stars, we observe that
$\beta$-SGP improves restoration quality, compared to the SGP, in many cases
and still preserves restoration quality in others. We conclude that generalized
versions of image restoration algorithms are more robust due to their enhanced
flexibility and could be a promising modification for astronomical image
restoration.

problems, such as those in non-commutative groups, group rings, semigroups,

reduction methods within their specific proposed platforms. A rigorous
examination of the complexity of these algorithmic problems is therefore an
important topic of research. In this paper, we present a cryptanalysis of a
public key exchange system based on a decomposition-type problem in the
so-called twisted group algebras of the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ over a finite
field $\fq$. Our method of analysis relies on an algebraic reduction of the
original problem to a set of equations over $\fq$ involving circulant matrices,
and a subsequent solution to these equations. Our attack runs in polynomial
time and succeeds with probability at least $90$ percent for the parameter
values provided by the authors. We also show that the underlying algorithmic
problem, while based on a non-commutative structure, may be formulated as a
commutative semigroup action problem.

Most existing all-reduce algorithms are designed for traditional electrical
interconnect systems, which cannot meet the communication requirements for
distributed training of large DNNs due to the low data bandwidth of the
electrical interconnect systems. One of the promising alternatives for
electrical interconnect is optical interconnect, which can provide high
bandwidth, low transmission delay, and low power cost. We propose an efficient
scheme called WRHT (Wavelength Reused Hierarchical Tree) for implementing
all-reduce operation in optical interconnect systems. WRHT can take advantage
of WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) to reduce the communication time of
distributed data-parallel DNN training. We further derive the required number
of wavelengths, the minimum number of communication steps, and the
communication time for the all-reduce operation on optical interconnect. The
constraint of insertion loss is also considered in our analysis. Simulation
results show that the communication time of all-reduce by WRHT is reduced by
80.81%, 64.36%, and 82.12%, respectively, compared with three traditional
all-reduce algorithms according to our simulation results of an optical

different scenes instead of a hand-crafting one. To solve the challenges,
firstly, a proxy of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is proposed to quantify a
viewpoint quality; secondly, the proxy is optimized jointly with the parameters
of an implicit neural network for the scene. With the proposed view quality
criterion from neural networks (termed as Neural Uncertainty), we can then
apply implicit representations to autonomous 3D reconstruction. Our method
demonstrates significant improvements on various metrics for the rendered image

previously considered two independent training and optimization processes. The
proposed meta-registration is hypothesized to maximize the efficiency and
effectiveness of the test-time optimization in the ""outer"" meta-optimization of
the networks. For image guidance applications that often are time-critical yet
limited in training data, the potentially gained speed and accuracy are
compared with classical registration algorithms, registration networks without
meta-learning, and single-pair optimization without test-time optimization
data. Experiments are presented in this paper using clinical transrectal
ultrasound image data from 108 prostate cancer patients. These experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of a meta-registration protocol, which yields
significantly improved performance relative to existing learning-based methods.
Furthermore, the meta-registration achieves comparable results to classical
iterative methods in a fraction of the time, owing to its rapid test-time
optimization process.

deterministic omega-automata do not currently have anything similar. One reason
for this is that a normal form for omega-regular languages has to speak about
more than acceptance - for example, to have a normal form for a parity
language, it should relate every infinite word to some natural color for this
language. This raises the question of whether or not a concept such as a
natural color of an infinite word (for a given language) exists, and, if it
does, how it relates back to automata.
  We define the natural color of a word purely based on an omega-regular
language, and show how this natural color can be traced back from any
deterministic parity automaton after two cheap and simple automaton
transformations. The resulting streamlined automaton does not necessarily
accept every word with its natural color, but it has a 'co-run', which is like
a run, but can once move to a language equivalent state, whose color is the
natural color, and no co-run with a higher color exists.
  The streamlined automaton defines, for every color c, a good-for-games

learning on datasets with varying distributions, a phenomenon known as
catastrophic forgetting. More significant distribution shifts among datasets
lead to more forgetting. Recently, parameter-isolation-based approaches have
shown great potential in overcoming forgetting with significant distribution
shifts. However, they suffer from poor generalization as they fix the neural
path for each dataset during training and require dataset labels during
inference. In addition, they do not support backward knowledge transfer as they
prioritize past data over future ones. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive
learning method, named AdaptCL, that fully reuses and grows on learned
parameters to overcome catastrophic forgetting and allows the positive backward
transfer without requiring dataset labels. Our proposed technique adaptively
grows on the same neural path by allowing optimal reuse of frozen parameters.
Besides, it uses parameter-level data-driven pruning to assign equal priority
to the data. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST Variants, DomainNet, and
Food Freshness Detection datasets under different intensities of distribution
shifts without requiring dataset labels. Results demonstrate that our proposed
method is superior to alternative baselines in minimizing forgetting and

prove that if a closed smooth spin manifold admits a distance decreasing

is strictly less than the sphere somewhere or the map is a distance isometry.
Moreover, the property also holds for continuous metrics with scalar curvature
lower bound in some weak sense. This extends a result in the recent work of
Cecchini-Hanke-Schick and answers a question of Gromov. The method is based on
studying the harmonic map heat flow coupled with the Ricci flow from rough

  arXiv:2012.11701",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vulnerability prediction refers to the problem of identifying system
components that are most likely to be vulnerable. Typically, this problem is
tackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. Unfortunately,
recent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the
following two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the
inherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered
much later than they are introduced. This misleads classifiers as they learn to
recognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. To tackle these
issues, we propose TROVON, a technique that learns from known vulnerable
components rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as
typically performed. We perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and
their respective fixed components. This way, TROVON manages to learn from the
things we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and
unbalanced data. We evaluate TROVON by comparing it with existing techniques on
three security-critical open source systems, i.e., Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, and
Wireshark, with historical vulnerabilities that have been reported in the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Our evaluation demonstrates that the
prediction capability of TROVON significantly outperforms existing
vulnerability prediction techniques such as Software Metrics, Imports, Function
Calls, Text Mining, Devign, LSTM, and LSTM-RF with an improvement of 40.84% in
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score under Clean Training Data

to address the update locking problem and minimise the total training cost. The

achieves almost linear speedup without compromising the accuracy performance of

de-identification reduce data utility? We addressed this question by showcasing
the Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA), an established and globally
practised video-based diagnostic tool in early infancy for detecting
neurological deficits, such as cerebral palsy. To date, no shared
expert-annotated large data repositories for infant movement analyses exist.
Such datasets would massively benefit training and recalibration of human

study, sequences from a prospective longitudinal infant cohort with a total of
19451 available general movements video snippets were randomly selected for
human clinical reasoning and computer-based analysis. We demonstrated for the
first time that pseudonymisation by face-blurring video recordings is a viable
approach. The video redaction did not affect classification accuracy for either
human assessors or computer vision methods, suggesting an adequate and
easy-to-apply solution for sharing movement video data. We call for further
explorations into efficient and privacy rule-conforming approaches for
deidentifying video data in scientific and clinical fields beyond movement

development of electronic design automation tools. Nowadays, the simulation of
systems-on-a-chip using virtual platforms is common. Virtual platforms enable
hardware/software co-design to shorten the time to market, offer insights into
the models, and allow debugging of the simulated hardware. Profiling tools are
required to improve the usability of virtual platforms. During simulation,
these tools capture data that are evaluated afterward. Those data can reveal
information about the simulation itself and the software executed on the
platform. This work presents the tracing tool NISTT that can profile
SystemC-TLM-2.0-based virtual platforms. NISTT is implemented in a completely
non-intrusive way. That means no changes in the simulation are needed, the
source code of the simulation is not required, and the traced simulation does
not need to contain debug symbols. The standardized SystemC application
programming interface guarantees the compatibility of NISTT with other
simulations. The strengths of NISTT are demonstrated in a case study. Here,
NISTT is connected to a virtual platform and traces the boot process of Linux.
After the simulation, the database created by NISTT is evaluated, and the
results are visualized. Furthermore, the overhead of NISTT is quantified. It is
shown that NISTT has only a minor influence on the overall simulation
performance.

peculiar one is an elongated feature with an ultra-steep spectrum that is the

report an extreme spectral curvature for the GReET, the spectral index flattens

we detect the radio halo at 54, 144 and at lower significance at 323 MHz. We
categorize it as an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo with a spectral index

studied in the context of general relativity (GR) and modified gravity setups
by assuming a monochromatic PBH mass function. Here we extend the previous
analysis in the context of GR by studying the aforementioned SGWB within more
physically realistic regimes where PBHs have different masses. In particular,
starting from a power-law cosmologically motivated primordial curvature power
spectrum with a running spectral index we extract the extended PBH mass
function and the associated to it PBH gravitational potential which acts as the
source of the scalar induced SGWB. At the end, by taking into account the
dynamical evolution of the PBH gravitational potential during the transition
from the matter era driven by PBHs to the radiation era we extract the
respective GW signal today. Interestingly, in order to trigger an early
PBH-dominated era and avoid the GW constraints at BBN we find that the running
of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ of our primordial curvature power
spectrum should be within the narrow range
$\alpha_\mathrm{s}\in[3.316,3.355]\times 10^{-3}$ while at the same time the GW

it is sufficient to learn the unstable dynamics alone, which are typically

asteroseismic interpretation revealed the presence of radial differential
rotation in this massive star of $\sim$9.35 M . The stellar core is indeed
estimated to spin $\sim$3.6 times faster than the surface. The surface rotation
was consequently derived as $\sim$2 km/s. This massive star represents an ideal
counter-part to the wealth of space-based photometry results for main-sequence
and evolved low-mass stars. Those latter have revealed a new, and often
unexpected, picture of the angular momentum transport processes acting in
stellar interiors. We investigate in a new way the constraints on the internal
rotation of HD 129929, focusing on their interpretation for the evolution of
the internal rotation during the main sequence of a massive star. We test
separately hydrodynamic and magnetic instability transport processes of angular
momentum. We used the best asteroseismic model obtained in an earlier work. We
calibrated stellar models including rotation, with different transport
processes, to reproduce that reference model. We then looked whether one
process is favoured to reproduce the rotation profile of HD 129929, based on
the fit of the asteroseismic multiplets. The impact of the Tayler magnetic
instability on the angular momentum transport predicts a ratio of the
core-to-surface rotation rate of only 1.6, while the recently revised
prescription of this mechanism predicts solid-body rotation. Both are too low
in comparison with the asteroseismic inference. The models with only
hydrodynamic processes are in good agreement with the asteroseismic
measurements. Strikingly, we can also get a constraint on the profile of
rotation on the zero age main sequence: likely, the ratio between the core and
surface rotation was at least $\sim$1.7.

astrophysical dust with CO and CO$_2$ icy mantles are computed. Conclusions:
The developed method can be used for a model-independent reconstruction of
optical constants of various astrophysical ice analogs in a broad THz-IR range.
Such data can provide important benchmarks to interpret the broadband
observations from the existing and future ground-based facilities and space

general elastic polycrystalline material with arbitrary shaped and randomly
oriented grains under uniform loading. The model provides algebraic expressions
for the local grain-boundary-normal stress and the corresponding uncertainties,
as a function of the grain-boundary type, its inclination with respect to the
direction of external loading and material-elasticity parameters. The knowledge
of intergranular normal stresses is a necessary prerequisite in any local
damage modeling approach, e.g., to predict the intergranular stress-corrosion
cracking, grain-boundary sliding or fatigue-crack-initiation sites in

  The model is derived in a perturbative manner, starting with the exact
solution of a simple setup and later successively refining it to account for
higher order complexities of realistic polycrystalline materials. In the
simplest scenario, a bicrystal model is embedded in an isotropic elastic medium
and solved for uniaxial loading conditions, assuming 1D Reuss and Voigt
approximations on different length scales. In the final iteration, the grain
boundary becomes a part of a 3D structure consisting of five 1D chains with
arbitrary number of grains and surrounded by an anisotropic elastic medium.
Constitutive equations can be solved for arbitrary uniform loading, for any
grain-boundary type and choice of elastic polycrystalline material. At each
iteration, the algebraic expressions for the local grain-boundary-normal

their accuracy systematically verified and validated against the finite element

bounds conditioned on the hardness of one or more of key problems: k-SAT, 3SUM

setting conditioned on the hardness of k-SAT and 3SUM. This is done using
fine-grained reductions, where the approach is to (1) select a key problem $X$
that, for some function $T$, is conjectured to not be solvable by any
$O(T(n)^{1-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for any constant $\epsilon > 0$ (in a
fixed model of computation), and (2) reduce $X$ in a fine-grained way to these
computational problems, thus giving (mostly) tight conditional time lower
bounds for them.
  Interestingly, for Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection,
classical hardness results have been derived conditioned on hardness of all
three mentioned key problems. More precisely, it is proven that an
$n^{3-\epsilon}$ time classical algorithm for either of these two graph
problems would imply faster classical algorithms for k-SAT, 3SUM and APSP,

modification of gravity or inertia. These theoretical possibilities of
fundamental importance may be distinguished by the statistical relation between
the observed centripetal acceleration of particles in orbital motion and the
expected Newtonian acceleration from the observed distribution of baryons in
galaxies. Here predictions of cold dark matter halos, modified gravity, and
modified inertia are compared and tested by a statistical sample of galaxy
rotation curves from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves

correctly predicts the observed statistical relation of accelerations from both
the inner and outer parts of rotation curves. Taken at face value there is a
$6.9\sigma$ difference between the inner and outer parts on an acceleration
plane which would be inconsistent with current proposals of modified inertia.
Removing galaxies with possible systematic concerns such as central bulges or
special inclinations does not change this trend. Cold dark matter halos predict
a systematically deviating relation from the observed one. All aspects of

separation, and a combination of both. Turning then to a non-reciprocal system,
we find that non-reciprocity can turn otherwise stationary instabilities into
oscillatory ones, affect the relative orientation of flocks, and, crucially,
change the general type of instability. This illustrates the drastic impact of
non-reciprocity and chirality on the emergent collective dynamics of active
matter systems, with potentially far-reaching biological implications.

manual annotation of pixel-wise flow labels is prohibitively expensive and

discrepancy and hinders the performance for real-world applications. To solve
these problems, we propose RealFlow, an Expectation-Maximization based
framework that can create large-scale optical flow datasets directly from any
unlabeled realistic videos. Specifically, we first estimate optical flow
between a pair of video frames, and then synthesize a new image from this pair
based on the predicted flow. Thus the new image pairs and their corresponding
flows can be regarded as a new training set. Besides, we design a Realistic
Image Pair Rendering (RIPR) module that adopts softmax splatting and
bi-directional hole filling techniques to alleviate the artifacts of the image
synthesis. In the E-step, RIPR renders new images to create a large quantity of
training data. In the M-step, we utilize the generated training data to train
an optical flow network, which can be used to estimate optical flows in the
next E-step. During the iterative learning steps, the capability of the flow
network is gradually improved, so is the accuracy of the flow, as well as the
quality of the synthesized dataset. Experimental results show that RealFlow
outperforms previous dataset generation methods by a considerably large margin.
Moreover, based on the generated dataset, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks compared with both
supervised and unsupervised optical flow methods. Our code and dataset are

wavelength, this observing mode implements the concept of the four quadrant
phase mask for the very first time in a space telescope. We observed single
stars together with a series of reference stars to measure raw contrasts as
they are delivered on the detector, as well as reference subtracted contrasts.
MIRI's coronagraphs achieve raw contrasts greater than $10^3$ at the smallest
angular separations (within $1''$) and about $10^5$ further out (beyond
$5\sim6''$). Subtracting the residual diffracted light left unattenuated by the
coronagraph has the potential to bring the final contrast down to the
background and detector limited noise floor at most angular separations (a few
times $10^4$ at less than $1''$). MIRI coronagraphs behave as expected from
simulations. In particular the raw contrasts for all four coronagraphs are
fully consistent with the diffractive model. Contrasts obtained with
subtracting reference stars also meet expectations and are fully demonstrated
for two four quadrant phase masks (F1065C and F1140C). The worst contrast,
measured at F1550C, is very likely due to a variation of the phase aberrations
at the primary mirror during the observations, and not an issue of the
coronagraph itself. We did not perform reference star subtraction with the Lyot
mask at F2300C, but we anticipate that it would bring the contrast down to the

fix the underlying bug or it introduces a new defect that is not covered by the
test suite. Therefore, the patches generated by APR tools need to be validated
by human programmers, which can be very costly, and prevents APR tools adoption
in practice.Our work aims at increasing developer trust in automated patch
generation by minimizing the number of plausible patches that they have to
review, thereby reducing the time required to find a correct patch. We
introduce a novel light-weight test-based patch clustering approach called
xTestCluster, which clusters patches based on their dynamic behavior.
xTestCluster is applied after the patch generation phase in order to analyze
the generated patches from one or more repair tools. The novelty of
xTestCluster lies in using information from execution of newly generated test
cases to cluster patches generated by multiple APR approaches. A cluster is
formed with patches that fail on the same generated test cases. The output from
xTestCluster gives developers a) a way of reducing the number of patches to
analyze, as they can focus on analyzing a sample of patches from each cluster,
b) additional information attached to each patch. After analyzing 1910
plausible patches from 25 Java APR tools, our results show that xTestCluster is
able to reduce the number of patches to review and analyze with a median of
50%. xTestCluster can save a significant amount of time for developers that
have to review the multitude of patches generated by APR tools, and provides
them with new test cases that show the differences in behavior between

achieved state-of-the-art performance, as they can integrate both the node

However, these GCN-based recommendation models not only suffer from
over-smoothing when stacking too many layers but also bear performance
degeneration resulting from the existence of noise in user-item interactions.
In this paper, we first identify a recommendation dilemma of over-smoothing and
solution collapsing in current GCN-based models. Specifically, these models
usually aggregate all layer embeddings for node updating and achieve their best
recommendation performance within a few layers because of over-smoothing.
Conversely, if we place learnable weights on layer embeddings for node
updating, the weight space will always collapse to a fixed point, at which the
weighting of the ego layer almost holds all. We propose a layer-refined GCN
model, dubbed LayerGCN, that refines layer representations during information
propagation and node updating of GCN. Moreover, previous GCN-based
recommendation models aggregate all incoming information from neighbors without
distinguishing the noise nodes, which deteriorates the recommendation
performance. Our model further prunes the edges of the user-item interaction
graph following a degree-sensitive probability instead of the uniform
distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the

and ultraviolet ranges remain poorly addressed by them. Obtaining better fibers
for the short-wavelength range has been restricted, in all fiber optics, by
scattering processes. In hollow-core fibers, the scattering loss arises from
the core roughness and represents the limiting factor in reducing their loss
regardless of the fiber cladding confinement power. To attain fibers performing
at short wavelengths, it is paramount developing means to minimize the height
variations on the fiber microstructure boundaries. Here, we report on the
reduction of the core surface roughness of hollow-core fibers by modifying
their fabrication technique. In the novel process proposed herein, counter
directional gas fluxes are applied within the fiber holes during fabrication to
attain an increased shear rate on its microstructure. The effect of the process
on the surface roughness has been quantified by optical profilometry and the
results showed that the root-mean-square surface roughness has been reduced

data has made some impressive advancements, thanks to the advent of Deep
Learning. However, it has mostly focused on input coming from a single RGB
image, overlooking the following important factors: a) Nowadays, the vast
majority of facial image data of interest do not originate from single images
but rather from videos, which contain rich dynamic information. b) Furthermore,
these videos typically capture individuals in some form of verbal communication
(public talks, teleconferences, audiovisual human-computer interactions,
interviews, monologues/dialogues in movies, etc). When existing 3D face
reconstruction methods are applied in such videos, the artifacts in the
reconstruction of the shape and motion of the mouth area are often severe,
since they do not match well with the speech audio.
  To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present the first method for
visual speech-aware perceptual reconstruction of 3D mouth expressions. We do
this by proposing a ""lipread"" loss, which guides the fitting process so that
the elicited perception from the 3D reconstructed talking head resembles that
of the original video footage. We demonstrate that, interestingly, the lipread
loss is better suited for 3D reconstruction of mouth movements compared to
traditional landmark losses, and even direct 3D supervision. Furthermore, the
devised method does not rely on any text transcriptions or corresponding audio,
rendering it ideal for training in unlabeled datasets. We verify the efficiency
of our method through exhaustive objective evaluations on three large-scale
datasets, as well as subjective evaluation with two web-based user studies.

The availability of time series of SAR images offers the possibility of
improving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over
the same area. The supervised training of deep neural networks requires
ground-truth speckle-free images. Such images can only be obtained indirectly
through some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are
imperfect. Given the potential of very high quality restoration reachable by
multi-temporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need
to be circumvented. We extend a recent self-supervised training strategy for
single-look complex SAR images, called MERLIN, to the case of multi-temporal
filtering. This requires modeling the sources of statistical dependencies in
the spatial and temporal dimensions as well as between the real and imaginary
components of the complex amplitudes. Quantitative analysis on datasets with

additional SAR images are included. Our method is then applied to stacks of

semantics is based on Kripke contexts, and a formula is interpreted as a
semiconcept of the underlying context. The systems are shown to be sound and

product arrives periodically and unmet demand is backlogged. Each product has
two distinct supply modes that may be different suppliers or different
transport modes from the same supplier. These supply modes differ in terms of
their carbon emissions, speed, and costs. The company needs to decide when to
ship how much using which supply mode such that total holding, backlog, and
procurement costs are minimized while the emissions associated with different
supply modes across the assortment remains below a certain target level. Since
the optimal policy for this inventory system is highly complex, we assume that
shipment decisions for each product are governed by a dual-index policy. This
policy dynamically prescribes shipment quantities with both supply modes based
on the on-hand inventory, the backlog, and the products that are still
in-transit. We formulate this decision problem as a mixed integer linear

  images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Reducing speckle and limiting the variations of the physical parameters in
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is often a key-step to fully exploit the
potential of such data. Nowadays, deep learning approaches produce state of the
art results in single-image SAR restoration. Nevertheless, huge multi-temporal
stacks are now often available and could be efficiently exploited to further
improve image quality. This paper explores two fast strategies employing a
single-image despeckling algorithm, namely SAR2SAR, in a multi-temporal
framework. The first one is based on Quegan filter and replaces the local
reflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress
speckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the
form of a ""super-image"", i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series.
Experimental results on Sentinel-1 GRD data show that these two multi-temporal
strategies provide improved filtering results while adding a limited
computational cost.

describe the unique details of a target image -- has received considerable
attention over the last few years. A recent DIC work proposes to generate
distinctive captions by comparing the target image with a set of
semantic-similar reference images, i.e., reference-based DIC (Ref-DIC). It aims
to make the generated captions can tell apart the target and reference images.
Unfortunately, reference images used by existing Ref-DIC works are easy to
distinguish: these reference images only resemble the target image at
scene-level and have few common objects, such that a Ref-DIC model can
trivially generate distinctive captions even without considering the reference
images. To ensure Ref-DIC models really perceive the unique objects (or
attributes) in target images, we first propose two new Ref-DIC benchmarks.
Specifically, we design a two-stage matching mechanism, which strictly controls
the similarity between the target and reference images at object-/attribute-
level (vs. scene-level). Secondly, to generate distinctive captions, we develop
a strong Transformer-based Ref-DIC baseline, dubbed as TransDIC. It not only
extracts visual features from the target image, but also encodes the
differences between objects in the target and reference images. Finally, for
more trustworthy benchmarking, we propose a new evaluation metric named
DisCIDEr for Ref-DIC, which evaluates both the accuracy and distinctiveness of
the generated captions. Experimental results demonstrate that our TransDIC can
generate distinctive captions. Besides, it outperforms several state-of-the-art
models on the two new benchmarks over different metrics.

time. To ensure optimal control performance, controllers should adapt to these
changes. When the underlying cause and time of change is unknown, we need to
rely on online data for this adaptation. In this paper, we will use
time-varying Bayesian optimization (TVBO) to tune controllers online in
changing environments using appropriate prior knowledge on the control
objective and its changes. Two properties are characteristic of many online
controller tuning problems: First, they exhibit incremental and lasting changes
in the objective due to changes to the system dynamics, e.g., through wear and
tear. Second, the optimization problem is convex in the tuning parameters.
Current TVBO methods do not explicitly account for these properties, resulting
in poor tuning performance and many unstable controllers through
over-exploration of the parameter space. We propose a novel TVBO forgetting
strategy using Uncertainty-Injection (UI), which incorporates the assumption of
incremental and lasting changes. The control objective is modeled as a
spatio-temporal Gaussian process (GP) with UI through a Wiener process in the
temporal domain. Further, we explicitly model the convexity assumptions in the
spatial dimension through GP models with linear inequality constraints. In
numerical experiments, we show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
method in TVBO, exhibiting reduced regret and fewer unstable parameter
configurations.

  Learning For Optimal Execution",,,,,"q-fin.TR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimal execution is a sequential decision-making problem for cost-saving in
algorithmic trading. Studies have found that reinforcement learning (RL) can
help decide the order-splitting sizes. However, a problem remains unsolved: how
to place limit orders at appropriate limit prices? The key challenge lies in
the ""continuous-discrete duality"" of the action space. On the one hand, the
continuous action space using percentage changes in prices is preferred for
generalization. On the other hand, the trader eventually needs to choose limit
prices discretely due to the existence of the tick size, which requires
specialization for every single stock with different characteristics (e.g., the
liquidity and the price range). So we need continuous control for
generalization and discrete control for specialization. To this end, we propose
a hybrid RL method to combine the advantages of both of them. We first use a
continuous control agent to scope an action subset, then deploy a fine-grained
agent to choose a specific limit price. Extensive experiments show that our
method has higher sample efficiency and better training stability than existing
RL algorithms and significantly outperforms previous learning-based methods for
order execution.

answers affirmatively to as many queries as possible; it achieves this goal by
delaying answer modifications as much as possible. We also show that the

dark matter particles are carried out using different technologies either via
direct detection, indirect detection, or collider searches. In this work, the
invisible Higgs sector was investigated, where Higgs bosons are produced via
the vector boson fusion (VBF) process and subsequently decay into invisible
particles. The hypothesis under consideration is that the Higgs boson might
decay into a pair of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are
candidates for dark matter. The observed number of events are found to be in
agreement with the background expectation from Standard Model (SM). Assuming a
125 GeV Higgs boson with SM production cross section, the observed and expected
upper limits on the branching fraction of its decay into invisible particles
are found to be 0.13 at 95\% confidence level. Combination of searches for an
invisibly decaying Higgs boson produced via the main Higgs production modes at
the LHC using 2011-2018 data is conducted and discussed.

perhaps even more than images: e.g. highlighting part of a spectrogram or an
image is often insufficient to convey high-level ideas that are genuinely
relevant to humans. In computer vision, concept learning was therein proposed
to adjust explanations to the right abstraction level (e.g. detect clinical
concepts from radiographs). These methods have yet to be used for MIR.
  In this paper, we adapt concept learning to the realm of music, with its
particularities. For instance, music concepts are typically non-independent and
of mixed nature (e.g. genre, instruments, mood), unlike previous work that
assumed disentangled concepts. We propose a method to learn numerous music
concepts from audio and then automatically hierarchise them to expose their
mutual relationships. We conduct experiments on datasets of playlists from a
music streaming service, serving as a few annotated examples for diverse
concepts. Evaluations show that the mined hierarchies are aligned with both
ground-truth hierarchies of concepts -- when available -- and with proxy
sources of concept similarity in the general case.

primarily on how well the parameters of the networks can be controlled. Our

behaviors of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This includes inferring the
complex interactions between genes, which can be used for a wide range of
genomics analyses, including diagnosis or prognosis of diseases and finding
effective treatments for chronic diseases such as cancer. Boolean networks have
emerged as a successful class of models for capturing the behavior of GRNs. In
most practical settings, inference of GRNs should be achieved through limited
and temporally sparse genomics data. A large number of genes in GRNs leads to a
large possible topology candidate space, which often cannot be exhaustively
searched due to the limitation in computational resources. This paper develops
a scalable and efficient topology inference for GRNs using Bayesian
optimization and kernel-based methods. Rather than an exhaustive search over
possible topologies, the proposed method constructs a Gaussian Process (GP)
with a topology-inspired kernel function to account for correlation in the
likelihood function. Then, using the posterior distribution of the GP model,
the Bayesian optimization efficiently searches for the topology with the
highest likelihood value by optimally balancing between exploration and
exploitation. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through
comprehensive numerical experiments using a well-known mammalian cell-cycle
network.

that are over-represented in gene sets collections and might be associated with
a specific phenotypic trait. However, as this involves a massive number of
hypothesis testing, it is often questionable whether a pre-processing step to
reduce gene sets collections' sizes is helpful. Moreover, the often highly
overlapping gene sets and the consequent low interpretability of gene sets'
collections demand for a reduction of the included gene sets. Inspired by this
bioinformatics context, we propose a method to rank sets within a family of
sets based on the distribution of the singletons and their size. We obtain
sets' importance scores by computing Shapley values without incurring into the
usual exponential number of evaluations of the value function. Moreover, we
address the challenge of including a redundancy awareness in the rankings
obtained where, in our case, sets are redundant if they show prominent
intersections. We finally evaluate our approach for gene sets collections; the
rankings obtained show low redundancy and high coverage of the genes. The
unsupervised nature of the proposed ranking does not allow for an evident
increase in the number of significant gene sets for specific phenotypic traits
when reducing the size of the collections. However, we believe that the
rankings proposed are of use in bioinformatics to increase interpretability of
the gene sets collections and a step forward to include redundancy into Shapley

to this sequence of papers) a generalization of a result of Dvo\v{r}\'ak,
Lidick\'y, and Mohar which states that if a graph drawn in the plane so that
all crossings in $G$ are pairwise of distance at least 15 apart, then $G$ is
5-choosable. In our generalization, we prove an analogous result in which
planar drawings with pairwise far-apart crossings have been replaced by
drawings on arbitrary surfaces with pairwise far-apart matchings with many
crossings, where the graph obtained by deleting these matching edges is a
high-face-width embedding.

introduce secure multi-party computation to spatial data sharing to address the

reducing the cost of computation and storage with low-bitwidth data

full-bitwidth processing unit, such as ALU in CPUs and DSP in FPGAs, can be
better utilized to deliver significantly higher computation throughput for

HiKonv, a unified solution that maximizes the throughput of convolution on a
given underlying processing unit with low-bitwidth quantized data inputs
through novel bit-wise management and parallel computation. We establish
theoretical framework and performance models using a full-bitwidth multiplier
for highly parallelized low-bitwidth convolution, and demonstrate new
breakthroughs for high-performance computing in this critical domain. For
example, a single 32-bit processing unit in CPU can deliver 128 binarized
convolution operations (multiplications and additions) and 13 4-bit convolution
operations with a single multiplication instruction, and a single 27x18
multiplier in the FPGA DSP can deliver 60, 8 or 2 convolution operations with
1, 4 or 8-bit inputs in one clock cycle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
HiKonv on both CPU and FPGA. On CPU, HiKonv outperforms the baseline
implementation with 1 to 8-bit inputs and provides up to 7.6x and 1.4x
performance improvements for 1-D convolution, and performs 2.74x and 3.19x over
the baseline implementation for 4-bit signed and unsigned data inputs for 2-D

convolutions with a shorter processing latency. For binarized input, each DSP
with HiKonv is equivalent up to 76.6 LUTs. Compared to the DAC-SDC 2020

specific constrained configuration. It is relevant to various real-world
applications such as finance and management. To solve the optimal stopping
problem, state-of-the-art algorithms in dynamic programming, such as the
least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC), are employed. This type of algorithm relies
on path simulations using only the last price of the underlying asset as a
state representation. Also, the LSMC was thinking for option valuation where
risk-neutral probabilities can be employed to account for uncertainty. However,
the general optimal stopping problem goals may not fit the requirements of the
LSMC showing auto-correlated prices. We employ a data-driven method that uses
Monte Carlo simulation to train and test artificial neural networks (ANN) to
solve the optimal stopping problem. Using ANN to solve decision problems is not
entirely new. We propose a different architecture that uses convolutional
neural networks (CNN) to deal with the dimensionality problem that arises when
we transform the whole history of prices into a Markovian state. We present
experiments that indicate that our proposed architecture improves results over
the previous implementations under specific simulated time series function
sets. Lastly, we employ our proposed method to compare the optimal exercise of
the financial options problem with the LSMC algorithm. Our experiments show
that our method can capture more accurate exercise opportunities when compared
to the LSMC. We have outstandingly higher (above 974\% improvement) expected
payoff from these exercise policies under the many Monte Carlo simulations that
used the real-world return database on the out-of-sample (test) data.

information source for intelligent systems requiring access to structured
knowledge. One of the major challenges is the extraction and processing of
unambiguous information from textual data. Following the human perception,
overlapping semantic linkages between two named entities become clear due to
our common-sense about the context a relationship lives in which is not the
case when we look at it from an automatically driven process of a machine. In
this work, we are interested in the problem of Relational Resolution within the
scope of KGs, i.e, we are investigating the inherent semantic of relationships
between entities within a network. We propose a new adaptive AutoEncoder,
called V-Coder, to identify relations inherently connecting entities from
different domains. Those relations can be considered as being ambiguous and are
candidates for disentanglement. Likewise to the Adaptive Learning Theory (ART),
our model learns new patterns from the KG by increasing units in a competitive
layer without discarding the previous observed patterns whilst learning the
quality of each relation separately. The evaluation on real-world datasets of
Freebase, Yago and NELL shows that the V-Coder is not only able to recover
links from corrupted input data, but also shows that the semantic disclosure of
relations in a KG show the tendency to improve link prediction. A semantic
evaluation wraps the evaluation up.

GEA guides the evolution by exploring the search space by generating and
evaluating several architectures in each generation at initialisation stage
using a zero-proxy estimator, where only the highest-scoring architecture is
trained and kept for the next generation. Subsequently, GEA continuously
extracts knowledge about the search space without increased complexity by
generating several off-springs from an existing architecture at each
generation. More, GEA forces exploitation of the most performant architectures
by descendant generation while simultaneously driving exploration through
parent mutation and favouring younger architectures to the detriment of older

been one of the main challenges for autonomous driving. Due to limited sensing
range of onboard sensors, a merging vehicle can hardly observe main road
conditions and merge properly. By leveraging the wireless communications
between connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), a merging CAV has potential to
proactively obtain the intentions of nearby vehicles. However, CAVs can be
prone to inaccurate observations, such as the noisy basic safety messages (BSM)
and poor quality surveillance images. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for Robust on-ramp merge of CAVs via Augmented and Multi-modal
Reinforcement Learning, named by RAMRL. Specifically, we formulate the on-ramp
merging problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) by taking driving safety,
comfort driving behavior, and traffic efficiency into account. To provide
reliable merging maneuvers, we simultaneously leverage BSM and surveillance
images for multi-modal observation, which is used to learn a policy model
through proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, to improve data
efficiency and provide better generalization performance, we train the policy
model with augmented data (e.g., noisy BSM and noisy surveillance images).
Extensive experiments are conducted with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)

together facilitate quantifying both the excess valuation and valuation
confidence attributable to this global socio-economic shock. Our
quasi-experimental pre-/post-COVID-19 design spans several years around 2020
and leverages contemporaneous price estimates of rental properties - i.e., real

speculation - as an appropriate counterfactual to properties listed for sale.
Combining unit-level matching and difference-in-difference approaches, we
estimate that properties listed for sale after the pandemic featured an excess
monthly price growth of roughly 1 percentage points, corresponding to an excess
annual price growth of roughly 12.7 percentage points, which accounts for more
than half of the annual growth observed across those regions in 2021.
Simultaneously, uncertainty in price estimates decreased, signaling the
irrational confidence characteristic of prior asset bubbles. We explore how
these two trends are related to market size, local market supply and borrowing
costs, which altogether lend support for the counter-intuitive roles of
uncertainty and interruptions in decision-making.

paradoxical result is a consequence of the negative specific heat of many
gravitating systems, so as the energy emitted by the sun is reflected back to
increase the thermal energy, the sun expands and its central temperature goes
down rather than up and reduces the nuclear burning rate, so that the sun can
last much longer than five billion years, for a lifetime growing roughly
