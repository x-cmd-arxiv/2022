  Workshop; 17 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Visual relations form the basis of understanding our compositional world, as
relationships between visual objects capture key information in a scene. It is
then advantageous to learn relations automatically from the data, as learning
with predefined labels cannot capture all possible relations. However, current
relation learning methods typically require supervision, and are not designed
to generalize to scenes with more complicated relational structures than those
seen during training. Here, we introduce ViRel, a method for unsupervised
discovery and learning of Visual Relations with graph-level analogy. In a
setting where scenes within a task share the same underlying relational
subgraph structure, our learning method of contrasting isomorphic and
non-isomorphic graphs discovers the relations across tasks in an unsupervised
manner. Once the relations are learned, ViRel can then retrieve the shared
relational graph structure for each task by parsing the predicted relational
structure. Using a dataset based on grid-world and the Abstract Reasoning
Corpus, we show that our method achieves above 95% accuracy in relation
classification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and
further generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational
structures.

multilingual NTTS systems models trained with both representations. Our results
reveal that the unified approach consistently achieves better cross-lingual

networks that accelerates their convergence to reach higher accuracy. However,
we demonstrate that BN comes with a fundamental drawback: it incentivizes the
model to rely on low-variance features that are highly specific to the training
(in-domain) data, hurting generalization performance on out-of-domain examples.
In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by first showing that removing BN
layers across a wide range of architectures leads to lower out-of-domain and
corruption errors at the cost of higher in-domain errors. We then propose
Counterbalancing Teacher (CT), a method which leverages a frozen copy of the
same model without BN as a teacher to enforce the student network's learning of
robust representations by substantially adapting its weights through a
consistency loss function. This regularization signal helps CT perform well in
unforeseen data shifts, even without information from the target domain as in
prior works. We theoretically show in an overparameterized linear regression
setting why normalization leads to a model's reliance on such in-domain
features, and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of CT by outperforming
several baselines on robustness benchmarks such as CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and
VLCS.

ratio) is a major measure of association to summarize the results of two
treatments or exposures. Generally, it measures the relative change in disease
risk as a result of treatment application. Standard approaches to estimating
relative risk available in common software packages may produce biased
inference when applied to correlated binary data collected from longitudinal or
clustered studies. In recent years, several methods for estimating the risk
ratio for correlated binary data have been published, some of which maintain a
well-controlled coverage probability but do not maintain an appropriate
interval width or the interval location to measure the balance between distal
and mesial noncoverage probabilities accurately or, vice versa. This paper
develops efficient and straightforward inference procedures for estimating a
confidence interval for risk ratio based on a hybrid method. In general, the
hybrid method combines two separate confidence intervals for two single risk
rates to form a hybrid confidence interval for their ratio. Additionally, we
propose the procedures for constructing a confidence interval for risk ratio
that directly extends recently recommended methods for correlated binary data
by building on the concepts of the design effect and effective sample sizes
typically used in representative sample surveys. In order to investigate the
performance of these proposed methods, we conduct an extensive simulation
study. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods, we present three

tricyclic antidepressants with a placebo, the efficacy of the treatment group

variational framework, satisfying the orthogonality condition for anisotropic
materials. This implies that the present model can be applied to arbitrary

generalize two existing models for tension-compression asymmetry in isotropic
materials, namely the volumetric-deviatoric model and the no-tension model,
towards materials with anisotropic nature. Two benchmark problems, single
notched tensile shear tests, are used to study the performance of the present
model. The results can retain the anisotropic constitutive behavior and the
tension-compression asymmetry in the crack response, and are qualitatively in

interest rates instead of stocks. Pricing interest rate derivatives used to be
challenging, as their previous models employed either the instantaneous
interest or forward rate that could not be directly observed in the market.
This has been much improved since LMM was raised, as it uses directly
observable interbank offered rates and is expected to be more precise.
Recently, quantum computing has been used to speed up option pricing tasks, but
rarely on structured interest rate derivatives. Given the size of the interest
rate derivatives market and the widespread use of LMM, we employ quantum
computing to price an interest rate derivative, caps, based on the LMM. As caps
pricing relates to path-dependent Monte Carlo iterations for different tenors,
which is common for many complex structured derivatives, we developed our
hybrid classical-quantum approach that applies the quantum amplitude estimation
algorithm to estimate the expectation for the last tenor. We show that our
hybrid approach still shows better convergence than pure classical Monte Carlo
methods, providing a useful case study for quantum computing with a greater

conditional information. Recent methods proposed to mitigate this limitation
increase the diversity of generated samples, yet they reduce the performance of

we propose a novel method to selectively increase the diversity of
GAN-generated samples. By adding a simple, yet effective regularization to the
training loss function we encourage the generator to discover new data modes
for inputs related to diverse outputs while generating consistent samples for
the remaining ones. More precisely, we maximise the ratio of distances between
generated images and input latent vectors scaling the effect according to the

Learning (RL). Traditional RL algorithms learn a value function defined for a

value function for many policies. Here we combine the actor-critic architecture
of Parameter-Based Value Functions and the policy embedding of Policy
Evaluation Networks to learn a single value function for evaluating (and thus
helping to improve) any policy represented by a deep neural network (NN). The
method yields competitive experimental results. In continuous control problems
with infinitely many states, our value function minimizes its prediction error
by simultaneously learning a small set of `probing states' and a mapping from
actions produced in probing states to the policy's return. The method extracts
crucial abstract knowledge about the environment in form of very few states
sufficient to fully specify the behavior of many policies. A policy improves
solely by changing actions in probing states, following the gradient of the
value function's predictions. Surprisingly, it is possible to clone the
behavior of a near-optimal policy in Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 environments only
by knowing how to act in 3 and 5 such learned states, respectively. Remarkably,
our value function trained to evaluate NN policies is also invariant to changes

induce a relative velocity between the CMB and the (dark) matter rest frames

Although this scenario is not particularly natural, there are possible links

that subject to CMB constraints this is too small to reconcile the dipole

inside protein molecules using THz signals can control changes in their

establish that, we formulate a selectivity metric that quantifies the system
performance and captures the capability of the nanoantenna to induce a
conformational change in the desired protein molecule/population. The metric
provides a score between -1 and 1 that indicates the degree of control we have
over the system to achieve targeted protein interactions. To develop the
selectivity measure, we first use the Langevin stochastic equation driven by an
external force to model the protein behavior. We then determine the probability
of protein folding by computing the steady-state energy of the driven protein
and then generalize our model to account for protein populations. Our numerical
analysis results indicate that a maximum selectivity score is attained when
only the targeted population experiences a folding behavior due to the
impinging THz signal. From the achieved selectivity values, we conclude that
the system response not only depends on the resonant frequency but also on the
system controlling parameters namely, the nanoantenna force, the damping
constant, and the abundance of each protein population. The presented work

the proportion of incorrect (noisy) samples retrieved. These noisy samples have

semantics to other classes in the dataset, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
images, which share no semantic correlation with any category from the dataset.
The latter are, in practice, the dominant type of noisy images retrieved. To

from ID samples on the unit hypersphere. We then spectrally embed the
unsupervised representations using a fixed neighborhood size and apply an
outlier sensitive clustering at the class level to detect the clean and OOD

causal model can be learned without significantly impacting reconstruction
fidelity. By learning the causal relationships between image semantic labels or
tabular variables, we can analyze biases, intervene on the generative model,
and simulate new scenarios. Furthermore, by modifying the causal structure, we
can generate samples outside the domain of the original training data and use
such counterfactual models to de-bias datasets. Thus, datasets with known
biases can still be used to train the causal generative model and learn the
causal relationships, but we can produce de-biased datasets on the generative
side. Our proposed method combines a causal latent space VAE model with
specific modification to emphasize causal fidelity, enabling finer control over
the causal layer and the ability to learn a robust intervention framework. We
explore how better disentanglement of causal learning and encoding/decoding
generates higher causal intervention quality. We also compare our model against
similar research to demonstrate the need for explicit generative de-biasing

various diseases. However, the nature of the CT images is even more diverse
since the resolution and number of the slices of a CT scan are determined by
the machine and its settings. Conventional deep learning models are hard to
tickle such diverse data since the essential requirement of the deep neural
network is the consistent shape of the input data. In this paper, we propose a
novel, effective, two-step-wise approach to tickle this issue for COVID-19
symptom classification thoroughly. First, the semantic feature embedding of
each slice for a CT scan is extracted by conventional backbone networks. Then,
we proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer-based sub-network
to deal with temporal feature learning, leading to spatiotemporal feature
representation learning. In this fashion, the proposed two-step LSTM model
could prevent overfitting, as well as increase performance. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the proposed two-step method not only shows excellent
performance but also could be compensated for each other. More specifically,
the two-step LSTM model has a lower false-negative rate, while the 2-step Swin
model has a lower false-positive rate. In summary, it is suggested that the
model ensemble could be adopted for more stable and promising performance in
real-world applications.

propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens
progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision
Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to
estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The
module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically.
While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in
vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation
can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our
method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision
Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require
structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial
sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric
computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths
to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more
important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while
significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures

HiPE, a novel hierarchical algorithm for pose graph initialization. Our

gradually deprives the patient of cognitive function and can end in death. With
the advancement of technology today, it is possible to detect Alzheimer's
disease through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. So that MRI is the
technique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of
Alzheimer's disease. With this technology, image recognition in the early
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved automatically using machine
learning. Although machine learning has many advantages, currently the use of
deep learning is more widely applied because it has stronger learning
capabilities and is more suitable for solving image recognition problems.
However, there are still several challenges that must be faced to implement
deep learning, such as the need for large datasets, requiring large computing
resources, and requiring careful parameter setting to prevent overfitting or
underfitting. In responding to the challenge of classifying Alzheimer's disease
using deep learning, this study propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

the need for a large and balanced dataset, transfer learning from ImageNet is
used and weighting the loss function values so that each class has the same

challenges when resolving the RNA structures, which leads to the scarcity of

complementary to the experimental techniques. However, none of the \textit{de

strategies, and their performance seems to hit the plateau. In this work, we
develop the first end-to-end deep learning approach, E2Efold-3D, to accurately
perform the \textit{de novo} RNA structure prediction. Several novel components
are proposed to overcome the data scarcity, such as a fully-differentiable
end-to-end pipeline, secondary structure-assisted self-distillation, and
parameter-efficient backbone formulation. Such designs are validated on the
independent, non-overlapping RNA puzzle testing dataset and reach an average
sub-4 \AA{} root-mean-square deviation, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Interestingly, it also achieves
promising results when predicting RNA complex structures, a feat that none of

require modifications, beyond merely changing parameters, to the unitaries that

  In this paper, for estimating the derivatives of parameterized expectation

shift rule). Our method is exact (i.e., it gives ``analytic derivatives''), and
it has the same worst-case variance as Banchi-Crooks'.
  Moreover, we discuss the theory surrounding proper shift rules, based on
Fourier analysis of perturbed-parametric quantum evolutions, resulting in a
characterization of the proper shift rules in terms of their Fourier

make them compatible with the remaining non-shadow regions without a trace,
shadow removal is a very challenging problem that benefits many downstream
image/video-related tasks. Recently, transformers have shown their strong
capability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and
this capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying
transformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two
reasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to
irregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from
the non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way
interactions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel
cross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs
from existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the
non-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches.
This is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation
that can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the
non-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and
Video Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method
compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

emission from regions close to the central engine, possibly the outer accretion

related, their emission may be temporarily correlated, possibly with some time
delays. We present the results of quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray monitoring
of three RQ Seyfert galaxies, Mrk 110, Mrk 766, and NGC 4593, carried out with
the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz over a period of about 300 days, and with the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer at 2-10 keV over a period of about 2000 days. The
radio core variability is likely detected in the highest resolution (A
configuration) observations of Mrk 110 and NGC 4593, with a fractional
variability amplitude of 6.3% and 9.5%, respectively. A cross-correlation
analysis suggests an apparently strong (Pearson r = -0.89) and highly
significant correlation (p = 1 x 10^(-6)) in Mrk 110, with the radio lagging
the X-ray by 56 days. However, a further analysis of the r values distribution
for physically unrelated long time delays, reveals that this correlation is not
significant. This occurs since the Pearson correlation assumes white noise,
while both the X-ray and the radio light curves follow red noise, which
dramatically increases the chance, by a factor of ~ 10^3, to get extremely high
r values in uncorrelated data sets. A significantly longer radio monitoring
with a higher sampling rate, preferably with a high-resolution fixed radio
array, is required in order to reliably detect a delay.

it remains elusive how to construct minimax optimal DNN classifiers. Moreover,
it is interesting to explore whether DNN classifiers can circumvent the curse

paper are two-fold. First, based on a localized margin framework, we discover
the source of suboptimality of existing DNN approaches. Motivated by this, we
propose a new deep learning classifier using a divide-and-conquer technique:
DNN classifiers are constructed on each local region and then aggregated to a
global one. We further propose a localized version of the classical Tsybakov's
noise condition, under which statistical optimality of our new classifier is
established. Second, we show that DNN classifiers can adapt to low-dimensional
data structures and circumvent the curse of dimensionality in the sense that
the minimax rate only depends on the effective dimension, potentially much
smaller than the actual data dimension. Numerical experiments are conducted on
simulated data to corroborate our theoretical results.

(potential) mismatch between the domain where a model is deployed and the
domain(s) where the training data was gathered. Methods to handle such problems
must specify what structure is common between the domains and what varies. A
natural assumption is that causal (structural) relationships are invariant in
all domains. Then, it is tempting to learn a predictor for label $Y$ that
depends only on its causal parents. However, many real-world problems are
""anti-causal"" in the sense that $Y$ is a cause of the covariates $X$ -- in this
case, $Y$ has no causal parents and the naive causal invariance is useless. In
this paper, we study representation learning under a particular notion of
domain shift that both respects causal invariance and that naturally handles
the ""anti-causal"" structure. We show how to leverage the shared causal
structure of the domains to learn a representation that both admits an
invariant predictor and that also allows fast adaptation in new domains. The
key is to translate causal assumptions into learning principles that
disentangle ""invariant"" and ""non-stable"" features. Experiments on both

spectrum is affected by stellar variability at individual epochs. We report an
observed anticorrelation between the relative slopes and offsets of the spectra
across all epochs. This anticorrelation is consistent with the predictions from
the forward transmission models, which account for the effect of unocculted
stellar spots and faculae measured previously for WASP-19. We introduce a new
method to correct for this stellar variability effect at each epoch by using
the observed correlation between the transmission spectral slopes and offsets.
We compare our stellar variability corrected GMOS transmission spectrum with
previous contradicting MOS measurements for WASP-19b and attempt to reconcile
them. We also measure the amplitude and timescale of broadband stellar
variability of WASP-19 from TESS photometry, which we find to be consistent

their characteristic strain spectrum; ii) their statistical isotropy; and iii)
the variance of their spatial correlations. We also investigate how the

regression MLMs is proposed. The focus is on three aspects, model,
discrimination, and transparency and explainability. These aspects are
subsequently divided into sub aspects. Contributors, such as inter MLM group
fairness, feature contribution order, and aggregated feature contribution, are
identified for each of these sub aspects. To measure the performance of the
contributors, the framework proposes a shortlist of KPIs. A traffic light risk
assessment method is furthermore coupled to these KPIs. For assessing
transparency and explainability, different explainability methods (SHAP and
LIME) are used, which are compared with a model intrinsic method using
quantitative methods and machine learning modelling. Using an open source
dataset, a model is trained and tested and the KPIs are computed. It is
demonstrated that popular explainability methods, such as SHAP and LIME,
underperform in accuracy when interpreting these models. They fail to predict
the order of feature importance, the magnitudes, and occasionally even the
nature of the feature contribution. For other contributors, such as group
fairness and their associated KPIs, similar analysis and calculations have been
performed with the aim of adding profundity to the proposed audit framework.
The framework is expected to assist regulatory bodies in performing conformity
assessments of AI systems using multilevel binomial classification models at
businesses. It will also benefit businesses deploying MLMs to be future proof

parameter combinations constrained by different combinations of cosmological

quintessence using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy. Using mock DESI
observations of the Hubble parameter, angular diameter distance, and growth

proceeds in batches, where the update to the value of each state must be
completed before the next batch of updates can begin. Completing a single batch
is prohibitively expensive if the state space is large, rendering VI
impractical for many applications. Asynchronous VI helps to address the large
state space problem by updating one state at a time, in-place and in an
arbitrary order. However, Asynchronous VI still requires a maximization over
the entire action space, making it impractical for domains with large action

inadvertently led to network designs that achieve significant gains in AP but

AP to choose a model that provides an optimal tradeoff between false positives
and high recall. To resolve this dilemma, we review alternative metrics in the
literature and propose two new measures to explicitly measure the amount of

observations of seven of the most star-forming brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs). Continuum-subtracted [O II] maps reveal the detailed, complex structure
of warm ($T \sim 10^4$ K) ionized gas filaments in these BCGs, allowing us to
measure spatially-resolved star formation rates (SFRs) of ~60-600 Msun/yr. We
compare the SFRs in these systems and others from the literature to their
intracluster medium (ICM) cooling rates (dM/dt), measured from archival Chandra
X-ray data, finding a best-fit relation of log(SFR) = (1.67+/-0.17) log(dM/dt)
+ (-3.25+/-0.38) with an intrinsic scatter of 0.39+/-0.09 dex. This
steeper-than-unity slope implies an increasingly efficient conversion of hot
($T \sim 10^7$ K) gas into young stars with increasing dM/dt, or conversely a
gradual decrease in the effectiveness of AGN feedback in the strongest cool
cores. We also seek to understand the physical extent of these multiphase
filaments that we observe in cluster cores. We show, for the first time, that
the average extent of the multiphase gas is always smaller than the radii at
which the cooling time reaches 1 Gyr, the tcool/tff profile flattens, and that
X-ray cavities are observed. This implies a close connection between the
multiphase filaments, the thermodynamics of the cooling core, and the dynamics
of X-ray bubbles. Interestingly, we find a one-to-one correlation between the
average extent of cool multiphase filaments and the radius at which the cooling
time reaches 0.5 Gyr, which may be indicative of a universal condensation
timescale in cluster cores.

In one, unitarity is built-in, while the black hole interior emerges only

degrees of freedom. In the other, more widely studied approach, the existence
of the interior is manifest, while the unitarity of the underlying dynamics can
be captured only indirectly by incorporating certain nonperturbative effects of
gravity. These two pictures correspond to a distant description and the
description based on entanglement islands/replica wormholes, respectively. We
also present a holographic description of de Sitter spacetime based on the

this is that magnetized disk winds dominate angular momentum transport. This
has several important implications for planet formation processes. We compute
the physical and chemical evolution of disks and the formation and migration of
planets under the combined effects of angular momentum transport by turbulent
viscosity and disk winds. We take into account the critical role of planet
traps to limit Type I migration in all of these models and compute thousands of
planet evolution tracks for single planets drawn from a distribution of initial
disk properties and turbulence strengths. We do not consider multi-planet
models nor include N-body planet-planet interactions. Within this physical
framework we find that populations with a constant value disk turbulence and
winds strength produce mass-semimajor axis distributions in the M-a diagram
with insufficient scatter to compare reasonably with observations. However,
populations produced as a consequence of sampling disks with a distribution of
the relative strengths of disk turbulence and winds fit much better. Such
models give rise to a substantial super Earth population at orbital radii
0.03-2 AU, as well as a clear separation between the produced hot Jupiter and
warm Jupiter populations. Additionally, this model results in a good comparison
with the exoplanetary mass-radius distribution in the M-R diagram after
post-disk atmospheric photoevaporation is accounted for.

two of the main sources of systematic uncertainty in weak lensing surveys. We
investigate the impact of redshift errors and their interplay with different IA
models. Generally, errors on the mean $\delta_z$ and on the width $\sigma_z$ of
the redshift bins can both lead to biases in cosmological constraints. We find
that such biases can, however, only be partially resolved by marginalizing over
$\delta_z$ and $\sigma_z$. For Stage-III surveys, $\delta_z$ and $\sigma_z$
cannot be well constrained due to limited statistics. The resulting biases are
thus sensitive to prior volume effects. For Stage-IV surveys, we observe that
marginalizing over the redshift parameters has an impact and reduces the bias.
We derive requirements on the uncertainty of $\sigma_z$ and $\delta_z$ for both
Stage-III and Stage-IV surveys. We assume that the redshift systematic errors
on $S_8$ should be less than half of the statistical errors, and the median
bias should be smaller than $0.25\sigma$. We find that the uncertainty on
$\delta_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.025$ for the NLA IA model with a Stage-III
survey. For $\sigma_z$, the requirement is met even for large uncertainties
$\leq0.3$. For the TATT IA model, the uncertainty on $\delta_z$ has to be
$\lesssim0.02$ and the uncertainty on $\sigma_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.2$. For
Stage-IV surveys, the uncertainty on $\delta_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.005$ and
the uncertainty on $\sigma_z$ should be $\lesssim0.1$, with no significant
dependence on the IA model. This required high precision will be a challenge
for the redshift calibration of these future surveys. Finally, we investigate
whether the interplay between redshift systematics and IA modelling can explain
the $S_8$-tension between cosmic shear results and CMB measurements. We find
that this is unlikely to explain the current $S_8$-tension.

(BH) X-ray transients (XRTs), based on the depth of the trough (T) from
double-peaked Ha emission profiles arising in accretion discs. We find that the
inclination angle (i) is linearly correlated with T in phase-averaged spectra
with sufficient orbital coverage (>~50 per cent) and spectral resolution,
following i (deg)=93.5 x T +23.7. The correlation is caused by a combination of
line opacity and local broadening, where a leading (excess broadening)
component scales with the de-projected velocity of the outer disc.
Interestingly, such scaling allows to estimate the fundamental ratio M1/Porb by
simply resolving the intrinsic width of the double-peak profile. We apply the
T-i correlation to derive binary inclinations for GRO J0422+32 and Swift
J1357-0933, two BH XRTs where strong flickering activity has hindered
determining their values through ellipsoidal fits to photometric light curves.
Remarkably, the inclination derived for GRO J0422+32 (i=55.6+-4.1) implies a BH
mass of 2.7+0.7-0.5 Msun thus placing it within the gap that separates BHs from
neutron stars. This result proves that low-mass BHs exist in nature and
strongly suggests that the so-called ""mass gap"" is mainly produced by low
number statistics and possibly observational biases. On the other hand, we find
that Swift J1357-0933 contains a 10.9+1.7-1.6 Msun BH seen nearly edge on
(i=87.4+2.6-5.6 deg). Such extreme inclination, however, should be treated with
caution since it relies on extrapolating the T-i correlation beyond i>~75 deg,
where it has not yet been tested.

$z\sim8$ galaxies with red Spitzer/IRAC colors suggests objects with unusual
ionizing capabilities that created early ionized bubbles in a neutral era.
Whether such bubbles reflect enhanced ionizing properties (nature) or an
overdense environment (nurture), however, remains unclear. Here we aim to
distinguish between these hypotheses via a search for Ly$\alpha$ emission in
five fainter galaxies drawn from the CANDELS-GOODS fields using a similar IRAC
excess and UV magnitudes that should reflect reduced clustering effects. Using
Keck/MOSFIRE we tentatively detect $>4\sigma$ line emission in only two targets
at redshifts $z_{\rm Ly\alpha}$=7.1081 and $z_{\rm Ly\alpha}$=7.9622 with
rest-frame EWs of 16-17 A, $\sim$1.5$\times$ weaker compared to their brighter
counterparts. Thus we find a reduced rate for Ly$\alpha$ emission of
$0.40^{+0.30}_{-0.25}$ compared to $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.44}$ for more luminous
examples. The lower rate agrees with predictions from simulations of a mostly
neutral IGM and an intrinsic EW$_{0,\rm Ly\alpha}$ distribution for $z\sim6$
galaxies. However, even with an extreme EW$_{0,\rm Ly\alpha}$ model, it is
challenging to match the detection rate for the luminous objects. SED-fitting
of our fainter sample indicates young and star-forming systems, albeit with
less extreme SFRs and ionization parameters compared to their luminous
counterparts. The enhanced Ly$\alpha$ rate in luminous galaxies is thus likely
a byproduct of both extreme ionizing properties as well as environment effects.
Further studies with JWST may be required to resolve the physical nature of
this puzzling population.

estimated so far for any Galactic BH X-ray binary. If the donor star is a
main-sequence dwarf, such a period corresponds to the evolutionary stage where
orbital shrinking is driven by gravitational radiation and the star has
regained contact with its Roche lobe (low end of the period gap). The three
Galactic BHs with the shortest period (<~3 hr) are also those with the highest

generating high-fidelity gates, in a scalable manner, remains a major challenge
in all quantum information processing platforms. Accordingly, improving the
fidelity and robustness of these gates has been a research focus in recent
years. In trapped ions quantum computers, entangling gates are performed by
driving the normal modes of motion of the ion chain, generating a
spin-dependent force. Even though there has been significant progress in
increasing the robustness and modularity of these gates, they are still
sensitive to noise in the intensity of the driving field. Here we supplement
the conventional spin-dependent displacement with spin-dependent squeezing,
which enables a gate that is robust to deviations in the amplitude of the
driving field. We solve the general Hamiltonian and engineer its spectrum
analytically. We also endow our gate with other, more conventional, robustness
properties, making it resilient to many practical sources of noise and
inaccuracies.

\lesssim 6.44$, this particle, under the action of the lateral CP force (which
is the projection of the CP force onto the mentioned plane), is attracted to
the point on the plane which is closest to the cylinder surface. On the other
hand, when $x_0/R \gtrsim 6.44$, we also show that, for certain particle
orientations and anisotropy, the lateral CP force can move the particle away

reveals a nontrivial dependence of the CP interaction with the surface
geometry, specifically of the relative curvature. In the vdW regime, we show
that a similar nontrivial repulsive behavior occurs, but for the relative
curvature $x_0/R \gtrsim 2.18$, which means that this effect requires a smaller
cylinder curvature in the vdW regime than in the CP one. In addition, we also
show that there are classical counterparts of these effects, involving a
neutral particle with a permanent electric dipole moment. The prediction of

the past decade thanks to its outstanding empirical performance. Yet, because
of its black-box nature, the results by random forests can be hard to interpret
in many big data applications. Quantifying the usefulness of individual
features in random forests learning can greatly enhance its interpretability.
Existing studies have shown that some popularly used feature importance
measures for random forests suffer from the bias issue. In addition, there lack
comprehensive size and power analyses for most of these existing methods. In
this paper, we approach the problem via hypothesis testing, and suggest a
framework of the self-normalized feature-residual correlation test (FACT) for
evaluating the significance of a given feature in the random forests model with
bias-resistance property, where our null hypothesis concerns whether the
feature is conditionally independent of the response given all other features.
Such an endeavor on random forests inference is empowered by some recent
developments on high-dimensional random forests consistency. The vanilla
version of our FACT test can suffer from the bias issue in the presence of
feature dependency. We exploit the techniques of imbalancing and conditioning
for bias correction. We further incorporate the ensemble idea into the FACT
statistic through feature transformations for the enhanced power. Under a
fairly general high-dimensional nonparametric model setting with dependent
features, we formally establish that FACT can provide theoretically justified
random forests feature p-values and enjoy appealing power through nonasymptotic
analyses. The theoretical results and finite-sample advantages of the newly
suggested method are illustrated with several simulation examples and an
economic forecasting application in relation to COVID-19.

experience and provide them with the highest possible data rates. Recently, the
concept of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems has been considered to
enhance the performance of systems that operate merely with Radio Frequency
(RF) or visible light communication (VLC) technologies. In this paper, a hybrid
VLC/RF cell-free massive MIMO system is proposed where an RF cell-free network
and a VLC cell-free network coexist to serve users. The idea is to utilize the
benefits of each network and balance the load aiming at maximizing the system's
sum-rate. The system is evaluated using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding scheme. Two
user association algorithms are proposed to assign users to either the VLC or
the RF networks. In addition, two user-centric clustering approaches are
proposed and evaluated. Simulation results show that the proposed association
algorithms significantly outperform a random network association of users in
terms of sum-rate. Results also show great potential for the proposed system
compared to standalone cell-free networks.

different types of texts (e.g., social media posts and news stories) containing

performance degradation in remote mobile robots during task execution. A robot
may encounter a variety of uncertainties and adversities during task execution,
which can impair its ability to carry out tasks effectively and cause its
performance to degrade. Such situations can be mitigated or averted by timely
detection and intervention (e.g., by a remote human supervisor taking over
control in teleoperation mode). Inspired by patient triaging systems in
hospitals, we introduce the framework of ""robot vitals"" for estimating overall
""robot health"". A robot's vitals are a set of indicators that estimate the
extent of performance degradation faced by a robot at a given point in time.
Robot health is a metric that combines robot vitals into a single scalar value
estimate of performance degradation. Experiments, both in simulation and on a
real mobile robot, demonstrate that the proposed robot vitals and robot health
can be used effectively to estimate robot performance degradation during
runtime.

blocks that are constrained geometrically through contact and friction by their
neighboring blocks. As long as the frictional strength is nowhere exceeded, the
blocks stick against each other, allowing for large rotations. Once the
interfacial stresses exceed the frictional strength, relative sliding between
the blocks alters the structure's mechanical response. Improving the structural
performance, precisely the strength and the toughness, has been one of the main
focal points in the literature. However, many fundamental questions regarding
the role and effect of the interface mechanisms (stick and slip) and rotation
of the blocks have not been addressed yet. Here, we carry out a parametric
analysis to understand the effect of Young's modulus, friction coefficient and
geometry of the blocks on the dominance of the stick or slip governed
mechanism. We combine analytical and computational tools to analyze the failure
mechanisms and the response capacities of beam-like topologically interlocked
structures. This is achieved using a finite element method coupled with a
penalty-based approach for enforcing contact constraints along interfaces. We
show that the combination of the structure's height and the friction
coefficient controls whether the failure mechanism is slip-governed or
stick-governed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sticking mechanism across
all interfaces along with the rotation of the blocks dictates a saturation
level to the mechanical performance of a given structure irrespective of
geometric and material properties. This provides a theoretical upper bound for
the structural response of topologically interlocked structures and establishes
a theoretical benchmark of achievable performance.

interesting states on a quantum computer, and this task can often be costly or
challenging to implement. A digital, ``site-by-site'' scheme of state
preparation was introduced in arXiv:1911.03505 as a way to prepare the vacuum
state of certain fermionic field theory Hamiltonians with a mass gap. More
generally, this algorithm may be used to prepare ground states of Hamiltonians
by adding one site at a time as long as successive intermediate ground states
share a non-zero overlap and the Hamiltonian has a non-vanishing spectral gap
at finite lattice size. In this paper, we study the ground state overlap as a
function of the number of sites for a range of quadratic fermionic
Hamiltonians. Using analytical formulas known for free fermions, we are able to
explore the large-$N$ behavior and draw conclusions about the state overlap.
For all models studied, we find that the overlap remains large (e.g. $> 0.1$)
up to large lattice sizes ($N=64,72$) except near quantum phase transitions or
in the presence of gapless edge modes. For one-dimensional systems, we further
find that two $N/2$-site ground states also share a large overlap with the
$N$-site ground state everywhere except a region near the phase boundary. Based
on these numerical results, we additionally propose a recursive alternative to
the site-by-site state preparation algorithm.

task, shorthanded for text2motion and motion2text, respectively. To tackle the
existing challenges, especially to enable the generation of multiple distinct
motions from the same text, and to avoid the undesirable production of trivial
motionless pose sequences, we propose the use of motion token, a discrete and
compact motion representation. This provides one level playing ground when
considering both motions and text signals, as the motion and text tokens,
respectively. Moreover, our motion2text module is integrated into the inverse
alignment process of our text2motion training pipeline, where a significant
deviation of synthesized text from the input text would be penalized by a large
training loss; empirically this is shown to effectively improve performance.
Finally, the mappings in-between the two modalities of motions and texts are
facilitated by adapting the neural model for machine translation (NMT) to our
context. This autoregressive modeling of the distribution over discrete motion
tokens further enables non-deterministic production of pose sequences, of
variable lengths, from an input text. Our approach is flexible, could be used
for both text2motion and motion2text tasks. Empirical evaluations on two

  function",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral estimators have been broadly applied to statistical network analysis
but they do not incorporate the likelihood information of the network sampling
model. This paper proposes a novel surrogate likelihood function for
statistical inference of a class of popular network models referred to as
random dot product graphs. In contrast to the structurally complicated exact
likelihood function, the surrogate likelihood function has a separable
structure and is log-concave yet approximates the exact likelihood function
well. From the frequentist perspective, we study the maximum surrogate
likelihood estimator and establish the accompanying theory. We show its
existence, uniqueness, large sample properties, and that it improves upon the
baseline spectral estimator with a smaller sum of squared errors. A
computationally convenient stochastic gradient descent algorithm is designed
for finding the maximum surrogate likelihood estimator in practice. From the
Bayesian perspective, we establish the Bernstein--von Mises theorem of the
posterior distribution with the surrogate likelihood function and show that the
resulting credible sets have the correct frequentist coverage. The empirical
performance of the proposed surrogate-likelihood-based methods is validated
through the analyses of simulation examples and a real-world Wikipedia graph
dataset. An R package implementing the proposed computation algorithms is
publicly available at https://fangzheng-xie.github.io./publication/ .

  Development Effort Estimation",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past two decades, several Machine Learning (ML) libraries have become
freely available. Many studies have used such libraries to carry out empirical
investigations on predictive Software Engineering (SE) tasks. However, the
differences stemming from using one library over another have been overlooked,
implicitly assuming that using any of these libraries would provide the user
with the same or very similar results. This paper aims at raising awareness of
the differences incurred when using different ML libraries for software
development effort estimation (SEE), one of most widely studied SE prediction
tasks. To this end, we investigate 4 deterministic machine learners as provided
by 3 of the most popular ML open-source libraries written in different
languages (namely, Scikit-Learn, Caret and Weka). We carry out a thorough
empirical study comparing the performance of the machine learners on 5 SEE
datasets in the two most common SEE scenarios (i.e., out-of-the-box-ml and
tuned-ml) as well as an in-depth analysis of the documentation and code of
their APIs. The results of our study reveal that the predictions provided by
the 3 libraries differ in 95% of the cases on average across a total of 105
cases studied. These differences are significantly large in most cases and
yield misestimations of up to approx. 3,000 hours per project. Moreover, our
API analysis reveals that these libraries provide the user with different
levels of control on the parameters one can manipulate, and a lack of clarity
and consistency, overall, which might mislead users. Our findings highlight
that the ML library is an important design choice for SEE studies, which can
lead to a difference in performance. However, such a difference is
under-documented. We conclude by highlighting open-challenges with suggestions
for the developers of libraries as well as for the researchers and

to be maintained during the migration from one cell to another in the handover.
Due to the presence of a massive number of mobile devices, the management of
the high mobility of a dense network becomes crucial. Moreover, a dynamic
adaptation is required for the Time-to-Trigger (TTT) and hysteresis margin,
which significantly impact the handover latency and overall throughput.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an online learning-based mechanism, known
as Learning-based Intelligent Mobility Management (LIM2), for mobility
management in 5G and beyond, with an intelligent adaptation of the TTT and
hysteresis values. LIM2 uses a Kalman filter to predict the future signal
quality of the serving and neighbor cells, selects the target cell for the
handover using state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA)-based reinforcement
learning, and adapts the TTT and hysteresis using the epsilon-greedy policy. We
implement a prototype of the LIM2 in NS-3 and extensively analyze its
performance, where it is observed that the LIM2 algorithm can significantly
improve the handover operation in very high speed mobility scenarios.

verb-noun compositional action nodes in the knowledge graph, making it
inefficient to scale since the number of compositional action nodes grows
quadratically with respect to the number of verbs and nouns. To address this

Knowledge-bases (DARK), which leverages the inherent compositionality of
actions. DARK trains a factorized model by first extracting disentangled
feature representations for verbs and nouns, and then predicting classification
weights using relations in external knowledge graphs. The type constraint
between verb and noun is extracted from external knowledge bases and finally
applied when composing actions. DARK has better scalability in the number of
objects and verbs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Charades

allowed ranges of the $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson mass consistent with the
constraints arising from neutrino trident production, $R_{K^{*}}$ anomaly,
$B_{s}$ meson oscillation. We conclude the $R_{K^{*}}$ and muon $g-2$ anomalies

design nonlinear waveguides with arbitrarily shaped effective nonlinearity
profiles. The method takes advantage of the fact that the second order
nonlinear response is a tensor quantity and thus the local effective
nonlinearity of a material depends on the propagation direction of the fields
participating in the interaction. Thus, by locally changing the propagation
direction of the fields we can modulate the wave-mixing process. Our methods
allows for the waveguide fabrication process to be significantly simplified:
The material structure of the waveguide is made by a single crystal, no longer
needing oriented patterning (OP) or periodic poling (PP). We use our method to
design waveguides with a nonlinearity profile that is Gaussian in the
propagation length, allowing to generate perfectly pure heralded single

Here, we present the results of an experiment in which the evolution of the

small changes in the way that information is provided to consumers can have
large aggregate effects on behavior. This has been promoted in popular media in
areas of public health and wellness, but its application to other areas has not
been broadly studied. This paper presents a simple model which expresses the
effect of providing commuters with carefully-curated information regarding
aggregate traffic ""slowdowns"" on the various roads in a transportation network.
Much of the work on providing information to commuters focuses specifically on
travel-time information. However, the model in the present paper allows a
system planner to provide slowdown information as well; that is, commuters are
additionally told how much slower each route is as compared to its uncongested
state. We show that providing this additional information can improve
equilibrium routing efficiency when compared to the case when commuters are
only given information about travel time, but that these improvements in
congestion are not universal. That is, transportation networks exist on which
any provision of slowdown information can harm equilibrium congestion. In
addition, this paper illuminates a deep connection between the effects of
commuter slowdown-sensitivity and the study of marginal-cost pricing and

fortunately, a handful of examples are typically available, enabling the model
to adapt to the new category/style. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective
-- instead of asking for a model that generalises, we advocate for one that
quickly adapts, with just very few samples during testing (in a few-shot
manner). To solve this new problem, we introduce a novel model-agnostic
meta-learning (MAML) based framework with several key modifications: (1) As a
retrieval task with a margin-based contrastive loss, we simplify the MAML
training in the inner loop to make it more stable and tractable. (2) The margin
in our contrastive loss is also meta-learned with the rest of the model. (3)
Three additional regularisation losses are introduced in the outer loop, to
make the meta-learned FG-SBIR model more effective for category/style
adaptation. Extensive experiments on public datasets suggest a large gain over
generalisation and zero-shot based approaches, and a few strong few-shot
baselines.

of high quantum purity, which is essential for future information storage. The
nonlinearity of the transitions arise from cavity-assisted pumping between
ground states of cold, trapped atoms and the stability depends on the intensity
of two driving lasers. We interpret the phenomenon in terms of the recent
paradigm of first-order, driven-dissipative phase transitions, where the
transmitted and driving fields are understood as the order and control
parameters, respectively. The saturation-induced bistability is recovered for
infinite drive in one of the controls. The order of the transition is confirmed

computer vision tasks and systematically investigate a family of functions that
generalize the power-law function to allow for better estimation of data

scenario presents more stability. Additionally, we investigate how the solar
radiation pressure perturbs particles of different sizes orbiting the triple

radiation pressure for the retrograde case. Meanwhile, to resist solar
radiation, the particles in prograde orbit must be larger than the particles in

operating public and private images alike as long as the storage service
supports HTTP range requests (standard in Cloud storage and most web servers).
ImageBox3 thus removes significant hurdles to WSI operation and effective

mock-polarization maps based on the toroidal-dominated magnetic field in the
outflow zone with the observed polarization vectors of SiO lines in Orion
Source I shows a reasonable agreement when the magnetic axis is tilted at an

lines have a net polarization parallel to the local magnetic field. Although
the observed polarization is from SiO lines and our synthetic maps are due to

ambiguity of whether the line polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the
local magnetic field direction.

flows for discrete data have only recently been explored. These prior models,
however, suffer from limitations that are distinct from those of continuous
flows. Most notably, discrete flow-based models cannot be straightforwardly
optimized with conventional deep learning methods because gradients of discrete
functions are undefined or zero. Previous works approximate pseudo-gradients of
the discrete functions but do not solve the problem on a fundamental level. In
addition to that, backpropagation can be computationally burdensome compared to
alternative discrete algorithms such as decision tree algorithms. Our approach
seeks to reduce computational burden and remove the need for pseudo-gradients
by developing a discrete flow based on decision trees -- building upon the
success of efficient tree-based methods for classification and regression for
discrete data. We first define a tree-structured permutation (TSP) that
compactly encodes a permutation of discrete data where the inverse is easy to
compute; thus, we can efficiently compute the density value and sample new
data. We then propose a decision tree algorithm to build TSPs that learns the
tree structure and permutations at each node via novel criteria. We empirically
demonstrate the feasibility of our method on multiple datasets.

impact of density and resource distribution on the growth of a plant
population. They allow to define simple individual-based models, by integrating
information relatively easy to collect at the population scale, which are
generalized to a macroscopic scale by mean-field limit arguments. Nevertheless,
up to our knowledge, few works have studied under which conditions on the
competition index or on the initial configuration of the population the passage
from the individual scale to the population scale is mathematically guaranteed.
We consider in this paper a competition index commonly used in the literature,
expressed as an average over the population of a pairwise potential depending
on a measure of plants' sizes and their respective distances. In line with the
literature on mixed-effect models, the population is assumed to be
heterogeneous, with inter-individual variability of growth parameters.
Sufficient conditions on the initial configuration are given so that the
population dynamics, taking the form of a system of non-linear differential
equations, is well defined. The mean-field distribution associated with an
infinitely crowded population is then characterized by the characteristic flow,
and the convergence towards this distribution for an increasing population size
is also proved. The dynamics of the heterogeneous population is illustrated by
numerical simulations, using a Lagrangian scheme to visualize the mean-field
dynamics.

  - For X \in {public-key, attribute-based, fully-homomorphic, witness,

zero-knowledge assuming statistically-binding commitments.
  - We also obtain a strong form of everlasting security for two-party and

achieving everlasting security against all parties in this setting is known to
be impossible, we introduce everlasting security transfer (EST). This enables
any one party (or a subset of parties) to dynamically and certifiably
information-theoretically delete other participants' data after protocol
execution. We construct general-purpose secure computation with EST assuming

approximating the complex Landau collision integral in the FPL equation. The
operator surrogate models can also be combined with the traditional numerical
schemes. It provides a high efficiency in computational time when the number of
velocity modes becomes larger. Using the opPINN framework, we provide the
neural network solutions for the FPL equation under the various types of
initial conditions, and interaction models in two and three dimensions.
Furthermore, based on the theoretical properties of the FPL equation, we show
that the approximated neural network solution converges to the a priori
classical solution of the FPL equation as the pre-defined loss function is
reduced.

features an auxiliary 'clone' of the gauge field sector. We argue that this
last approach shares the attractive features of the other two while avoiding
their respective shortcomings. Like in Sen's approach, within the clone field
formalism, arbitrary interactions can be straightforwardly included in any
number of dimensions (treating interactions becomes very difficult in the PST

auxiliary fields are gauged away on-shell (while in Sen's approach, they merely
decouple from the physical fields but remain dynamical).

discriminative correlation filters (DCF) trackers stand out in the UAV tracking

remarkable balance between efficiency and precision. Our method is general and

specific saliency visualisation methods or saliency issues. We propose a novel
saliency enhancing approach called SESS (Saliency Enhancing with Scaling and
Sliding). It is a method and model agnostic extension to existing saliency map
generation methods. With SESS, existing saliency approaches become robust to
scale variance, multiple occurrences of target objects, presence of distractors
and generate less noisy and more discriminative saliency maps. SESS improves
saliency by fusing saliency maps extracted from multiple patches at different
scales from different areas, and combines these individual maps using a novel
fusion scheme that incorporates channel-wise weights and spatial weighted
average. To improve efficiency, we introduce a pre-filtering step that can
exclude uninformative saliency maps to improve efficiency while still enhancing
overall results. We evaluate SESS on object recognition and detection
benchmarks where it achieves significant improvement. The code is released

solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs. Self-supervised learning has been
used to approximate solutions of such PDEs while circumventing the curse of

due to its sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting
controllers in robotics applications when player rewards are discontinuous.
This paper investigates two potential solutions to this problem: a hybrid
method that leverages both supervised Nash equilibria and the HJI PDE, and a
value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with a gradually
hardening reward. We compare these solutions using the resulting generalization
and safety performance in two vehicle interaction simulation studies with 5D

supervision (e.g., collision and near-collision demonstrations) and the low
cost of self-supervised learning, the hybrid method achieves better safety
performance than the supervised, self-supervised, and value hardening
approaches on equal computational budget. Value hardening fails to generalize
in the higher-dimensional case without informative supervision. Lastly, we show
that the neural activation function needs to be continuously differentiable for
learning PDEs and its choice can be case dependent.

that it is consistent with the big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic

Similarly, the free-streaming length constraints exclude a large parameter
space derived in previous studies. In addition to known freeze-in pair
production of $N$ from the standard model fermion pairs, we find the case that
$N$ is dominantly produced from a pair of $Z'$ at the temperature characterized
by the $B-L$ breaking scalar mass. Thus, the naive truncation of the

many-body system for a microcanonical ensemble by introducing a pure quantum
state named here an energy-filtered random-phase state, which is also a
potentially promising application of near-term quantum computers. In our
formalism, a microcanonical ensemble is specified by two parameters, i.e., the
energy of the system and its associated energy window. Accordingly, the density
of states is expressed as a sum of Gaussians centered at the target energy with
its spread corresponding to the width of the energy window. We then show that
the thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and temperature are calculated by
evaluating the trace of the time-evolution operator and the trace of the
time-evolution operator multiplied by the Hamiltonian of the system. We also
describe how these traces can be evaluated using random diagonal-unitary
circuits appropriate to quantum computation. The pure quantum state
representing our microcanonical ensemble is related to a state of the form
introduced by Wall and Neuhauser for the filter diagonalization method [M. R.
Wall and D. Neuhauser, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 8011 (1995)], and therefore we refer

random-phase state is essentially a Fourier transform of a time-evolved state
whose initial state is prepared as a random-phase state, and the cut-off time
in the time-integral for the Fourier transform sets the inverse of the width of
the energy window. The proposed method is demonstrated numerically by
calculating thermodynamic quantities for the one-dimensional spin-1/2

relevant source task to a target task. However, most existing works assume both
tasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the
sub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task
distribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a
more realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks,
i.e., source and target tasks are continuously evolving over time. We
theoretically show that the expected error on the dynamic target task can be
tightly bounded in terms of source knowledge and consecutive distribution
discrepancy across tasks. This result motivates us to propose a generic
meta-learning framework L2E for modeling the knowledge transferability on
dynamic tasks. It is centered around a task-guided meta-learning problem with a
group of meta-pairs of tasks, based on which we are able to learn the prior
model initialization for fast adaptation on the newest target task. L2E enjoys
the following properties: (1) effective knowledge transferability across
dynamic tasks; (2) fast adaptation to the new target task; (3) mitigation of
catastrophic forgetting on historical target tasks; and (4) flexibility in
incorporating any existing static transfer learning algorithms. Extensive
experiments on various image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed L2E framework.

represent a promising solution, but the difficulties associated with attaining
desirable 3D dynamics within acceptable mass and complexity budgets have led to
a minimal practical adoption. This paper addresses the influence of strut
boundary conditions (BCs) on system-level mechanical disturbance suppression.
Inherent limitations of the traditional all-rotational joint configuration are
highlighted and shown to originate in link mass and rotational inertia. A
pin-slider BC alternative is proposed and analytically proven to alleviate them

manipulators and are demonstrated for several hexapod geometries through
numerical tests. A configuration with favourable performance is suggested.
Finally, a novel planar joint that allows the physical realisation of the

development of platforms for microvibration attenuation that do not require

variation of the linear polarization across these resonance lines, which is
produced by the scattering of anisotropic radiation in the solar atmosphere.
The linear polarization signals of the Mg II h & k lines are sensitive to the
magnetic field from the low to the upper chromosphere through the Hanle and
magneto-optical effects. We compare the observations to theoretical predictions
from radiative transfer calculations in unmagnetized semi-empirical models,
arguing that magnetic fields and horizontal inhomogeneities are needed to
explain the observed polarization signals and spatial variations. This

convex objective $\phi$ over an $n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrix
$M\succeq0$, under the assumption that the minimizer $M^{\star}$ has low rank
$r^{\star}\ll n$. Following the Burer--Monteiro approach, we instead minimize
the nonconvex objective $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over a factor matrix $X$ of size
$n\times r$. This substantially reduces the number of variables from $O(n^{2})$
to as few as $O(n)$ and also enforces positive semidefiniteness for free, but
at the cost of giving up the convexity of the original problem. In this paper,
we prove that if the search rank $r\ge r^{\star}$ is overparameterized by a
constant factor with respect to the true rank $r^{\star}$, namely as in
$r>\frac{1}{4}(L/\mu-1)^{2}r^{\star}$, then despite nonconvexity, local
optimization is guaranteed to globally converge from any initial point to the
global optimum. This significantly improves upon a previous rank
overparameterization threshold of $r\ge n$, which is known to be sharp if
$\phi$ is allowed to be nonsmooth and/or non-strongly convex, but would
increase the number of variables back up to $O(n^{2})$. Conversely, without
rank overparameterization, we prove that such a global guarantee is possible if
and only if $\phi$ is almost perfectly conditioned, with a condition number of
$L/\mu<3$. Therefore, we conclude that a small amount of overparameterization
can lead to large improvements in theoretical guarantees for the nonconvex

via trading their crypto assets on decentralized applications (DApps for short)
of the Ethereum ecosystem. Apart from Ether (the native cryptocurrency of
Ethereum), many ERC20 (a widely used token standard on Ethereum) tokens obtain
vast market value in the ecosystem. Specifically, the approval mechanism is
used to delegate the privilege of spending users' tokens to DApps. By doing so,
the DApps can transfer these tokens to arbitrary receivers on behalf of the
users. To increase the usability, unlimited approval is commonly adopted by
DApps to reduce the required interaction between them and their users. However,
as shown in existing security incidents, this mechanism can be abused to steal
users' tokens.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic study to quantify the risk of
unlimited approval of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. Specifically, by evaluating
existing transactions up to 31st July 2021, we find that unlimited approval is
prevalent (60%, 15.2M/25.4M) in the ecosystem, and 22% of users have a high
risk of their approved tokens for stealing. After that, we investigate the
security issues that are involved in interacting with the UIs of 22
representative DApps and 9 famous wallets to prepare the approval transactions.
The result reveals the worrisome fact that all DApps request unlimited approval
from the front-end users and only 10% (3/31) of UIs provide explanatory
information for the approval mechanism. Meanwhile, only 16% (5/31) of UIs allow
users to modify their approval amounts. Finally, we take a further step to
characterize the user behavior into five modes and formalize the good practice,
i.e., on-demand approval and timely spending, towards securely spending
approved tokens. However, the evaluation result suggests that only 0.2% of
users follow the good practice to mitigate the risk.

externalities (e.g., inducing trips and aggravating traffic congestion).
Therefore, many cities are planning to enact or have already enacted policies
to regulate its use. However, these policies' effectiveness or impact on
ridesourcing demand and traffic congestion is uncertain. To this end, this
study applies difference-in-differences (i.e., a regression-based causal
inference approach) to empirically evaluate the effects of the congestion tax
policy on ridesourcing demand and traffic congestion in Chicago. It shows that
this congestion tax policy significantly curtails overall ridesourcing demand
but marginally alleviates traffic congestion. The results are robust to the
choice of time windows and data sets, additional control variables, alternative
model specifications, alternative control groups, and alternative modeling
approaches (i.e., regression discontinuity in time). Moreover, considerable
heterogeneity exists. For example, the policy notably reduces ridesourcing
demand with short travel distances, but such an impact is gradually attenuated

classes. It is a promising solution to take the advantage of generative models
to hallucinate realistic unseen samples based on the knowledge learned from the
seen classes. However, due to the generation shifts, the synthesized samples by
most existing methods may drift from the real distribution of the unseen data.
To address this issue, we propose a novel flow-based generative framework that
consists of multiple conditional affine coupling layers for learning unseen
data generation. Specifically, we discover and address three potential problems
that trigger the generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance
collapse, and structure disorder. First, to enhance the reflection of the
semantic information in the generated samples, we explicitly embed the semantic
information into the transformation in each conditional affine coupling layer.
Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the real unseen features, we
introduce a boundary sample mining strategy with entropy maximization to
discover more difficult visual variants of semantic prototypes and hereby
adjust the decision boundary of the classifiers. Third, a relative positioning
strategy is proposed to revise the attribute embeddings, guiding them to fully
preserve the inter-class geometric structure and further avoid structure
disorder in the semantic space. Extensive experimental results on four GZSL

  Synthesis",,,,,"quant-ph cs.ET","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent assertions of a potential advantage of Quantum Neural Network (QNN)
for specific Machine Learning (ML) tasks have sparked the curiosity of a
sizable number of application researchers. The parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), a major building block of a QNN, consists of several layers of
single-qubit rotations and multi-qubit entanglement operations. The optimum
number of PQC layers for a particular ML task is generally unknown. A larger
network often provides better performance in noiseless simulations. However, it
may perform poorly on hardware compared to a shallower network. Because the
amount of noise varies amongst quantum devices, the optimal depth of PQC can
vary significantly. Additionally, the gates chosen for the PQC may be suitable
for one type of hardware but not for another due to compilation overhead. This
makes it difficult to generalize a QNN design to wide range of hardware and
noise levels. An alternate approach is to build and train multiple QNN models
targeted for each hardware which can be expensive. To circumvent these issues,
we introduce the concept of knowledge distillation in QNN using approximate
synthesis. The proposed approach will create a new QNN network with (i) a
reduced number of layers or (ii) a different gate set without having to train
it from scratch. Training the new network for a few epochs can compensate for
the loss caused by approximation error. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate ~71.4% reduction in circuit layers, and still achieve ~16.2% better
accuracy under noise.

aspects. Firstly, besides simple concatenation, we propose circulant matrix
transformation and stacking for speaker embeddings and countermeasure
embeddings. With the stacking operation of newly-defined circulant embeddings,
we almost explore all the possible interactions between speaker embeddings and
countermeasure embeddings. Secondly, we attempt different convolution neural
networks to selectively fuse the embeddings' salient regions into channels with
convolution kernels. Finally, we design parallel attention in 1D convolution
neural networks to learn the global correlation in channel dimensions as well
as to learn the important parts in feature dimensions. Meanwhile, we embed
squeeze-and-excitation attention in 2D convolutional neural networks to learn
the global dependence among speaker embeddings and countermeasure embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that all the above methods are effective.
After fusion of four well-trained models enhanced by the mentioned methods, the

found that the crystalline phases of 2D water clusters placed between two
hexagonal boron nitride hBN nanoribbons are crucially determined by the
nanoribbons edges, the resulting polarity of the nanoribbons, and their
interlayer distance. We make use of density functional theory with further
assistance of molecular dynamics simulations to establish the comprehensive

multiple instance learning (MIL) methods to handle gigapixel resolution images

harnessing massive datasets and diverse samples, urging the need for efficient
training pipelines for scaling to large datasets and data augmentation
techniques for diversifying samples. However, current MIL-based WSI
classification pipelines are memory-expensive and computation-inefficient since
they usually assemble tens of thousands of patches as bags for computation. On
the other hand, despite their popularity in other tasks, data augmentations are
unexplored for WSI MIL frameworks. To address them, we propose ReMix, a general
and efficient framework for MIL based WSI classification. It comprises two
steps: reduce and mix. First, it reduces the number of instances in WSI bags by
substituting instances with instance prototypes, i.e., patch cluster centroids.
Then, we propose a ``Mix-the-bag'' augmentation that contains four online,
stochastic and flexible latent space augmentations. It brings diverse and
reliable class-identity-preserving semantic changes in the latent space while
enforcing semantic-perturbation invariance. We evaluate ReMix on two public
datasets with two state-of-the-art MIL methods. In our experiments, consistent
improvements in precision, accuracy, and recall have been achieved but with
orders of magnitude reduced training time and memory consumption, demonstrating
ReMix's effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available.

MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). Since 2006, this DLA is known to show a
narrow HI 21-cm absorption at z_abs = 1.173019 coinciding with a distinct metal
absorption line component. We do not detect significant HI 21-cm optical depth
variations from this known HI component. A high resolution optical spectrum
(August 2010) shows a distinct Mg I absorption at the redshift of the new HI
21-cm absorber. However, this component is not evident in the profiles of
singly ionized species. We measure the metallicity ([Zn/H] = -(0.77\pm0.11) and
[Si/H]= -(0.96\pm0.11)) and depletion ([Fe/Zn] = -(0.63\pm0.16)) for the full
system. Using the apparent column density profiles of Si II, Fe II and Mg I we
show that the depletion and the N(Mg I)/N(Si II) column density ratio
systematically vary across the velocity range. The region with high depletion
tends to have slightly larger N(Mg I)/N(Si II) ratio. The two HI 21-cm
absorbers belong to this velocity range. The emergence of z_abs = 1.172635 can
be understood if there is a large optical depth gradient over a length scale of
~0.35 pc. However, the gas producing the z_abs = 1.173019 component must be
nearly uniform over the same scale. Systematic uncertainties introduced by the
absorption line variability has to be accounted for in experiments measuring
the variations of fundamental constants and cosmic acceleration even when the
radio emission is apparently compact as in PKS 2355-106.

of semiconductor manufacturing, the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs)
and the piracy of intellectual properties (IPs) can lead to significant damage
to the integrity of the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking emerges as a
primary design-for-security measure to counter these threats, where ICs become
fully functional only when unlocked with a secret key. However, Boolean
satisfiability-based attacks have rendered most locking schemes ineffective.
This gives rise to numerous defenses and new locking methods to achieve SAT
resiliency. This paper provides a unique perspective on the SAT attack
efficiency based on conjunctive normal form (CNF) stored in SAT solver. First,
we show how the attack learns new relations between keys in every iteration
using distinguishing input patterns and the corresponding oracle responses. The
input-output pairs result in new CNF clauses of unknown keys to be appended to
the SAT solver, which leads to an exponential reduction in incorrect key
values. Second, we demonstrate that the SAT attack can break any locking scheme
within linear iteration complexity of key size. Moreover, we show how key
constraints on point functions affect the SAT attack complexity. We explain why
proper key constraint on AntiSAT reduces the complexity effectively to constant
1. The same constraint helps the breaking of CAS-Lock down to linear iteration
complexity. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the capabilities of SAT
attack against multiplier benchmark c6288, and we provide new directions to
achieve SAT resiliency.

Although this linearization theoretically requires the generation of an
infinite matrix, the original nonlinear equations can be reconstructed. For the
practical use, the linearized system should be truncated with finite size and
analysis precision can be determined by the extent of the truncation. Matrix
should be sufficiently large so that the precision is satisfied because quantum
computers can treat. Our method was applied to a one-variable nonlinear dy/dt =
-y^2 system to investigate the effect of truncation orders in Carleman
linearization and time step size on the absolute error. Subsequently, two
zero-dimensional homogeneous ignition problems for H2/air and CH4/air gas
mixtures were solved. The results revealed that the proposed method could
accurately reproduce reference data. Furthermore, an increase in the truncation
order in Carleman linearization improved accuracy even with a large time-step
size. Thus, our approach can provide accurate numerical simulations rapidly for
complex combustion systems.

  structures: Route to ultra-low power steering and peculiar stable states","Journal of the Optical Society of America B",,,,"physics.optics nlin.PS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the context of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings, tailoring
the nonlinear profile along the propagation coordinate serves to be a new
direction for realizing low-power all-optical switches. The scheme is fruitful
only when the nonlinearity profile will be either linearly decreasing or
increasing form. If the rate of variation of the nonlinearity profile is high,
the critical intensities fall below the input power of value 0.01 in the
unbroken regime provided that the light launching direction is right. Nowadays,
every new theoretical inception into the PTFBG has started making sense of
switching in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime which was once believed
to be the instability regime. When the inhomogeneous nonlinearity acts together
with the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and right light incidence, it leads to
two peculiar settings. First, the switch-up intensities are ultra-low. Second,
the switch-down action takes place at zero critical intensities. Such OB curves
are unprecedented in the context of conventional gratings and found only in
plasmonic devices and anti-directional couplers. Even though the nonlinearity
is inhomogeneous, the ramp-like first stable states persist in the broken
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime giving an additional indication that the broken
PTFBG is closely associated with the plasmonic structures. In the existing
PTFBG systems, the switching intensities are relatively higher in the broken
regime. However, the proposed system records the lowest switching intensities
in the broken regime. The reported intensities ($< 0.005$) are also the lowest
ever-switching intensities recorded in the perspective of PTFBGs to date.

  The stability of feature selection can be improved with the use of feature
selection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple base feature
selectors. A threshold must be applied to the final aggregated feature set to
separate the relevant features from the redundant ones. A fixed threshold,

instance, calibration of input noise covariance matrix in augmented or dual
Kalman filters is a critical task since a slight variation in its value can
adversely affect estimations. The present study develops a Bayesian
Expectation-Maximization (BEM) methodology for the uncertainty quantification
and propagation in coupled input-state-parameter-noise identification problems.
It also proposes the incorporation of input dummy observations for stabilizing
low-frequency components of the latent states and mitigating potential drifts.
In this respect, the covariance matrix of the dummy observations is also
calibrated based on the measured data. Additionally, an explicit formulation is
provided to study the theoretical observability of the Bayesian estimators,
which helps characterize the minimum sensor requirements. Ultimately, the BEM
is tested and verified through numerical and experimental examples, wherein
sensor configurations, multiple input forces, and abrupt stiffness changes are
investigated. It is confirmed that the BEM provides accurate estimations of
states, input, and parameters while characterizing the degree of belief in
these estimations based on the posterior uncertainties driven by applying a
Bayesian perspective.

research and space weather forecasting since they can observe both the solar

indispensable to remove the instrumental non-uniformity of a solar EUV imager
in producing high-quality scientific data from original observed data.
Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) is a meteorological satellite operated in Sun-synchronous
orbit, and the routine EUV imaging data from the Solar X-ray and Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) onboard FY-3E has the characteristics of concentric
rotation. Taking advantage of the concentric rotation, we propose a post-hoc
flat field measurement method for its EUV 195 channel in this paper. This
method removes small-scale and time-varying component of the coronal activities
by taking the median value for each pixel along the time axis of a concentric
rotation data cube, and then derives large-scale and invariable component of
the quiet coronal radiation, and finally generates a flat field image. Analysis
shows that our method is able to measure the instrumental spot-like
non-uniformity possibly caused by contamination on the detector, which mostly
disappears after the in-orbit self-cleaning process. It can also measure the
quasi-periodic grid-like non-uniformity, possibly from the obscuration of the
support mesh on the rear filter. After flat field correction, these
instrumental non-uniformities from the original data are effectively removed.
X-EUVI 195 data after dark and flat field corrections are consistent with the
193 channel data from SDO/AIA, verifying the suitability of the method. Our
method is not only suitable for FY-3E/X-EUVI but also a candidate method for
the flat field measurement of future solar EUV telescopes.

universal WaveGAN model for extracting latent distribution $p(z)$ of speech and
reconstructing waveform from it. Then a flow-based acoustic model only needs to
learn the same $p(z)$ from texts, which naturally avoids the mismatch between
the acoustic model and the vocoder, resulting in high-quality generated speech
without model fine-tuning. Based on a continuous speaker space and the
reversible property of flows, the conditional distribution can be obtained for
any speaker, and thus we can further conduct high-quality zero-shot speech
generation for new speakers. We particularly investigate two methods to
construct the speaker space, namely pre-trained speaker encoder and

requires a reliable library detection technique. Especially when a new
vulnerability (or a privacy-invasive behavior) was discovered in a third-party
library, there is a practical need to precisely identify the existence of
libraries and their versions for iOS apps. However, few studies have been
proposed to tackle this problem, and they all suffer from the code duplication
problem in different libraries. In this paper, we focus on third-party library
detection in iOS apps. Given an app, we aim to identify the integrated
libraries and pinpoint their versions (or the version range).To this end, we
first conduct an in-depth study on iOS third-party libraries to demystify the
code duplication challenge. By doing so, we have two key observations: 1) even
though two libraries can share classes, the shared classes cannot be integrated
into an app simultaneously without causing a class name conflict; and 2) code
duplication between multiple versions of two libraries can vary. Based on these
findings, we propose a novel profile-based similarity comparison approach to
perform the detection. Specifically, we build a library database consists of
original library binaries with distinct versions. After extracting profiles for
each library version and the target app, we conduct a similarity comparison to
find the best matches. We implemented this approach in iLibScope. We built a
benchmark consists of 5,807 apps with 10,495 library integrations and applied
our tool to it. Our evaluation shows that iLibScope achieves a recall exceeds
99% and a precision exceeds 97% for library detection. We also applied
iLibScope to detect the presence of well-known vulnerable third-party libraries

tackle new challenges in order to meet the requirements of emerging

optimized, including the channel and the surrounding environment, as it is no
longer sufficient to control the transmitter and/or the receiver only.
Investigating large intelligent surfaces, ultra massive multiple-input
multiple-output, and smart constructive environments will contribute to this
direction. In addition, to allow the exchange of high dimensional sensing data
between connected intelligent devices, semantic and goal oriented
communications need to be considered for a more efficient and context-aware
information encoding. In particular, for multi-agent systems, where agents are
collaborating together to achieve a complex task, emergent communications,
instead of hard coded communications, can be learned for more efficient task
execution and communication resources use. Moreover, new physics phenomenon
should be exploited such as the thermodynamics of communication as well as the
the interaction between information theory and electromagnetism to better
understand the physical limitations of different technologies, e.g, holographic
communications. Another new communication paradigm is to consider the
end-to-end approach instead of block-by-block optimization, which requires
exploiting machine learning theory, non-linear signal processing theory, and
non-coherent communications theory. Within this context, we identify twelve

where I/O requests typically transfers through multiple hefty and redundant
layers. The complexity of object management has grown dramatically with the
ever increasing requirements of performance, consistency and fault-tolerance
from storage subsystems. Simply stated, more number of intermediate layers are
encountered in the I/O data path, with each passing layer adding its own syntax
and semantics. Thereby increasing the overheads of request processing. In this
paper, through comprehensive under-the-hood analysis of an object-storage node,
we characterize the impact of object-store (and user-application) workloads on
the OS I/O stack and its subsequent rippling effect on the underlying
object-storage devices (OSD). We observe that the legacy architecture of the OS
based I/O storage stack coupled with complex data management policies leads to
a performance mismatch between what an end-storage device is capable of
delivering and what it actually delivers in a production environment.
Therefore, the gains derived from developing faster storage devices is often
nullified. These issues get more pronounced in highly concurrent and
multiplexed cloud environments. Owing to the associated issues of
object-management and the vulnerabilities of the OS I/O software stacks, we
discuss the potential of a new class of storage devices, known as
Object-Drives. Samsung Key-Value SSD (KV-SSD) [1] and Seagate Kinetic Drive [2]
are classic industrial implementations of object-drives, where host data
management functionalities can be offloaded to the storage device. This leads
towards the simplification of the over-all storage stack. Based on our
analysis, we believe object-drives can alleviate object-stores from highly
taxing overheads of data management with 20-38% time-savings over traditional
Operating Systems (OS) stack.

condensates into an all-optical triangular vortex lattice with each cell

appearing in the triangular graph of three condensates. Furthermore, we
demonstrate emergence of frustrated phases of driven-dissipative large-scale

selecting patient-representative templates together with a novel dynamic time
warping algorithm to infer the morphology of event-based sampled heartbeats.
  Methods: We acquire a set of uniformly sampled heartbeats and use a
graph-based clustering algorithm to define representative templates for the
patient. Then, for each event-based sampled heartbeat, we select the
morphologically nearest template, and we then reconstruct the heartbeat with
piece-wise linear deformations of the selected template, according to a novel
dynamic time warping algorithm that matches events to template segments.
  Results: Synthetic tests on a standard normal sinus rhythm dataset, composed
of approximately 1.8 million normal heartbeats, show a big leap in performance
with respect to standard resampling techniques. In particular (when compared to
classic linear resampling), we show an improvement in P-wave detection of up to

deposited layer stack demonstrates the possibility of including ultrathin
ferroelectric AlScN into all-epitaxial GaN-based devices using sputter

The passing over the EP leads to a phase transition, which endows the system
with unconventional features that find a wide range of applications. However,
the need of using the dissipation and amplification limits the possible
applications of systems with the EP. In this work, we demonstrate an existence
of signature of exceptional point phase transition in Hermitian systems that
are free from dissipation and amplification. We consider a composite Hermitian
system including both two coupled oscillators and their environment consisting
only of several tens of degrees of freedom. We show that the dynamics of such a
Hermitian system demonstrate a transition, which occurs at the coupling
strength between oscillators corresponding to the EP in the non-Hermitian

the system dynamics in which collapses and revivals of the energy occur. Thus,
we demonstrate that the phase transition occurring at the passing over the EP

detecting magnetic fields at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths using high resolution

wind resonance lines not available in the visible, but they can also provide
many photospheric lines in hot stars. Detecting photospheric magnetic fields
using the Zeeman effect and Least Squares Deconvolution is potentially more
effective in the UV due to the much higher density of strong lines. We
investigate detecting magnetic fields in the magnetosphere of a star using the
Zeeman effect in wind lines, and find that this could be detectable at high S/N
in an O or B star with a strong magnetic field. We consider detecting magnetic
fields using the Hanle effect in linear polarization, which is complementary to
the Zeeman effect, and could be more sensitive in photospheric lines of rapid
rotators. The Hanle effect can also be used to infer circumstellar magnetism in
winds. Detecting the Hanle effect requires UV observations, and a multi-line
approach is key for inferring magnetic field properties. This demonstrates that
high resolution spectropolarimetry in the UV, and the proposed Polstar mission,

in the context of scene understanding. Despite the growing progress on
benchmarks, we realize that existing methods often perform unsatisfactorily on
distant interactions, where the leading causes are two-fold: 1) Distant
interactions are by nature more difficult to recognize than close ones. A
natural scene often involves multiple humans and objects with intricate spatial
relations, making the interaction recognition for distant human-object largely
affected by complex visual context. 2) Insufficient number of distant
interactions in benchmark datasets results in under-fitting on these instances.
To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method
for better handling distant interactions in HOI detection. One essential
component in our method is a novel Far Near Distance Attention module. It
enables information propagation between humans and objects, whereby the spatial
distance is skillfully taken into consideration. Besides, we devise a novel
Distance-Aware loss function which leads the model to focus more on distant yet
rare interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging datasets

problem for a nonlocal heat equation with a nonlinear convection term. The
diffusion operator is the infinitesimal generator of a stable L\'evy process,
which may be highly anisotropic. The initial data are assumed to be bounded and
integrable. The mass of the solution is conserved along the evolution, and the
large-time behaviour is given by the source-type solution with this mass of a
limit equation that depends on the relative strength of convection and
diffusion. When diffusion is stronger than convection the original equation
simplifies asymptotically to the purely diffusive nonlocal heat equation. When
convection dominates, it does so only in the direction of convection, and the
limit equation is still diffusive in the subspace orthogonal to this direction,
with a diffusion operator that is a ""projection"" of the original one onto the
subspace. The determination of this projection is one of the main issues of the
paper. When convection and diffusion are of the same order the limit equation
coincides with the original one. Most of our results are new even in the
isotropic case in which the diffusion operator is the fractional Laplacian. We
assume in principle that the convection nonlinearity is locally Lipschitz, but
we are also able to cover some situations in which it is only locally H\""older.
This possibility has never been considered before in the nonlocal diffusion

bulk properties, as well as the role of the finite size contributions. For the
bulk properties, the density and isospin dependencies of the nuclear
incompressibility in infinite matter are characterized by introducing new
empirical parameters, and two new constraints for the value of $K_{sym}$ are
suggested. For finite nuclei, we employ a Bayesian approach coupled to a
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) exploration of the parameter space to confront
the model predictions of $K_A$ in Zr, Sn and Pb isotopes to the experimental
data. We show that $Q_{sat}\approx -950\pm 200$~MeV describes the experimental
measurements of $K_A$ in these isotopes. This value is different from the ones
deduced from phenomenological nuclear energy density functionals, suggesting a
possible explanation of their difficulty to accurately describe Zr, Sn and Pb

this measurement, provided it is accurate enough, will allow to better

labels. To identify such unseen labels, multi-label zero-shot learning (ML-ZSL)
focuses on transferring knowledge by a pre-trained textual label embedding
(e.g., GloVe). However, such methods only exploit single-modal knowledge from a
language model, while ignoring the rich semantic information inherent in
image-text pairs. Instead, recently developed open-vocabulary (OV) based
methods succeed in exploiting such information of image-text pairs in object
detection, and achieve impressive performance. Inspired by the success of
OV-based methods, we propose a novel open-vocabulary framework, named
multi-modal knowledge transfer (MKT), for multi-label classification.
Specifically, our method exploits multi-modal knowledge of image-text pairs
based on a vision and language pre-training (VLP) model. To facilitate
transferring the image-text matching ability of VLP model, knowledge
distillation is employed to guarantee the consistency of image and label
embeddings, along with prompt tuning to further update the label embeddings. To
further enable the recognition of multiple objects, a simple but effective
two-stream module is developed to capture both local and global features.
Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets. The source code is

electronic states in both layers. However, the connection between the

filling is effective in determining the magnetic moments. This unusual behavior
stems from the unique chemical and magnetic nature of Cr atoms and is
essentially due to the localized and transferred itinerant electrons. Our study

allowing members to learn and adapt as the work progresses.
  Advice on teamwork is abundant. For example, the Google re:Work model offers

areas require reliable high certainty predictions. For this purpose, the system
can be extended by an reject option which allows the system to reject inputs
where only a prediction with an unacceptably low certainty would be possible.
While being able to reject uncertain samples is important, it is also of
importance to be able to explain why a particular sample was rejected. With the
ongoing rise of eXplainable AI (XAI), a lot of explanation methodologies for
machine learning based systems have been developed -- explaining reject
options, however, is still a novel field where only very little prior work
exists.
  In this work, we propose to explain rejects by semifactual explanations, an
instance of example-based explanation methods, which them self have not been
widely considered in the XAI community yet. We propose a conceptual modeling of
semifactual explanations for arbitrary reject options and empirically evaluate
a specific implementation on a conformal prediction based reject option.

  The first main result in this paper is the construction of semiorthogonal

  We next construct explicit objects of quasi-BPS categories via Koszul duality
equivalences, and show that they form a basis in the torus localized K-theory.
These computations may be regarded as a numerical K-theoretic analogue in
dimension three of the McKay correspondence for Hilbert schemes of points. In
particular, the torus localized K-theory of DT categories has a basis whose
cardinality is the number of plane partitions, giving a K-theoretic analogue of
MacMahon's formula. We also study the topological K-theory of DT categories and
prove similar results as above.

the Yang-Rice-Zhang ansatz for cuprates [P. W. Phillips, L. Yeo and E. W.

Coulomb repulsion in the Hubbard model, the repulsive interaction in the HK
model divides the momentum space into three parts: empty, single-occupied and
double-occupied regions, that are separated from each other by two distinct
Fermi surfaces. In the presence of an additional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS)-type pairing interaction of a moderate strength, we show that the system
exhibits a ""two-stage superconductivity"" feature as temperature decreases: a
first-order superconducting transition occurs at a temperature $T_{\rm c}$ that
is followed by a sudden increase of the superconducting order parameter at a
lower temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\prime}<T_{\rm c}$. At the first stage, $T_{\rm
c}^{\prime}<T<T_{\rm c}$, the pairing function arises and the entropy is
released only in the vicinity of the two Fermi surfaces; while at the second
stage, $T<T_{\rm c}^{\prime}$, the pairing function becomes significant and the
entropy is further released in deep (single-occupied) region in the Fermi sea.

We divide this problem into three tasks: strongly constrained translation,

constraint here indicates the extent to which the content or semantic

have achieved good performance in weakly constrained tasks, they failed to
fully preserve the content in both strongly and normally constrained tasks,
including photo-realism synthesis, style transfer, and colorization, etc. To
achieve content-preserving transfer in strongly constrained and normally

consists of normalizing flows and a novel Style-Aware Normalization (SAN)
module. With the invertible network structure, StyleFlow first projects input
images into deep feature space in the forward pass, while the backward pass
utilizes the SAN module to perform content-fixed feature transformation and
then projects back to image space. Our model supports both image-guided

well-known problem. Most of the existing automated sleep scoring systems are
trained using labels annotated by a single scorer, whose subjective evaluation
is transferred to the model. When annotations from two or more scorers are
available, the scoring models are usually trained on the scorer consensus. The
averaged scorer's subjectivity is transferred into the model, losing
information about the internal variability among different scorers. In this
study, we aim to insert the multiple-knowledge of the different physicians into
the training procedure. The goal is to optimize a model training, exploiting
the full information that can be extracted from the consensus of a group of
scorers.
  Methods: We train two lightweight deep learning based models on three
different multi-scored databases. We exploit the label smoothing technique
together with a soft-consensus (LSSC) distribution to insert the
multiple-knowledge in the training procedure of the model. We introduce the
averaged cosine similarity metric (ACS) to quantify the similarity between the
hypnodensity-graph generated by the models with-LSSC and the hypnodensity-graph
generated by the scorer consensus.
  Results: The performance of the models improves on all the databases when we
train the models with our LSSC. We found an increase in ACS (up to 6.4%)
between the hypnodensity-graph generated by the models trained with-LSSC and
the hypnodensity-graph generated by the consensus.
  Conclusion: Our approach definitely enables a model to better adapt to the
consensus of the group of scorers. Future work will focus on further
investigations on different scoring architectures and hopefully
large-scale-heterogeneous multi-scored datasets.

first disentangle latent features from the classifier, followed by aligning
these features to observed/human-defined `context' features. These aligned

causal graph depicting the `perceived' data-generating process, describing the
inter- and intra-feature interactions between unobserved latent features and
observed `context' features. This causal graph serves as a global model from
which local explanations of different forms can be extracted. Specifically, we
provide a generator to visualize the `effect' of interactions among features in
latent space and draw feature importance therefrom as local explanations. Our
framework utilizes adversarial knowledge distillation to faithfully learn a
representation from the classifiers' latent space and use it for extracting
visual explanations. We use the styleGAN-v2 architecture with an additional

To cover the full range of field strengths, we allow for a small coupling with

strengths close to half of the gap while lowering it at the gap resonance as

(EL), in order to associate each cell value to a real-world entity in a
Knowledge Base (KB). In this work, we focus on end-to-end solutions for EL on
tabular data that do not rely on fact lookup in the target KB. Tabular data
contains heterogeneous and sparse context, including column headers, cell
values and table captions. We experiment with various models to generate a
vector representation for each cell value to be linked. Our results show that
it is critical to apply an attention mechanism as well as an attention mask, so
that the model can only attend to the most relevant context and avoid
information dilution. The most relevant context includes: same-row cells,
same-column cells, headers and caption. Computational complexity, however,
grows quadratically with the size of tabular data for such a complex model. We
achieve constant memory usage by introducing a Tabular Entity Linking Lite

value, the table headers and the table caption. TELL achieves 80.8% accuracy on
Wikipedia tables, which is only 0.1% lower than the state-of-the-art model with

transmission capacities that enable transactions between market participants of
different countries are limited. Starting from two reduced-form representations

matched with standing volumes of the foreign market, resulting in cross-border
trades. Since the transmission capacities in our model are limited, our model
alternates between regimes in which cross-border trades are possible and
regimes in which incoming market orders can only be matched against limit
orders of the same origin. We derive a high-frequency approximation of our
microscopic model, assuming that the size of an individual order converges to
zero while the order arrival rate tends to infinity. If transmission capacities
are available, the limit process behaves as follows: the volume dynamics is a
four-dimensional linear Brownian motion in the positive orthant with oblique
reflection at the axes. Each time two queues simultaneously hit zero, the
process is reinitialized. The capacity turns out to be a continuous process of
finite variation. The analytic tractability of the limiting dynamics allows us
to compute key quantities of interest like the distribution of the duration

previously unaffected software system. They often happen as a result of source
code changes (e.g., a bug fix) and can have severe effects.
  Aims: To increase the understanding of security regressions. This is an
important step in developing secure software engineering.
  Method: We perform an exploratory, mixed-method case study of Mozilla. First,
we analyze 78 regression vulnerabilities and 72 bug reports where a bug fix
introduced a regression vulnerability at Mozilla. We investigate how developers
interact in these bug reports, how they perform the changes, and under what
conditions they introduce regression vulnerabilities. Second, we conduct five
semi-structured interviews with as many Mozilla developers involved in the
vulnerability-inducing bug fixes.
  Results: Software security is not discussed during bug fixes. Developers'
main concerns are the complexity of the bug at hand and the community pressure
to fix it. Moreover, developers do not to worry about regression
vulnerabilities and assume tools will detect them. Indeed, dynamic analysis
tools helped finding around 30% of regression vulnerabilities at Mozilla.
  Conclusions: These results provide evidence that, although tool support helps
identify regression vulnerabilities, it may not be enough to ensure security
during bug fixes. Furthermore, our results call for further work on the
security tooling support and how to integrate them during bug fixes.

conceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the

of plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the
semantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the
performance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form
distances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for
CCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which
a given word's own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories
according to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on
high-level abstraction. We see that what has often been conceived of as a
highly abstract concept, [+plural], is better captured via a family of

operation frequencies is, among other errors, limited by electrons tunnelling
in the wrong direction. Increasing the barrier transparency between the island
and the leads, and the source-drain bias helps to suppress these events in a
larger frequency range, although they lead to some additional errors. We
experimentally demonstrate a driving scheme that suppresses tunnelling in the
wrong direction hence extending the range of frequencies for generating
accurate single-electron currents. The main feature of this approach is an
additional AC signal applied to the bias with twice the frequency as the one
applied to the gate electrode. This allows additional modulation of the island
chemical potential. By using the new approach under certain parameters, we
improve the single-electron current accuracy by one order of magnitude.
Finally, we show through experimentally-contrasted calculations that our method
can improve accuracy even in devices for which the usual gate driving gives
errors $\sim 10^{-3}$ at high frequencies and can bring them under $5\times
10^{-4}$.

namely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily
incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former
component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the
presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states
potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then
learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both
stationary and non-stationary environments and across different actor-critic
backbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the
learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with
those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.

relation between features of a natural speech signal and the corresponding

regression tasks. Either EEG is predicted, or speech is reconstructed, and the
correlation between predicted and actual signal is used to measure the brain's
decoding ability. However, given the nonlinear nature of the brain, the
modeling ability of linear models is limited. Recent studies introduced
nonlinear models to relate the speech envelope to EEG. We set out to include
other features of speech that are not coded in the envelope, notably the
fundamental frequency of the voice (f0). F0 is a higher-frequency feature
primarily coded at the brainstem to midbrain level. We present a
dilated-convolutional model to provide evidence of neural tracking of the f0.
We show that a combination of f0 and the speech envelope improves the
performance of a state-of-the-art envelope-based model. This suggests the
dilated-convolutional model can extract non-redundant information from both f0

to generalize to subjects not included during training. This latter finding
will accelerate f0-based hearing diagnosis.

detected by Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). Two flaring activities were
observed in the two scans of $\sim 3$ hours apart, where the 2-10 keV flux
reached $5\times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. During the period, the source
exhibited a large spectral change suggesting that the absorption column density
$N_\mathrm{H}$ increased from $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.
NuSTAR follow-up observation on January 29 identified a new X-ray source with a
flux of $6\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the position consistent
with LY CMa, which has been identified as B supergiant as well as Be star,
located at the 3 kpc distance. The observed X-ray activity characterized by the
short ($\lesssim$ several hours) duration, the rapid ($\lesssim$ a few seconds)
variabilities accompanied with spectral changes, and the large luminosity swing
($10^{32}$-$10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) agree with those of SFXT. On the other hand,
optical spectroscopic observations of LY CMa revealed a broad $H\alpha$
emission line, which may indicate the existence of a Be circumstellar disk.
These obtained results suggest that the optical companion, LY CMa, certainly
has a complex circumstellar medium including dense clumps.

introduced by the regularization. In addition, we found that GN can only help
the neural network training in some specific period, unlike BN, which helps the
network throughout the training. To solve these issues, we propose a new
normalization layer built on top of GN, by incorporating the advantages of BN.
Experimental results on the image classification task demonstrated that the
proposed normalization layer outperforms the official GN to improve recognition
accuracy regardless of the batch sizes and stabilize the network training.

self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been proposed to harvest their
latent spatio-temporal representations for task-specific training, practical
challenges including privacy concerns and communication costs prevent SSL from
being deployed at large scales. To mitigate these issues, we propose the use of
Federated Learning (FL) to the task of video SSL. In this work, we evaluate the
performance of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) video-SSL techniques and
identify their shortcomings when integrated into the large-scale FL setting
simulated with kinetics-400 dataset. We follow by proposing a novel federated
SSL framework for video, dubbed FedVSSL, that integrates different aggregation
strategies and partial weight updating. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and significance of FedVSSL as it outperforms the centralized
SOTA for the downstream retrieval task by 6.66% on UCF-101 and 5.13% on
HMDB-51.

use the PLUTO code to solve the fully compressive, resistive MHD equations for
a 2D magnetic X-point. Using wave pulses with a wide range of amplitudes, we
perform a parameter study to obtain values for the period, considering the
presence and absence of anisotropic thermal conduction separately. In both

initial perturbation. The addition of anisotropic thermal conduction only leads
to an increase in the mean value for the period, in agreement with our previous

oscillation period matching the independent trend previously mentioned. Thus,
we report for the first time on the independence between the type and strength

participating peers, who cooperatively build a machine learning (ML) model
while keeping their private data in their devices. However, that same autonomy
opens the door for malicious peers to poison the model by conducting either
untargeted or targeted poisoning attacks. The label-flipping (LF) attack is a
targeted poisoning attack where the attackers poison their training data by
flipping the labels of some examples from one class (i.e., the source class) to
another (i.e., the target class). Unfortunately, this attack is easy to perform
and hard to detect and it negatively impacts on the performance of the global
model. Existing defenses against LF are limited by assumptions on the
distribution of the peers' data and/or do not perform well with
high-dimensional models. In this paper, we deeply investigate the LF attack
behavior and find that the contradicting objectives of attackers and honest
peers on the source class examples are reflected in the parameter gradients
corresponding to the neurons of the source and target classes in the output
layer, making those gradients good discriminative features for the attack
detection. Accordingly, we propose a novel defense that first dynamically
extracts those gradients from the peers' local updates, and then clusters the
extracted gradients, analyzes the resulting clusters and filters out potential
bad updates before model aggregation. Extensive empirical analysis on three
data sets shows the proposed defense's effectiveness against the LF attack
regardless of the data distribution or model dimensionality. Also, the proposed
defense outperforms several state-of-the-art defenses by offering lower test
error, higher overall accuracy, higher source class accuracy, lower attack
success rate, and higher stability of the source class accuracy.

to many strategies in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications,
such as the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Therefore,
plenty of efficient channel covariance matrix estimation schemes have been
proposed in the literature. However, an abrupt change in the channel covariance
matrix may happen occasionally in practice due to the change in the scattering
environment and the user location. Our paper aims to adopt the classic change
detection theory to detect the change in the channel covariance matrix as
accurately and quickly as possible such that the new covariance matrix can be
re-estimated in time. Specifically, this paper first considers the technique of
on-line change detection (also known as quickest/sequential change detection),
where we need to detect whether a change in the channel covariance matrix
occurs at each channel coherence time interval. Next, because the complexity of
detecting the change in a high-dimension covariance matrix at each coherence
time interval is too high, we devise a low-complexity off-line strategy in
massive MIMO systems, where change detection is merely performed at the last
channel coherence time interval of a given time period. Numerical results show
that our proposed on-line and off-line schemes can detect the channel
covariance change with a small delay and a low false alarm rate. Therefore, our
paper theoretically and numerically verifies the feasibility of detecting the
channel covariance change accurately and quickly in practice.

hindering the model to learn general representations to achieve open-vocabulary

of open-vocabulary 3D point-cloud detection. Instead of seeking a point-cloud
dataset with full labels, we resort to ImageNet1K to broaden the vocabulary of
the point-cloud detector. We propose OV-3DETIC, an Open-Vocabulary 3D DETector

upper back is unsupported, as this stimulates active postural control. We
developed an experimental methodology to evaluate 3D vibration transmission
from compliant seats to the human body. Wide-band (0.1-12 Hz) motion stimuli
were applied in fore-aft, lateral and vertical direction to evaluate the
translational and rotational body response in pelvis, trunk and head. A
standard car seat was equipped with a configurable and compliant back support
to test 3 support heights and 3 sitting postures (erect, slouched, and
preferred) where we also tested head down looking at a smartphone. Seat back
support height and sitting posture substantially affected vibration
transmission and affected low-frequency responses in particular for body
segment rotation. According to our hypothesis a low support height proved
beneficial in reducing head motion. Relevance to industry: Our methodology
effectively evaluates 3D wide-band vibration transmission from compliant seats
to the human body. The lowest back support height reduced head motion but was
perceived as least comfortable. This calls for seat designs which support but
do not so much constrain the upper back. The head down posture enlarged head
motion, pleading for computer system integration allowing heads up postures in
future automated cars. The biomechanical data will serve to validate human

that for $\eta \lesssim 0.05$ the accretion threshold is reached and clumps
which originate by instabilities are accreted onto the secondary. For each
value of $\eta$ we calculate the mass accretion rate and identify different

ownership verification, with two other classes of ML protection mechanisms:
differentially private training, and robustness against model evasion. We find
that several pairwise interactions result in conflicts. We explore potential

hyperparameter relaxations, finding that there is no sweet spot balancing the
performance of both protection mechanisms. Second, we explore if modifying one

approach can avoid the conflict between ownership verification mechanisms when

learning the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and estimation is
performed with Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). An extensive parameter
selection framework enables us to objectively select the model hyper-parameters
and prevents overfitting. The final model behavior is optimized with a cost
function balancing between accuracy and smoothness. Naturalistic driving data
covering seven participants is obtained using a static driving simulator at
Toyota Motor Europe for the training, evaluation, and testing of the proposed
model. The results demonstrate that our approach achieved a 92% steering torque
accuracy with a 37% increase in signal smoothness and 90% fewer data compared
to a baseline. In addition, our model captures the complex and nonlinear human
behavior and inter-driver variability from novice to expert drivers, showing an
interesting potential to become a steering performance predictor in future
user-oriented ADAS.

protein that have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.
Over recent decades the molecular dynamics of prions have been characterized
both empirically and through mathematical models, providing insights into the
epidemiology of prion diseases, and the impact of prions on the evolution of
cellular processes. At the same time, a variety of evidence indicates that
prions are themselves capable of a form of evolution, in which changes to their
structure that impact their rate of growth or fragmentation are replicated,
making such changes subject to natural selection. Here we study the role of
such selection in shaping the characteristics of prions under the nucleated
polymerization model (NPM). We show that fragmentation rates evolve to an
evolutionary stable value which balances rapid reproduction of $PrP^{Sc}$
aggregates with the need to produce stable polymers. We further show that this
evolved fragmentation rate differs in general from the rate that optimizes
transmission between cells. We find that under the NPM, prions that are both

  Report)","Extended version of paper accepted at CONCUR 2022. This version fixes
  a missing condition in fairness",,,,"cs.PL cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Session types enable the specification and verification of communicating
systems. However, their theory often assumes that processes never fail. To
address this limitation, we present a generalised multiparty session type
(MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes can crash arbitrarily.
  Our new theory validates more protocols and processes w.r.t. previous work.
We apply minimal syntactic changes to standard session {\pi}-calculus and
types: we model crashes and their handling semantically, with a generalised
MPST typing system parametric on a behavioural safety property. We cover the
spectrum between fully reliable and fully unreliable sessions, via optional
reliability assumptions, and prove type safety and protocol conformance in the
presence of crash-stop failures.
  Introducing crash-stop failures has non-trivial consequences: writing correct
processes that handle all crash scenarios can be difficult. Yet, our
generalised MPST theory allows us to tame this complexity, via model checking,
to validate whether a multiparty session satisfies desired behavioural
properties, e.g. deadlock-freedom or liveness, even in presence of crashes. We
implement our approach using the mCRL2 model checker, and evaluate it with
examples extended from the literature.

molecular magnets, and has been extensively studied theoretically and
experimentally. Dissipation due to coupling between the system and environment
is an important factor in determining the transition rates. Here we report
experimental results on the dissipative LZ transition. Using a tunable
superconducting flux qubit, we observe for the first time the crossover from
weak to strong coupling to the environment. The weak coupling limit corresponds
to small system-environment coupling and leads to environment-induced
thermalization. In the strong coupling limit, environmental excitations dress
the system and transitions occur between the dressed states. Our results
confirm previous theoretical studies of dissipative LZ tunneling in the weak
and strong coupling limits. Our results for the intermediate regime are novel
and could stimulate further theoretical development of open system dynamics.
This work provides insight into the role of open system effects on quantum

Therefore, when calculating the angular distribution,we only need to know the

symmetry of physical processes, such as parity and time inversion

obtained by helicity method. In addition, we also introduce the density matrix
to study the polarization of the final state particles, and discuss some
inherent symmetries of the density matrix. When we study the polarization and
angular distribution of final state particles, we can use these properties to
simplify density matrix without knowing all the elements of the density

states and their internal quantum structure by solving the trion Schr\""odinger
equation. Transforming the system into a trion basis and solving equations of
motion, including the trion-phonon interaction within the second-order
Born-Markov approximation, provides a microscopic access to the trion dynamics.
In particular, we investigate trion propagation and compute the diffusion
coefficient and mobility. In the low density limit, we find that trions
propagate less efficiently than excitons and electrons due to their stronger
coupling with phonons and their larger mass. For increasing densities, we
predict a drastic enhancement of diffusion caused by the build-up of a large
pressure by the degenerate trion gas, which is a direct consequence of the
fermionic character of trions. Our work provides microscopic insights into the
trion-phonon interaction and its impact on the diffusion behaviour in
atomically thin semiconductors.

correlation function, whose scaling exponents cannot be determined by only
using the dimensional analysis based on the Kolmogorov's phenomenology. As a
result, the scaling laws of the correlation function can depend on the initial
separation. This initial-separation dependency is frequently observed in
laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations of the relative
dispersion, which is directly related to the correlation function, at moderate
Reynolds numbers. We numerically verify the self-similar form by direct
numerical simulations of two-dimensional energy inverse-cascade turbulence. The
involved scaling exponents and the dependencies on finite Reynolds number
effects are determined empirically. Then, we consider implication of the
scaling laws of the correlation function on the relative dispersion, i.e. the
Richardson-Obukhov $t^3$ law. Our results suggest a possibility not to recover

  Correlation Coefficient","Accepted in NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge distillation(KD) is a widely-used technique to train compact models
in object detection. However, there is still a lack of study on how to distill
between heterogeneous detectors. In this paper, we empirically find that better
FPN features from a heterogeneous teacher detector can help the student
although their detection heads and label assignments are different. However,
directly aligning the feature maps to distill detectors suffers from two
problems. First, the difference in feature magnitude between the teacher and
the student could enforce overly strict constraints on the student. Second, the
FPN stages and channels with large feature magnitude from the teacher model
could dominate the gradient of distillation loss, which will overwhelm the
effects of other features in KD and introduce much noise. To address the above
issues, we propose to imitate features with Pearson Correlation Coefficient to
focus on the relational information from the teacher and relax constraints on
the magnitude of the features. Our method consistently outperforms the existing
detection KD methods and works for both homogeneous and heterogeneous
student-teacher pairs. Furthermore, it converges faster. With a powerful
MaskRCNN-Swin detector as the teacher, ResNet-50 based RetinaNet and FCOS
achieve 41.5% and 43.9% mAP on COCO2017, which are 4.1\% and 4.8\% higher than

Probing the carbon-rich region is relevant because it forms during the

computation capacities and features of mobile users by offloading complex
computation tasks to the edge servers. However, mobility poses great challenges
on delivering reliable MEC service required for latency-critical applications.
First, mobility management has to tackle the dynamics of both user's location
changes and task arrivals that vary in different timescales. Second, user
mobility could induce service migration, leading to reliability loss due to the
migration delay. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale mobility management
framework by joint control of service migration and transmission power to
address the above challenges. Specifically, the service migration operates at a
large timescale to support user mobility in the multi-cell network, while the
power control is performed at a small timescale for real-time task offloading.
Their joint control is formulated as an optimization problem aiming at the
long-term mobile energy minimization subject to the reliability requirement of
computation offloading. To solve the problem, we propose a Lyapunov-based
framework to decompose the problem into different timescales, based on which a
low-complexity two-timescale online algorithm is developed by exploiting the
problem structure. The proposed online algorithm is shown to be asymptotically
optimal via theoretical analysis, and is further developed to accommodate the
multiuser management. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm can significantly improve the energy and reliability performance.

precursor to both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Advances in machine
learning (ML) aim to increase diagnostic efficiency by replacing a single
application with generalized algorithms. The goal of unsupervised anomaly
detection (UAD) is to identify potential anomalous regions unseen during
training, where convolutional neural network (CNN) based autoencoders (AEs) and
variational autoencoders (VAEs) are considered a de facto approach for
reconstruction based-anomaly segmentation. The restricted receptive field in
CNNs limits the CNN to model the global context. Hence, if the anomalous
regions cover large parts of the image, the CNN-based AEs are not capable of
bringing a semantic understanding of the image. Meanwhile, vision transformers
(ViTs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to CNNs. It relies on the
self-attention mechanism that can relate image patches to each other. We
investigate in this paper Transformer capabilities in building AEs for the
reconstruction-based UAD task to reconstruct a coherent and more realistic
image. We focus on anomaly segmentation for brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and present five Transformer-based models while enabling segmentation
performance comparable to or superior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The

spatiotemporal correlation functions in quantum and classical spin models. In
the quantum case, our large-scale numerics are based on the concept of quantum
typicality, which exploits the fact that random pure quantum states can
faithfully approximate ensemble averages, allowing the simulation of spin-$1/2$
systems with up to $40$ lattice sites. Due to the exponentially growing Hilbert
space, we find that for such system sizes even a single random state is
sufficient to yield results with extremely low noise that is negligible for
most practical purposes. In contrast, a classical analog of typicality is
missing. In particular, we demonstrate that, in order to obtain data with a
similar level of noise in the classical case, extensive averaging over
classical trajectories is required, no matter how large the system size.
Focusing on (quasi-)one-dimensional spin chains and ladders, we find a
remarkably good agreement between quantum and classical dynamics. This applies
not only to cases where both the quantum and classical model are nonintegrable,
but also to cases where the quantum spin-$1/2$ model is integrable and the
corresponding classical $s\to\infty$ model is not. Our analysis is based on the
comparison of space-time profiles of the spin and energy correlation functions,
where the agreement is found to hold not only in the bulk but also in the tails
of the resulting density distribution. The mean-squared displacement of the
density profiles reflects the nature of emerging hydrodynamics and is found to
exhibit similar scaling for quantum and classical models.

of which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of
proactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by
benefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is
designed to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial
risk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the
level of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance
adaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for
entities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as
an investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of
return when they need it most.
  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they
over-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.
This is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in
climate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but
also outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic
value. This coordinates capital through time and place according to parties'
risk reduction capabilities and financial profiles, while also providing a
diversifying investment return.
  Climate-contingent finance can be generalized to any situation where entities
share exposure to a risk where they lack direct control over whether it occurs
(e.g., climate change, or a natural pandemic), and one type of entity can take
proactive actions to benefit from addressing the effects of the risk if it
occurs (e.g., through innovating on crops that would do well under extreme
climate change or vaccination technology that could address particular viruses)
with funding from another type of entity that seeks a targeted return to
ameliorate the downside.

energy with external field. Their local and global structure was described by
Martinez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov. In this paper we start the development of
a theory of critical measures on higher genus Riemann surfaces, where the
logarithmic energy is replaced by the energy with respect to a bipolar Green's
kernel. We study a max-min problem for the bipolar Green's energy with external
fields Re V where dV is a meromorphic differential. Under reasonable
assumptions the max-min problem has a solution and we show that the
corresponding equilibrium measure is a critical measure in the external field.
In a special genus one situation we are able to show that the critical measure
is supported on maximal trajectories of a meromorphic quadratic differential.
  We are motivated by applications to random lozenge tilings of a hexagon with
periodic weightings. Correlations in these models are expressible in terms of
matrix valued orthogonal polynomials. The matrix orthogonality is interpreted
as (partial) scalar orthogonality on a Riemann surface. The theory of critical
measures will be useful for the asymptotic analysis of a corresponding
Riemann-Hilbert problem as we outline in the paper.

theoretical question: how do initially wide binaries shrink sufficiently
quickly that they are able to merge via gravitational wave (GW) radiation
within a Hubble time? One promising class of answers involves secular driving
of binary eccentricity by some external tidal perturbation. This perturbation
can arise due to the presence of a tertiary point mass, in which case the
system exhibits Lidov-Kozai (LK) dynamics, or it can stem from the tidal field
of the stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. While these secular
tide-driven mechanisms have been studied exhaustively in the case of no GW
emission, when GWs are included the dynamical behavior is still incompletely
understood. In this paper we consider compact object binaries driven to merger
via high eccentricity excitation by (doubly-averaged, test-particle quadrupole
level) cluster tides - which includes LK-driven mergers as a special case - and
include the effects of both general relativistic precession and GW emission. We
provide for the first time an analytical understanding of the different

algebraic identities, and multiple kernels, one expression can be evaluated via
many different algorithms. These algorithms are all mathematically equivalent
(i.e., in exact arithmetic, they all compute the same result), but often differ
noticeably in terms of execution time. When faced with a decision, high-level
languages, libraries, and tools such as Julia, Armadillo, and Linnea choose by
selecting the algorithm that minimises the FLOP count. In this paper, we test
the validity of the FLOP count as a discriminant for dense linear algebra
algorithms, analysing ""anomalies"": problem instances for which the fastest
algorithm does not perform the least number of FLOPs.
  To do so, we focused on relatively simple expressions and analysed when and
why anomalies occurred. We found that anomalies exist and tend to cluster into
large contiguous regions. For one expression anomalies were rare, whereas for
the other they were abundant. We conclude that FLOPs is not a sufficiently
dependable discriminant even when building algorithms with highly optimised
kernels. Plus, most of the anomalies remained as such even after filtering out
the inter-kernel cache effects. We conjecture that combining FLOP counts with
kernel performance models will significantly improve our ability to choose

Input-level dense connections between cascade inputs and outputs, an improved

deep learning networks. An ablation study was performed, where five model
configurations were trained on the NYU fastMRI neuro dataset with an end-to-end
scheme conjunct on four- and eight-fold acceleration. The trained models were
evaluated by comparing their respective structural similarity index measure

  Results: The proposed densely interconnected residual cascading network

improvement of 8% and 11% for four- and eight-fold acceleration, respectively.
For eight-fold acceleration, the model achieved a 23% decrease in the NMSE when

that the optimum, $x^*(\theta)$, is also a function of $\theta$. We propose an
efficient method to compute $x^*(\theta)$ and its statistics. We use a chaos
expansion of $x^*(\theta)$ along a truncated basis and study a restarted
subgradient method that compute the optimal coefficients. We establish the
convergence rate of the method as the number of basis functions increases, and
hence the dimensionality of the optimization problem is increased.
  We give a non-asymptotic convergence rate for subgradient descent, building
on earlier work that looked at gradient and accelerated gradient descent.
Additionally, this work explicitly deals with the issue of projections, and
suggests a method to deal with non-trivial projections. We show how this
algorithm can be used to quantify uncertainty in discrete problems by utilising
the (convex) Lovasz Extension for the min s,t-cut graph problem.

methods have shown promising performance on both effectiveness and efficiency
for solving the IP problem. However, we observed that a large fraction of
variables solved by some iterative approximate methods fluctuate around their
final converged discrete states in very long iterations. Inspired by this
observation, we aim to accelerate these approximate methods by early fixing
these fluctuated variables to their converged states while not significantly
harming the solution accuracy. To this end, we propose an early fixing
framework along with the approximate method. We formulate the whole early
fixing process as a Markov decision process, and train it using imitation
learning. A policy network will evaluate the posterior probability of each free
variable concerning its discrete candidate states in each block of iterations.
Specifically, we adopt the powerful multi-headed attention mechanism in the
policy network. Extensive experiments on our proposed early fixing framework
are conducted to three different IP applications: constrained linear
programming, MRF energy minimization and sparse adversarial attack. The former
one is linear IP problem, while the latter two are quadratic IP problems. We
extend the problem scale from regular size to significantly large size. The
extensive experiments reveal the competitiveness of our early fixing framework:
the runtime speeds up significantly, while the solution quality does not
degrade much, even in some cases it is available to obtain better solutions.
Our proposed early fixing framework can be regarded as an acceleration
extension of ADMM methods for solving integer programming. The source codes are

incorporates the idea of pre-trained transformers as universal compute engines

small datasets without overfitting. In addition, CASHformer models cognitive
decline to reveal AD atrophy patterns in the temporal sequence. Our results
show that CASHformer reduces the reconstruction error by 73% compared to

critical part of their safe deployment. Recent work has proposed a variety of
complexity measures that directly predict or theoretically bound the

of assumptions that in practice are not always satisfied. Motivated by the
limited settings in which existing measures can be applied, we propose a novel
complexity measure based on the local manifold smoothness of a classifier. We
define local manifold smoothness as a classifier's output sensitivity to
perturbations in the manifold neighborhood around a given test point.
Intuitively, a classifier that is less sensitive to these perturbations should
generalize better. To estimate smoothness we sample points using data
augmentation and measure the fraction of these points classified into the
majority class. Our method only requires selecting a data augmentation method
and makes no other assumptions about the model or data distributions, meaning
it can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods
cannot. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification,
sentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and
robust correlation between our manifold smoothness measure and actual OOD
generalization on over 3,000 models evaluated on over 100 train/test domain

FDG-PET better captures AD-specific pathologies than sMRI. Therefore, we
propose a framework for the systematic evaluation of multi-modal DNNs and
critically re-evaluate single- and multi-modal DNNs based on FDG-PET and sMRI

show improvement when combined. This conforms with the established clinical
knowledge on AD biomarkers, but raises questions about the true benefit of
multi-modal DNNs. We argue that future work on multi-modal fusion should
systematically assess the contribution of individual modalities following our

protons are accelerated in the wind near the BH via diffusive shock
acceleration, $p\gamma$ processes with AGN photons generate neutrinos as well
as pair cascade emission from the gamma-ray to radio bands. The TeV neutrinos
detected by IceCube from the obscured Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 can be
interpreted consistently if the shock velocity is appreciably lower than the
local escape velocity, which may correspond to a failed, line-driven wind that
is physically well motivated. Although the $p\gamma$-induced cascade is
$\gamma\gamma$-attenuated above a few MeV, it can still contribute
significantly to the sub-GeV gamma rays observed from NGC 1068. At higher

offline reinforcement learning. Prior works have shown that neural nets trained
with TD-learning and gradient descent can exhibit implicit regularization that
can be characterized by under-parameterization of these networks. Specifically,
the rank of the penultimate feature layer, also called \textit{effective rank},
has been observed to drastically collapse during the training. In turn, this
collapse has been argued to reduce the model's ability to further adapt in
later stages of learning, leading to the diminished final performance. Such an
association between the effective rank and performance makes effective rank
compelling for offline RL, primarily for offline policy evaluation. In this
work, we conduct a careful empirical study on the relation between effective
rank and performance on three offline RL datasets : bsuite, Atari, and DeepMind
lab. We observe that a direct association exists only in restricted settings
and disappears in the more extensive hyperparameter sweeps. Also, we
empirically identify three phases of learning that explain the impact of
implicit regularization on the learning dynamics and found that bootstrapping
alone is insufficient to explain the collapse of the effective rank. Further,
we show that several other factors could confound the relationship between
effective rank and performance and conclude that studying this association
under simplistic assumptions could be highly misleading.

an adaptive backstepping controller for the platoon such that the

formally guaranteed. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. In particular, we provide

proposed control algorithm from the literature, under two types of information

transportation is roughly four times more fuel-efficient than roadway
transportation, a train derailment has greater potential to cause more
disastrous consequences than a truck incident. Train types, such as unit train
or manifest train (also called mixed train), can influence transport risks in
several ways. For example, unit trains only experience risks on mainlines and
when arriving at or departing from terminals, while manifest trains experience
additional switching risks in yards. Based on prior studies and various data
sources covering the years 1996-2018, this paper constructs event chains for
line-haul risks on mainlines (for both unit trains and manifest trains),
arrival/departure risks in terminals (for unit trains) and yards (for manifest
trains), and yard switching risks for manifest trains using various
probabilistic models, and finally determines expected casualties as the
consequences of a potential train derailment and release incident. This is the
first analysis to quantify the total risks a train may encounter throughout the
shipment process, either on mainlines or in yards/terminals, distinguishing
train types. It provides a methodology applicable to any train to calculate the
expected risks (quantified as expected casualties in this paper) from an origin

stellar clusters and/or Galactic spiral structures, and infer from that the
time elapsed since the first supernova event. We use astrometric data from the
Gaia EDR3 to initialize the position and velocity of each known HMXBs from the
Galaxy, and integrate their motion back in time. In parallel, we perform the
same calculations on a sample of 1381 open clusters detected by Gaia as well as
for four Galactic spiral arms which shape and motion have also been recently
modelled using Gaia data. We report on all the encounter candidates between
HMXBs and clusters or spiral arms in the past 100 Myr. In our sample of 26
HMXBs, we infer that 7 were born in clusters, 8 were born near a Galactic
spiral arm, and conclude that 7 others could have formed isolated. The
birthplaces of the remaining 4 HMXBs are still inconclusive due to a
combination of great distance, poor astrometric data and lack of known open
cluster in the vicinity. We provide the kinematical age since supernova of 15
HMXBs. The astrometry from Gaia and the orbit integration we employ are
effective at finding the birthplaces of HMXBs in the Milky Way. By considering
the biases in our data and method, we find it is likely that the progenitors of
HMXBs preferentially formed alongside other massive stars in open clusters.

investigated. However, these techniques can improve the conditioning but would
hurt the performance. To avoid such a side effect, we propose the Nearest

data shares the same distribution as the upcoming testing samples. However,
this stationary assumption is often violated in real-world applications,
especially when testing data appear in an online fashion. In this paper, we
formulate and investigate the problem of \emph{online label shift} (OLaS): the
learner trains an initial model from the labeled offline data and then deploys
it to an unlabeled online environment where the underlying label distribution
changes over time but the label-conditional density does not. The
non-stationarity nature and the lack of supervision make the problem
challenging to be tackled. To address the difficulty, we construct a new
unbiased risk estimator that utilizes the unlabeled data, which exhibits many
benign properties albeit with potential non-convexity. Building upon that, we
propose novel online ensemble algorithms to deal with the non-stationarity of
the environments. Our approach enjoys optimal \emph{dynamic regret}, indicating
that the performance is competitive with a clairvoyant who knows the online
environments in hindsight and then chooses the best decision for each round.
The obtained dynamic regret bound scales with the intensity and pattern of
label distribution shift, hence exhibiting the adaptivity in the OLaS problem.
Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and support
our theoretical findings.

distributions in ""true"" variables. The ill-posedness of the unfolding problem
can lead to results with strong anti-correlations and fluctuations between
bins, which make comparisons to theoretical models in plots difficult. To
alleviate this problem, one can introduce regularisation terms in the unfolding
procedure. These suppress the anti-correlations in the result, at the cost of
introducing some bias towards the expected shape of the data. This paper
discusses a method using simple linear algebra, which makes it is possible to
regularise any result that is presented as a central value and a covariance
matrix. This ""post-hoc"" regularisation is generally much faster than repeating
the unfolding method with different regularisation terms. The method also
yields a regularisation matrix which connects the regularised to the
unregularised result, and can be used to retain the full statistical power of
the unregularised result when publishing a nicer looking regularised result. In
addition to the regularisation method, this paper also presents some thoughts
on the presentation of correlated data in general. When using the proposed
method, the bias of the regularisation can be understood as a data
visualisation problem rather than a statistical one. The strength of the
regularisation can be chosen by minimising the difference between the
implicitly uncorrelated distribution shown in the plots and the actual
distribution described by the unregularised central value and covariance. Aside
from minimising the difference between the shown and the actual result,
additional information can be provided by showing the local log-likelihood

solar physics. For example, magnetic twist plays a role in the initiation of
flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Various proxies for the twist above
the photosphere have been found using models of uniformly twisted flux tubes,
and are routinely computed from single photospheric vector magnetograms. One
class of proxies is based on $\alpha_z$, the ratio of the vertical current to
the vertical magnetic field. Another class of proxies is based on the so-called
twist density, $q$, which depends on the ratio of the azimuthal field to the
vertical field. However, the sensitivity of these proxies to temporal
fluctuations of the magnetic field has not yet been well characterized. We aim
to determine the sensitivity of twist proxies to temporal fluctuations in the
magnetic field as estimated from time-series of SDO/HMI vector magnetic field
maps. To this end, we introduce a model of a sunspot with a peak vertical field
of 2370 Gauss at the photosphere and a uniform twist density $q= -0.024$
Mm$^{-1}$. We add realizations of the temporal fluctuations of the magnetic
field that are consistent with SDO/HMI observations, including the spatial
correlations. Using a Monte-Carlo approach, we determine the robustness of the
different proxies to the temporal fluctuations. The temporal fluctuations of
the three components of the magnetic field are correlated for spatial
separations up to 1.4 Mm (more than expected from the point spread function
alone). The Monte-Carlo approach enables us to demonstrate that several proxies
for the twist of the magnetic field are not biased in each of the individual
magnetograms. The associated random errors on the proxies have standard
deviations in the range between $0.002$ and $0.006$ Mm$^{-1}$, which is smaller
by approximately one order of magnitude than the mean value of $q$.

reported in Wagner et al. 2021. Despite the significant amount of time spent on
this target, the orbit of this candidate remains poorly constrained due to
these observations being closely distributed in 34 days. We argue that future
single-target deep surveys would benefit from a K-Stacker based strategy, where
the observations would be split over a significant part of the expected orbital
period to better constrain the orbital parameters. This application of
K-Stacker on high contrast imaging data in the mid-infrared demonstrates the

quantum dots. A fundamental quantity to measure optical performance of the
quantum dots is a distribution function for the light-emission duration. So
far, to estimate it, a threshold value for the fluorescent intensity was
introduced, and the light-emission state was evaluated as a state above the
threshold. With this definition, the light-emission duration was estimated, and
its distribution function was derived as a blinking plot. Due to the noise in
the fluorescent data, however, this treatment generates a large number of
artificially short-lived emission states, thus leading to an erroneous blinking
plot. In the present paper, we propose a hidden Markov model to eliminate these
artifacts. The hidden Markov model introduces a hidden variable specifying the
light-emission and quenching states behind the observed fluorescence. We found
that it is possible to avoid the above artifacts by identifying the state from
the hidden-variable time series. We found that, from the analysis of

developed for computer vision and medical image analysis due to their prominent

application of fast MRI may not be straightforward. The main obstacle is the
computational cost of the self-attention layer, which is the core part of the

propose a new Transformer architecture for solving fast MRI that coupled
Shifted Windows Transformer with U-Net to reduce the network complexity. We
incorporate deformable attention to construe the explainability of our

remove inhalable virus-laden respiratory particles and lower the risk of
infection, direct validation in schools with population-based studies is far
from definitive.
  Methods: We investigated the strength of association between ventilation and
SARS-CoV-2 transmission reported among the students of Italy's Marche region in
more than 10,000 classrooms, of which 316 were equipped with mechanical
ventilation. We used ordinary and logistic regression models to explore the
relative risk associated with the exposure of students in classrooms.
  Findings: For classrooms equipped with mechanical ventilation systems, the
relative risk of infection decreased with the increase in ventilation:
ventilation ranging from 10 to 14 L s-1 student-1 reduced the likelihood of
infection for students by 80% compared with a classroom with only natural
ventilation. From the regression analysis, as confirmed by the predictive
theoretical approach, we obtained a relative risk reduction in the range
12%-15% for each additional unit of ventilation rate per person.
  Interpretation: We need high ventilation rates (> 10 L s$^{-1}$
student$^{-1}$) to protect students in classrooms from airborne transmission;
this is higher than the rate needed to ensure indoor air quality. The excellent
agreement between the results from the retrospective cohort study and the
outcomes of the predictive theoretical approach makes it possible to assess the
risk of airborne transmission for any indoor environment.

the cells with vortex rings arising around the plumes. Even if bioconvection at
a high Rayleigh number is disturbed, the bioconvection is strongly stable with
respect to disturbances, and the pattern does not change due to disturbances.
Bioconvection changes depending on the physical properties of bacteria and
oxygen, and, in particular, the rate of oxygen consumption by bacteria
significantly affects the strength of bioconvection. Bioconvection patterns
with different plume arrangements and shapes are formed for different Rayleigh
numbers or initial disturbances of the cell concentration. As a result, the
wavelengths of the patterns also vary. As the Rayleigh number increases,
interference between plumes is strengthened by the shortening of the pattern
wavelength, so the velocities of both upward and downward flows increase. Many
cells are located under the plumes and a strong shear flow occurs in these
regions. As the pattern wavelength decreases, the cells are affected by high
shear stress. Then, the convective transport of the entire suspension
strengthens and the transport characteristics of cells and oxygen improve. When
the chamber boundary is changed to side walls, bacteria adhere to the wall
surface, and plumes are regularly arranged along the side walls.

  arXiv:2110.11945",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various
visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by stacked
self-attention operations. Employing self-attention modules results in a
quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on
approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have thus
been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this
work reveals that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically
ineffective for visual recognition. We identify that their limitations are
rooted in retaining the softmax self-attention during approximations.
Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled
dot-product between token feature vectors. Preserving the softmax operation
challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Under this insight, a
SOftmax-Free Transformer (abbreviated as SOFT) is proposed for the first time.
To eliminate the softmax operator in self-attention, a Gaussian kernel function
is adopted to replace the dot-product similarity. This enables a full
self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition.
The robustness of our approximation is achieved by calculating its
Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Further, an efficient
symmetric normalization is introduced on the low-rank self-attention for
enhancing model generalizability and transferability. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet, COCO and ADE20K show that our SOFT significantly improves the
computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear
complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in
superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.

significant progress for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems in the last 25
years, only sporadic theoretical results exist on how EAs solve
permutation-based problems.
  To overcome the lack of permutation-based benchmark problems, we propose a
general way to transfer the classic pseudo-Boolean benchmarks into benchmarks
defined on sets of permutations. We then conduct a rigorous runtime analysis of
the permutation-based $(1+1)$ EA proposed by Scharnow, Tinnefeld, and Wegener
(2004) on the analogues of the LeadingOnes and Jump benchmarks. The latter
shows that, different from bit-strings, it is not only the Hamming distance
that determines how difficult it is to mutate a permutation $\sigma$ into
another one $\tau$, but also the precise cycle structure of $\sigma \tau^{-1}$.
For this reason, we also regard the more symmetric scramble mutation operator.
We observe that it not only leads to simpler proofs, but also reduces the
runtime on jump functions with odd jump size by a factor of $\Theta(n)$.
Finally, we show that a heavy-tailed version of the scramble operator, as in
the bit-string case, leads to a speed-up of order $m^{\Theta(m)}$ on jump
functions with jump size $m$. A short empirical analysis confirms these
findings, but also reveals that small implementation details like the rate of
void mutations can make an important difference.

regulate the joint variables of a mobile manipulator. The motion of the mobile
base forces undue disturbances on the joint controllers of the manipulator. In
designing a conventional PID controller, one should make a trade-off between
the performance and agility of the closed-loop system and its stability
margins. The proposed nonlinear adaptive PID controller provides a mechanism to
relax the need for such a compromise by adapting the gains according to the
magnitude of the error without expert tuning. Therefore, we can achieve agile
performance for the system while seeing damped overshoot in the output and
track the reference as close as possible, even in the presence of external
disturbances and uncertainties in the modeling of the system. We have employed
a Bayesian optimization approach to choose the parameters of a nonlinear
adaptive PID controller to achieve the best performance in tracking the
reference input and rejecting disturbances. The results demonstrate that a
well-designed nonlinear adaptive PID controller can effectively regulate a

Recall@k. Yet, those metrics, are limited to binary labels and do not take into
account errors' severity. This paper introduces a new hierarchical AP training
method for pertinent image retrieval (HAP-PIER). HAPPIER is based on a new H-AP
metric, which leverages a concept hierarchy to refine AP by integrating errors'
importance and better evaluate rankings. To train deep models with H-AP, we
carefully study the problem's structure and design a smooth lower bound
surrogate combined with a clustering loss that ensures consistent ordering.
Extensive experiments on 6 datasets show that HAPPIER significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for hierarchical retrieval, while being on par with
the latest approaches when evaluating fine-grained ranking performances.
Finally, we show that HAPPIER leads to better organization of the embedding
space, and prevents most severe failure cases of non-hierarchical methods. Our

spreading or atomic excitation dynamics. SOC describes the buildup of
large-scale and long-range spatio-temporal correlations as a result of only
local interactions and dissipation. The simulation of SOC dynamics is typically
based on Monte-Carlo (MC) methods, which are however numerically expensive and
do not scale beyond certain system sizes. We investigate the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) as an effective surrogate model to learn the dynamics
operator for a paradigmatic SOC system, inspired by an experimentally
accessible physics example: driven Rydberg atoms. To this end, we generalize
existing GNN simulation approaches to predict dynamics for the internal state
of the node. We show that we can accurately reproduce the MC dynamics as well
as generalize along the two important axes of particle number and particle
density. This paves the way to model much larger systems beyond the limits of
traditional MC methods. While the exact system is inspired by the dynamics of
Rydberg atoms, the approach is quite general and can readily be applied to
other systems.

analyzed COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets to understand the evolving perceptions
of COVID-19 vaccines. We finetuned a deep learning classifier using a
state-of-the-art model, XLNet, to detect each tweet's sentiment automatically.
We employed validated methods to extract the users' race or ethnicity, gender,
age, and geographical locations from user profiles. Incorporating multiple data
sources, we assessed the sentiment patterns among subpopulations and juxtaposed
them against vaccine uptake data to unravel their interactive patterns.
11,211,672 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets corresponding to 2,203,681 users
over two years were analyzed. The finetuned model for sentiment classification
yielded an accuracy of 0.92 on testing set. Users from various demographic
groups demonstrated distinct patterns in sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccines.
User sentiments became more positive over time, upon which we observed
subsequent upswing in the population-level vaccine uptake. Surrounding dates
where positive sentiments crest, we detected encouraging news or events
regarding vaccine development and distribution. Positive sentiments in
pregnancy-related tweets demonstrated a delayed pattern compared with trends in
general population, with postponed vaccine uptake trends. Distinctive patterns

Populations with additional concerns, such as pregnancy, demonstrated more

have a negative impact on the rewards of other agents. One way to combat this
problem is to let agents trade their rewards amongst each other. Motivated by
this, this work applies a trading approach to a simulated scheduling
environment, where the agents are responsible for the assignment of incoming
jobs to compute cores. In this environment, reinforcement learning agents learn
to trade successfully. The agents can trade the usage right of computational
cores to process high-priority, high-reward jobs faster than low-priority,
low-reward jobs. However, due to combinatorial effects, the action and
observation spaces of a simple reinforcement learning agent in this environment
scale exponentially with key parameters of the problem size. However, the
exponential scaling behavior can be transformed into a linear one if the agent
is split into several independent sub-units. We further improve this
distributed architecture using agent-internal parameter sharing. Moreover, it
can be extended to set the exchange prices autonomously. We show that in our
scheduling environment, the advantages of a distributed agent architecture
clearly outweigh more aggregated approaches. We demonstrate that the
distributed agent architecture becomes even more performant using
agent-internal parameter sharing. Finally, we investigate how two different
reward functions affect autonomous pricing and the corresponding scheduling.

apply to the generalised ILW equation, i.e.~with nonlinearity $\partial_x

results of generalised ILW solutions on the circle with regularity $s\geq

In direct numerical simulations of compressible fluid flow, normalized time to

those obtained using Fluent and STAR-CCM+. The findings extend to the
incompressible case. All models offer weak and strong scaling in tests
performed on up to 48 compute nodes, each with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs. In linear
elasticity simulations with ABAQUS, both the iterative solver and the direct

outperforming the direct solver in terms of time-to-solution and memory usage.
The results provide a first indication of the potential of HPC architectures in
