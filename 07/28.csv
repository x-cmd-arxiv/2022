  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-scale learning frameworks have been regarded as a capable class of
models to boost semantic segmentation. The problem nevertheless is not trivial
especially for the real-world deployments, which often demand high efficiency
in inference latency. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the design of
convolutional blocks (the type of convolutions and the number of channels in
convolutions), and the ways of interactions across multiple scales, all from
lightweight standpoint for semantic segmentation. With such in-depth
comparisons, we conclude three principles, and accordingly devise Lightweight
and Progressively-Scalable Networks (LPS-Net) that novelly expands the network
complexity in a greedy manner. Technically, LPS-Net first capitalizes on the
principles to build a tiny network. Then, LPS-Net progressively scales the tiny
network to larger ones by expanding a single dimension (the number of
convolutional blocks, the number of channels, or the input resolution) at one
time to meet the best speed/accuracy tradeoff. Extensive experiments conducted
on three datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of LPS-Net over
several efficient semantic segmentation methods. More remarkably, our LPS-Net
achieves 73.4% mIoU on Cityscapes test set, with the speed of 413.5FPS on an
NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, leading to a performance improvement by 1.5% and a 65%
speed-up against the state-of-the-art STDC. Code is available at

we generalize Krylov complexity from a closed system to an open system coupled

growth of Krylov complexity is suppressed by dissipation, and at long-time,
Krylov complexity saturates at a finite value much smaller than that of a

  Non-k-Optimal Topologies","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An efficient algorithm to solve the $k$ shortest non-homotopic path planning
($k$-SNPP) problem in a 2D environment is proposed in this paper. Motivated by
accelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the
2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-$k$-optimal path
topologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This
is a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of
the path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully
constructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at
the goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial
relationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable.
  This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based
topology simplification mechanism to solve the $k$-SNPP task, whose core
contribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally
shortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then
those path topologies having more than $k$ better topologies are proven free of
the desired $k$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning
process. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an
implementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in
non-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven
locally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations
between partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree,
the tree nodes that expand in non-$k$-optimal topologies will not be expanded.
As a result, the computational time for solving the $k$-SNPP problem is reduced
by near two orders of magnitude.

when present, reduces the local density of the material, leading to swelling.
We show that the model exhibits rich resonance features, but is overall
characterised by clear scaling laws at low and high driving frequencies, and a
pronounced resonance at intermediate frequencies. Our model predictions suggest
that both the magnitude and position of the resonance can be varied by varying
the material's elastic modulus or cross-linking density, whereas the local

Computer Vision and Graphics. On the one hand, most existing works in Computer
Vision usually impose many assumptions regarding the image formation process,
e.g. direct illumination and predefined materials, to make scene parameter
estimation tractable. On the other hand, mature Computer Graphics tools allow
modeling of complex photo-realistic light transport given all the scene
parameters. Combining these approaches, we propose a method for scene
relighting under novel views by learning a neural precomputed radiance transfer
function, which implicitly handles global illumination effects using novel
environment maps. Our method can be solely supervised on a set of real images
of the scene under a single unknown lighting condition. To disambiguate the
task during training, we tightly integrate a differentiable path tracer in the
training process and propose a combination of a synthesized OLAT and a real

improves significantly over the current state of the art and, thus, also our
re-rendering results are more realistic and accurate.

valid inequalities from general disjunctions. Cuts are critical to modern
integer programming solvers, but their benefit is only realized when the cuts
are applied recursively, causing numerical instability and ""tailing off"" of cut
strength after several rounds. To mitigate these difficulties, the VPC
framework offers a practical method for generating strong cuts without
resorting to recursion. The framework starts with a disjunction whose terms
partition the feasible region into smaller subproblems, then obtains a
collection of points and rays from the disjunctive terms, from which we build a
linear program whose feasible solutions correspond to valid disjunctive cuts.
Though a na\""ive implementation would result in an exponentially-sized
optimization problem, we show how to efficiently construct this linear program,
such that it is much smaller than the one from the alternative, the
lift-and-project approach. This enables us to test strong multiterm
disjunctions that arise from the leaf nodes of a partial branch-and-bound tree.
In addition to proving useful theoretical properties of the cuts, we evaluate
their performance computationally through an implementation in the open-source
COIN-OR framework. In the results, VPCs from a strong disjunction significantly
improve the gap closed compared to existing cuts in solvers, and they also
decrease solving time when used with branch and bound if the best partial tree

the mock catalogs are compared against observations using the burst indicator
$\eta = \log_{10}(\mathrm{SFR_{H\alpha}/SFR_{NUV}})$, with the standard

$\eta$ in comparison to the observations. This work also presents the novel
approach of analytically deriving the relationship between the intrinsic
scatter in $\eta$, scatter added by measurement uncertainties, and observed
scatter, resulting in an intrinsic burstiness measurement of $0.06-0.16$ dex.

among the key observables in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ
Markovian feedback control to synthesize two effective thermal baths that
couple to the boundaries of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. This allows
for the realization of a heat-current-carrying state. We investigate the
steady-state heat current, including its scaling with system size and its
response to disorder. In order to study large systems, we use semi-classical
Monte-Carlo simulation and kinetic theory. The numerical results from both
approaches show, as expected, that for non- and weakly interacting systems with
and without disorder one finds the same scaling of the heat current with
respect to the system size as it is found for systems coupled to thermal baths.
Finally, we propose and test a scheme for measuring the energy flow. Thus, we
provide a route for the quantum simulation of heat-current-carrying steady
states of matter in atomic quantum gases.

rover slip detection systems rely on visual perception on the assumption that
sufficient visual features can be acquired in the environment. However,
visual-based methods are prone to suffer in perceptually degraded planetary
environments with dominant low terrain features such as regolith, glacial
terrain, salt-evaporites, and poor lighting conditions such as dark caves and
permanently shadowed regions. Relying only on visual sensors for slip detection
also requires additional computational power and reduces the rover traversal

planetary rover without depending on visual perception. In this respect, we
propose a slip detection system that obtains its information from a
proprioceptive localization framework that is capable of providing reliable,
continuous, and computationally efficient state estimation over hundreds of
meters. This is accomplished by using zero velocity update, zero angular rate
update, and non-holonomic constraints as pseudo-measurement updates on an
inertial navigation system framework. The proposed method is evaluated on
actual hardware and field-tested in a planetary-analog environment. The method
achieves greater than 92% slip detection accuracy for distances around 150 m

interest in exploring methods to integrate Ising problems as part of their

hybrid quantum-classical approaches rooted in existing optimization algorithms.
While it is widely acknowledged that quantum computers should augment classical
computers, rather than replace them entirely, comparatively little attention
has been directed toward deriving analytical characterizations of their

in the context of solving mixed-binary quadratic programs (MBQP) via Ising

allowing the resulting reformulation to inherit the straightforward analysis of
convex optimization. We propose to solve this reformulation with a hybrid
quantum-classical cutting-plane algorithm. Using existing complexity results
for convex cutting-plane algorithms, we deduce that the classical portion of
this hybrid framework is guaranteed to be polynomial time. This suggests that
when applied to NP-hard problems, the complexity of the solution is shifted
onto the subroutine handled by the Ising solver.

types. Based on atomistic simulations we reveal their structure and mobility
and put our focus on the splitting into partial dislocations, because this
mechanism is held responsible for the good dislocation mobility in strontium
titanate. Our results reveal that dislocations with a {1-10} glide plane (types
A, B, and C) show easy glide behavior due to their glide dissociated
configuration. The motion of dislocations on {001} glide planes (type E),
however, is prohibited due to high Peierls barriers, as is the case for the
{1-1-2} glide plane (type D). For dislocations with (partial) edge character
the dissociation into partials is shown to be very sensitive to the charge
state of the dislocation core. Since, in turn, dislocation mobility is strongly
related to the dissociation of dislocations, the macroscopic ductility may in
some cases have a direct relation to the charge at the dislocation core.

We find that the electronic correlations are about twice as strong in the
nickelates and are almost k-independent, indicating that they originate from a
local effect-likely the Mott interaction, whereas the cuprate interactions are
somewhat less local. Nevertheless, the nickelates still demonstrate an
approximately linear in energy and linear in temperature scattering rate.

system with its classical environment. Quantum simulators enable us to program
this interaction by using measurement operations. Measurements generally remove
part of the quantum entanglement built between the qubits inside a simulator.
While in simple cases entanglement may disappear at a constant rate as we
measure qubits one by one, the evolution of entanglement under measurements for
a given class of quantum states is generally unknown. Here, we show that
consecutive measurements of the qubits in a quantum simulator can lead to
criticality, separating two phases of entanglement. We prepare an entangled
superposition of ground states to a classical spin model and show that
progressively measuring the qubits drives the simulator into a spin glass phase
of entanglement. By entangling and measuring up to 48 qubits in this fashion,
we determine the vitrification point and its critical exponent, which obey spin
glass theory exactly. Our findings show that measurements alone can trigger

Measurement-based modeling approaches can create an impedance/admittance model
of IBRs to be subsequently used in small signal stability studies. Such
measurement-based approaches have previously been successfully used for dc-dc
converters but present unique challenges for three-phase IBRs. This paper
discusses the choices and challenges that can lead to an incorrect model from
measurement-based approaches as well as mitigation mechanisms of the adverse

assessment involving such admittance models is also provided. It is seen
through the illustrative example shown that the injection signal and the model

the grid impedance may impact the accuracy of the measurement-based admittance

provides novel ZCZ sequences of length $p^k$, where $k$ is an integer $\geq 2$.
We establish a relationship between the proposed CC-ZCZ code set and the
first-order generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) code, and proved that both have the
same Hamming distance. We also counted the number of CC-ZCZ code set in
first-order GRM codes. The column sequence peak-to-mean envelope power ratio

MPAS-O, containing cells as small as 125 meters wide in Delaware Bay. It is
shown that a particular, third-order LTS scheme (LTS3) produces sea-surface
height (SSH) solutions that are of comparable quality to solutions produced by
the classical four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) with a uniform
time step on the same meshes. Furthermore, LTS3 is up to 35% faster in the best
cases, showing that LTS schemes are viable for use in MPAS-O with the added
benefit of substantially less computational cost. The results of these
performance experiments inform us of the requirements for efficient mesh design

discussion about their performance has been limited to their ability to
reproduce a known target distribution. For example, expressive model families
such as Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) have been almost entirely
evaluated on their capability to learn a given target distribution with high
accuracy. While this aspect may be ideal for some tasks, it limits the scope of
a generative model's assessment to its ability to memorize data rather than
generalize. As a result, there has been little understanding of a model's
generalization performance and the relation between such capability and the
resource requirements, e.g., the circuit depth and the amount of training data.
In this work, we leverage upon a recently proposed generalization evaluation
framework to begin addressing this knowledge gap. We first investigate the
QCBM's learning process of a cardinality-constrained distribution and see an
increase in generalization performance while increasing the circuit depth. In
the 12-qubit example presented here, we observe that with as few as 30% of the
valid data in the training set, the QCBM exhibits the best generalization
performance toward generating unseen and valid data. Lastly, we assess the
QCBM's ability to generalize not only to valid samples, but to high-quality
bitstrings distributed according to an adequately re-weighted distribution. We
see that the QCBM is able to effectively learn the reweighted dataset and
generate unseen samples with higher quality than those in the training set. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature that
presents the QCBM's generalization performance as an integral evaluation metric
for quantum generative models, and demonstrates the QCBM's ability to
generalize to high-quality, desired novel samples.

large intermediate data if a sequence consists of thousands or even millions

infeasible. However, the majority of sequence elements can usually be predicted

predictions affected by long-term dependencies are sparse and characterized by
high uncertainty given only local information. We propose MemUP, a new training
method that allows to learn long-term dependencies without backpropagating
gradients through the whole sequence at a time. This method can potentially be
applied to any recurrent architecture. LSTM network trained with MemUP performs
better or comparable to baselines while requiring to store less intermediate

in the social and behavioural sciences. However, the literature does not always
clearly define the concept. Definitions of bias are often ambiguous or not

well-defined concept of bias. We propose to define bias as a direct causal
effect that is unjustified. We propose to define the closely related concept of
disparity as a direct or indirect causal effect that includes a bias. Our
proposed definitions can be used to study biases and disparities in a more
rigorous and systematic way. We compare our definitions of bias and disparity
with various criteria of fairness introduced in the artificial intelligence
literature. We also illustrate our definitions in two case studies, focusing on
gender bias in science and racial bias in police shootings. Our proposed

  2022",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intrusion detection systems (IDS) generate a large number of false alerts
which makes it difficult to inspect true positives. Hence, alert prioritization
plays a crucial role in deciding which alerts to investigate from an enormous
number of alerts that are generated by IDS. Recently, deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) off-policy
method has shown to achieve better results for alert prioritization as compared
to other state-of-the-art methods. However, DDPG is prone to the problem of
overfitting. Additionally, it also has a poor exploration capability and hence
it is not suitable for problems with a stochastic environment. To address these
limitations, we present a soft actor-critic based DRL algorithm for alert
prioritization (SAC-AP), an off-policy method, based on the maximum entropy
reinforcement learning framework that aims to maximize the expected reward
while also maximizing the entropy. Further, the interaction between an
adversary and a defender is modeled as a zero-sum game and a double oracle
framework is utilized to obtain the approximate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
(MSNE). SAC-AP finds robust alert investigation policies and computes pure
strategy best response against opponent's mixed strategy. We present the
overall design of SAC-AP and evaluate its performance as compared to other
state-of-the art alert prioritization methods. We consider defender's loss,
i.e., the defender's inability to investigate the alerts that are triggered due
to attacks, as the performance metric. Our results show that SAC-AP achieves up
to 30% decrease in defender's loss as compared to the DDPG based alert
prioritization method and hence provides better protection against intrusions.
Moreover, the benefits are even higher when SAC-AP is compared to other
traditional alert prioritization methods including Uniform, GAIN, RIO and
Suricata.

optimal or near-optimal solution. Furthermore, this loss function is
differentiable and thus can be used to train neural networks directly. We use
our loss function with a Graph Neural Network and design controlled experiments

supervised learning of not requiring large labelled datasets. In addition, the
performance of our approach surpasses reinforcement learning for asymmetric TSP

approach for accessing mid-infrared wavelengths between 2 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m,
but has not yet been integrated into silicon nanophotonics. Typically, Kerr OPO
uses a single transverse mode family for pump, signal, and idler modes, and
relies on a delicate balance to achieve normal (but close-to-zero) dispersion
near the pump and the requisite higher-order dispersion needed for phase- and
frequency-matching. Within integrated photonics platforms, this approach
results in two major problems. First, the dispersion is very sensitive to
geometry, so that small fabrication errors can have a large impact. Second, the
device is susceptible to competing nonlinear processes near the pump. In this
letter, we propose a flexible solution to infrared OPO that addresses these two
problems, by using a silicon nitride photonic crystal microring (PhCR). The
frequency shifts created by the PhCR bandgap enable OPO that would otherwise be
forbidden. We report an intrinsic optical quality factor up to (1.2 $\pm$
0.1)$\times$10$^6$ in the 2 $\mu$m band, and use a PhCR ring to demonstrate an
OPO with threshold power of (90 $\pm$ 20) mW dropped into the cavity, with the

2063 nm, respectively. We further discuss how to extend OPO spectral coverage

the first campaign over an entire activity period which resulted in no

predicted from our modelling of chromaticity, resulting in eight burst
detections. The bursts were detected in a window of 1.35 days, 3.6 days
preceding the activity peak seen by CHIME, suggesting the chromaticity extends
to higher frequency. The detected bursts have narrower temporal widths and
larger spectral widths compared to lower frequencies. All of them have flat
polarization position angle sweeps and high polarization fractions. The bursts
also exhibit diffractive scintillation due to the Milky Way, following a
$f^{3.90\pm0.05}$ scaling, and vary significantly over time. We find that burst

find that HMcode and ReACT considerably improve over the HALOFIT prescriptions
of Smith and Takahashi (both combined with the Bird correction), with an
overall agreement of 2\% for all the cosmological scenarios considered.
Concerning emulators, we find that, especially at low redshifts,
EuclidEmulator2 remarkably agrees with the simulated spectra at $\lesssim 1\%$
level in scenarios with dynamical dark energy and massless neutrinos, reaching
a maximum difference of $\sim 2\%$ at $z=2$. baccoemu has a similar behaviour
as EuclidEmulator2, except for a couple of dark energy models. In cosmologies
with massive neutrinos, at $z=0$ all the nonlinear prescriptions improve their
agreement with respect to the massless neutrino case, except for the Bird and
TakaBird models which, however, are not tailored to $w_0$--$w_a$ models. At
$z>0$ we do not find a similar improvement when including massive neutrinos,
probably due to the lower impact of neutrino free-streaming at higher
redshifts; rather at $z=2$ EuclidEmulator2 exceeds $2\%$ agreement for some

accelerated expansion. We discuss the phenomenology of the background evolution
and of the linear scalar perturbations and we identify measurable signatures of
the coupling in the dark sector on the cosmic microwave background, the lensing
potential auto-correlation and the matter power spectra. We also perform a
parameter estimation analysis using data of cosmic microwave background
temperature, polarisation and lensing, baryonic acoustic oscillations and
supernovae. We find that the strength of the coupling between the dark sectors,
regulated by the parameter $\alpha$, is constrained to be of order $10^{-4}$. A
model selection analysis does not reveal a statistical preference between
$\Lambda$CDM and the Kinetic model.

commonly obtained by combining multiple sensor measurements from different

  Most NBV approaches reason about measurements using rigid data structures

the selection of a next best view with the final data processing.
  This paper presents the Surface Edge Explorer (SEE), a NBV approach that
selects new observations directly from previous sensor measurements without

best views that increase coverage of insufficiently observed surfaces while
avoiding potential occlusions. Statistical results from simulated experiments

start from primordial power spectra (PPS) which include a monochromatic spike,
typical of ultra slow-roll inflation models. We consider the PBH formation as
being associated to the amplitude of the spike on top of the linear energy
density fluctuations, coming from a PPS with a blue index. By modelling the
spike with a log-normal function, we study the properties of the resulting mass
function spikes, and compare these to the underlying extended mass
distributions. When the spike is at PBH masses which are much lower than the
exponential cutoff of the extended distribution, very little mass density is
held by the PBHs within the spike, and it is not ideal to apply the
Press-Schechter formalism in this case as the resulting characteristic
overdensity is too different from the threshold for collapse. It is more
appropriate to do so when the spike mass is similar to, or larger than the
cutoff mass. Additionally, it can hold a similar mass density as the extended
part. Such particular mass functions also contain large numbers of small PBHs,
especially if stable PBH relics are considered, and they can provide $\sim
1000M_\odot$ seeds for the supermassive black holes at the centres of
present-day galaxies. The constraints on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs

additional heating necessary to explain the observed high RO3 while remaining
consistent with other observed line ratios. Our models represent a first step

supermassive black holes, which support accretion flows that radiate across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Although the composition of the accreting gas is
unknown, it is likely a mix of ionized hydrogen and helium. We use a simple
analytic model and a suite of numerical general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic accretion simulations to study how polarimetric images and
spectral energy distributions of the source are influenced by the
hydrogen/helium content of the accreting matter. We aim to identify general
trends rather than make quantitatively precise predictions, since it is not
possible to fully explore the parameter space of accretion models. If the
ion-to-electron temperature ratio is fixed, then increasing the helium fraction
increases the gas temperature; to match the observational flux density
constraints, the number density of electrons and magnetic field strengths must
therefore decrease. In our numerical simulations, emission shifts from regions
of low to high plasma beta -- both altering the morphology of the image and
decreasing the variability of the light curve -- especially in strongly
magnetized models with emission close to the midplane. In polarized images, we
find that the model gas composition influences the degree to which linear
polarization is (de)scrambled and therefore affects estimates for the resolved
linear polarization fraction. We also find that the spectra of
helium-composition flows peak at higher frequencies and exhibit higher
luminosities. We conclude that gas composition may play an important role in
predictive models for black hole accretion.

applications of quantum metrology to science and technology. We consider a
quantum system initialized in a pure state and whose evolution is goverened by
a Hamiltonian $H$; a measurement can later estimate the time $t$ for which the
system has evolved. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental
trade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a
quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that
leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in
which Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to
evolve for a time $t$ that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock
through a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information
that is lost. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI)
about $t$ is equal to Eve's gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter.
We also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to
estimate the values of parameters associated with two non-commuting
observables. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy
of the clock to be unaffected by the noise. These are a subset of the
Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions; states satisfying these conditions
are said to form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct
metrological codes in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are
metrological codes that cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code
with similar distance in which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator,
potentially offering new schemes for constructing states that do not lose any

formation (SF) of a galaxy. Connecting the star formation rate (SFR) to the
available H$_{\rm 2}$ is key to accurately model SF in cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. We investigate how modifying the underlying modelling of
H$_{\rm 2}$ and the description of stellar feedback in low-metallicity
environments (LMF, i.e. low-metallicity stellar feedback) in cosmological,
zoomed-in simulations of a Milky Way-size halo influences the formation history
of the forming, spiral galaxy and its final properties. We exploit two
different models to compute the molecular fraction of cold gas (f$_{\rm H_{\rm
2}}$): $i)$ the theoretical model by Krumholz et al. (2009b) and $ii)$ the
phenomenological prescription by Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006). We find that the
model adopted to estimate f$_{\rm H_{\rm 2}}$ plays a key role in determining
final properties and in shaping the morphology of the galaxy. The clumpier
interstellar medium (ISM) and the more complex H$_{\rm 2}$ distribution that
the Krumholz et al. (2009b) model predicts result in better agreement with
observations of nearby disc galaxies. This shows how crucial it is to link the
SFR to the physical properties of the star-forming, molecular ISM. The
additional source of energy that LMF supplies in a metal-poor ISM is key in
controlling SF at high redshift and in regulating the reservoir of SF across
cosmic time. Not only is LMF able to regulate cooling properties of the ISM,
but it also reduces the stellar mass of the galaxy bulge. These findings can
foster the improvement of the numerical modelling of SF in cosmological
simulations.

we measured the temperature and density of the intracluster medium (ICM). From
the SRT observations, we discovered two regions where the radio flux density is
below the background value. We computed the Comptonization parameter both from
the radio and from the X-ray observations to test if the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich

estimates. If the negative signal is considered as real, then we speculate that
the discrepancy between the two values could be partially caused by the
presence of a non-thermal bath of mildly relativistic ghost electrons. From the
polarimetric radio images, we find a net asymmetry of the Faraday rotation

Emission from the intra-halo light (IHL) has been proposed as a possible

from the integrated galaxy light (IGL) and IHL in the power spectrum of EBL
fluctuations using the simulated galaxy catalog MICECAT. We find that at
$\ell\sim10^3$, the one-halo clustering from satellite galaxies has comparable
power to the two-halo term in the IGL power spectrum. In some previous EBL
analyses, the IGL model assumed a small one-halo clustering signal, which may
result in overestimating the IHL contribution to the EBL. We also investigate
the dependence of the IGL$+$IHL power spectrum on the IHL distribution as a
function of redshift and halo mass, and the spatial profile within the halo.
Our forecast suggests that the upcoming SPHEREx deep field survey can
distinguish different IHL models considered in this work with high
significance. Finally, we quantify the bias in the power spectrum from the
correlation of the mask and the signal, which has not been accounted for in
previous analyses.

tracks solution along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework,
allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability. The wave equation can
be written as a first order hyperbolic system. Considering each characteristic
family, a straightforward application of ELDG will be to transform to the
characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic related
space-time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However,
the mass conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this
paper, we formulate a mass conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by
decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a
different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are
evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete
scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK
solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results on 1D and 2D wave
equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG
method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability
with extra large time stepping size, and mass conservative property.

Madelung transform. Here, we consider both descriptions and restrict our
analysis to linear response theory. We take advantage of the hydrodynamic
formulation to derive a fully analytic solution to the DF in steady-state and
for a finite time perturbation. We compare our prediction to a numerical
implementation of the wave approach that includes a non-vanishing FDM velocity
dispersion $\sigma$. Our solution is valid for both a single and a binary
perturber in circular motion as long as $\sigma$ does not significantly exceed
the orbital speed $v_\text{circ}$. While the short-distance Coulomb divergence
of the (supersonic) gaseous DF is no longer present, DF in the FDM case
exhibits an infrared divergence which stems from the (also) diffusive nature of
the Schr\""odinger equation. Our analysis of the finite time perturbation case
reveals that the density wake diffuses through the FDM medium until it reaches
its outer boundary. Once this transient regime is over, both the radial and
tangential DF oscillate about the steady-state solution with an exponentially
decaying envelope. Steady-state is thus never achieved. We use our results to
revisit the DF decay timescales of the 5 Fornax globular clusters. We also

considerable importance in recent years. Recent theoretical advances use
techniques from hydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and non-equilibrium statistical
physics. However, for biological agents, these don't seem to recognize
explicitly their critical feature, namely, the role of survival-driven purpose
and the attendant pursuit of maximum utility. Here, we propose a novel

agents, garuds, self-organize dynamically into flocks to approach a stable
arbitrage equilibrium of equal effective utilities. While it has been
well-known for three centuries that there are constants of motion for passive
matter, it comes as a surprise to discover that the dynamics of active matter
populations could also have an invariant. This is essentially the invisible
hand mechanism of Adam Smith's in a biological context. What we demonstrate is
for ideal systems, similar to the ideal gas or Ising model in thermodynamics.
The next steps would involve examining and learning how real swarms behave
compared to their ideal versions. Our theory is not limited to just birds

calculating explicitly the domain of validity of this Markovian approximation,
we argue that the lack of complete positivity in the usual microscopic

X-ray component reported here from RTXE and the Fermi LAT upper limit for
gamma-ray emission, is significantly lower than theoretical estimates that
place most of the non-thermal energy in protons. Our estimate is based on the
detection of non-thermal X-ray emission using the 3 - 20 keV RXTE spectrum,
which shows residual emission not well modeled by a single thermal component.
The statistical significance of adding a non-thermal, power law component is
~96%. The significance of adding a second thermal component is 90%. The
addition of a component consisting of full Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB)
fluctuation to an isothermal model is significant with 92% confidence. The
cumulative probability for the two thermal component model is 81% and 90% for
the thermal plus power law. Thus the model with non-thermal emission is the
preferred description of the data. Evidence of shock heating between the
clusters in the spectro-imaging data of XMM, Chandra, and Suzaku indicates that
a cosmic ray component should also be present and supports a non-thermal
interpretation for the additional component. The bolometric non-thermal X-ray

waveform. As binaries are expected to be nearly circularized when entering the
frequency band of ground-based detectors, tests of general relativity (GR)
currently employ quasicircular waveforms. We quantify the effect of residual
orbital eccentricity on the IMR consistency test. We find that eccentricity
causes a significant systematic bias in the inferred final mass and spin of the
remnant black hole at an orbital eccentricity (defined at $10$ Hz) of $e_0
\gtrsim 0.1$ in the LIGO band (for a total binary mass in the range $65$-$200

systematic bias becomes significant for $e_0 \gtrsim 0.015$ (for $200$-$600
\,M_{\odot}$ systems). This eccentricity-induced bias on the final mass and
spin leads to an apparent inconsistency in the IMR consistency test,
manifesting as a false violation of GR. Hence, eccentric corrections to
waveform models are important for constructing a robust test of GR, especially
for third-generation detectors. We also estimate the eccentric corrections to
the relationship between the inspiral parameters and the final mass and final
spin; they are shown to be quite small.

density-dependent meson-nucleon coupling functional DD-ME2. It is shown that
clustering features gradually weaken with increasing temperature and disappear
when the shape phase transition occurs. Considering thermal fluctuations in the
density profiles, the clustering features vanish at lower temperatures,
compared to the case without thermal fluctuations. The effect of the pairing
correlations on the nucleon localization and the formation of cluster

pairing in the calculations, cluster structures are preserved until the
critical temperatures for the shape phase transition are reached. Above the
critical temperature of the shape phase transition, the clustering features
suddenly disappear, which differs from the results without pairing.

separate nodules. The results were comparable with that of radiologists. The
algorithm was further tested with 378 nodules imaged with ultrasound machines

experienced radiologists were requested to evaluate the nodules for comparison
with deep learning. Results: The Area Under Curve (AUC) of the deep learning

0.75). The AUC of radiologists were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.59 - 0.67), 0.66 (95%

Conclusion: In the new testing dataset, the deep learning algorithm achieved
similar performances with all four radiologists. The relative performance

(CNNs), aggregate the message of nodes' neighbors and structure information to
acquire expressive representations of nodes for node classification, graph
classification, and link prediction. Previous studies have indicated that GNNs
are vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which infer whether a
node is in the training data of GNNs and leak the node's private information,
like the patient's disease history. The implementation of previous MIAs takes
advantage of the models' probability output, which is infeasible if GNNs only
provide the prediction label (label-only) for the input.
  In this paper, we propose a label-only MIA against GNNs for node
classification with the help of GNNs' flexible prediction mechanism, e.g.,
obtaining the prediction label of one node even when neighbors' information is
unavailable. Our attacking method achieves around 60\% accuracy, precision, and
Area Under the Curve (AUC) for most datasets and GNN models, some of which are
competitive or even better than state-of-the-art probability-based MIAs
implemented under our environment and settings. Additionally, we analyze the
influence of the sampling method, model selection approach, and overfitting
level on the attack performance of our label-only MIA. Both of those factors
have an impact on the attack performance. Then, we consider scenarios where
assumptions about the adversary's additional dataset (shadow dataset) and extra
information about the target model are relaxed. Even in those scenarios, our
label-only MIA achieves a better attack performance in most cases. Finally, we
explore the effectiveness of possible defenses, including Dropout,
Regularization, Normalization, and Jumping knowledge. None of those four
defenses prevent our attack completely.

get an idea about the important topics for corpus. There are multiple existing
texts comparing methods present that compare topics rather than sentiments but
we feel that focusing on sentiment-carrying words would better compare the two

two corpora do not many have identical words for side-by-side comparison, so
comparing the sentiment words gives us an idea of how the corpora are appealing
to the emotions of the reader. We can argue that the entropy or the
unexpectedness and divergence of topics should also be of importance and help
us to identify key pivot points and the importance of certain topics in the

micellar solution with matched rheology in a Taylor-Couette (TC) cell using a
combination of particle-tracking velocimetry, birefringence, and turbidity
measurements. Both solutions exhibit a stress plateau within a range of shear
rates. Under startup of a steady shear rate flow within the stress plateau,
both linear and branched samples exhibit strong transient shear thinning flow
profiles. However, while the flow of the linear solution evolves to a banded
structure at longer times, the flow of the branched solution transitions to a
curved velocity profile with no evidence of shear banding. Flow-induced
birefringence measurements indicate transient birefringence banding with strong
micellar alignment in the high shear band for the linear solution. The
transient flow-induced birefringence is stronger for the branched system at an
otherwise identical Wi. At longer times, the birefringence bands are replaced
by a chaotic flow reminiscent of elastic instabilities. Visualization of the
flow-induced turbidity in the velocity gradient-vorticity plane reveals
quasi-steady banding with a turbidity contrast between high and low shear bands
in the linear solution. However, the turbidity evolves uniformly within the gap
of the TC cell for the branched solution, corroborating the non-banded
quasi-steady velocimetry results. Finally, we show that while elastic
instabilities in the linear solution emerge in the high shear band, the flow of

input, it unfortunately limits users' virtual representations to just their
upper bodies. Current systems thus resort to floating avatars, whose limitation
is particularly evident in collaborative settings. To estimate full-body poses
from the sparse input sources, prior work has incorporated additional trackers
and sensors at the pelvis or lower body, which increases setup complexity and
limits practical application in mobile settings. In this paper, we present
AvatarPoser, the first learning-based method that predicts full-body poses in
world coordinates using only motion input from the user's head and hands. Our
method builds on a Transformer encoder to extract deep features from the input
signals and decouples global motion from the learned local joint orientations
to guide pose estimation. To obtain accurate full-body motions that resemble
motion capture animations, we refine the arm joints' positions using an
optimization routine with inverse kinematics to match the original tracking
input. In our evaluation, AvatarPoser achieved new state-of-the-art results in
evaluations on large motion capture datasets (AMASS). At the same time, our
method's inference speed supports real-time operation, providing a practical
interface to support holistic avatar control and representation for Metaverse
applications.

undirected graphs, and Bayesian networks (BNs) that are associated with
directed acyclic graphs, have proven to be a very popular approach for
reasoning under uncertainty, prediction problems and causal inference.
  Parametric MRF likelihoods are well-studied for Gaussian and categorical
data. However, in more complicated parametric and semi-parametric settings,
likelihoods specified via clique potential functions are generally not known to
be congenial {(jointly well-specified)} or non-redundant. Congenial and
non-redundant DAG likelihoods are far simpler to specify in both parametric and
semi-parametric settings by modeling Markov factors in the DAG factorization.
However, DAG likelihoods specified in this way are not guaranteed to coincide
in distinct DAGs within the same Markov equivalence class. This complicates
likelihoods based model selection procedures for DAGs by ``sneaking in''
potentially unwarranted assumptions about edge orientations.
  In this paper we link a density function decomposition due to Chen with the
clique factorization of MRFs described by Lauritzen to provide a general
likelihood for MRF models. The proposed likelihood is composed of variationally
independent, and non-redundant closed form functionals of the observed data
distribution, and is sufficiently general to apply to arbitrary parametric and
semi-parametric models. We use an extension of our developments to give a
general likelihood for DAG models that is guaranteed to coincide for all
members of a Markov equivalence class. Our results have direct applications for
model selection and semi-parametric inference.

  Fine-Grained DRAM Architecture",,,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There are two major sources of inefficiency in computing systems that use
modern DRAM devices as main memory. First, due to coarse-grained data transfers
(size of a cache block, usually 64B between the DRAM and the memory controller,
systems waste energy on transferring data that is not used. Second, due to
coarse-grained DRAM row activation, systems waste energy by activating DRAM
cells that are unused in many workloads where spatial locality is lower than
the large row size (usually 8-16KB).
  We propose Sectored DRAM, a new, low-overhead DRAM substrate that alleviates
the two inefficiencies, by enabling fine-grained DRAM access and activation. To
efficiently retrieve only the useful data from DRAM, Sectored DRAM exploits the
observation that many cache blocks are not fully utilized in many workloads due
to poor spatial locality. Sectored DRAM predicts the words in a cache block
that will likely be accessed during the cache block's cache residency and: (i)
transfers only the predicted words on the memory channel, as opposed to
transferring the entire cache block, by dynamically tailoring the DRAM data
transfer size for the workload and (ii) activates a smaller set of cells that
contain the predicted words, as opposed to activating the entire DRAM row, by
carefully operating physically isolated portions of DRAM rows (MATs).
  Compared to prior work in fine-grained DRAM, Sectored DRAM greatly reduces
DRAM energy consumption, does not reduce DRAM throughput, and can be
implemented with low hardware cost. We evaluate Sectored DRAM using 41
workloads from widely-used benchmark suites. Sectored DRAM reduces the DRAM
energy consumption of highly-memory-intensive workloads by up to (on average)
33% (20%) while improving their performance by 17% on average. Sectored DRAM's
DRAM energy savings, combined with its system performance improvement, allows

defined in terms of multipartitions. As such, they are sensitive to the
fine-grain structure of quantum systems. Building on this observation, we
introduce the concept of quantum conditional mutual information between the
edges of quantum many-body systems. We show that this quantity characterizes
unambiguously one-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors, being
equal to Bell-state entanglement in the former and to half Bell-state
entanglement in the latter, mirroring the different statistics of the edge
modes in the two systems. The edge-to-edge quantum conditional mutual
information is robust in the presence of disorder or local perturbations,
converges exponentially with the system size to a quantized topological
invariant, even in the presence of interactions, and vanishes in the trivial
phase. We thus conjecture that it coincides with the edge-to-edge squashed
entanglement in the entire ground-state phase diagram of symmetry-protected
topological systems, and we provide some analytical evidence supporting the
claim. By comparing them with the entanglement negativity, we collect further
indications that the quantum conditional mutual information and the squashed

  Presentation",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Pose-NDF, a continuous model for plausible human poses based on
neural distance fields (NDFs). Pose or motion priors are important for
generating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy
or partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the
zero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling
implicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3)^K, where a human
pose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The
resulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect
to the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the
manifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In
contrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose
space into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold,
preserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that PoseNDF outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks,
ranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded
data to 3D pose reconstruction from images. Furthermore, we show that it can be
used to generate more diverse poses by random sampling and projection than
VAE-based methods.

particles, are key conveyors of sediment, nutrient, and pollutant from the
continental margins to deep ocean, and pose critical submarine geohazard risks.
Due to their vast scale and extreme aspect ratio, extant models are constrained
to highly simplified depth-averaged theory and fail to capture observed
behaviour. We propose a novel depth-averaged model capturing the internal
energy balance and the vertical profiles of velocity, depth, and turbulent
kinetic energy. The vertical profiles change as the current evolves: it self
stratifies. This enables the critical new insight that turbidity current
propagation is enabled by bidirectional cascades between mean-flow kinetic,
turbulent, and gravitational potential energies.
  The model is generalised for fully confined `canyon' flow (no lateral
overspill), and partially confined `channel' flow (lateral overspill over
bounding levees). `Quasi-equilibrium' solutions for self-stratifying turbidity
currents are constructed. These solutions are weekly unstable and connected to
a slowly evolving manifold, wherein environmental currents are likely found.
Equilibrium solutions, found for channel flow, are not stable either. Levee
overspill removes dilute, low momentum fluid, rejuvenating the flow, which can
cause a positive feedback loop where the fluid becomes increasingly
concentrated. We test the new theory by modelling flow in the Congo
canyon-channel system, for the first time simulating a supercritical turbidity
current that travels 100s km to the distal reaches of a real-world system. It

implementing smart contracts and specifying contract-level properties. Driven
by the observation that smart contract operations and contract-level properties
can be naturally expressed as relational constraints, DeCon models each smart
contract as a set of relational tables that store transaction records. This
relational representation of smart contracts enables convenient specification
of contract properties, facilitates run-time monitoring of potential property
violations, and brings clarity to contract debugging via data provenance.
Specifically, a DeCon program consists of a set of declarative rules and
violation query rules over the relational representation, describing the smart
contract implementation and contract-level properties, respectively. We have
developed a tool that can compile DeCon programs into executable Solidity
programs, with instrumentation for run-time property monitoring. Our case
studies demonstrate that DeCon can implement realistic smart contracts such as
ERC20 and ERC721 digital tokens. Our evaluation results reveal the marginal
overhead of DeCon compared to the open-source reference implementation,
incurring 14% median gas overhead for execution, and another 16% median gas
overhead for run-time verification.

solutions (RONS). RONS was recently proposed as a framework for reduced-order
modeling of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), where the
modes depend nonlinearly on a set of time-varying parameters. RONS uses a set
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters to optimally
evolve the shape of the modes to adapt to the PDE's solution. This method has
already proven extremely effective in tackling challenging problems such as
advection-dominated flows and high-dimensional PDEs. However, as the number of
parameters grow, integrating the RONS equation and even its formation become
computationally prohibitive. Here, we develop three separate methods to address
these computational bottlenecks: symbolic RONS, collocation RONS and
regularized RONS. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods on two examples:
Fokker-Planck equation in high dimensions and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation. In both cases, we observe that the proposed methods lead to several
orders of magnitude in speedup and accuracy. Our proposed methods extend the
applicability of RONS beyond reduced-order modeling by making it possible to
use RONS for accurate numerical solution of linear and nonlinear PDEs. Finally,
as a special case of RONS, we discuss its application to problems where the
PDE's solution is approximated by a neural network, with the time-dependent
parameters being the weights and biases of the network. The RONS equations
dictate the optimal evolution of the network's parameters without requiring any
training.

have shown a considerable reluctance towards its application. There is
substantial existing research studying industrial use and technical challenges
of modelling. However, there is a lack of detailed empirical work investigating
how students perceive modelling. Aim: We investigate the perceptions of
students towards modelling in a university environment. Method: We conducted a
multiple case study with 5 cases (5 courses from 3 universities) and two units
of analysis (student and instructor). We collected data through 21
semi-structured interviews, which we analysed using in-vivo coding and thematic
analysis. Results: Students see some benefits of modelling, e.g., using models
for planning and communicating within the group. However, several factors
negatively influence their understanding of modelling, e.g., assignments with
unclear expectations, irregular and insufficient feedback on their models, and
lack of experience with the problem domains. Conclusions: Our findings help in
understanding better why students struggle with software modelling, and might
be reluctant to adopt it later on. This could help to improve education and
training in software modelling, both at university and in industry.
Specifically, we recommend that educators try to provide feedback beyond
syntactical issues, and to consider using problem domains that students are
knowledgeable about.

The study develops a predictive model of the pathological states based on

complete workflow for mesh extraction and simplification of an organ's surface
is developed, and coupled with an automatic extraction of morphological
features given by the distribution of mean curvature and mesh energy. An
XGBoost supervised classifier is then trained and tested on the 3D-morphomics
to predict the pathological states. This framework is applied to the prediction
of the malignancy of lung's nodules. On a subset of NLST database with
malignancy confirmed biopsy, using 3D-morphomics only, the classification model
of lung nodules into malignant vs. benign achieves 0.964 of AUC. Three other
sets of classical features are trained and tested, (1) clinical relevant

prohibitive latency in processing input data. This triggers new research
opportunities toward task offloading systems where edge servers handle
intensive computations of IoT devices. Deploying the computing servers at
existing base stations may not be sufficient to support IoT nodes operating in
a harsh environment. This requests mobile edge servers to be mounted on
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide on-demand mobile edge computing
(MEC) services. Time-varying offloading demands and mobility of UAVs need a
joint design of the optimization variables for all time instances. Therefore,
an online decision mechanism is essential for UAV-aided MEC networks. This
article presents an overview of recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
approaches where decisions about UAVs and IoT nodes are taken in an online
manner. Specifically, joint optimization over task offloading, resource
allocation, and UAV mobility is addressed from the DRL perspective. For the
decentralized implementation, a multi-agent DRL method is proposed where
multiple intelligent UAVs cooperatively determine their computations and
communication policies without central coordination. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed decentralized learning strategy is superior to
existing DRL solutions. The proposed framework sheds light on the viability of
the decentralized DRL techniques in designing self-organizing IoT networks.

resonant chains of planets that later experience a dynamical instability.
However, both the boundary of stability in resonant chains and the mechanism of
the instability itself are poorly understood. Previous work postulated that a
secondary resonance between the fastest libration frequency and a difference in
synodic frequencies destabilizes the system. Here, we use that hypothesis to
produce a simple and general criterion for resonant chain stability that
depends only on planet orbital periods and masses. We show that the criterion
accurately predicts the maximum mass of planets in synthetic resonant chains up
to six planets. More complicated resonant chains produced in population
synthesis simulations are found to be less stable than expected, although our
criterion remains useful and superior to machine learning models.

a homoclinic bifurcation, the associated two-dimensional invariant manifold of
the equilibrium closes on itself in an orientable or non-orientable way. We are
interested in the interaction between global invariant manifolds of saddle
equilibria and saddle periodic orbits for a vector field close to a
codimension-two homoclinic flip bifurcation, that is, the point of transition
between having an orientable or non-orientable two-dimensional surface. Here,
we focus on homoclinic flip bifurcations of case $\textbf{B}$, which is
characterized by the fact that the codimension-two point gives rise to an
additional homoclinic bifurcation, namely, a two-homoclinic orbit. To explain
how the global manifolds organize phase space, we consider Sandstede's
three-dimensional vector field model, which features inclination and orbit flip
bifurcations. We compute global invariant manifolds and their intersection sets
with a suitable sphere, by means of continuation of suitable two-point boundary
problems, to understand their role as separatrices of basins of attracting
periodic orbits. We show representative images in phase space and on the
sphere, such that we can identify topological properties of the manifolds in
the different regions of parameter space and at the homoclinic bifurcations
involved. We find heteroclinic orbits between saddle periodic orbits and
equilibria, which give rise to regions of infinitely many heteroclinic orbits.
Additional equilibria exist in Sandstede's model and we compactify phase space
to capture how equilibria may emerge from or escape to infinity. We present
images of these bifurcation diagrams, where we outline different configurations
of equilibria close to homoclinic flip bifurcations of case $\textbf{B}$;
furthermore, we characterize the dynamics of Sandstede's model at infinity.

which impact the overall performance of SpGEMM. Existing work either precisely
calculates the output structure or adopts upper-bound or sampling-based methods

In particular, we prove that self-testing is possible in nontrivial classes of

self-testing correlations found on the no-signaling boundary are provably
non-exposed. An analogous characterization for the set $\mathcal{M}$ of quantum

provided. En route to establishing this last result, we show that all

convex combinations of those achievable using a Bell pair and projective

a surface flow and the 2-manifold used to define the pattern can be optimized,
where the 2-manifold is implicitly defined on another fixed 2-manifold named as
the base manifold. The fiber bundle topology optimization approach is developed
based on the description of the topological structure of the surface flow by
using the differential geometry concept of the fiber bundle. The material
distribution method is used to achieve the evolution of the pattern of the
surface flow. The evolution of the implicit 2-manifold is realized via a
homeomorphous map. The design variable of the pattern of the surface flow and
that of the implicit 2-manifold are regularized by two sequentially implemented
surface-PDE filters. The two surface-PDE filters are coupled, because they are
defined on the implicit 2-manifold and base manifold, respectively. The surface
Navier-Stokes equations, defined on the implicit 2-manifold, are used to
describe the surface flow. The fiber bundle topology optimization problem is
analyzed using the continuous adjoint method implemented on the first-order
Sobolev space. Several numerical examples have been provided to demonstrate
this approach, where the combination of the viscous dissipation and pressure

In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a
model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous
datapoints. Motivated by the increasing use of overparameterized models, we
develop Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass
learning which seeks to perfectly fit every new datapoint while changing the
parameters in a direction that causes the least change to the predictions on
previous datapoints. By doing so, we bridge two seemingly distinct algorithms
in adaptive filtering and machine learning, namely the recursive least-squares
(RLS) algorithm and orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). Our algorithm uses the
memory efficiently by exploiting the structure of the streaming data via an
incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Further, we show that, for
overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by our algorithm
is what stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to in the standard
multi-pass setting. Finally, we generalize the results to the nonlinear setting
for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning. Our
experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the

to scan quickly and broadly while precisely placing the slit position across

pixel into a certain natural or man-made category of the earth surface, such as
water, soil, natural vegetation, crops, and human infrastructure. Limited by
hardware computational resources and memory capacity, most existing studies
preprocessed original remote sensing images by down sampling or cropping them
into small patches less than 512*512 pixels before sending them to a deep
neural network. However, down sampling images incurs spatial detail loss,
renders small segments hard to discriminate, and reverses the spatial
resolution progress obtained by decades of years of efforts. Cropping images
into small patches causes a loss of long-range context information, and
restoring the predicted results to their original size brings extra latency. In
response to the above weaknesses, we present an efficient lightweight semantic
segmentation network termed MKANet. Aimed at the characteristics of top view
high-resolution remote sensing imagery, MKANet utilizes sharing kernels to
simultaneously and equally handle ground segments of inconsistent scales, and
also employs parallel and shallow architecture to boost inference speed and
friendly support image patches more than 10X larger. To enhance boundary and
small segments discrimination, we also propose a method that captures category
impurity areas, exploits boundary information and exerts an extra penalty on
boundaries and small segment misjudgment. Both visual interpretations and
quantitative metrics of extensive experiments demonstrate that MKANet acquires
state-of-the-art accuracy on two land-cover classification datasets and infers
2X faster than other competitive lightweight networks. All these merits

often criticized for their poor performances. In this paper, we propose an
advanced generative steganography network (GSN) that can generate realistic
stego images without using cover images. We firstly introduce the mutual

a discriminator ($D$), a steganalyzer ($S$), and a data extractor ($E$). $D$
and $S$ act as two adversarial discriminators to ensure the visual quality and
security of generated stego images. $E$ is to extract the hidden secret from
generated stego images. The generator $G$ is flexibly constructed to synthesize
either cover or stego images with different inputs. It facilitates covert
communication by concealing the function of generating stego images in a normal

the increase of the down slope of a subsequent de-shoal zone leads to a
monotonic decrease in the rogue wave probability, thus featuring a strong

to define an internal waveguide that isolates specific modes from the edge

defining waveguides in graphene; in this manuscript, we consider strain folds

discontinuity of segmented vessels. To solve these problems, the paper proposes
an algorithm named SuperVessel, which gives out high-resolution and accurate
vessel segmentation using low-resolution images as input. We first take
super-resolution as our auxiliary branch to provide potential high-resolution
detail features, which can be deleted in the test phase. Secondly, we propose
two modules to enhance the features of the interested segmentation region,
including an upsampling with feature decomposition (UFD) module and a feature
interaction module (FIM) with a constraining loss to focus on the interested
features. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets
demonstrate that our proposed SuperVessel can segment more tiny vessels with
higher segmentation accuracy IoU over 6%, compared with other state-of-the-art
algorithms. Besides, the stability of SuperVessel is also stronger than other
algorithms. We will release the code after the paper is published.

neural diarization (EEND) and clustering-based diarization is a promising
approach for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Such an
approach first divides an observed signal into fixed-length segments, then
performs {\it segment-level} local diarization based on an EEND module, and
merges the segment-level results via clustering to form a final global
diarization result. The segmentation is done to limit the number of speakers in
each segment since the current EEND cannot handle a large number of speakers.
In this paper, we argue that such an approach involving the segmentation has
several issues; for example, it inevitably faces a dilemma that larger segment
sizes increase both the context available for enhancing the performance and the
number of speakers for the local EEND module to handle. To resolve such a
problem, this paper proposes a novel framework that performs diarization
without segmentation. However, it can still handle challenging data containing
many speakers and a significant amount of overlapping speech. The proposed
method can take an entire meeting for inference and perform {\it
utterance-by-utterance} diarization that clusters utterance activities in terms
of speakers. To this end, we leverage a neural network training scheme called
Graph-PIT proposed recently for neural source separation. Experiments with
simulated active-meeting-like data and CALLHOME data show the superiority of

customized to hypergraphs which recover linear and periodic structures

perpendicular shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) is expected to accelerate CRs
up to PeV without upstream magnetic field amplification. Red supergiants (RSGs)
and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are considered as progenitors in this work. We
perform test particle simulations to investigate the escape process and
escape-limited maximum energy without magnetic field amplification in the
upstream region, where the magnetic field strength and rotation period expected
from observations of RSGs and WR stars are used. We show that particles escape
to the far upstream region while moving along the equator or poles and the
maximum energy is about $10-100~{\rm TeV}$ when SNRs propagate to free wind
regions of RSGs and WR stars. In most cases, the escape-limited maximum energy
is given by the potential difference between the equator and pole. If
progenitors are oblique rotators and SNRs are in the early phase just after the
supernova explosion, the escape-limited maximum energy is limited by the half
wavelength of the wavy current sheet. In addition, for RSGs, we show that the
luminosity of CRs accelerated in the wind region is sufficient to supply the
observed CR flux above $10~{\rm TeV}$ if a strong magnetic field strength is
sustained in most RSGs. In terms of the CR luminosity, SNRs propagating to the
free wind of WR stars can contribute to PeV CRs. As long as no magnetic field
amplification works around SNR shocks, the maximum energy is decided by the
magnetic field strength in the wind region, which depends on the rotation
period, stellar wind, and surface magnetic field of RSGs and WR stars.
Therefore, we need to observe these quantities to understand the origin of CRs.

locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant
model, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems
(FRSs) do not consider the lack of resources and data availability at the
end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users
and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices, and that all local
recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user's
behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be
made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources.
Furthermore, users' preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new
items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the
straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data.
In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System

self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning
a user's temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server
side, ReFRS utilizes a semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation
within each identified user cluster. The clustering module operates in an
asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and
cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior
performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by
comparative experiments.

find that when intimately mixed with other materials, including water ice,
CO$_2$ ice becomes rapidly undetectable due to its low absorptivity. As low as
5 wt.$\%$ of fine-grained H$_2$O ice is enough to mask entirely the signatures

to identify samples with H$_2$O, CO$_2$, JSC Mars-1, or various mixtures from
their reflectance and orient our study to helping interpret ice and soil
reflectance spectra from the Martian surface. From the laboratory spectra, we
simulate the colour signal generated by the CaSSIS instrument to allow for

out-of-distribution (OOD) test data into one of the in-distribution (ID)
training classes with high confidence. This can have disastrous consequences
for safety-critical applications. A popular mitigation strategy is to train a
separate classifier that can detect such OOD samples at the test time. In most
practical settings OOD examples are not known at the train time, and hence a
key question is: how to augment the ID data with synthetic OOD samples for
training such an OOD detector? In this paper, we propose a novel Compounded
Corruption technique for the OOD data augmentation termed CnC. One of the major
advantages of CnC is that it does not require any hold-out data apart from the
training set. Further, unlike current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, CnC
does not require backpropagation or ensembling at the test time, making our
method much faster at inference. Our extensive comparison with 20 methods from
the major conferences in last 4 years show that a model trained using CnC based
data augmentation, significantly outperforms SOTA, both in terms of OOD
detection accuracy as well as inference time. We include a detailed post-hoc
analysis to investigate the reasons for the success of our method and identify
higher relative entropy and diversity of CnC samples as probable causes. We
also provide theoretical insights via a piece-wise decomposition analysis on a
two-dimensional dataset to reveal (visually and quantitatively) that our
approach leads to a tighter boundary around ID classes, leading to better
detection of OOD samples. Source code link: https://github.com/cnc-ood

deformed generating a so-called bump in the paddle aperture, which may

would provide an enhanced image quality of the recombined image, increasing the
visibility of the contrast-uptakes to be targeted during the biopsy procedure.
In this work we propose a method to estimate the shape of the breast bump in
biopsy vertical approach. Materials and Methods: Our method consists on two
steps: first, we compute a raw thickness which does not take into account the
presence of contrast-uptakes; second, we use a physical model to separate the
sparse iodine texture from the breast shape. This physical model is composed by
a sum of Fourier components, describing the main shape of the bump, a series of
low-order polynomials, describing the main compressed thickness, paddle tilt
and deflection, and non-linear components describing the translation and
rotation of the paddle aperture. A 3D object mimicking a bump was fabricated to
test the pertinence of our shape model. Also, clinical images of 21 patients
which followed CESM-guided biopsy were visually assessed. Results: Comparison
between raw and final estimated thickness of our 3D test object shows an error
standard deviation of 0.37 mm similar to the noise standard deviation equals to
0.32 mm. The visual assessment of clinical cases showed that the thickness
correction removes the superimposed low-frequency pattern due to non-uniform
thickness of the bump, improving the identification of the lesion to be
targeted. Conclusion: The proposed method for thickness estimation is adapted
to CESM-guided biopsies in vertical approach and it improves the identification
of the contrast-uptakes that need to be targeted during the procedure.

marine ecosystem models. Using a marine ecosystem model, the assessment and the
validation of annual periodic solutions (i.e., steady annual cycles) against
observational data are crucial to identify biogeochemical processes, which, for
example, influence the global carbon cycle. For marine ecosystem models, the
transport matrix method (TMM) already lowers the runtime of the simulation
significantly and enables the application of larger time steps
straightforwardly. However, the selection of an appropriate time step is a
challenging compromise between accuracy and shortening the runtime. Using an
automatic time step adjustment during the computation of a steady annual cycle
with the TMM, we present in this paper different algorithms applying either an
adaptive step size control or decreasing time steps in order to use the time
step always as large as possible without any manual selection. For these
methods and a variety of marine ecosystem models of different complexity, the
accuracy of the computed steady annual cycle achieved the same accuracy as
solutions obtained with a fixed time step. Depending on the complexity of the
marine ecosystem model, the application of the methods shortened the runtime
significantly. Due to the certain overhead of the adaptive method, the
computational effort may be higher in special cases using the adaptive step
size control. The presented methods represent computational efficient methods
for the simulation of marine ecosystem models using the TMM but without any
manual selection of the time step.

R$_*$=1.043\,$\pm$\,0.009\,R$_\odot$) in a visual binary system. We combined
TESS and CHEOPS space-borne photometry with data from MuSCAT 2, `Alopeke,
PHARO, TRES, FIES, and SOPHIE. We validated and spectroscopically confirmed the
outer transiting planet HD 93963 Ac, a sub-Neptune with an orbital period of
P$_c \approx$ 3.65 d, reported as a TESS object of interest (TOI) shortly after
the release of Sector 22 data. HD 93963 Ac has a mass of M$_c = 19.2 \pm 4.1$
M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of R$_c = 3.228 \pm 0.059$ R$_{\oplus}$, implying a
mean density of $\rho_c=3.1\pm0.7$ gcm$^{-3}$. The inner object, HD 93963 Ab,
is a validated 1.04 d ultra-short period (USP) transiting super-Earth that we
discovered in the TESS light curve and that was not listed as a TOI, owing to
the low significance of its signal (TESS signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 6.7,
TESS $+$ CHEOPS combined transit depth D$_b=141.5 \pm 8.5$ ppm). We intensively
monitored the star with CHEOPS by performing nine transit observations to
confirm the presence of the inner planet and validate the system. HD 93963 Ab
is the first small (R$_b = 1.35 \pm 0.042$ R$_{\oplus}$) USP planet discovered
and validated by TESS and CHEOPS. Unlike planet c, HD 93963 Ab is not
significantly detected in our radial velocities (M$_b = 7.8 \pm 3.2$
M$_{\oplus}$). We also discovered a linear trend in our Doppler measurements,
suggesting the possible presence of a long-period outer planet. With a V-band
magnitude of 9.2, HD 93963 A is among the brightest stars known to host a USP
planet, making it one of the most favourable targets for precise mass
measurement via Doppler spectroscopy and an important laboratory to test
formation, evolution, and migration models of planetary systems hosting
ultra-short period planets.

achieved near-experimental accuracy. These advanced pipelines mainly rely on
Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) as inputs to learn the co-evolution
information from the homologous sequences. Nonetheless, searching MSAs from
protein databases is time-consuming, usually taking dozens of minutes.
Consequently, we attempt to explore the limits of fast protein structure
prediction by using only primary sequences of proteins. HelixFold-Single is
proposed to combine a large-scale protein language model with the superior
geometric learning capability of AlphaFold2. Our proposed method,
HelixFold-Single, first pre-trains a large-scale protein language model (PLM)
with thousands of millions of primary sequences utilizing the self-supervised
learning paradigm, which will be used as an alternative to MSAs for learning
the co-evolution information. Then, by combining the pre-trained PLM and the
essential components of AlphaFold2, we obtain an end-to-end differentiable
model to predict the 3D coordinates of atoms from only the primary sequence.
HelixFold-Single is validated in datasets CASP14 and CAMEO, achieving
competitive accuracy with the MSA-based methods on the targets with large
homologous families. Furthermore, HelixFold-Single consumes much less time than
the mainstream pipelines for protein structure prediction, demonstrating its
potential in tasks requiring many predictions. The code of HelixFold-Single is

does the complexity of the corresponding inventory management problem.
High-quality decision making, in this regard, necessitates the utilisation of
computerised decision support systems capable of accommodating the complexity
presented by a large number of products. Existing frameworks for decision
support in inventory management are mainly focused on a single facet of the
inventory management problem - generic, integrated frameworks seem to be absent
from the literature. In this paper, a holistic framework design is proposed
which integrates all of the major components expected to form part of a generic

provide decision support in respect of various inventory management operations,
such as product segmentation, demand forecasting and determining the sizes and
timings of replenishment orders, in pursuit of a desirable balance between the

general class of routing problems with intermediate stops and synchronization
constraints. In DRP-E, the drone has to visit a set of nodes and routinely
requires battery swaps from a (potentially) mobile replenishment station.
Contrary to widespread restrictions in the drone routing literature, several
destinations may be visited in between two consecutive battery swaps. In this
paper, we propose a nontrivial very large-scale neighbourhood for DRP-E, which
synergetically leverages two large-sized polynomially solvable DRP-E
SubProblems (SP1 and SP2). The number of feasible solutions in the resulting
neighborhood is a multiple of those in SP1 and SP2, and, thus, exponential in
the input size of the problem, whereas the computational time to search it
remains polynomial. The proposed polynomial two-stage dynamic programming
algorithm VLSN to search this neighborhood can be flexibly adjusted to the
desired trade-off between accuracy and computational time. For instance, the
search procedure can be converted into an exact algorithm of competitive
runtime for DRP-E. In computational tests, the developed solution methods
outperform current state-of-the art heuristics for DRP-E by a significant
margin. A case study based on a search for missing persons demonstrates that
VLSN easily accommodates additional practice relevant features and outperforms
the state-of-the-art solution in disaster relief by 20%.

spherical equiareal parameterizations between a simply connected closed surface
$\mathcal{M}$ and a unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ via minimizing the total area
distortion energy on $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$. Provided we determine the
minimizer of the total area distortion energy, the minimizer composed with the
initial conformal map determines the equiareal map between the extended planes.
Taking the inverse stereographic projection, we can derive the equiareal map
between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathbb{S}^2$. The total area distortion energy can
be rewritten into the sum of Dirichlet energies associated with the southern

solving the corresponding Laplacian equations. Based on this foundational

of the spherical equiareal parameterization between $\mathcal{M}$ and

tests LMs abilities in multiple dimensions, i.e., grammar, semantics,
knowledge, reasoning and computation. In addition, it provides carefully
annotated token-level rationales that satisfy sufficiency and compactness. It
contains perturbed instances for each original instance, so as to use the
rationale consistency under perturbations as the metric for faithfulness, a
perspective of interpretability. We conduct experiments on several widely-used
pre-trained LMs. The results show that they perform very poorly on the
dimensions of knowledge and computation. And their plausibility in all
dimensions is far from satisfactory, especially when the rationale is short. In
addition, the pre-trained LMs we evaluated are not robust on syntax-aware data.
We will release this evaluation benchmark at \url{http://xyz}, and hope it can
facilitate the research progress of pre-trained LMs.

-- which we shall describe, we argue that, while the clarity and precision of
models are essential for their exchange and reuse, the way in which the data of
these models are defined and the information conveyed is also essential for
their (re) utilization -- e.g., for analysis or synthesis purposes. Category
Theory has made it possible to link seemingly separate fields or domains, so
that anything that can be rewritten in this framework benefits from a level of
abstraction and a relational viewpoint -- essential to address complexity. We
therefore take advantage of this framework to define a federated architecture
for projecting and conveying these models without sacrificing clarity and
precision. A federated architecture has two important advantages. On the one
hand, it unifies these models from their structure; on the other hand, it
allows a specific usage (instantiation or interpretation) of this structure
within a business domain. We define the structure of these models as a
symmetric multicategory. In particular, we rely on matrices over a semiring to
define morphisms and their composition. The choice of matrices is intended to
facilitate the application in practice.

quadratic computational complexity of standard Transformers caused by the
Softmax attention. However, most of them simply swap Softmax with an efficient
attention mechanism without considering the customized architectures specially
for the efficient attention. In this paper, we argue that the handcrafted
vanilla Transformer architectures for Softmax attention may not be suitable for
efficient Transformers. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to
find optimal architectures for efficient Transformers with the neural

popular machine translation and image classification tasks. We observe that the
optimal architecture of the efficient Transformer has the reduced computation
compared with that of the standard Transformer, but the general accuracy is
less comparable. It indicates that the Softmax attention and efficient
attention have their own distinctions but neither of them can simultaneously
balance the accuracy and efficiency well. This motivates us to mix the two
types of attention to reduce the performance imbalance. Besides the search
spaces that commonly used in existing NAS Transformer approaches, we propose a
new search space that allows the NAS algorithm to automatically search the

  Problems",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an algorithmic framework for various reconfiguration
problems using zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs), a data
structure for families of sets. In general, a reconfiguration problem checks if
there is a step-by-step transformation between two given feasible solutions
(e.g., independent sets of an input graph) of a fixed search problem such that
all intermediate results are also feasible and each step obeys a fixed
reconfiguration rule (e.g., adding/removing a single vertex to/from an
independent set). The solution space formed by all feasible solutions can be
exponential in the input size, and indeed many reconfiguration problems are
known to be PSPACE-complete. This paper shows that an algorithm in the proposed
framework efficiently conducts the breadth-first search by compressing the
solution space using ZDDs, and finds a shortest transformation between two
given feasible solutions if exists. Moreover, the proposed framework provides
rich information on the solution space, such as the connectivity of the
solution space and all feasible solutions reachable from a specified one. We
demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to various
reconfiguration problems, and experimentally evaluate their performances.

degradation is known (\eg, bicubic). These methods will suffer a severe
performance drop when the degradation is different from their assumption.
Therefore, some approaches attempt to train SR networks with the complex
combination of multiple degradations to cover the real degradation space. To
adapt to multiple unknown degradations, introducing an explicit degradation
estimator can actually facilitate SR performance. However, previous explicit
degradation estimation methods usually predict Gaussian blur with the
supervision of groundtruth blur kernels, and estimation errors may lead to SR
failure. Thus, it is necessary to design a method that can extract implicit
discriminative degradation representation. To this end, we propose a
Meta-Learning based Region Degradation Aware SR Network (MRDA), including
Meta-Learning Network (MLN), Degradation Extraction Network (DEN), and Region
Degradation Aware SR Network (RDAN). To handle the lack of groundtruth
degradation, we use the MLN to rapidly adapt to the specific complex
degradation after several iterations and extract implicit degradation
information. Subsequently, a teacher network MRDA$_{T}$ is designed to further
utilize the degradation information extracted by MLN for SR. However, MLN
requires iterating on paired low-resolution (LR) and corresponding
high-resolution (HR) images, which is unavailable in the inference phase.
Therefore, we adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to make the student network
learn to directly extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as
the teacher from LR images.

for particle collisions in particle-resolved simulations. Since the time step
required for resolving a collision process is much smaller than that for a
fluid flow, the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model by
reducing the time step is quite high in particle-resolved simulations. In one
state-of-the-art methodology, collision time is stretched to several times the
flow solver time step for the fluid to adapt to the sudden change in particle
motion. However, the stretched collision time is not physical, the hydrodynamic
force may be severely underestimated during a stretched collision, and the
simulation of sediment transport may be sensitive to the stretched collision
time. The proposed MTSA adopts different time steps to resolve fluid flow,
fluid-particle interaction, and particle collision. We assessed the MTSA for
particle-wall collisions as well as particle-particle collisions, determined
the optimal iteration number in the algorithm, and obtained excellent
agreements with experimental measurements and reference simulations. The
computational cost of the MTSA can be reduced to about one order of magnitude
less than that using the traditional soft-sphere model with almost the same
accuracy. The MTSA was then implemented in a particle-resolved simulation of
sediment transport with thousands of particles. {By comparing the results
obtained using the MTSA and a version of the stretching collision time
algorithm similar to Costa et al.(2015), we found that stretching the collision
time reduced particle stiffness, weakened particle entrainment, and affected
some turbulence and particle statistics.

remote sensing (RS) images is one of the most important research topics in RS.
To address MLC problems, the use of deep neural networks that require a high
number of reliable training images annotated by multiple land-cover class
labels (multi-labels) has been found popular in RS. However, collecting such
annotations is time-consuming and costly. A common procedure to obtain
annotations at zero labeling cost is to rely on thematic products or
crowdsourced labels. As a drawback, these procedures come with the risk of
label noise that can distort the learning process of the MLC algorithms. In the
literature, most label noise robust methods are designed for single-label
classification (SLC) problems in computer vision (CV), where each image is
annotated by a single label. Unlike SLC, label noise in MLC can be associated
with: 1) subtractive label-noise (a land cover class label is not assigned to
an image while that class is present in the image); 2) additive label-noise (a
land cover class label is assigned to an image although that class is not
present in the given image); and 3) mixed label-noise (a combination of both).
In this paper, we investigate three different noise robust CV SLC methods and
adapt them to be robust for multi-label noise scenarios in RS. During
experiments, we study the effects of different types of multi-label noise and
evaluate the adapted methods rigorously. To this end, we also introduce a
synthetic multi-label noise injection strategy that is more adequate to
simulate operational scenarios compared to the uniform label noise injection
strategy, in which the labels of absent and present classes are flipped at
uniform probability. Further, we study the relevance of different evaluation
metrics in MLC problems under noisy multi-labels.

information for documents. Most previous studies develop multimodal pre-trained
models in a self-supervised way. In this paper, we focus on the embedding
learning of word blocks containing text and layout information, and propose
UTel, a language model with Unified TExt and Layout pre-training. Specifically,
we propose two pre-training tasks: Surrounding Word Prediction (SWP) for the
layout learning, and Contrastive learning of Word Embeddings (CWE) for
identifying different word blocks. Moreover, we replace the commonly used 1D
position embedding with a 1D clipped relative position embedding. In this way,
the joint training of Masked Layout-Language Modeling (MLLM) and two newly
proposed tasks enables the interaction between semantic and spatial features in
a unified way. Additionally, the proposed UTel can process arbitrary-length
sequences by removing the 1D position embedding, while maintaining competitive
performance. Extensive experimental results show UTel learns better joint
representations and achieves superior performance than previous methods on
various downstream tasks, though requiring no image modality. Code is available

of temporally-ordered values, aka time series (TS). Such processes often
consist of multiple states, e.g. operating modes of a machine, such that state
changes in the observed processes result in changes in the distribution of
shape of the measured values. Time series segmentation (TSS) tries to find such
changes in TS post-hoc to deduce changes in the data-generating process. TSS is
typically approached as an unsupervised learning problem aiming at the
identification of segments distinguishable by some statistical property.
Current algorithms for TSS require domain-dependent hyper-parameters to be set
by the user, make assumptions about the TS value distribution or the types of
detectable changes which limits their applicability. Common hyperparameters are
the measure of segment homogeneity and the number of change points, which are
particularly hard to tune for each data set. We present ClaSP, a novel, highly
accurate, hyper-parameter-free and domain-agnostic method for TSS. ClaSP
hierarchically splits a TS into two parts. A change point is determined by
training a binary TS classifier for each possible split point and selecting the
one split that is best at identifying subsequences to be from either of the
partitions. ClaSP learns its main two model-parameters from the data using two
novel bespoke algorithms. In our experimental evaluation using a benchmark of
107 data sets, we show that ClaSP outperforms the state of the art in terms of
accuracy and is fast and scalable. Furthermore, we highlight properties of
ClaSP using several real-world case studies.

the system performance can be improved greatly. However, since the traffic
distribution in EC is heterogeneous and dynamic, it is difficult for an

edge servers. The previous server cooperation algorithms have disadvantages
since the cooperated region is limited within one-hop. However, the performance
of EC can be improved further by releasing the restriction of cooperation
region. Even some works have extended the cooperated region to multi-hops, they
fail to support the task offloading which is one of the core issues of edge
computing. Therefore, we propose a new decentralized and borderless server
cooperation algorithm for edge computing which takes task offloading strategy
into account, named CoNet. In CoNet, the cooperation region is not limited.
Each server forms its own basic cooperation unit (BCU) and calculates its
announced capability based on BCU. The server's capability, the processing
delay, the task and calculation result forwarding delay are considered during
the calculation. The task division strategy bases on the real capability of
host-server and the announced capability of cooperation-servers. This
cooperation process is recursive and will be terminated once the terminal

  Adaptive Admittance Control","RA-L IROS 2022",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Drilling a hole on a curved surface with a desired angle is prone to failure
when done manually, due to the difficulties in drill alignment and also
inherent instabilities of the task, potentially causing injury and fatigue to
the workers. On the other hand, it can be impractical to fully automate such a
task in real manufacturing environments because the parts arriving at an
assembly line can have various complex shapes where drill point locations are
not easily accessible, making automated path planning difficult. In this work,
an adaptive admittance controller with 6 degrees of freedom is developed and
deployed on a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 cobot such that the operator is able to
manipulate a drill mounted on the robot with one hand comfortably and open
holes on a curved surface with haptic guidance of the cobot and visual guidance
provided through an AR interface. Real-time adaptation of the admittance
damping provides more transparency when driving the robot in free space while
ensuring stability during drilling. After the user brings the drill
sufficiently close to the drill target and roughly aligns to the desired
drilling angle, the haptic guidance module fine tunes the alignment first and
then constrains the user movement to the drilling axis only, after which the
operator simply pushes the drill into the workpiece with minimal effort. Two
sets of experiments were conducted to investigate the potential benefits of the
haptic guidance module quantitatively (Experiment I) and also the practical
value of the proposed pHRI system for real manufacturing settings based on the
subjective opinion of the participants (Experiment II).

The model exploits the current state-of-the-art TEOBResumS-Dali model for

by Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, are replaced with the corresponding
functions that are linear in the symmetric mass ratio $\nu\equiv m_1
m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2$ taken at 8.5PN accuracy. To improve their strong-field

Pad\'e approximants and (ii) additionally effectively informed to
state-of-the-art numerical results obtained by gravitational self-force theory
(GSF). For simplicity, the spin-sector of the model is taken to be the one of
TEOBResumS-Dali, though removing the NR-informed spin-orbit effective

ices is based on a continuous representation of the sporadic desorption of ice
mantle components from classical (0.1 micron) dust grains. This has been
re-evaluated and developed to include tracking the desorption through
(extended) grain cooling profiles, consideration of grain size-dependencies and
constraints to the efficiencies. A model was then constructed to study the
true, sporadic, nature of the process with possible allowances from species
co-desorption and whole mantle desorption from very small grains. The key
results from the study are that the desorption rates are highly uncertain, but
almost certainly significantly larger than have been previously determined. For
typical interstellar grain size distributions it is found that the desorption
is dominated by the contributions from the smallest grains. The sporadic
desorption model shows that, if the interval between cosmic ray impacts is
comparable to, or less than, the freeze-out timescale, the continuous
representation is inapplicable; chemical changes may occur on very long
timescales, resulting in strong gas phase chemical enrichments that have very
non-linear dependences on the cosmic ray flux. The inclusion of even limited
levels of species co-desorption and/or the contribution from very small grains
further enhances the rates, especially for species such as H2O. In general we
find that cosmic-ray heating is the dominant desorption mechanism in dark
environments. These results may have important chemical implications for
protostellar and protoplanetary environments.

geoscience applications, such as reservoir management and geothermal energy
production. Modelling and simulation of these highly heterogeneous and
geometrically complex systems require the adoption of non-standard numerical
schemes. The Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) is a simple and effective
way to account for fractures with coarse and regular grids, but it suffers from
some limitations: it assumes a linear pressure distribution around fractures,
which holds true only far from the tips and fracture intersections, and it can
be employed for highly permeable fractures only. In this paper we propose an
improvement of EDFM which aims at overcoming these limitations computing an
improved coupling between fractures and the surrounding porous medium by a)
relaxing the linear pressure distribution assumption, b) accounting for
impermeable fractures modifying near-fracture transmissibilities. These results
are achieved by solving different types of local problems with a fine
conforming grid, and computing new transmissibilities (for connections between
fractures and the surrounding porous medium and those through the porous medium
itself near to the fractures). Such local problems are inspired from numerical
upscaling techniques present in the literature. The new method is called Local
Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (LEDFM) and the results obtained from several
numerical tests confirm the aforementioned improvements.

approaches struggle to predict high-quality masks with accurate boundary
details. Moreover, the predicted segmentations often fluctuate over time,
suggesting that temporal consistency cues are neglected or not fully utilized.
In this paper, we set out to tackle these issues, with the aim of achieving
highly detailed and more temporally stable mask predictions for VIS. We first
propose the Video Mask Transfiner (VMT) method, capable of leveraging
fine-grained high-resolution features thanks to a highly efficient video
transformer structure. Our VMT detects and groups sparse error-prone
spatio-temporal regions of each tracklet in the video segment, which are then
refined using both local and instance-level cues. Second, we identify that the
coarse boundary annotations of the popular YouTube-VIS dataset constitute a
major limiting factor. Based on our VMT architecture, we therefore design an
automated annotation refinement approach by iterative training and
self-correction. To benchmark high-quality mask predictions for VIS, we
introduce the HQ-YTVIS dataset, consisting of a manually re-annotated test set
and our automatically refined training data. We compare VMT with the most
recent state-of-the-art methods on the HQ-YTVIS, as well as the Youtube-VIS,
OVIS and BDD100K MOTS benchmarks. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the
efficacy and effectiveness of our method on segmenting complex and dynamic

nanoscopic systems, where electron transfer between electrodes can be realized

quantum dot system in the chosen geometry, interference of electrons
transferred between electrodes via the interfacial quantum dot and electrons
scattered on the side dot gives rise to Fano-like interference. If such a
system is additionally coupled to a superconducting electrode, together with
the well-understood Fano resonance an additional resonance appears on the
opposite side of the Fermi level. In the recent work [Sci. Rep. 10, 2881

oscillations between subsystems; (ii) we estimate the time required for each

indispensable, a lack of which would result in vulnerability to rare but

However, reasoning from a global context requires access to sensors of multiple
types and adequate fusion of multi-modal sensor signals, which is difficult to
achieve. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability in learning models
also hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In this paper, we
propose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable
Sensor Fusion Transformer(InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information
from multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene
understanding and adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate
interpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more

pulses. A thorough zoning analysis is performed for all laser driven high-Z
foils over a wide intensity range of $10^{12}-10^{15} W/cm^{2}$ with
appropriately chosen photon energy range and recombination parameter. The
resulting variation of conversion efficiency over the full intensity range
exhibits an optimum for all materials which is explained by considering the
characteristic emission contributions from two different regions of laser
irradiated plasma, namely, conversion layer and remission zone. A new
generalized single scaling relation based upon smooth broken power law is
proposed for conversion efficiency variation along with the separate
determination ($\eta_{S}$, $\eta_{M}$) in soft and hard/M-band x-ray regions.
It has been observed that $\eta_{S}$ for Pb and W always lies in between that
for Au and U for intensities smaller than $\sim 3\times 10^{13} W/cm^{2}$. On
further increase in intensity, $\eta_{S}$ is observed to be maximum for Au and
U whereas it is minimum for W. Significant contribution to M-band conversion
efficiencies is observed in all elements for intensities higher than $\sim
2\times 10^{13} W/cm^{2}$ with maximum and minimum values attained by W and U,

transfer function of the plant nominal model with stable zeros are unknown and
belong to a known bounded polyhedron in the space of coefficients. The gains of
coprime factor perturbations of the plant and the upper bound of external
disturbance are also unknown. The problem under consideration is to design
adaptive controller that minimizes, with the prescribed accuracy, the
worst-case asymptotic upper bound of the output. Solution of the problem is
based on set-membership estimation of unknown parameters and treating the
control criterion as the identification criterion. A hard nonconvex problem of
on-line computation of optimal estimates is reduced, under additional
nonrestrictive assumption, to a linear-fractional programming via a nonlinear
transformation of estimated parameters. Despite the non-identifiability of the
unknown parameters, the proposed adaptive controller guarantees, with the
prescribed accuracy, the same optimal asymptotic upper bound of the output of
adaptive system as the optimal controller for the plant with known parameters.
In addition to the optimality of adaptive control, the proposed solution
provides on-line verification/validation of current estimates and a priori
assumptions.

meteoroid cluster from 2016. We assumed that the mass-dominated meteoroid is
the parent body of the cluster and that the observed positions of meteoroids
are controlled by the ejection velocities and the action of solar radiation
pressure. A formula for the dependence of meteoroid ejection velocities on the
mutual positions, masses, and cluster age was derived. Knowing values and
directions of ejection velocities together with meteoroid masses then allowed
us to determine the most likely process of cluster formation.
  The meteoroids occupy a volume of 66$\times$67$\times$50 km and are shifted
in the antisolar direction by 27 km relative to the parent meteoroid. The age
of the cluster is 2.28$\pm$0.44 days. The ejection velocities range from
0.13$\pm$0.05 m/s to 0.77$\pm$0.34 m/s with a mean value of 0.35 m/s. The
ejection velocity directions are inside the cone with an apex angle of
101$\pm$5$^\circ$. The axis of the cone is $\sim$45$^\circ$ away from the solar
direction and $\sim$34$^\circ$ away from the mean direction of the flux of
small meteoroids' incident on the parent meteoroid. Formation due to the
separation of part of the surface due to very fast rotation is the least likely
thing to occur. We estimate the rotation frequency to be about 2 Hz and the
corresponding stress is several orders of magnitude lower than the predicted
strength limit. It is also difficult to explain the formation of the cluster by
an impact of a small meteoroid on the parent body. However, this possibility,
although not very likely, cannot be completely ruled out. The most probable
process is the exfoliation due to thermal stresses. Their estimated magnitude
is sufficient and the derived ejection velocities are consistent with this
process of formation.

both in the distribution-independent as well as the distribution-specific
setting, based on the assumption that worst-case lattice problems, such as
GapSVP or SIVP, are hard. In particular, we show that under this assumption
there is no efficient algorithm that outputs any binary hypothesis, not
necessarily a halfspace, achieving misclassfication error better than $\frac 1
2 - \gamma$ even if the optimal misclassification error is as small is as small
as $\delta$. Here, $\gamma$ can be smaller than the inverse of any polynomial
in the dimension and $\delta$ as small as $exp(-\Omega(\log^{1-c}(d)))$, where
$0 < c < 1$ is an arbitrary constant and $d$ is the dimension. For the
distribution-specific setting, we show that if the marginal distribution is
standard Gaussian, for any $\beta > 0$ learning halfspaces up to error
$OPT_{LTF} + \epsilon$ takes time at least
$d^{\tilde{\Omega}(1/\epsilon^{2-\beta})}$ under the same hardness assumptions.
Similarly, we show that learning degree-$\ell$ polynomial threshold functions
up to error $OPT_{{PTF}_\ell} + \epsilon$ takes time at least
$d^{\tilde{\Omega}(\ell^{2-\beta}/\epsilon^{2-\beta})}$. $OPT_{LTF}$ and
$OPT_{{PTF}_\ell}$ denote the best error achievable by any halfspace or
polynomial threshold function, respectively.
  Our lower bounds qualitively match algorithmic guarantees and (nearly)
recover known lower bounds based on non-worst-case assumptions. Previously,
such hardness results [Daniely16, DKPZ21] were based on average-case complexity
assumptions or restricted to the statistical query model. Our work gives the
first hardness results basing these fundamental learning problems on worst-case
complexity assumptions. It is inspired by a sequence of recent works showing
hardness of learning well-separated Gaussian mixtures based on worst-case

branches. The larger the history, the richer the information that the predictor
can exploit for discovering predictive patterns. However, without appropriate
filtering, such an approach may also heavily disorganize the predictor's
internal mechanisms, leading to diminishing returns. This paper studies a
fundamental control-flow property: the sparsity in the correlation between
branches and recent history. First, we show that sparse branch correlations
exist in standard applications and, more importantly, such correlations can be
computed efficiently using sparse modeling methods. Second, we introduce a
sparsity-aware branch prediction mechanism that can compactly encode and store
sparse models to unlock essential performance opportunities. We evaluated our

dynamical vertex approximation. We find the sweet spot for high $T_{\rm c}$ to
be at intermediate coupling, moderate Fermi surface warping, and low hole

by Stokes parameters. Analysis of polarization states can reveal valuable
information about the sources. In this paper, we propose a separable low-rank
quaternion linear mixing model to polarized signals: we assume each column of
the source factor matrix equals a column of polarized data matrix and refer to
the corresponding problem as separable quaternion matrix factorization (SQMF).
We discuss some properties of the matrix that can be decomposed by SQMF. To
determine the source factor matrix in quaternion space, we propose a heuristic
algorithm called quaternion successive projection algorithm (QSPA) inspired by
the successive projection algorithm. To guarantee the effectiveness of QSPA, a
new normalization operator is proposed for the quaternion matrix. We use a
block coordinate descent algorithm to compute nonnegative factor activation

significance because it is the dominant source of both chondritic meteorites
and near-Earth asteroids. This inner belt is bounded by an eccentricity-type
secular resonance and by the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unless
asteroid perihelia are low enough to allow scattering by Mars, escape requires
transport to one of the bounding resonances. In addition Yarkovsky forces are
generally ineffective in changing either the eccentricity and/or inclination
for asteroids with diameter $\gtrsim$30 km. Thus, large asteroids with
pericentres far from Mars may only escape from the inner belt through large
changes in their eccentricities. In this paper we study chaotic diffusion of
orbits near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars in a systematic way. We
show that, while chaotic orbital evolution in both resonant and non-resonant
orbits increase the dispersion of the inclinations and eccentricities, it does
not significantly change their mean values. We show further that, while the
dispersive growth is greatest for resonant orbits, at high $e$ the resonance
acts to mitigate asteroid scattering by Mars - making the asteroid lifetime in
the belt longer than it would have been for a non-resonant orbit. For asteroids
of all sizes in both resonant and non-resonant orbits, the changes in
eccentricity needed to account for the observations cannot be achieved by
gravitational forces alone. The role of resonant trapping in protecting
asteroids from encounters with Mars is also analysed.

band with a Q factor (frequency/width) of 2--4. Benefiting from the broad
energy band of hxmt, we study the energy dependence of the 60 mHz QRM in 1--100

increases with photon energy, while the time lags of the mHz QRM are soft and
decrease with photon energy. Fast recurrence of the mHz QRM, in a timescale of
less than one hour, has been observed during the outburst. During this period,
the corresponding energy spectra moderately change when the source transitions
from the QRM state to the non-QRM state. The QRM phenomena also shows a
dependence with the accretion rate. We suggest that the QRM could be caused by
an unknown accretion instability aroused from the corona.

proximity-induced superconductivity. We observed interplay between Andreev
reflection and Kondo resonance at mesoscopic interfaces between superconducting
Nb and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Above the critical temperature ($T_c$) of Nb, the
recorded differential conductance ($dI/dV$) spectra display a robust zero-bias
anomaly which is described well by a characteristic Fano line shape arising
from Kondo resonance. Below $T_c$, the Fano line mixes with Andreev reflection
dominated $dI/dV$ leading to a dramatic, unconventional suppression of
conductance at zero bias. As a consequence, an analysis of the Andreev
reflection spectra within a spin-polarized model yields an anomalously large
spin-polarization which is not explained by the density of states of the

Localization of the exciton within the junction area is accompanied by the
appearance of the dipole moment induced by the local electric field. The dipole

community. Such group-structured interactions can have a profound impact on the
behaviors that evolve. Group structure affects the way people cooperate, and
how they reciprocate each other's cooperative actions. Past work has shown that
population structure and reciprocity can both promote the evolution of
cooperation. Yet the impact of these mechanisms has been typically studied in
isolation. In this work, we study how the two mechanisms interact. Using a
game-theoretic model, we explore how people engage in reciprocal cooperation in
group-structured populations, compared to well-mixed populations of equal size.
To derive analytical results, we focus on two scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume a complete separation of time scales. Mutations are rare compared to
between-group comparisons, which themselves are rare compared to within-group
comparisons. In the second scenario, there is a partial separation of time
scales, where mutations and between-group comparisons occur at a comparable
rate. In both scenarios, we find that the effect of population structure
depends on the benefit of cooperation. When this benefit is small,
group-structured populations are more cooperative. But when the benefit is
large, well-mixed populations result in more cooperation. Overall, our results
reveal how group structure can sometimes enhance and sometimes suppress the
evolution of cooperation.

ensemble are neither fixed nor learned, but are progressively updated during
the training process in a way that by the end of the training only the ReLU
activations remain active in the network and the other activations can be
removed. This means that in inference time the network contains ReLU
activations only. We perform extensive evaluations on the ImageNet
classification task using various compact network architectures and various

confirms the applicability of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate

radio emission. We conducted a multi-frequency radio campaign using the ATCA
interferometer (band-names: 16cm, 4cm, and 15mm). The target was detected in
all bands. The most obvious explanation for the radio emission is that it
originates in the magnetosphere of the Ap star, but this is shown unfeasible.
The known stellar parameters of the Ap star enable us to exploit the scaling
relationship for non-thermal gyro-synchrotron emission from early-type magnetic
stars. This is a general relation demonstrating how radio emission from stars
with centrifugal magnetospheres is supported by rotation. Using KQVel's
parameters the predicted radio luminosity is more than five orders of
magnitudes lower than the measured one. The extremely long rotation period
rules out the Ap star as the source of the observed radio emission. Other
possible explanations for the radio emission from KQVel, involving its unknown
companion, have been explored. A scenario that matches the observed features
(i.e. radio luminosity and spectrum, correlation to X-rays) is a hierarchical
stellar system, where the possible companion of the magnetic star is a close
binary (possibly of RSCVn type) with at least one magnetically active late-type
star. To be compatible with the total mass of the system, the last scenario
places strong constraints on the orbital inclination of the KQVel stellar

films. We combine a temporal biglobal stability analysis based on the
linearized Navier-Stokes equations with experiments measuring the spatial
growth rate of sinusoidal waves flowing downstream an inclined channel. Very
good agreement was found when comparing the theoretical and experimental
results. Strong lateral confinement of the channel stabilises the flow. In the
wavenumber-Reynolds number space, the instability region experiences a
fragmentation due to selective damping of moderate wavenumbers. For this range
of parameters, the three dimensional confined problem shows several prominent
stability modes which are classified into two categories, the well known
Kapitza hydrodynamic instability mode (H-mode), and a new unstable mode, we
refer to it as wall-mode (W-mode). The two mode types are stabilised
differently, where the H-modes are stabilized at small wavenumbers, while the
W-modes experience stabilization at high wavenumbers, and at sufficiently small
channel widths, only the W-mode is observed. The reason behind the unique
H-modes stabilisation is that they become analogous to waveguide modes, which
can not propagate below a certain cut-off wavenumber. The spatial structure of
the eigenmodes experiences significant restructuring at wavenumbers smaller
than the most damped wavenumber. The mode switching preserves the spatial
symmetry of the unstable mode.

several parameters. The experiments were performed at the Mainz Microtron

solid-state butanol targets. The reaction products were analyzed with the

to T (target asymmetry) and F (beam-target asymmetry) for single pion

the persistence diagram of the maxima of flow enstrophy (an established
vorticity indicator), for the topological representation of 180 ensemble
members, generated by a coarse sampling of the parameter space of five
numerical solvers. We document five main hypotheses reported by domain experts,
describing their expectations regarding the variability of the flows generated
by the distinct solver configurations. We contribute three evaluation protocols
to assess the validation of the above hypotheses by two comparison measures:
(i) a standard distance used in scientific imaging (the L2 norm) and (ii) an
established topological distance between persistence diagrams (the
L2-Wasserstein metric). Extensive experiments on the input ensemble demonstrate
the superiority of the topological distance (ii) to report as close to each
other flows which are expected to be similar by domain experts, due to the
configuration of their vortices. Overall, the insights reported by our study
bring an experimental evidence of the suitability of TDA for representing and
comparing turbulent flows, thereby providing to the fluid dynamics community
confidence for its usage in future work. Also, our flow data and evaluation
protocols provide to the TDA community an application-approved benchmark for
the evaluation and design of further topological distances.

large-scale datasets with pixel-wise annotations. However, due to the ambiguous
boundary, annotating camouflage objects pixel-wisely is very time-consuming and
labor-intensive, taking ~60mins to label one image. In this paper, we propose
the first weakly-supervised COD method, using scribble annotations as
supervision. To achieve this, we first relabel 4,040 images in existing
camouflaged object datasets with scribbles, which takes ~10s to label one
image. As scribble annotations only describe the primary structure of objects
without details, for the network to learn to localize the boundaries of
camouflaged objects, we propose a novel consistency loss composed of two parts:
a cross-view loss to attain reliable consistency over different images, and an
inside-view loss to maintain consistency inside a single prediction map.
Besides, we observe that humans use semantic information to segment regions
near the boundaries of camouflaged objects. Hence, we further propose a
feature-guided loss, which includes visual features directly extracted from
images and semantically significant features captured by the model. Finally, we
propose a novel network for COD via scribble learning on structural information
and semantic relations. Our network has two novel modules: the local-context
contrasted (LCC) module, which mimics visual inhibition to enhance image
contrast/sharpness and expand the scribbles into potential camouflaged regions,
and the logical semantic relation (LSR) module, which analyzes the semantic
relation to determine the regions representing the camouflaged object.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms relevant SOTA methods on
three COD benchmarks with an average improvement of 11.0% on MAE, 3.2% on
S-measure, 2.5% on E-measure, and 4.4% on weighted F-measure.

In 2020 April-June,
this source underwent the second highest X-ray outburst (second only to the

In this paper, we discuss two scenarios to explore the origin of the outburst:
an after-effect of a black hole-disc impact and a tidal disruption event (TDE).
We present the weak correlations of the spectral index versus X-ray flux and
the hardness ratio (HR) versus the soft X-ray flux during the outburst, and
these features are different from the case in the quiescent state. The
correlations are compared with those of the 2016-2017 outburst with the highest
X-ray flux in monitoring history. Analysis of the outbursts in 2016-2017 and
2020 shows that the expected time of the X-ray outburst, based on the theory of
the after-effect of the black hole-disc impact and the estimation of available
data, is inconsistent with historical observations. The soft X-ray spectra, the
barely temporal evolution of colour, and the evolution of the HR mean that the
2020 outburst shares similar features with the 2016-2017 outburst, which was
considered as a possible candidate for a TDE. Additionally, we find that the
predictions of full TDEs ($t^{-5/3}$) and partial TDEs ($t^{-9/4}$) for the
soft X-ray decay light curve are well fitted. Our analysis suggests that the
2020 outburst in OJ 287 is probably related to the TDE candidate.

is cost-intensive and a multi-faceted task fraught with potential problems.
While computer science focuses mostly on the technical questions to mitigate
social issues, social science addresses citizens' perceptions to elucidate
social and political demands that influence the societal implementation of AI
systems. Thus, in this study, we explore the salience of AI issues in the
public with an emphasis on ethical criteria to investigate whether it is likely
that ethical AI is actively requested by the population. Between May 2020 and
April 2021, we conducted 15 surveys asking the German population about the most
important AI-related issues (total of N=14,988 respondents). Our results show
that the majority of respondents were not concerned with AI at all. However, it
can be seen that general interest in AI and a higher educational level are
predictive of some engagement with AI. Among those, who reported having thought
about AI, specific applications (e.g., autonomous driving) were by far the most
mentioned topics. Ethical issues are voiced only by a small subset of citizens
with fairness, accountability, and transparency being the least mentioned ones.
These have been identified in several ethical guidelines (including the EU
Commission's proposal) as key elements for the development of ethical AI. The
salience of ethical issues affects the behavioral intentions of citizens in the
way that they 1) tend to avoid AI technology and 2) engage in public
discussions about AI. We conclude that the low level of ethical implications
may pose a serious problem for the actual implementation of ethical AI for the
Common Good and emphasize that those who are presumably most affected by
ethical issues of AI are especially unaware of ethical risks. Yet, once ethical
AI is top of the mind, there is some potential for activism.

achieved prominent advances in past years. However, such prosperity could not
camouflage the unsatisfactory situation of Small Object Detection (SOD), one of
the notoriously challenging tasks in computer vision, owing to the poor visual
appearance and noisy representation caused by the intrinsic structure of small
targets. In addition, large-scale dataset for benchmarking small object
detection methods remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we first conduct a
thorough review of small object detection. Then, to catalyze the development of
SOD, we construct two large-scale Small Object Detection dAtasets (SODA),
SODA-D and SODA-A, which focus on the Driving and Aerial scenarios
respectively. SODA-D includes 24828 high-quality traffic images and 278433
instances of nine categories. For SODA-A, we harvest 2513 high resolution
aerial images and annotate 872069 instances over nine classes. The proposed
datasets, as we know, are the first-ever attempt to large-scale benchmarks with
a vast collection of exhaustively annotated instances tailored for
multi-category SOD. Finally, we evaluate the performance of mainstream methods
on SODA. We expect the released benchmarks could facilitate the development of
SOD and spawn more breakthroughs in this field. Datasets and codes are

substitution Au-C bond length $r_s$ from 0.23 to 0.04 pm agreement with

the reaction PbH$_4$ -> PbH$_2$ + H$_2$, which is thereby a good candidate for
observing QED effects in chemical reactions, as proposed in [K. G. Dyall et
al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 348 , 497 (2001)]. QED contributes 0.32 kcal/mol to the

hydrides of superheavy flerovium, the electronic structures are quite similar.
Interestingly, the QED contribution to the reaction energy is of quite similar
magnitude (0.35 kcal/mol), whereas the relative change is significantly smaller
(-0.50 %). This curious observation can be explained by the faster increase of
negative vacuum polarization over positive electron self-energy contributions
as a function of nuclear charge.

not only the same as 1-D CS in terms of performance but also slightly lower in

such length, and a state $v_0$, such that $\omega$ sends all states to $v_0$.
Prior to this work, the best upper bound was the quasilinear bound
$O(n\log^3n)$ due to Nicaud (2016). The correct scaling exponent had been
subject to various estimates by other authors between $0.5$ and $0.56$ based on
numerical simulations, and our result confirms that the smallest one indeed
gives a valid upper bound (with a log factor).
  Our proof introduces the concept of $w$-trees, for a word $w$, that is,
automata in which the $w$-transitions induce a (loop-rooted) tree. We prove a
strong structure result that says that, w.h.p., a random automaton on $n$
states is a $w$-tree for some word $w$ of length at most
$(1+\epsilon)\log_2(n)$, for any $\epsilon>0$. The existence of the (random)

of trigonal prisms embedded between slabs of octahedra. Here, we develop a

antiferromagnetic. Dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal the
orbitally selective Mott state of the Fe ions and tendency of conductivity to
low-dimensional behavior with particular enhancement along the 1D chains.
Across the series, the decoupling of the chains increases, and so with the

allow experimental realization of the model system of coupled 1D wires. We
point out the possibility to stabilize these compounds in the thin-film form

distinguish whether each relevant evidence is supporting (S) or refuting (R)

impact Dimorphos, the secondary component of the Didymos binary asteroid
system, which will excite Dimorphos's dynamical state and lead to significant
libration about the synchronous state and possibly chaotic non-principal axis
rotation. Although this particular outcome is human caused, many other
secondary components of binary systems are also prone to such exotic spin
states. For a satellite in an excited spin state, the time-varying tidal and
rotational environment can lead to significant surface accelerations. Depending
on the circumstances, this mechanism may drive granular motion on the surface
of the secondary. We modeled the dynamical evolution of a Didymos-like binary
asteroid system using a fully coupled, three-dimensional simulation code. Then,
we computed the time-varying gravitational and rotational accelerations felt
over the entire surface resulting from the secondary's perturbed dynamical
state. We find that an excited spin and orbit can induce large changes in the
effective surface slope, potentially triggering granular motion and surface
refreshment. However, for the case of the DART impact, this effect is highly
dependent on many unknowns, such as Dimorphos's detailed shape, bulk density,
surface geology, and the momentum transferred. Aside from the Didymos system
and the DART mission, this effect also has important implications for binary
systems in general.

to savanna [1,2]. Therefore, perturbation by climate change or human impact may
lead to crossing of a tipping point beyond which there is rapid large-scale
forest dieback that is not easily reversed [3-5]. Empirical evidence for
bistability due to fire-vegetation feedbacks relies on tree cover bimodality in
satellite-observed data [1,2], but this may also be explained by spatial
heterogeneity [6], or by biases in the data [7,8]. Theoretical evidence for
bistability [9-11] does not consider the interaction of fire with the
vegetation landscape. Focusing on landscapes consisting of tropical forest and
grassland, we show that the microscopic rules of fire and vegetation spread (as
proposed by [12]) lead to an emergent relation between macroscopic forest
structure and dynamics. This relation defines a landscape-scale balance
equation of forest area change in which the forest perimeter determines the
nonlinearity in forest growth while the forest perimeter weighted by adjacent
grassland area determines the nonlinearity in forest loss. We demonstrate that
our equation enables analysis of resilience or abrupt shifts for a given
landscape, using only the landscape state at a single point in time and
measurable parameters of the underlying microscopic spatial processes, thereby
avoiding the problems associated with reliance on bimodality.

of axioms leaving the underlying design opaque. However, a principled and
systematic ontology development life cycle is likely to be reflected in
regularities of the ontology's emergent syntactic structure. To develop an
understanding of this emergent structure, we propose to reverse-engineer
ontologies taking a syntax-directed approach for identifying and analysing
regularities for axioms and sets of axioms. We survey BioPortal in terms of
syntactic modelling trends and common practices for OWL axioms and class
frames. Our findings suggest that biomedical ontologies only share simple
syntactic structures in which OWL constructors are not deeply nested or
combined in a complex manner. While such simple structures often account for
large proportions of axioms in a given ontology, many ontologies also contain
non-trivial amounts of more complex syntactic structures that are not common

a mean density of 1.89$^{+0.52}_{-0.45}$ g/cm$^3$. The low density of the

it immediately above the radius valley at the lower end of the mini-Neptune

analytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built
upon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as
location, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common
modeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived
features are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the
distance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via
role-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the
game. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor
of global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic
graph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graph
representation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes.
Our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player
interaction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statistically
significant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both

former has received significant attention in the literature. To remedy this, we
propose FedVARP, a novel variance reduction algorithm applied at the server
that eliminates error due to partial client participation. To do so, the server
simply maintains in memory the most recent update for each client and uses
these as surrogate updates for the non-participating clients in every round.
Further, to alleviate the memory requirement at the server, we propose a novel
clustering-based variance reduction algorithm ClusterFedVARP. Unlike previously
proposed methods, both FedVARP and ClusterFedVARP do not require additional
computation at clients or communication of additional optimization parameters.
Through extensive experiments, we show that FedVARP outperforms

learning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple
co-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and

  Computing",,,,,"quant-ph cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum computing has attracted considerable public attention due to its
exponential speedup over classical computing. Despite its advantages, today's
quantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To
guarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it
is crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the
compiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make
users aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we
fill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware
quantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum
computing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer
Evolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of
the noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates
quick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum
algorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables
detailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits. We extensively evaluate
the performance of VACSEN through two case studies on quantum algorithms of
different scales and an in-depth interviews with 12 quantum computing users.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VACSEN in achieving
noise-aware quantum computing.

  Best-Response Diversity","Accepted in Transactions of Machine Learning Research",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is the challenge of designing a robust learner agent
that effectively collaborates with unknown teammates without prior coordination
mechanisms. Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner
with a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on
an expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter.
However, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge
is not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve
the robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated
by optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with
optimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy
generation is the emergence of superficially different teammates. When used for
AHT training, superficially different teammate behaviours may not improve a
learner's robustness during collaboration with unknown teammates. In this
paper, we present an automated teammate policy generation method optimising the
Best-Response Diversity (BRDiv) metric, which measures diversity based on the
compatibility of teammate policies in terms of returns. We evaluate our
approach in environments with multiple valid coordination strategies, comparing
against methods optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics and an
ablation not optimising any diversity metric. Our experiments indicate that
optimising BRDiv yields a diverse set of training teammate policies that
improve the learner's performance relative to previous teammate generation
approaches when collaborating with near-optimal previously unseen teammate
policies.

with names and binding following the Gabbay-Pitts nominal approach. Matching
logic is the foundation of the $\mathbb{K}$ framework, used to specify
programming languages and automatically derive associated tools (compilers,
debuggers, model checkers, program verifiers). Matching logic does not include
a primitive notion of name binding, though binding operators can be represented
via an encoding that internalises the graph of a function from bound names to
expressions containing bound names. This approach is sufficient to represent
computations involving binding operators, but has not been reconciled with
support for inductive reasoning over syntax with binding (e.g., reasoning over
$\lambda$-terms). Nominal logic is a formal system for reasoning about names
and binding, which provides well-behaved and powerful principles for inductive
reasoning over syntax with binding, and NML inherits these principles. We
discuss design alternatives for the syntax and the semantics of NML, prove
meta-theoretical properties and give examples to illustrate its expressive
power. In particular, we show how induction principles for $\lambda$-terms
($\alpha$-structural induction) can be defined and used to prove standard
properties of the $\lambda$-calculus.

how quickly the agent is able to differentiate between rewarding actions and
hostile actions.This can be tested by placing the agent in an environment with
different types of hurdles and the goal of the agent is to reach the farthest
by taking decisions on actions that will lead to avoiding all the obstacles.The
environment chosen is a game called ""Flappy Bird"".The goal of the game is to
make the bird fly through a set of pipes of random heights.The bird must go in
between these pipes and must not hit the top, the bottom, or the pipes
themselves.The actions that the bird can take are either to flap its wings or
drop down with gravity.The algorithms that are enforced on the artificial
agents are NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and Reinforcement
Learning.The NEAT algorithm takes an ""N"" initial population of artificial
agents.They follow genetic algorithms by considering an objective function,
crossover, mutation, and augmenting topologies.Reinforcement learning, on the
other hand, remembers the state, the action taken at that state, and the reward
received for the action taken using a single agent and a Deep Q-learning
Network.The performance of the NEAT algorithm improves as the initial
population of the artificial agents is increased.

the pulsar, and an X-ray-emitting non-equilibrium ionisation plasma previously

symmetry of linear-cluster states, we can estimate the effectiveness of
circuit-cutting for simulating up to 33-qubit linear-cluster states, using at
most 4 physical qubits for each subcircuit. Specifically, for the 12-qubit
linear-cluster state, we found that the experimental fidelity bound can reach

circuit-cutting represents a feasible approach of simulating quantum circuits

  Conflicts at Intersections",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pedestrian safety has become an important research topic among various
studies due to the increased number of pedestrian-involved crashes. To evaluate
pedestrian safety proactively, surrogate safety measures (SSMs) have been
widely used in traffic conflict-based studies as they do not require historical
crashes as inputs. However, most existing SSMs were developed based on the
assumption that road users would maintain constant velocity and direction. Risk
estimations based on this assumption are less unstable, more likely to be
exaggerated, and unable to capture the evasive maneuvers of drivers.
Considering the limitations among existing SSMs, this study proposes a
probabilistic framework for estimating the risk of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts
at intersections. The proposed framework loosen restrictions of constant speed
by predicting trajectories using a Gaussian Process Regression and accounts for
the different possible driver maneuvers with a Random Forest model. Real-world
LiDAR data collected at an intersection was used to evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework. The newly developed framework is able to identify all
pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Compared to the Time-to-Collision, the proposed
framework provides a more stable risk estimation and captures the evasive
maneuvers of vehicles. Moreover, the proposed framework does not require
expensive computation resources, which makes it an ideal choice for real-time
proactive pedestrian safety solutions at intersections.

Specifically, we apply a recently introduced Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based
algorithm in order to estimate uplink channels stemming from a measurement
campaign. For this estimator, there is an initial (offline) training phase,
where a GMM is fitted onto given channel (training) data. Thereafter, the
fitted GMM is used for (online) channel estimation. Our experiments suggest
that the GMM estimator learns the intrinsic characteristics of a given base
station's whole radio propagation environment. Essentially, this ambient
information is captured due to universal approximation properties of the
initially fitted GMM. For a large enough number of GMM components, the GMM
estimator was shown to approximate the (unknown) mean squared error
(MSE)-optimal channel estimator arbitrarily well. In our experiments, the GMM
estimator shows significant performance gains compared to approaches that are
not able to capture the ambient information. To validate the claim that ambient
information is learnt, we generate synthetic channel data using a
state-of-the-art channel simulator and train the GMM estimator once on these
and once on the real data, and we apply the estimator once to the synthetic and
once to the real data. We then observe how providing suitable ambient
information in the training phase beneficially impacts the later channel
estimation performance.

embedded protostellar disks. How such large grains grow from the micron size
(or less) in the earliest phase of star formation remains relatively
unexplored. In this study we take a first step to model the grain growth in the
protostellar environment, using two-dimensional (2D axisymmetric) radiation
hydrodynamic and grain growth simulations. We show that the grain growth
calculations can be greatly simplified by the ""terminal velocity
approximation"", where the dust drift velocity relative to the gas is
proportional to its stopping time, which is proportional to the grain size. We
find that the grain-grain collision from size-dependent terminal velocity alone
is too slow to convert a significant fraction of the initially micron-sized
grains into mm/cm sizes during the deeply embedded Class 0 phase. Substantial
grain growth is achieved when the grain-grain collision speed is enhanced by a
factor of 4. The dust growth above and below the disk midplane enables the
grains to settle faster towards the midplane, which increases the local
dust-to-gas ratio, which, in turn, speeds up further growth there. How this
needed enhancement can be achieved is unclear, although turbulence is a strong
possibility that deserves further exploration.

RHA-Net is built by integrating residual blocks (ResBlocks) and hybrid
attention blocks into the encoder-decoder architecture. The ResBlocks are used
to improve the ability of RHA-Net to extract high-level abstract features. The
hybrid attention blocks are designed to fuse both low-level features and
high-level features to help the model focus on correct channels and areas of
cracks, thereby improving the feature presentation ability of RHA-Net. An image
data set containing 789 pavement crack images collected by a self-designed
mobile robot is constructed and used for training and evaluating the proposed
model. Compared with other state-of-the-art networks, the proposed model
achieves better performance and the functionalities of adding residual blocks
and hybrid attention mechanisms are validated in a comprehensive ablation
study. Additionally, a light-weighted version of the model generated by
introducing depthwise separable convolution achieves better a performance and a
much faster processing speed with 1/30 of the number of U-Net parameters. The

orbiting the star. We assume that the star is composed of concentric spheroids
of constant density, with a global power-law distribution of density inside the
star. At the lowest order approximation, we recover the known result for the
Maclaurin spheroid that the maximum in the radial epicyclic frequency occurs at
$r=\sqrt{2}ae$, for eccentricities $\geq 1/\sqrt{2}$. We find that the nature
of these characteristic frequencies differs based on the geometry of the
rotating star. For an oblate spheroid, the orbits resemble retrograde-Kerr
orbits and the location of the radial epicyclic maximum approaches the stellar
surface as the density variation inside the star becomes steeper. On the
contrary, orbits around a prolate spheroid resemble prograde-Kerr orbits, but
the marginally stable orbit does not exist for prolate-shaped stars. The
orbital frequency is larger (smaller) than the Keplerian value for an oblate
(prolate) star with the equality attained as $e \rightarrow 0$ or $r

angular momentum allow for a stable accreting disc around any nature of

tasks. We observe that DETR's slow convergence is largely attributed to the
difficulty in matching object queries to relevant regions due to the unaligned

observation, we design Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR++ (SAM-DETR++) to
accelerate DETR's convergence and improve detection performance. The core of
SAM-DETR++ is a plug-and-play module that projects object queries and encoded
image features into the same feature embedding space, where each object query
can be easily matched to relevant regions with similar semantics. Besides,
SAM-DETR++ searches for multiple representative keypoints and exploits their
features for semantic-aligned matching with enhanced representation capacity.
Furthermore, SAM-DETR++ can effectively fuse multi-scale features in a
coarse-to-fine manner on the basis of the designed semantic-aligned matching.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed SAM-DETR++ achieves superior
convergence speed and competitive detection accuracy. Additionally, as a

learning remains a challenging problem in HOI detection: existing methods
usually generate redundant negative H-O pair proposals and fail to effectively
extract interactive pairs. Though interactiveness has been studied in both
whole body- and part- level and facilitates the H-O pairing, previous works
only focus on the target person once (i.e., in a local perspective) and
overlook the information of the other persons. In this paper, we argue that
comparing body-parts of multi-person simultaneously can afford us more useful
and supplementary interactiveness cues. That said, to learn body-part
interactiveness from a global perspective: when classifying a target person's
body-part interactiveness, visual cues are explored not only from
herself/himself but also from other persons in the image. We construct
body-part saliency maps based on self-attention to mine cross-person
informative cues and learn the holistic relationships between all the
body-parts. We evaluate the proposed method on widely-used benchmarks HICO-DET

a qubit is measured in bases that do not commute with energy. We model two

look at the mean energy change of the measurement apparatus in both models,
conditioned on the qubit post-selection, and find that this change can be much
greater than the level spacing of the qubit, like an anomalous weak value. In
the clock model, the expression for the apparatus energy shift explicitly

distinctive characteristic is that the contact is tackled as a coupled problem,
in which the contacting bodies are treated separately, in a staggered way.
Then, the coupling is performed through the exchange of boundary conditions at
the contact interface following a Gauss-Seidel strategy. To validate this

evaluated the parallel performance of the proposed algorithm in a real impact

applications across industry and academia. In image sensing, a measurement,

between data collection and analysis by designing optical components to perform
not imaging, but encoding. By optically encoding images into a compressed,
low-dimensional latent space suitable for efficient post-analysis, these image
sensors can operate with fewer pixels and fewer photons, allowing
higher-throughput, lower-latency operation. Optical neural networks (ONNs)
offer a platform for processing data in the analog, optical domain. ONN-based
sensors have however been limited to linear processing, but nonlinearity is a
prerequisite for depth, and multilayer NNs significantly outperform shallow NNs
on many tasks. Here, we realize a multilayer ONN pre-processor for image
sensing, using a commercial image intensifier as a parallel optoelectronic,
optical-to-optical nonlinear activation function. We demonstrate that the
nonlinear ONN pre-processor can achieve compression ratios of up to 800:1 while
still enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision
tasks, including machine-vision benchmarks, flow-cytometry image
classification, and identification of objects in real scenes. In all cases we
find that the ONN's nonlinearity and depth allowed it to outperform a purely
linear ONN encoder. Although our experiments are specialized to ONN sensors for
incoherent-light images, alternative ONN platforms should facilitate a range of
ONN sensors. These ONN sensors may surpass conventional sensors by
pre-processing optical information in spatial, temporal, and/or spectral

Transcriptional profiling of human placenta from pregnancies complicated by

expressed genes (DEGs). The decisions to investigate DEGs experimentally are
biased by many factors, causing many DEGs to remain uninvestigated. A set of
DEGs which are associated with a disease experimentally, but which have no

optimise competition outcomes or training schedules. A recently published
hydraulic performance model has been reported to outperform established
work-balance models in predicting recovery during intermittent exercise. The
new hydraulic model was optimised to predict exercise recovery dynamics. In
this work, we hypothesised that the benefits of the model come at the cost of
inaccurate predictions of metabolic responses to exercise such as
$\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$.
  Methods: Hydraulic model predictions were compared to breath-by-breath
$\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$ data from 25 constant high-intensity exercise tests of
5 participants (age $32\pm7.8$ years, weight $73.6 \pm 5.81$ kg,
$\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2\mathrm{max}} \; 3.59 \pm 0.62$ L/min). Each test was
performed to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer with a duration between
2 and 12 min. The comparison focuses on the onset of $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$
kinetics.
  Results: On average, the hydraulic model predicted peak
$\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$ during exercise $216\pm113$~s earlier than observed in
the data. The new hydraulic model also did not predict the so-called
$\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$ slow component and made the unrealistic assumption
that there is no $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_2}$ at the onset of exercise.
  Conclusion: While the new hydraulic model may be a powerful tool for
predicting energy recovery, it should not be used to predict metabolic
responses during high-intensity exercise. The present study contributes towards
a more holistic picture of the benefits and limitations of the new hydraulic
model. Data and code are published as open source.

can also be caused by intellectual property considerations, biohazard concerns,

will allow researchers to find existing resources that are relevant for sharing
sensitive data across all participating research infrastructures (F in FAIR).
The toolbox will provide links to recommendations, procedures, and best
practices, as well as to software (tools) to support data sharing and reuse. It
will be based upon a tagging (categorisation) system, allowing consistent
labelling and categorisation of resources. The current design document provides
an outline for the anticipated toolbox, as well as its basic principles

formal approaches, various attempts have been made to estimate the termination
behavior of programs using neural networks. However, the majority of these
approaches continue to rely on formal methods to provide strong soundness
guarantees and consequently suffer from similar limitations. In this paper, we
move away from formal methods and embrace the stochastic nature of machine

interpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a
program's termination behavior and of the likely reason for nontermination
(when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Compared to
previous approaches using neural networks for program termination, we also take
advantage of the graph representation of programs by employing Graph Neural

nontermination bugs, we adapt the notions of attention and semantic
segmentation, previously used for other application domains, to programs.
Overall, we designed and implemented classifiers for program termination based
on Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, as well as a
semantic segmentation Graph Neural Network that localizes AST nodes likely to
cause nontermination. We also illustrated how the information provided by
semantic segmentation can be combined with program slicing to further aid
debugging.

consider correction associated with electron screening within Thomas-Fermi
approximation. In particular, I demonstrate that for relativistic electrons
(density $\rho>10^6$ g\,cm$^{-3}$) this correction can be estimated as $\delta
\mu_\mathrm{eff}^\mathrm{V}= -9.4\times 10^{-4}\sum_Z n_Z Z^{7/3}

representations from fully-supervised pre-training. This has been shown in a
host of settings such as generic object classification and detection, semantic
segmentation, and image retrieval. However, some issues have recently come to
the fore that demonstrate some of the failure modes of self-supervised
representations, such as performance on non-ImageNet-like data, or complex
scenes. In this paper, we show that self-supervised representations based on
the instance discrimination objective lead to better representations of objects
that are more robust to changes in the viewpoint and perspective of the object.
We perform experiments of modern self-supervised methods against multiple
supervised baselines to demonstrate this, including approximating object
viewpoint variation through homographies, and real-world tests based on several
multi-view datasets. We find that self-supervised representations are more
robust to object viewpoint and appear to encode more pertinent information
about objects that facilitate the recognition of objects from novel views.

ultra-realistic fake videos to trick the spectator. Deep generative algorithms,
such as, Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) are widely used to accomplish
such tasks. This approach synthesizes pseudo-realistic contents that are very
difficult to distinguish by traditional detection methods. In most cases,
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based discriminators are being used for
detecting such synthesized media. However, it emphasise primarily on the
spatial attributes of individual video frames, thereby fail to learn the
temporal information from their inter-frame relations. In this paper, we
leveraged an optical flow based feature extraction approach to extract the
temporal features, which are then fed to a hybrid model for classification.
This hybrid model is based on the combination of CNN and recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures. The hybrid model provides effective performance on
open source data-sets such as, DFDC, FF++ and Celeb-DF. This proposed method
shows an accuracy of 66.26%, 91.21% and 79.49% in DFDC, FF++, and Celeb-DF
respectively with a very reduced No of sample size of approx 100
samples(frames). This promises early detection of fake contents compared to

  May 2023, Kigali, Rwanda",,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a regularization loss based on kernel mean embeddings with
rotation-invariant kernels on the hypersphere (also known as dot-product
kernels) for self-supervised learning of image representations. Besides being
fully competitive with the state of the art, our method significantly reduces
time and memory complexity for self-supervised training, making it
implementable for very large embedding dimensions on existing devices and more
easily adjustable than previous methods to settings with limited resources. Our
work follows the major paradigm where the model learns to be invariant to some
predefined image transformations (cropping, blurring, color jittering, etc.),
while avoiding a degenerate solution by regularizing the embedding
distribution. Our particular contribution is to propose a loss family promoting
the embedding distribution to be close to the uniform distribution on the
hypersphere, with respect to the maximum mean discrepancy pseudometric. We
demonstrate that this family encompasses several regularizers of former
methods, including uniformity-based and information-maximization methods, which
are variants of our flexible regularization loss with different kernels. Beyond
its practical consequences for state-of-the-art self-supervised learning with
limited resources, the proposed generic regularization approach opens
perspectives to leverage more widely the literature on kernel methods in order
to improve self-supervised learning methods.

ability. However, all these works only consider the enclosing part of subgraph
without complete neighboring relations, which leads to the issue that partial
neighboring relations are neglected, and sparse subgraphs are hard to be
handled. To address that, we propose Subgraph Neighboring Relations Infomax,
SNRI, which sufficiently exploits complete neighboring relations from two
aspects: neighboring relational feature for node feature and neighboring
relational path for sparse subgraph. To further model neighboring relations in
a global way, we innovatively apply mutual information (MI) maximization for
knowledge graph. Experiments show that SNRI outperforms existing state-of-art
methods by a large margin on inductive link prediction task, and verify the
effectiveness of exploring complete neighboring relations in a global way to
characterize node features and reason on sparse subgraphs.

humans, machines, or both. Due to human/machine errors, there are chances of
having some missing values or inaccuracy, such as
vagueness/uncertainty/hesitation in the collected data. In this situation, it
will be difficult to measure the efficiencies of DMUs accurately. To overcome

quantum fields that is an inevitable outcome of Dirac's pioneering masterpiece.
Examples of these well-known enigmas are wave particle duality, the de Broglie
hypothesis, the uncertainty principle, wave function collapse, and predictions
of measurement outcomes in terms of probability instead of certainty. Paul
Dirac successfully incorporated special theory of relativity into quantum
mechanics for the first time. This was accomplished through his ingenious use
of matrices that allowed the equations of motion to maintain the necessary
first order time derivative feature necessary for positive probability density.
The ensuing Dirac equation for the electron led to the recognition of the
mystifying quantized spin and magnetic moment as intrinsic properties in
contrast to earlier ad hoc assumptions. The solution of his relativistic
equation for the hydrogen atom produced results in perfect agreement with
experimental data available at the time. The most far reaching prediction of
the celebrated Dirac equation was the totally unexpected existence of
anti-particles, culminating in the eventual development of the quantum field
