Majorana nature of a massive right-handed neutrino (RHN) $N$ in the MeV to GeV
mass range. We consider the production and decay of RHNs to proceed via new
interactions described by the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT)
extended with right-handed neutrino fields (SMNEFT), and not via mass mixing
with active neutrinos. We find that Belle II has the potential to discover $N$
if kinematically accessible. We perform detailed simulations of the angular
distributions of lepton pairs from the decay of $N$ produced in two-body and
three-body decays of $B$ mesons. We show that for $m_N$ above 100 MeV, Belle II
can distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos at more than the 5$\sigma$
CL for most operators, and the combination of the production and decay
operators can be identified from the subsequent decay of the heavy neutrino.
Also, the production operators can be identified using three-body $B$ meson
decay for any $m_N$ if the $B\to D\ell N$ and $B\to D^*\ell N$ events can be
well separated.

vision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the
full finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead.
Motivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language
transformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules
(e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune
these modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules
were originally proposed to finetune language models and did not take into
account the prior knowledge specifically for visual tasks. In this paper, we
propose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation
modules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters)
of trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL
methods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional
layers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data
regime. Experimental results on VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot learning
datasets show that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented adaptation
modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented adaptation
modules for adapting vision models.

phase, at 4K, of the receiver near-field beam pattern to predict two key

the telescope to 300K and 2) the beam pattern expected from the receiver when
fielded on the telescope. These cryogenic measurements informed the removal of
a filter, which led to improved optical efficiency and reduced side-lobes at

the spilled power past the telescope mirrors will be less than 1\% and the main

become widespread across the quantitative sciences. However, there are many
known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. In
this paper, we systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based
science. We show that data leakage is indeed a widespread problem and has led
to severe reproducibility failures. Specifically, through a survey of
literature in research communities that adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields
where errors have been found, collectively affecting 329 papers and in some
cases leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we
present a fine-grained taxonomy of 8 types of leakage that range from textbook
errors to open research problems.
  We argue for fundamental methodological changes to ML-based science so that
cases of leakage can be caught before publication. To that end, we propose
model info sheets for reporting scientific claims based on ML models that would
address all types of leakage identified in our survey. To investigate the
impact of reproducibility errors and the efficacy of model info sheets, we
undertake a reproducibility study in a field where complex ML models are
believed to vastly outperform older statistical models such as Logistic
Regression (LR): civil war prediction. We find that all papers claiming the
superior performance of complex ML models compared to LR models fail to
reproduce due to data leakage, and complex ML models don't perform
substantively better than decades-old LR models. While none of these errors
could have been caught by reading the papers, model info sheets would enable
the detection of leakage in each case.

Machine Learning protocol to examine the temporal trends of tuna schools'
association to drifting objects. Using a binary output, metrics typically used
in the literature were adapted to account for the fact that the entire tuna
aggregation under the dFAD was considered. The median time it took tuna to
colonize the dFADs for the first time varied between 25 and 43 days, depending
on the ocean, and the longest soak and colonization times were registered in
the Pacific Ocean. The tuna schools' Continuous Residence Times were generally
shorter than Continuous Absence Times (median values between 5 and 7 days, and
9 and 11 days, respectively), in line with the results found by previous
studies. Using a regression output, two novel metrics, namely aggregation time
and disaggregation time, were estimated to obtain further insight into the
symmetry of the aggregation process. Across all oceans, the time it took for
the tuna aggregation to depart from the dFADs was not significantly longer than
the time it took for the aggregation to form. The value of these results in the
context of the ""ecological trap"" hypothesis is discussed, and further analyses
to enrich and make use of this data source are proposed.

technologies comprise Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) and Mobile Relays
(MRs), whose envisaged roles include mitigating the negative effects of
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) connectivity, in particular at mmWave and higher
frequencies. The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative
networking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS
or the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing
the two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily
envisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment
such as walls and furniture. In contrast, the MRs will feature a higher degree
of freedom, as they will be able to position themselves seamlessly in the
environment. Based on the above assumptions, we derive an approach for
determining the optimal position of the IRS and MR in indoor environments,
i.e., the one that maximizes the end-to-end link quality between the source and
the destination. We follow by capturing the communication quality indicators
for both IRS- and MR-supported NLoS avoidance in indoor mmWave communication in
a number of scenarios. Our results show that, from the end-to-end link quality
perspective, the MRs generally outperform the IRSs, suggesting their
utilization potential for throughput-optimized NLoS avoidance scenarios.

models achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks, but

rules that are grounded in everyday situations than arbitrary rules about
abstract attributes. The training experiences of language models similarly
endow them with prior expectations that reflect human knowledge and beliefs. We
therefore hypothesized that language models would show human-like content
effects on abstract reasoning problems. We explored this hypothesis across
three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical
validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task (Wason, 1968). We find
that state of the art large language models (with 7 or 70 billion parameters;
Hoffman et al., 2022) reflect many of the same patterns observed in humans
across these tasks -- like humans, models reason more effectively about
believable situations than unrealistic or abstract ones. Our findings have

method for defining predicates or relations on domains, with applications
ranging from reasoning principles for program equivalence to proofs of adequacy
connecting denotational and operational semantics. Its main appeal is handling
recursive definitions that are not obviously well-founded: as long as the
corresponding domain is also defined recursively, and its recursion pattern
lines up appropriately with the definition of the relations, the framework can
guarantee their existence. Pitts' original development used the Knaster-Tarski
fixed-point theorem as a key ingredient. In these notes, I show how his
construction can be seen as an instance of other key fixed-point theorems: the
inverse limit construction, the Banach fixed-point theorem and the Kleene
fixed-point theorem. The connection underscores how Pitts' construction is
intimately tied to the methods for constructing the base recursive domains
themselves, and also to techniques based on guarded recursion, or
step-indexing, that have become popular in the last two decades.

(SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely
available at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem
than supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods
directly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to
their sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification
design, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this

relationship: a model generalizing well should be invariant to certain visual
factors. Building on this qualitative implication we make two contributions.
First, we introduce effective invariance (EI), a simple and reasonable measure
of model invariance which does not rely on image labels. Given predictions on a
test image and its transformed version, EI measures how well the predictions
agree and with what level of confidence. Second, using invariance scores
computed by EI, we perform large-scale quantitative correlation studies between
generalization and invariance, focusing on rotation and grayscale
transformations. From a model-centric view, we observe generalization and
invariance of different models exhibit a strong linear relationship, on both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. From a dataset-centric view,

flexible electric loads that can be pooled and controlled via aggregators to
provide low-cost energy and ancillary services to wholesale electricity

aggregate flexibility of the population of EVs under their command as a single
polytope that is compliant with existing market rules. To this end, we
investigate the problem of characterizing the aggregate flexibility set of a
heterogeneous population of EVs whose individual flexibility sets are given as
convex polytopes in half-space representation. As the exact computation of the
aggregate flexibility set -- the Minkowski sum of the individual flexibility
sets -- is known to be intractable, we study the problems of computing
maximum-volume inner approximations and minimum-volume outer approximations to
the aggregate flexibility set by optimizing over affine transformations of a
given convex polytope in half-space representation. We show how to
conservatively approximate these set containment problems as linear programs
that scale polynomially with the number and dimension of the individual
flexibility sets. The class of approximations methods provided in this paper
generalizes existing methods from the literature. We illustrate the improvement
in approximation accuracy achievable by our methods with numerical experiments.

attractive. Surprisingly, that force becomes repulsive in certain geometries

valid in the theory of ideal fluids, we show corresponding effects on steady
and unsteady fluid forces in the presence of boundaries. Two main results are
presented regarding the unsteady force. First, the added mass is proven to
always increase in the presence of boundaries. Second, in a model of a body
approaching a boundary, where the unsteady force is typically repulsive (Lamb
1975, {\S}137), we present a geometry where the force can be attractive. As for
the steady force, there is one main result: in a model of a Bernoulli suction
gripper, for which the steady force is typically attractive, we show that force
becomes repulsive in some geometries. Both the unsteady and steady forces are
shown to reverse sign when boundaries approximate flow streamlines, at energy
minima predicted by Kelvin's theorem.

Comparable algorithmic performance was recently made possible as well with the
adaptation of supervised training algorithms to the context of SNN. However,
information including audio, video, and other sensor-derived data are typically
encoded as real-valued signals that are not well-suited to SNN, preventing the
network from leveraging spike timing information. Efficient encoding from
real-valued signals to spikes is therefore critical and significantly impacts
the performance of the overall system. To efficiently encode signals into
spikes, both the preservation of information relevant to the task at hand as
well as the density of the encoded spikes must be considered. In this paper, we
study four spike encoding methods in the context of a speaker independent digit
classification system: Send on Delta, Time to First Spike, Leaky Integrate and
Fire Neuron and Bens Spiker Algorithm. We first show that all encoding methods
yield higher classification accuracy using significantly fewer spikes when
encoding a bio-inspired cochleagram as opposed to a traditional short-time
Fourier transform. We then show that two Send On Delta variants result in
classification results comparable with a state of the art deep convolutional
neural network baseline, while simultaneously reducing the encoded bit rate.
Finally, we show that several encoding methods result in improved performance
over the conventional deep learning baseline in certain cases, further
demonstrating the power of spike encoding algorithms in the encoding of

full access to the true isotonic responses, and is free to sign-corrupt them.
Estimating the true monotonic signal given these sign-corrupted responses is a
highly challenging task. Notably, the sign-corruptions are designed to violate
monotonicity, and possibly induce heavy dependence between the corrupted
response terms. In this sense, \texttt{ASCI} regression may be viewed as an
adversarial stress test for isotonic regression. Our motivation is driven by
understanding whether efficient robust estimation of the monotone signal is
feasible under this adversarial setting. We develop \texttt{ASCIFIT}, a
three-step estimation procedure under the \texttt{ASCI} setting. The
\texttt{ASCIFIT} procedure is conceptually simple, easy to implement with

images) where existing models of geometry prediction do not apply; (2) dynamic
foreground objects including hands constitute a large proportion of visual
scenes. These challenges limit the performance of the existing models learned
from large indoor datasets, such as ScanNet and NYUv2, which comprise
predominantly upright images of static scenes. We present a multimodal spatial
rectifier that stabilizes the egocentric images to a set of reference
directions, which allows learning a coherent visual representation. Unlike
unimodal spatial rectifier that often produces excessive perspective warp for
egocentric images, the multimodal spatial rectifier learns from multiple
directions that can minimize the impact of the perspective warp. To learn
visual representations of the dynamic foreground objects, we present a new
dataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities) that
comprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions.

nonlinear dynamical system of finite dimension into a linear system with an
infinite number of dimensions. As a results, the state of any nonlinear
dynamics is represented as a linear combination of high-order orthogonal

Since the optimal control technique can be reduced to a two-points boundary

variables in time, such that optimal values are obtained through map inversion
and polynomial evaluation. The new technique is applied to rendezvous
applications in space, where the relative motion between two satellites is

magnetic scattering, arising from intra-surfboard correlations, is observed
well above T$_g$. The spin fluctuations possess a steep energy-wave vector
relation and are indicative of strong exchange interactions, consistent with
the large Curie-Weiss temperature. As the temperature approaches T$_g$ from
above, a shift in spectral weight from inelastic to elastic scattering is
observed. At various temperatures between 4 K and 300 K, a characteristic
relaxation rate of the fluctuations is determined. Despite the freezing of the
majority of the spin correlations, an inelastic contribution remains even at
base temperature, signifying the presence of fluctuating intra-surfboard spin
correlations to at least T/T$_g$ $\approx$ 0.1 consistent with a description of
Fe$_2$TiO$_5$ as a hybrid between conventional and geometrically frustrated
spin glasses.

decisions in real-world traffic scenarios, which often leads to unique and
stochastic behaviors that can not be explained by perfect rationality
assumption, a widely accepted premise in modeling driving behaviors that
presume drivers rationally make decisions to maximize their own rewards under
all circumstances. To explicitly address this disadvantage, this study presents
a novel driver behavior model that aims to capture the resource rationality and
stochasticity of the human driver's behaviors in realistic longitudinal driving
scenarios. The resource rationality principle can provide a theoretic framework
to better understand the human cognition processes by modeling human's internal
cognitive mechanisms as utility maximization subject to cognitive resource
limitations, which can be represented as finite and time-varying preview
horizons in the context of driving. An inverse resource rational-based
stochastic inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRR-SIRL) is proposed to
learn a distribution of the planning horizon and cost function of the human
driver with a given series of human demonstrations. A nonlinear model
predictive control (NMPC) with a time-varying horizon approach is used to
generate driver-specific trajectories by using the learned distributions of the
planning horizon and the cost function of the driver. The simulation
experiments are carried out using human demonstrations gathered from the
driver-in-the-loop driving simulator. The results reveal that the proposed
inverse resource rational-based stochastic driver model can address the
resource rationality and stochasticity of human driving behaviors in a variety
of realistic longitudinal driving scenarios.

both abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated

is embedded in a wearable device, such training data is not available for
healthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this study, (i) we propose
a null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse
dictionary learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or
alternatively regularized least squares-based classification methods can reduce
the computational complexity, without sacrificing the detection accuracy, when
compared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then we introduce
a sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project
other existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal
space, enabling us to train the dedicated classifier without having any
abnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot learning can be
achieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An
extensive set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset
shows that when this domain adaptation-based training data generator is used
with a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior work by a
significant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an
ensemble classifier that further improves the performance. This approach for
zero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves an average accuracy level of 98.2% and
an F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient ECG monitoring

non-linear, whereas hearing aids (HAs) still rely on simplified descriptions of
auditory processing or hearing loss to restore hearing. Even though standard HA
amplification strategies succeed in restoring audibility of faint sounds, they
still fall short of providing targeted treatments for complex sensorineural
deficits and adverse listening conditions. These shortcomings of current HA
devices demonstrate the need for advanced hearing-loss compensation strategies
that can effectively leverage the non-linear character of the auditory system.
Here, we propose a differentiable deep-neural-network (DNN) framework that can
be used to train DNN-based HA models based on biophysical auditory-processing
differences between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired systems. We investigate
different loss functions to accurately compensate for impairments that include
outer-hair-cell (OHC) loss and cochlear synaptopathy (CS), and evaluate the
benefits of our trained DNN-based HA models for speech processing in quiet and
in noise. Our results show that auditory-processing enhancement was possible
for all considered hearing-loss cases, with OHC loss proving easier to
compensate than CS. Several objective metrics were considered to estimate the
expected speech intelligibility after processing, and these simulations hold
promise in yielding improved understanding of speech-in-noise for
hearing-impaired listeners who use our DNN-based HA processing. Since our
framework can be tuned to the hearing-loss profiles of individual listeners, we
enter an era where truly individualised and DNN-based hearing-restoration

geometrically rational surfaces whose associated discriminant covers
$\tilde{\Delta}\to\Delta\subset W$ are smooth and geometrically irreducible.
First, we determine the structure of the group $\mathrm{CH}^2 X_{\overline{k}}$
of rational equivalence classes of curves. Precisely, we construct a
Galois-equivariant group homomorphism from $\mathrm{CH}^2X_{\overline{k}}$ to a
group scheme associated to the discriminant cover $\tilde{\Delta}\to \Delta$ of
$X$. The target group scheme is a generalization of the Prym variety of
$\tilde{\Delta}\to\Delta$ and so our result can be viewed as a generalization
of Beauville's result that the algebraically trivial curve classes on
$X_{\overline{k}}$ are parametrized by the Prym variety.
  Next, we use our structural result on curve classes to study rationality
obstructions, in particular the refined intermediate Jacobian torsor (IJT)
obstruction recently introduced by Hassett--Tschinkel and Benoist--Wittenberg.
We show that for conic bundle threefolds there is no strongest (known)
rationality obstruction. Precisely, we construct a geometrically rational
irrational conic bundle threefold where the IJT obstruction cannot witness
irrationality (irrationality is detected through the real topology) and a
geometrically rational irrational conic bundle threefold where all classical
rationality obstructions vanish and the IJT obstruction is needed to prove
irrationality.

source and $n$ receiver nodes. The source updates itself with a Poisson process
and also sends updates to the nodes as Poisson arrivals. Upon receiving the
updates, the nodes update their knowledge about the source. The nodes gossip
the data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their
knowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a
constraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the
source. In this work, we propose ASUMAN, a distributed opportunistic gossiping
scheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a
time proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes
of the network. This allows the nodes in the network which have higher age to
remain silent and only the low-age nodes to gossip, thus utilizing a
significant portion of the constrained total gossip rate. We calculate the
average age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings and
show that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$. ASUMAN, with
an average age of $O(1)$, offers significant gains compared to a system where
the nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate in which case the age
scales as $O(\log n)$.

logical qubits are dynamically generated by a time-periodic measurement
schedule, to a stochastic setting. When all types of bonds are measured with
comparable frequency, we find a critical phase with a logarithmic violation of
the area-law, which sharply distinguishes it from its Hamiltonian counterpart.
The critical phase has the same set of topological qubits, as diagnosed by the
tripartite mutual information, but protects them only for a time polynomial in

these measurements to infer the level of non-thermal sources of pressure, such

fit a model for the cluster, cavities, and central point source directly to the
time ordered data of the MUSTANG-2 signal. We use this model to probe the
thermodynamic state of the cavities. We have shown that the SZ signal
associated with the cavities is suppressed compared to the expectations for a
thermal plasma with the temperature $\sim$few tens keV. The smallest value of
the suppression factor $f$ that is consistent with the data is $\sim$0.4, lower
than inferred in earlier work. Larger values of $f$ are possible once the
contribution of the cocoon shock surrounding the bubbles is taken into account.
The baseline model with this particular geometrical setup yields best-fitting
value f~0.5, which at face value implies a mix of thermal and non-thermal
pressure support. Larger values of $f$ (up to 1, i.e. no tSZ signal from the

emerged as powerful strategies to manipulate the properties of quantum
materials out of equilibrium. Generalizing the exploitation of coherent
phonon-phonon interactions to nonlinear couplings among other types of
collective modes would open unprecedented opportunities in the design of novel
dynamic functionalities in solids. For example, the collective excitations of
magnetic order - magnons - can efficiently transfer information via spin
current flow, and their coherent and nonlinear control would provide an
attractive route to achieve faster signal processing for next-generation
information technologies. Here, we discover that intense terahertz (THz) fields
can initiate processes of magnon upconversion via coherent magnon-magnon
interactions - a phenomenon that opens the paradigm of nonlinear coupled
magnonics. By using a suite of advanced spectroscopic tools, including a newly
demonstrated two-dimensional (2D) THz polarimetry technique enabled by
single-shot detection, we unveil the unidirectional nature of coupling between
distinct magnon modes of a canted antiferromagnet. Calculations of spin
dynamics further suggest that this coupling is a universal feature of
antiferromagnets with canted magnetic moments. These results demonstrate a
route to inducing desirable energy transfer pathways between coherent magnons
in solids and pave the way for a new era in the development of magnonic signal
processing devices.

Our key insight is that the space-time varying geometry and reflectance of the

diffuse, and specular maps. These neural fields are further integrated into
reflectance-aware physically based rendering, where each vertex in the neural
field absorbs and reflects the light from the environment. The whole framework

of points where the solution forms a shock singularity, i.e., where some
first-order Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives of the velocity and
density blow up. We prove that in the solution regime under study, the singular
boundary has the structure of a degenerate, acoustically null $3D$
submanifold-with-boundary. Our approach yields the full structure of a
neighborhood of a connected component of the crease, which is a $2D$
acoustically spacelike submanifold equal to the past boundary of the singular
boundary. In the study of shocks, the crease plays the role of the ""true
initial singularity"" from which the singular boundary emerges, and it is a
crucial ingredient for setting up the shock development problem. These are the
first results revealing the totality of these structures without symmetry,
irrotationality, or isentropicity assumptions. Moreover, even within the
sub-class of irrotational and isentropic solutions, these are the first
constructive results revealing these structures without a strict convexity
assumption on the shape of the singular boundary. Our proof relies on a new
method: the construction of rough foliations of spacetime, dynamically adapted
to the exact shape of the singular boundary and crease, where the latter is
provably two degrees less differentiable than the fluid.

cause of the speeding up of the universe is the running vacuum (RV).
Appropriate renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor shows that the vacuum
energy density is a smooth function of the Hubble rate and its derivatives:
$\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. This is because in
QFT the quantum scaling of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ with the renormalization point
turns into cosmic evolution with $H$. As a result, any two nearby points of the
cosmic expansion during the standard FLRW epoch are smoothly related through
$\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In our approach, what we call the
`cosmological constant' $\Lambda$ is just the nearly sustained value of $8\pi
G(H)\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ around (any) given epoch, where $G(H)$ is the running
gravitational coupling. In the present study, after summarizing the main QFT
calculations supporting the RV approach, we focus on the calculation of the
equation of state (EoS) of the RV for the entire cosmic history within such a
QFT framework. In particular, in the very early universe, where higher (even)
powers $\rho_{\rm vac}\sim{\cal O}(H^N)$ ($N=4,6,\dots$) triggered inflation
during a short period in which $H=$const, the vacuum EoS is very close to
$w_{\rm vac}=-1$. This ceases to be true during the FLRW era, where it adopts
the EoS of matter during the relativistic ($w_{\rm vac}=1/3$) and
non-relativistic ($w_{\rm vac}=0$) epochs. Interestingly enough, we find that
in the late universe the EoS becomes mildly dynamical and mimics quintessence,
$w_{\rm vac}\gtrsim-1$. It finally asymptotes to $-1$ in the remote future, but
in the transit the RV helps alleviating the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.

geometric confinement, e.g. restricting rigid spherical particles to a channel

between local resetting and geometric confinement in a system consisting of two
species of diffusive particles: ""bath"" particles, and ""tracers"" which undergo
local resetting. Mean-field analysis and numerical simulations show that the
resetting tracers, whose stationary density profile exhibits a typical
""tent-like"" shape, imprint this shape onto the bath density profile. Upon
varying the ratio of the degree of geometric confinement over particle
diffusivity, the system is found to transition between two states. In one
tracers expel bath particles away from the origin, while in the other they
ensnare them instead. Between these two states, we find a special case where
the mean field approximation becomes exact.

the pressure on the encoder to memorize target-specific information in BERT
pretraining. The first design is motivated by the observation that using a
pretrained MAE to extract the features as the BERT prediction target for masked
tokens can achieve better pretraining performance. Therefore, we add a momentum
encoder in parallel with the original MAE encoder, which bootstraps the
pretraining performance by using its own representation as the BERT prediction
target. In the second design, we introduce target-specific information (e.g.,
pixel values of unmasked patches) from the encoder directly to the decoder to
reduce the pressure on the encoder of memorizing the target-specific
information. Thus, the encoder focuses on semantic modeling, which is the goal
of BERT pretraining, and does not need to waste its capacity in memorizing the
information of unmasked tokens related to the prediction target. Through
extensive experiments, our BootMAE achieves $84.2\%$ Top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming MAE by $+0.8\%$ under the same

annihilation temperatures, ALPs can constitute $100\%$ of DM, and the
annihilation could produce supermassive black holes with a mass of up to
$10^9\, M_\odot$ as found at the center of large galaxies. Therefore our model
could solve two mysteries, the nature of the DM and the origin of these black
holes.

exciting possibility of storing and manipulating quantum information in a
manner that is protected from decoherence at the hardware level. In this work,
we study the possibility of realizing such excitations along line defects in
certain fractional quantum Hall states in multi-valley systems. Such line
defects have been recently observed experimentally between valley polarized
Hall states on the surface of Bi(111), and excitations near these defects
appear to be gapped (gapless) depending on the presence (absence) of
interaction-induced gapping perturbations constrained by momentum selection
rules, while the position of defects is determined by strain. In this work, we
use these selection rules to show that a hybrid structure involving a
superlattice imposed on such a multi-valley quantum Hall surface realizes
non-Abelian anyons which can then be braided by modulating strain locally to
move line defects. Specifically, we explore such defects in Abelian fractional
quantum Hall states of the form {\nu} = 2/m using a K-matrix approach, and
identify relevant gapping perturbations. Charged modes on these line defects
remain gapped, while charge netural valley pseudospin modes may be gapped with
the aid of two (mutually orthogonal) superlattices which pin non-commuting
fields. When these superlattices are alternated along the line defect,
non-Abelian zero modes result at points where the gapping perturbation changes.
Given that these pseudospin modes carry no net physical charge or spin, the
setup eschews utilizing superconducting and magnetic elements to engineer
gapping perturbations. We provide a scheme to braid these modes using strain
modulation, and confirm that the resulting unitaries satisfy a representation
of the braid group.

identical stellar populations. Here we test this prediction by measuring
accurate F606W-F814W colors from deep HST/ACS imaging. We find that the
clusters are extremely homogeneous. The mean color difference between the
globular clusters in DF2 and DF4 is $-0.003\pm 0.005$ mag and the observed

falsified it. No other formation models have predicted this extreme uniformity

present estimates and upper bounds for the flux of high-energy neutrinos

account for a sizable fraction, or even dominate, the expected flux of
cosmogenic neutrinos; ii) neutrinos from the beta-decay of secondary neutrons
produced in nucleus photodisintegration end up in the TeV-PeV band observed by
IceCube, but can hardly account for the observed flux; iii) UHECRs accelerated

This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of

phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure
Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even control the criticality

questions we consider real analytic CFT data, where in the absence of
logarithms, the radius is set by singularities of the complex metric reached by
analytically continuing the Fefferman-Graham radial coordinate. With the
conformal boundary at the origin of the complex radial plane, real Lorentzian
submanifolds appear as piecewise paths built from radial rays and arcs of
circles centred on the origin. This allows singularities of Fefferman-Graham
metric functions to be identified with gauge-invariant singularities of
maximally extended black hole spacetimes, thereby clarifying the physical cause
of the limited radius of convergence in such cases. We find black holes with
spacelike singularities can give a radius of convergence equal to the horizon
radius, however for black holes with timelike singularities the radius is
smaller. We prove that a finite radius of convergence does not necessarily
follow from the existence of an event horizon, a spacetime singularity, nor
from caustics of the Fefferman-Graham gauge, by providing explicit examples of
spacetimes with an infinite radius of convergence which contain such features.

disruption events (TDE). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we
assume the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital
period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical
pressure-supported envelope of radius R_v ~ 1e14 cm (photosphere radius ~1e15
cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools
radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction R_v ~ t^(-1), its
temperature rising T_eff ~ t^(1/2) while its total luminosity remains roughly
constant; the optical luminosity decays as nu L_nu ~ R_v^2 T_eff ~ t^(-3/2).
Despite this similarity to the mass fall-back rate Mdot_fb ~ t^(-5/3), envelope
heating from fall-back accretion is sub-dominant compared to the envelope
cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable).
Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the
inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time
flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some
TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius,
the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing
optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced)
delay of up to several hundred days, may account for the delayed onset of
thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation,
observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light
curve correlation studies, finding agreement as well as points of tension.

causing these differences, the lower obscured fraction of star formation than
at lower redshift can alleviate the tension between our stacked
$q_{\mathrm{TIR}}$s and that of local normal SFGs. It is possible that the dust
buildup, which primarily governs the IR emission in addition to older stellar
populations, has not had enough time to occur fully in these galaxies, whereas
the radio emission can respond on a more rapid timescale. Therefore, we might
expect a lower $q_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ to be a general property of high-redshift

consistent with that measured for field dM stars of similar spectral type and
age, implying their long primordial disk lifetimes are likely not a consequence
of unusually faint X-ray host stars. Our derived X-ray photoevaporative mass
loss rates predict our systems have passed the point of rapid gas dispersal and
call into question the impact of this internal mechanism for primordial disk
dispersal around dM stars. Our qualitative assessment of the surrounding Peter
Pan environments also does not predict unusually low levels of external
photoevaporation relative to other respective moving group members. Overall,
our results suggest Peter Pan disks may be a consequence of the low FUV flux

that are excluded by the cosmological data at more than 2$\sigma$ (here $n_s$
is the scalar spectral index). The same is true for single field inflationary
models with an inflection point that can account for all or majority of dark
matter in the form of PBHs (primordial black holes). Cosmological models
incorporating strongly self-interacting neutrinos (with a heavy mediator) are,
however, known to prefer lower $n_s$ values compared to the $\Lambda\rm CDM$
model. Considering such neutrino self-interactions can, thus, open up the
parameter space to accommodate the above inflationary models. In this work, we
implement the massive neutrino self-interactions with a heavy mediator in two
different ways: flavour-universal (among all three neutrinos), and
flavour-specific (involving only one neutrino species). We implement the new
interaction in both scalar and tensor perturbation equations of neutrinos.
Interestingly, we find that the current cosmological data can support the
aforementioned inflationary models at 2$\sigma$ in the presence of such
neutrino self-interactions.

re-brightening observations represent the latest photometric measurements of a

suggest no hydrogen, the potential circumstellar material (CSM) must be H-poor.
Moreover, late (>150 days) spectra show no signs of narrow emission lines,
further disfavouring CSM interaction. On the contrary, an extended CSM
structure is seen through a follow-up radio campaign with Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA), indicating a source of bright optically thick radio emission
at late times, which is highly unusual among H-poor SESNe. We attribute this
phenomenology to an interaction of the supernova ejecta with

perturbs the progenitors CSM, that can explain the multi-peaked light curves of

Heterogenous nucleation and grain boundary pinning are explicitly included, and
a wide range of nanoparticle area fractions and nucleation rates are modeled.
At low area fractions less than 0.05, particle clustering increases grain size
between 15-45% compared to a random distribution. Our quantitative analyses
inform a modified Zener grain size relationship that not only depends on
nanoparticle size and area fraction, but also on the nucleation rate. Grain
size first drastically decreases before plateauing at higher nucleation rates.
Our simulations reveal a strong preference of nanoparticles pinning grain
boundaries. Pinning fraction increases rapidly with nucleation rate before
saturating between 0.85-0.90. Across the range of area fractions and nucleation
rates considered, the random and clustered grain sizes each collapse to a
simple analytical expression that depends only on nanoparticle radius and
pinning fraction. Comparisons against experimental data reveal the expressions

  On the negative side, we prove that CSPs where the satisfying assignments of

$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-space for any non-trivial approximation, even when the
constraints are randomly ordered. This was previously known only for
adversarially ordered constraints. Extending the results to randomly ordered
constraints requires switching the hard instances from a union of random
matchings to simple Erd\""os-Renyi random (hyper)graphs and extending tools that
can perform Fourier analysis on such instances.
  The only CSP to have been considered previously with random ordering is
$\textsf{Max-CUT}$ where the ordering is not known to change the
approximability. Specifically it is known to be as hard to approximate with
random ordering as with adversarial ordering, for $o(\sqrt{n})$ space

better job at modeling the regions surrounding proto-galaxy cores where metals

radiative transfer suppresses Pop III star formation, via the development of
ionized bubbles that slows gas accretion in these regions, and it results in

deeply entangled with a song's character and the artist's identity, and remains
one of the most important gateways to lead people to discover music. However,
designing cover art is a highly creative, lengthy and sometimes expensive
process that can be daunting, especially for non-professional artists. For this
reason, we propose a novel deep-learning framework to generate cover art guided
by audio features. Inspired by VQGAN-CLIP, our approach is highly flexible
because individual components can easily be replaced without the need for any
retraining. This paper outlines the architectural details of our models and
discusses the optimization challenges that emerge from them. More specifically,
we will exploit genetic algorithms to overcome bad local minima and adversarial
examples. We find that our framework can generate suitable cover art for most
genres, and that the visual features adapt themselves to audio feature changes.
Given these results, we believe that our framework paves the road for
extensions and more advanced applications in audio-guided visual generation
tasks.

interstellar medium, and for their influence on the final state of a star prior
to it exploding as a supernova. However, the dynamics of these winds is
understood primarily via their illumination from a single central source. The
Doppler shift seen in resonance lines is a useful tool for inferring these
dynamics, but the mapping from that Doppler shift to the radial distance from
the source is ambiguous. Binary systems can reduce this ambiguity by providing
a second light source at a known radius in the wind, seen from orbitally
modulated directions. From the nature of the collision between the winds, a
massive companion also provides unique additional information about wind
momentum fluxes. Since massive stars are strong ultraviolet (UV) sources, and
UV resonance line opacity in the wind is strong, UV instruments with a high
resolution spectroscopic capability are essential for extracting this dynamical
information. Polarimetric capability also helps to further resolve ambiguities
in aspects of the wind geometry that are not axisymmetric about the line of
sight, because of its unique access to scattering direction information. We
review how the proposed MIDEX-scale mission Polstar can use UV
spectropolarimetric observations to critically constrain the physics of
colliding winds, and hence radiatively-driven winds in general. We propose a
sample of 20 binary targets, capitalizing on this unique combination of
illumination by companion starlight, and collision with a companion wind, to
probe wind attributes over a range in wind strengths. Of particular interest is
the hypothesis that the radial distribution of the wind acceleration is altered
significantly, when the radiative transfer within the winds becomes optically
thick to resonance scattering in multiple overlapping UV lines.

the videos a user watches during this time (inflow) and the daily engagements;
liking, sharing, downloading or creating new videos (outflow) to estimate
contagion. To validate our approach and analysis, we obtain human feedback on

campaigns have shown that $UVJ$-selected quiescent samples at $z \gtrsim 3$
include $\sim 10-30\%$ contamination from galaxies with dust-obscured star
formation and strong emission lines. Moreover, at $z>3$, $UVJ$ colors are
extrapolated because the rest-frame J-band shifts beyond the coverage of the
deepest bandpasses at $< 5~\mu m$ (typically $Spitzer$/IRAC 4.5 $\mu m$ or
future $JWST$/NIRCam observations). We demonstrate that $(ugi)_s$ offers
improvements to $UVJ$ at $z>3$, and can be applied to galaxies in the $JWST$

$(u_s-g_s)_0$ color by $\leq$ 0.2 mag, even at $z\simeq 6$. While
$(ugi)_s$-selected quiescent samples are comparable to $UVJ$ in completeness
(both achieve $\sim$85-90% at $z=3-3.5$), $(ugi)_s$ reduces contamination in
quiescent samples by nearly a factor of two, from $\simeq$35% to $\simeq$17% at
$z=3$, and from $\simeq $60% to $\simeq $33% at $z=6$. This leads to
improvements in the true-to-false-positive ratio (TP/FP), where we find TP/FP
$\gtrsim$ 2.2 for $(ugi)_s$ at $z \simeq 3.5 - 6$, compared to TP/FP $<$ 1 for
$UVJ$-selected samples. This indicates that contaminants will outnumber true
quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ at these redshifts, while $(ugi)_s$ will provide
higher-fidelity samples.

Pleiades star cluster. These ALMA observations complement previous infrared
observations of this sample by providing sensitivity to emission from
circumstellar dust at lower temperatures, corresponding to debris at radii
comparable to the Kuiper Belt and beyond. The observations obtain a beam size
of 1.5 arcsec (200 au) and a median rms noise of 54 mircoJy/beam, which
corresponds to a fractional luminosity $L_{dust}/L_{star} \sim 10^{-4}$ for 40
K dust for a typical star in the sample. The ALMA images show no significant
detections of the targeted stars. We interpret these limits in the context of a
steady-state collisional cascade model for debris disk evolution that provides
a good description of observations of the field population near the Sun but is
not well-calibrated on younger populations.The ALMA non-detections of the
Pleiades systems are compatible with the disk flux predictions of this model.
We find no high fractional luminosity outliers from these ALMA data that could
be associated with enhanced collisions resulting from activity not accounted
for by steady-state evolution. However, we note that two systems (HII 1132 and

remarkable progress, most of the previous deep clustering works still suffer
from two limitations. First, many of them focus on some distribution-based
clustering loss, lacking the ability to exploit sample-wise (or
augmentation-wise) relationships via contrastive learning. Second, they often
neglect the indirect sample-wise structure information, overlooking the rich
possibilities of multi-scale neighborhood structure learning. In view of this,
this paper presents a new deep clustering approach termed Image clustering with
contrastive learning and multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (IcicleGCN),
which bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph
convolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning and
multi-scale neighborhood structure learning for the image clustering task. The
proposed IcicleGCN framework consists of four main modules, namely, the
CNN-based backbone, the Instance Similarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster
Structure Learning and Instance reconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the
Multi-scale GCN module (M-GCN). Specifically, with two random augmentations
performed on each image, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is
utilized to learn the representations for the augmented samples, which are then
fed to ISM and JC-SLIM for instance-level and cluster-level contrastive
learning, respectively. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure
learning, two streams of GCNs and an auto-encoder are simultaneously trained
via (i) the layer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the
joint self-adaptive learning that ensures their last-layer output distributions
to be consistent. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate the
superior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art.

perturbation experiments to check for influence of a given latent variable on a

graph that models a structural equation model between latent codes taken as
exogenous variables and attributes taken as observed variables. One interesting
aspect is that a single latent variable controls multiple overlapping subsets
of attributes unlike conventional approach that tries to impose full
independence. Using a pre-trained RNN-based generative autoencoder trained on a
dataset of peptide sequences, we demonstrate that the learnt causal graph from
our algorithm between various attributes and latent codes can be used to
predict a specific property for sequences which are unseen. We compare

zero-shot (e.g., increasing the accuracy gap by 50.1 pp on CelebA). We thus
develop an adapter training strategy to effectively and efficiently improve FM
group robustness. Our motivating observation is that while poor robustness
results from groups in the same class being embedded far apart in the
foundation model ""embedding space,"" standard adapter training may not bring
these points closer together. We thus propose contrastive adapting, which
trains adapters with contrastive learning to bring sample embeddings close to
both their ground-truth class embeddings and other sample embeddings in the
same class. Across the 9 benchmarks, our approach consistently improves group
robustness, raising worst-group accuracy by 8.5 to 56.0 pp over zero-shot. Our
approach is also efficient, doing so without any FM finetuning and only a fixed
set of frozen FM embeddings. On benchmarks such as Waterbirds and CelebA, this
leads to worst-group accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
retrain entire models, while only training $\leq$1% of the model parameters.

  friction: Application to earthquake prevention",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Passivity property gives a sense of energy balance. The classical definitions
and theorems of passivity in dynamical systems require time invariance and
locally Lipschitz functions. However, these conditions are not met in many
systems. A characteristic example is nonautonomous and discontinuous systems
due to presence of Coulomb friction. This paper presents an extended result for
the negative feedback connection of two passive nonautonomous systems with
set-valued right-hand side based on an invariance-like principle. Such
extension is the base of a structural passivity-based control synthesis for
underactuated mechanical systems with Coulomb friction. The first step consists
in designing the control able to restore the passivity in the considered
friction law, achieving stabilization of the system trajectories to a domain
with zero velocities. Then, an integral action is included to improve the
latter result and perform a tracking over a constant reference (regulation). At
last, the control is designed considering dynamics in the actuation. These
control objectives are obtained using fewer control inputs than degrees of
freedom, as a result of the underactuated nature of the plant. The presented
control strategy is implemented in an earthquake prevention scenario, where a
mature seismogenic fault represents the considered frictional underactuated
mechanical system. Simulations are performed to show how the seismic energy can
be slowly dissipated by tracking a slow reference, thanks to fluid injection
far from the fault, accounting also for the slow dynamics of the fluid's
diffusion.

interconnectedness among stocks based on their correlation matrix which we
represent as a network with the nodes representing individual stocks and the
weighted links between pairs of nodes representing the corresponding pair-wise

extensively utilized in financial literature, require handcrafted features such
as centrality measures to understand such correlation networks. However,
manually enlisting all such handcrafted features may quickly turn out to be a
daunting task. Instead, we propose a new approach for studying nuances and
relationships within the correlation network in an algorithmic way using a
graph machine learning algorithm called Node2Vec. In particular, the algorithm
compresses the network into a lower dimensional continuous space, called an
embedding, where pairs of nodes that are identified as similar by the algorithm
are placed closer to each other. By using log returns of S&P 500 stock data, we
show that our proposed algorithm can learn such an embedding from its
correlation network. We define various domain specific quantitative (and
objective) and qualitative metrics that are inspired by metrics used in the
field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate the embeddings in order
to identify the optimal one. Further, we discuss various applications of the

albedo and low-latitude location, they have a strong effect on Earths radiation
budget. Previous studies using Large Eddy Simulations have shown that multiple
equilibria (both cloud-covered and cloud-free states) exist as a function of
fixed-SST, with relevance to equatorward advected air masses. Multiple
equilibria have also been found as a function of atmospheric CO2, with a
subtropical SST nearly 10 K higher in the cloud-free state, and with suggested
relevance to warm-climate dynamics. In this study, we use a mixed-layer model
with an added surface energy balance and the ability to simulate both the
cloud-covered and cloud-free states to study both types of multiple equilibria
and the corresponding hysteresis. The model's simplicity and computational
efficiency allow us to explore the mechanisms critical to the stratocumulus
cloud instability and hysteresis as well as isolate key processes that allow
for multiple equilibria via mechanism denial experiments not possible with a
full-complexity model. For the hysteresis in fixed-SST, we find that decoupling
can occur due to either enhanced entrainment warming or a reduction in
cloud-top longwave cooling. The critical SST at which decoupling occurs is
highly sensitive to precipitation and entrainment parameterizations. In the CO2
hysteresis, decoupling occurs in the simple model used even without the
inclusion of an active SST and SST-cloud cover feedbacks, and the width of the
hysteresis displays the same sensitivities as the fixed-SST case. Overall, the
simple model analysis and results motivate further studies using higher
complexity models.

examine how to share the cost savings compared to the initial situation, when
optimally requeueing/changing the number of machines. Although, in general,
stable allocation may not exist, we guarantee the existence of stable

measures the radio path length between a certain position of the primary mirror
surface to the focal point where a 20 GHz coherent receiver is placed. With the

radii of 5 m and 16 m) at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. Then an excess path length
(EPL) between the two positions was obtained by differentiating the two optical
paths. A power spectral density of the EPL shows three components: a
low-frequency drift (1/f^n), oscillations, and a white noise. A comparison of
EPL measurements under a variety of wind conditions suggests that the former
two are likely induced by the wind load on the telescope structure. The power
of the white noise corresponds to a 1sigma statistical error of 8 um in EPL
measurements. The 8 um r.m.s. is significant with respect to the mirror surface

enters a jackknife state and the vehicle and trailer eventually collide if
trailer operation is not corrected. This paper considers low speed trailer
maneuvering typical of trailer backing where jackknife state limits can vary
due to sideslip caused by physical interaction between the vehicle, trailer,
and environment. Analysis of a kinematic model considering sideslip at the
vehicle and trailer wheels indicates that vehicle-trailer systems should be
divided into three categories based on the ratio of hitch length and trailer
tongue length, each with distinct behaviors. The Long Trailer category may have
no jackknifing state while the other two categories always have states leading
to jackknifing. It is found that jackknife limits, which are the boundaries
between the jackknifing state and the recoverable regions, can be divided into
safe and unsafe limits, the latter of which must be avoided. Simulations and
physical experiments support these results and provide insight about the
implications of vehicle and trailer states with slip that lead to jackknifing.
Simulations also demonstrate the benefit of considering these new slip-based

cover a very wide range of turbulence conditions in terms of Taylor-scale based
Reynolds numbers ($Re_\lambda \in [30-520]$), Rouse numbers ($Ro \in [0-5]$)
and volume fractions ($\phi_v \in[0.5\times10^{-5} - 2.0\times10^{-5}]$). We
find, in agreement with previous works, that enhancement of the settling
velocity occurs at low Rouse number, while hindering of the settling occurs at
higher Rouse number for decreasing turbulence energy levels. The wide range of
flow parameters explored allowed us to observe that enhancement decreases
significantly with the Taylor Reynolds number and is significantly affected by
the volume fraction $\phi_v$. We also studied the effect of large-scale forcing
on settling velocity modification. The possibility of changing the inflow
conditions by using different grids allowed us to test cases with fixed
$Re_\lambda$ and turbulent intensity but different integral length scale.
Finally, we assess the existence of secondary flows in the wind tunnel and
their role on particle settling. This is achieved by characterising the

Y-bifurcation of an elastic, liquid-filled Hele-Shaw channel, as a benchtop
model of airway reopening. With channel compliance provided by an elastic upper
boundary, we can impose collapsed channel configurations into which we inject
air with constant volume-flux. We typically observe steady finger propagation
in the main channel, which is lost ahead of the Y-bifurcation but subsequently
recovered in the daughter channels. At low levels of initial collapse, steady
finger shapes and bubble pressure in the daughter channels map onto those in
the main channel, despite small differences in initial collapse in different
parts of the Y-channel. However, at higher levels of initial collapse where the
elastic sheet almost touches the bottom boundary of the channel, experimentally
indistinguishable fingers in the main channel can lead to multiple states of
reopening of the daughter channels. The downstream distance at which steady
propagation is recovered in the daughter channels also varies considerably with
injection flow rate and initial collapse because of a transition in the
mechanics regulating finger propagation. We find that the characteristic time
and length-scales of this recovery are largest in the regime where viscous and
surface tension forces dominate at low flow rate and/or low initial collapse,
and that they decrease towards a constant plateau reached in the limit where
elastic and surface tension forces balance at high flow rate and/or high
initial collapse. Our findings suggest that practical networks are unlikely to
comprise long enough channels for steady state propagation to remain
established.

potential for drug design and screening render the study of allostery
invaluable. Nevertheless, challenges remain as few computational methods are
available to effectively predict allosteric sites, identify signalling pathways
involved in allostery, or to aid with the design of suitable molecules
targeting such sites. Recently, bond-to-bond propensity analysis has been shown
successful at identifying allosteric sites for a large and diverse group of
proteins from knowledge of the orthosteric sites and its ligands alone by using
network analysis applied to energy-weighted atomistic protein graphs. To
address the identification of signalling pathways, we propose here a method to
compute and score paths of optimised propensity that link the orthosteric site
with the identified allosteric sites, and identifies crucial residues that
contribute to those paths. We showcase the approach with three well-studied

identified and showed agreement with experimental results, and pivotal
signalling residues along the pathway were also revealed, thus providing
alternative targets for drug design. By using the computed path scores, we were

augmentation allowing for fast computations even for data sets of over a
million clients. Moreover, scalable point estimation based on EM algorithm is
also presented. An illustrative example emulates a typical behaviour for life
insurance contracts and a simulated study investigates the properties of the
proposed model. In particular, the observed censuring in the insurance context
might be up to 50% of the data, which is very unusual for survival models in
other fields such as epidemiology. This aspect is exploited in our simulated
study.

result, ML in vehicle routing has witnessed an expansion phase with new

  This paper aims at encouraging the consolidation of the field through
understanding and improving current existing models, namely the attention model
by Kool et al. We identify two discrepancy categories for VRP generalization.
The first is based on the differences that are inherent to the problems
themselves, and the second relates to architectural weaknesses that limit the
model's ability to generalize. Our contribution becomes threefold: We first
target model discrepancies by adapting the Kool et al. method and its loss
function for Sparse Dynamic Attention based on the alpha-entmax activation. We
then target inherent differences through the use of a mixed instance training
method that has been shown to outperform single instance training in certain
scenarios. Finally, we introduce a framework for inference level data
augmentation that improves performance by leveraging the model's lack of

unsupervised nature of the situation. We propose a simple, almost obvious,
approach to supervise the choice of tuning parameter(s): minimize a notion of
stress. We substantiate this choice by reference to rigidity theory. We extend
a result by Aspnes et al. (IEEE Mobile Computing, 2006), showing that general
random geometric graphs are trilateration graphs with high probability. And we
provide a stability result \`a la Anderson et al. (SIAM Discrete Mathematics,

of Shang and Ruml (IEEE INFOCOM, 2004). As a prototypical patch-stitching
method, it requires the choice of patch size, and we use the stress to make
that choice data-driven. In this context, we perform a number of experiments to
illustrate the validity of using the stress as the basis for tuning parameter
selection. In so doing, we uncover a bias-variance tradeoff, which is a
phenomenon which may have been overlooked in the multidimensional scaling
literature. By turning MDS-MAP(P) into a method for manifold learning, we
obtain a local version of Isomap for which the minimization of the stress may
also be used for parameter tuning.

that the distribution of short-range order is determined by the confining

two confining grains. Ordered polyhedra density is found to be inversely
related to grain incompatibility, meaning that large incompatibilities between

differential equation (PDE) by casting it as a saddle point of a min-max
problem and using iterative optimization methods to find the saddle point. Our
approach is flexible with the choice of both time and spatial discretization
schemes. It benefits from the implicit structure and gains large regions of
stability, and overcomes the restriction on the mesh size in time by explicit
schemes from Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy (CFL) conditions (really via von Neumann
stability analysis). Nevertheless, it is highly parallelizable and
easy-to-implement. In particular, no nonlinear inversions are required!
Specifically, we illustrate our approach using the finite difference scheme and
discontinuous Galerkin method for the spatial scheme; backward Euler and
backward differentiation formulas for implicit discretization in time.
Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
approach. In future work, we will demonstrate that our idea of replacing an
initial-value evolution equation with this primal-dual hybrid gradient approach
has great advantages in many other situations.

years, with ongoing exploration of new technologies, a decrease in error rates,
and a growth in the number of qubits available in quantum processors. However,
near-term quantum algorithms are still unable to be induced without compounding
consequential levels of noise, leading to non-trivial erroneous results.
Quantum Error Correction and Mitigation are rapidly advancing areas of research
in the quantum computing landscape, with a goal of reducing errors. IBM has
recently emphasized that Quantum Error Mitigation is the key to unlocking the
full potential of quantum computing. A recent work, namely HAMMER, demonstrated
the existence of a latent structure regarding post-circuit induction errors
when mapping to the Hamming spectrum. However, they assumed that errors occur
solely in local clusters, whereas we observe that at higher average Hamming
distances this structure falls away. Our study demonstrates that the correlated
structure is not just limited to local patterns, but it also encompasses
certain non-local clustering patterns that can be accurately characterized
through a Poisson distribution model. This model takes into account the input
circuit, the current state of the device, including calibration statistics, and
the qubit topology. Using this quantum error characterizing model, we developed
an iterative algorithm over the generated Bayesian network state-graph for
post-induction error mitigation. Our Q-Beep approach delivers state-of-the-art
results, thanks to its problem-aware modeling of the error distribution's
underlying structure and the implementation of an Bayesian network state-graph.
This has resulted in an increase of up to 234.6% in circuit execution accuracy
on BV circuits and an average improvement of 71.0% in the quality of QAOA
solutions when tested on 16 IBMQ quantum processors.

has focused on the nutrient requirements of individuals, although most food and
anti-poverty programs target whole households. This raises the question of how
the cost of a nutrient-adequate diet can be measured for an entire household.
This study identifies upper and lower bounds on the feasibility, cost, and
affordability of meeting all household members' nutrient requirements using
2013-2017 survey data from Malawi. Findings show only a minority of households
can afford the nutrient-adequate diet at either bound, with 20% of households
able to afford the (upper bound) shared diets and 38% the individualized (lower
bound) diets. Individualized diets are more frequently feasible with locally
available foods (90% vs. 60% of the time) and exhibit more moderate seasonal
fluctuation. To meet all members' needs, a shared diet requires a more
nutrient-dense combination of foods that is more costly and exhibits more
seasonality in diet cost than any one food group or the individualized diets.
The findings further help adjudicate the extent to which nutritional behavioral
change programs versus broader agricultural and food policies can be relied
upon to improve individual access to healthy diets.

an approximate linear physics-based model into our optimization framework along
with a deep learning-based prior and solve the resulting problem using an

interaction up to next-to-next-to-leading-order and the Argonne $v_6'$

Green's function Monte Carlo and auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo, path
integral quantum Monte Carlo has the advantage that it can directly calculate
the expectation value of operators without tradeoff, whether they commute with
the Hamiltonian or not. For operators that commute with the Hamiltonian, e.g.,
the Hamiltonian itself, the path integral quantum Monte Carlo light-nuclei
results agree with Green's function Monte Carlo and auxiliary field diffusion
Monte Carlo results. For other operator expectations which are important to
understand nuclear measurements but do not commute with the Hamiltonian and
therefore cannot be accurately calculated by diffusion based quantum Monte
Carlo methods without tradeoff, the path integral quantum Monte Carlo method
gives reliable results. I show root-mean-square radii, one-particle number
density distributions, and Euclidean response functions for single-nucleon
couplings. I also systematically describe all the sampling algorithms used in
this work, the strategies to make the computation efficient, the error
estimations, and the details of the implementation of the code to perform
calculations. This work can serve as a benchmark test for future calculations
of larger nuclei or finite temperature nuclear matter using path integral

irrevocably, whether to purchase each observed edge. The observation time is
bounded by parameter $t$, and the total budget of purchased edges is bounded by
parameter $b$. Builder's goal is to devise a strategy that, with high
probability, allows him to construct a graph of purchased edges possessing a
target graph property $\mathcal{P}$, all within the limitations of observation
time and total budget. We show the following: (a) Builder has a strategy to
achieve $k$-vertex-connectivity at the hitting time for this property by
purchasing at most $c_kn$ edges for an explicit $c_k<k$; and a strategy to
achieve minimum degree $k$ (slightly) after the threshold for minimum degree
$k$ by purchasing at most $(1+\varepsilon)kn/2$ edges (which is optimal). (b)

substantially extends the classical hitting time result for Hamiltonicity due

  Collaborative Detection and Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typical text spotters follow the two-stage spotting paradigm which detects
the boundary for a text instance first and then performs text recognition
within the detected regions. Despite the remarkable progress of such spotting
paradigm, an important limitation is that the performance of text recognition
depends heavily on the precision of text detection, resulting in the potential
error propagation from detection to recognition. In this work, we propose the
single shot Self-Reliant Scene Text Spotter v2 (SRSTS v2), which circumvents
this limitation by decoupling recognition from detection while optimizing two
tasks collaboratively. Specifically, our SRSTS v2 samples representative
feature points around each potential text instance, and conducts both text
detection and recognition in parallel guided by these sampled points. Thus, the
text recognition is no longer dependent on detection, thereby alleviating the
error propagation from detection to recognition. Moreover, the sampling module
is learned under the supervision from both detection and recognition, which
allows for the collaborative optimization and mutual enhancement between two
tasks. Benefiting from such sampling-driven concurrent spotting framework, our
approach is able to recognize the text instances correctly even if the precise
text boundaries are challenging to detect. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks demonstrate that our method compares favorably to state-of-the-art
spotters.

  Evolution","ICML 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task-free continual learning (CL) aims to learn a non-stationary data stream
without explicit task definitions and not forget previous knowledge. The widely
adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long
data streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the
memory buffer. Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the
memory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data
distribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address
these problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution
framework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the
memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust
optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory
buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein
gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is w.r.t the worst-case evolved memory
data distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns
significantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods.
Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the
proposed framework, our method is more robust to adversarial examples than
existing task-free CL methods. Code is available on GitHub

aim to scale up single-node GCN accelerators to accelerate GCNs on large-scale
graphs. We first identify the communication pattern and challenges of
multi-node acceleration for GCNs on large-scale graphs. We observe that (1)
coarse-grained communication patterns exist in the execution of GCNs in
MultiAccSys, which introduces massive amount of redundant network transmissions
and off-chip memory accesses; (2) overall, the acceleration of GCNs in
MultiAccSys is bandwidth-bound and latency-tolerant. Guided by these two
observations, we then propose MultiGCN, the first MultiAccSys for large-scale
GCNs that trades network latency for network bandwidth. Specifically, by
leveraging the network latency tolerance, we first propose a topology-aware
multicast mechanism with a one put per multicast message-passing model to
reduce transmissions and alleviate network bandwidth requirements. Second, we
introduce a scatter-based round execution mechanism which cooperates with the
multicast mechanism and reduces redundant off-chip memory accesses. Compared to

experiment is performed using plain copper and plastic targets. High-energy
proton beams with maximum cut-off energy up to 62.5 MeV are achieved using
copper foils at the optimum target thickness of 4 {\mu}m via target normal

the proton cut-off energy is approximately 20 MeV, showing ring-like or

relatively good beam contrast. Further optimization for these key parameters is

Traditionally, ultra-massive white dwarfs are thought to harbour oxygen-neon

that some ultra-massive white dwarfs could harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) cores.
Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the core composition of

revealing the core-chemical composition in ultra-massive white dwarfs that is
based on the study of magnetic fields generated by convective mixing induced by
the crystallization process. ONe white dwarfs crystallize at higher
luminosities than their CO counterparts. Therefore, the study of magnetic
ultra-massive white dwarfs in the particular domain where ONe cores have
reached the crystallization conditions but CO cores have not, may provide
valuable support to their ONe core-chemical composition, since ONe white dwarfs
would display signs of magnetic fields and CO would not. We apply our method to
eight white dwarfs with magnetic field measurements and we suggest that these

circular polarization state - either left- or right-handed - reveals a broad
stop band with major attenuation, whereas the other polarization state is
transmitted nearly unimpeded. We observe such gaps in different frequency
ranges, with alternating handedness. The appearance of the circular-polarized
gaps is successfully interpreted with a physical model wherein the circular
polarization either co-rotates or counter-rotates with the chiral structure,
thereby effectively leading to a spatially-dependent or a constant refractive
index, and thus to the presence or absence of a gap. We find that the presence
or absence of circularly polarized gaps is tuned by the transverse periods
perpendicular to the chiral axis in both the 3D direct and inverse chiral

applications as on-chip sensors for circularly polarized light and in the

and language, are utilized to describe product items. It is an enormous
challenge to understand such diversified data, especially via extracting the
attribute-value pairs in text sequences with the aid of helpful image regions.
Although a series of previous works have been dedicated to this task, there
remain seldomly investigated obstacles that hinder further improvements: 1)
Parameters from up-stream single-modal pretraining are inadequately applied,
without proper jointly fine-tuning in a down-stream multi-modal task. 2) To
select descriptive parts of images, a simple late fusion is widely applied,
regardless of priori knowledge that language-related information should be
encoded into a common linguistic embedding space by stronger encoders. 3) Due
to diversity across products, their attribute sets tend to vary greatly, but
current approaches predict with an unnecessary maximal range and lead to more
potential false positives. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a
novel approach to boost multi-modal e-commerce attribute value extraction via
unified learning scheme and dynamic range minimization: 1) Firstly, a unified
scheme is designed to jointly train a multi-modal task with pretrained
single-modal parameters. 2) Secondly, a text-guided information range
minimization method is proposed to adaptively encode descriptive parts of each
modality into an identical space with a powerful pretrained linguistic model.
3) Moreover, a prototype-guided attribute range minimization method is proposed
to first determine the proper attribute set of the current product, and then
select prototypes to guide the prediction of the chosen attributes. Experiments
on the popular multi-modal e-commerce benchmarks show that our approach
achieves superior performance over the other state-of-the-art techniques.

significantly reducing the full-duplex self-interference coupled between the

compatible with existing cellular standards. Instead, STEER uses conventional
beam alignment to identify the general directions beams should be steered, and
then it makes use of a minimal number of self-interference measurements to
jointly select transmit and receive beams that deliver high gain in these
directions while coupling low self-interference. We implement STEER on an
industry-grade 28 GHz phased array platform and use further simulation to show
that full-duplex operation with beams selected by STEER can notably outperform
both half-duplex and full-duplex operation with beams chosen via conventional
beam selection. For instance, STEER can reliably reduce self-interference by
more than 20 dB and improve SINR by more than 10 dB, compared to conventional
beam selection. Our experimental results highlight that beam alignment can be
used not only to deliver high beamforming gain in full-duplex mmWave systems

First, we consider the large deviation behavior of

the unique equilibrium of the noiseless dynamics. Due to degeneracy of the
noise in the limit, the methods of Donsker and Varadhan (1976) are not directly

thus their discriminative power is restrained. To tackle this issue, we propose
a new positional spacial gating unit (PoSGU). It exploits the attention
formulations used in the classical relative positional encoding (RPE), to
efficiently encode the cross-token relations for token mixing. It can
successfully reduce the current quadratic parameter complexity $O(N^2)$ of
vision MLPs to $O(N)$ and $O(1)$. We experiment with two RPE mechanisms, and
further propose a group-wise extension to improve their expressive power with
the accomplishment of multi-granular contexts. These then serve as the key
building blocks of a new type of vision MLP, referred to as PosMLP. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting thorough experiments,
demonstrating an improved or comparable performance with reduced parameter
complexity. For instance, for a model trained on ImageNet1K, we achieve a
performance improvement from 72.14\% to 74.02\% and a learnable parameter
reduction from $19.4M$ to $18.2M$. Code could be found at

  Retrieval","13 pages, 6 figures, ACMMM22",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video-text retrieval has been a crucial and fundamental task in multi-modal
research. The development of video-text retrieval has been considerably
promoted by large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training, which primarily
focuses on coarse-grained or fine-grained contrast. However, cross-grained
contrast, which is the contrast between coarse-grained representations and
fine-grained representations, has rarely been explored in prior research.
Compared with fine-grained or coarse-grained contrasts, cross-grained contrast
calculate the correlation between coarse-grained features and each fine-grained
feature, and is able to filter out the unnecessary fine-grained features guided
by the coarse-grained feature during similarity calculation, thus improving the
accuracy of retrieval. To this end, this paper presents a novel multi-grained
contrastive model, namely X-CLIP, for video-text retrieval. However, another
challenge lies in the similarity aggregation problem, which aims to aggregate
fine-grained and cross-grained similarity matrices to instance-level
similarity. To address this challenge, we propose the Attention Over Similarity
Matrix (AOSM) module to make the model focus on the contrast between essential
frames and words, thus lowering the impact of unnecessary frames and words on
retrieval results. With multi-grained contrast and the proposed AOSM module,
X-CLIP achieves outstanding performance on five widely-used video-text
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT (49.3 R@1), MSVD (50.4 R@1), LSMDC (26.1
R@1), DiDeMo (47.8 R@1) and ActivityNet (46.2 R@1). It outperforms the previous
state-of-theart by +6.3%, +6.6%, +11.1%, +6.7%, +3.8% relative improvements on
these benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of multi-grained contrast and
AOSM.

Hbeta equivalent widths are derived to be ~400{\AA} and 100~{\AA},
respectively, and are consistent with values seen among quasars in the local
Universe, and at z ~2. After accounting for the contribution of photoionization
in the broad line regions of quasars, we suggest that the OIII emission
corresponds to strong, narrow line emission likely arising from feedback due to
massive star-formation in the quasar host. The high [OIII]/Hbeta line ratios
can uniquely be interpreted with radiative shock models, and translate to
magnetic field strengths of ~8 microGauss with shock velocities of ~400km/s.
Our measurement implies that strong, coherent magnetic fields were present in
the interstellar medium at a time when the universe was < 1 billion years old.
Comparing our estimated magnetic field strengths with models for the evolution
of galaxy-scale fields, favors high seed field strengths exceeding 0.1
microGauss, the first observational constraint on such fields. This high value
favors scenarios where seed magnetic fields were produced by turbulence in the

glassy states. Glass forming liquids or structural glasses are found very often
in three dimensions. However, in two dimensions(2D) it is believed that both
spin glass and structural glass can never exist at a finite temperature because
they are destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Using a large-scale quantum Monte
Carlo simulation, we discover a quantum-mechanically driven 2D glass phase at
finite temperatures. Our platform is an Ising spin model with a quantum
transverse field on a frustrated triangular lattice. How the present glass
phase is formed is understood by the following three steps. First, by the
interplay of geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuation, part of the spins
spontaneously form an antiferromagnetic honeycomb spin-superstructure. Then,
small randomness in the bond interaction works as a relevant perturbation to
this superstructure and breaks it up into {\it domains}, making it a structural
glass. The glassiness of the superstructure, in turn, generates an emergent
random magnetic field acting on the remaining fluctuating spins and freezes
them. The shape of domains thus formed depends sensitively on the quenching
process, which is one of the characteristic features of glass, originating from
a multi-valley free-energy landscape. The present system consists only of {\it
a single} bistable Ising degree of freedom, which naturally does not become a
structural glass alone nor a spin glass alone. Nevertheless, a glass having
both types of nature emerges in the form of coexisting two-component glasses,
algebraic structural-glass and long-range ordered spin-glass. This new concept
of glass-forming mechanism opens a way to realize functional glasses even in
low dimensional systems.

artifacts, i.e., the hair and ruler markings, discriminative feature extraction
from dermoscopic images is very challenging. In this study, we seek to resolve
these problems respectively towards better representation learning for lesion
features. Specifically, a GAN-based data augmentation (GDA) strategy is adapted
to generate synthetic melanoma-positive images, in conjunction with the
proposed implicit hair denoising (IHD) strategy. Wherein the hair-related
representations are implicitly disentangled via an auxiliary classifier network
and reversely sent to the melanoma-feature extraction backbone for better
melanoma-specific representation learning. Furthermore, to train the IHD
module, the hair noises are additionally labeled on the ISIC2020 dataset,
making it the first large-scale dermoscopic dataset with annotation of
hair-like artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component. The improved
dataset publicly avaliable at https://github.com/kirtsy/DermoscopicDataset.

as quasars and radio galaxies. Linear polarization of the background emission
is depolarized by Faraday rotation of inhomogeneous magnetized plasma of the
intervening galaxies. Exploring the depolarizing intervening galaxies (DINGs)
can be a powerful tool to investigate the cosmological evolution of the
galactic magnetic field. In this paper, we investigate the effects of DINGs on
background radio emission using theoretical DING models. We find that complex
structures of galaxy result in complicated depolarization features and the
Faraday dispersion functions (FDFs), but, for the features of depolarizations
and FDFs, the global component of magnetic fields is important. We show the
simplest results with ring magnetic field in the galactic disk. We find that
the degree of depolarization significantly depends on the inclination angle and
the impact parameter of the DING. We found that the larger the standard
deviation, the more likely it is that depolarization will occur. The FDF
represents the RM structure within the beam. The FDF exhibits multi-components
due mainly to the RM structure within the beam and the fraction of the DING
that covers the background emission (the filling factor). The peak Faraday
depth of the FDF is different from the beam-averaged RM of the DING. The
Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that DING's contribution to the standard
deviation of observed RMs follows $\sigma_{\rm RM} \propto 1/{(1+z)^k}$ with $k
\sim 2.7$ and exhibits a steeper redshift dependence than the wavelength
squared. DINGs will have a significant impact on RM catalogs created by future
survey projects such as the SKA and SKA Precursor/Pathfinder.

the Hessian matrix in the case of a connected harmonic-oscillator. The
diagonalization of the matrix gives the mode and frequency of the density

issues by removing the identity-related of the ReID data. However, most of the

paper, we aim to develop a technique that can achieve a good trade-off between
privacy protection and data usability for person ReID. To achieve this, we
propose a novel de-identification method designed explicitly for person ReID,
named Person Identify Shift (PIS). PIS removes the absolute identity in a
pedestrian image while preserving the identity relationship between image
pairs. By exploiting the interpolation property of variational auto-encoder,
PIS shifts each pedestrian image from the current identity to another with a
new identity, resulting in images still preserving the relative identities.
Experimental results show that our method has a better trade-off between
privacy-preserving and model performance than existing de-identification
methods and can defend against human and model attacks for data privacy.

paradigms for image reconstruction that can leverage the power of modern
denoisers for image regularization. In particular, these algorithms have been
shown to deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions using CNN denoisers. Since
the regularization is performed in an ad-hoc manner in PnP and RED,
understanding their convergence has been an active research area. Recently, it
was observed in many works that iterate convergence of PnP and RED can be
guaranteed if the denoiser is averaged or nonexpansive. However, integrating
nonexpansivity with gradient-based learning is a challenging task -- checking
nonexpansivity is known to be computationally intractable. Using numerical
examples, we show that existing CNN denoisers violate the nonexpansive property
and can cause the PnP iterations to diverge. In fact, algorithms for training
nonexpansive denoisers either cannot guarantee nonexpansivity of the final
denoiser or are computationally intensive. In this work, we propose to
construct averaged (contractive) image denoisers by unfolding ISTA and ADMM
iterations applied to wavelet denoising and demonstrate that their

For this reason, a fourth axiom has been proposed. In this paper we show how we

formed by an evaporation-induced flow through a fully-saturated porous slab.
Evaporation of saline waters can eventually result in the formation of salt
lakes as salt accumulates. As natural convection can impede the accumulation of
salt, establishing a relation between its occurrence and the value of physical
parameters such as evaporation rate, height of the slab or porosity is crucial.
One step towards determining when gravitational instabilities can arise is to
compute the ground-state salinity, that evolves due to the uniform upwards flow
caused by evaporation. The resulting salt concentration profile exhibits a
sharply increasing salt concentration near the surface, which can lead to a
gravitationally unstable setting. In this work, this ground state is
analytically derived within the framework of Sturm-Liouville theory. Then, the
method of linear stability in conjunction with the quasi-steady state approach
is employed to investigate the occurrence of instabilities. These instabilities
can develop and grow over time depending on the Rayleigh number and the
dimensionless height of the porous medium. To calculate the critical Rayleigh
number, which can determine the stability of a particular system, the
eigenvalues of the linear perturbation equations have to be computed. Here, a
novel fundamental matrix method is proposed to solve this eigenvalue problem
and shown to coincide with an established Chebyshev-Galerkin method in their
shared range of applicability. Finally, a 2-dimensional direct numerical
simulation of the full equation system via the finite volume method is employed
to validate the time of onset of convective instabilities predicted by the
linear theory. Moreover, the fully nonlinear convection patterns are analyzed.

of errors, that, though infrequent, can be large. We hypothesise that a
fundamental weakness of DL lies in its intrinsic dependence on
integrate-and-fire point neurons that maximise information transmission

evaluate arguments in practical scenarios. To adopt a richer characterization
for argument strength in real-world applications, we provide a novel
quantitative method called fuzzy labeling for fuzzy argumentation systems. For
fuzzy labeling, the argument strength is represented as a triple consisting of
acceptability, rejectability, and undecidability degree. With a richer scale,
it sheds new light on argument strength and gives us a deeper understanding
into status of arguments. For the purpose of evaluating arguments, we provide a
new way to establish gradual semantics by fuzzy labeling, which is crucial in
the evaluation process. We first investigate the rationality postulates of
fuzzy labeling, which are important for explaining the rationality of new
semantics taking into account the acceptability, rejectability and
undecidability degree together. We then propose a set of fuzzy labeling
semantics and prove some important properties which are crucial for comparing,

concern that original face images could be exposed to malicious intents and
consequently cause personal privacy breaches. This paper presents DuetFace, a
novel privacy-preserving face recognition method that employs collaborative
inference in the frequency domain. Starting from a counterintuitive discovery
that face recognition can achieve surprisingly good performance with only
visually indistinguishable high-frequency channels, this method designs a
credible split of frequency channels by their cruciality for visualization and
operates the server-side model on non-crucial channels. However, the model
degrades in its attention to facial features due to the missing visual
information. To compensate, the method introduces a plug-in interactive block
to allow attention transfer from the client-side by producing a feature mask.
The mask is further refined by deriving and overlaying a facial region of
interest (ROI). Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in protecting face images from undesired
visual inspection, reconstruction, and identification while maintaining high
task availability and performance. Results show that the proposed method
achieves a comparable recognition accuracy and computation cost to the

sleep dysfunction which impair cognitive and psychomotor functions, and, in
turn, increase driver risk. How this risk plays out in the real-world driving
settings is terra incognita. Addressing this knowledge gap requires
comprehensive observations of diabetes driver behavior and physiology in
challenging settings where crashes are more likely to occur, such as
stop-controlled traffic intersections, as in the current study of drivers with
Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM). Methods: 32 active drivers from around Omaha, NE
participated in 4-week, real-world study. Each participant's own vehicle was
instrumented with an advanced telematics and camera system collecting driving
sensor data and video. Videos were analyzed using computer vision models
detecting traffic elements to identify stop signs. Stop sign detections and
driver stopping trajectories were clustered to geolocate and extract
driver-visited stop intersections. Driver videos were then annotated to record
stopping behavior and key traffic characteristics. Stops were categorized as
safe or unsafe based on traffic law. Results: Mixed effects logistic regression
models examined how stopping behavior (safe vs. unsafe) in T1DM drivers was
affected by 1) abnormal sleep, 2) obesity, and 3) poor glucose control. Model
results indicate that one standard deviation increase in BMI (~7 points) in
T1DM drivers associated with a 14.96 increase in unsafe stopping odds compared
to similar controls. Abnormal sleep and glucose control were not associated
with increased unsafe stopping. Conclusion: This study links chronic patterns
of abnormal T1DM driver physiology, sleep, and health to driver safety risk at
intersections, advancing models to identify real-world safety risk in diabetes
drivers for clinical intervention and development of in-vehicle safety

alters PL spectra at a location with CNT gate electrodes. PL imaging has
revealed that image contrast from trions is linear along the CNT electrode
underneath, consistent with 1D confinement of trions in response to the CNT
local gating. The confinement width obtained from the PL image is 5.5 x 10^2
nm, consistent with nanoscale 1D confined trions with the diffraction limit
broadening. This work has demonstrated electrical control of excitonic states
at the nanoscale, leading to novel optoelectronic properties and exciton
devices in the future.

model introduced in Schmidt and Strauss (1975) that allows for lagged dependent

to a simple model for the intra-household relationship in employment. Our main

pose sequences from a sequence of observed poses. Previous approaches usually
employ deep generative networks to model the conditional distribution of data,
and then randomly sample outcomes from the distribution. While different
results can be obtained, they are usually the most likely ones which are not
diverse enough. Recent work explicitly learns multiple modes of the conditional
distribution via a deterministic network, which however can only cover a fixed
number of modes within a limited range. In this paper, we propose a novel
sampling strategy for sampling very diverse results from an imbalanced
multimodal distribution learned by a deep generative model. Our method works by
generating an auxiliary space and smartly making randomly sampling from the
auxiliary space equivalent to the diverse sampling from the target
distribution. We propose a simple yet effective network architecture that
implements this novel sampling strategy, which incorporates a Gumbel-Softmax
coefficient matrix sampling method and an aggressive diversity promoting hinge
loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
improves both the diversity and accuracy of the samplings compared with
previous state-of-the-art sampling approaches. Code and pre-trained models are

systems and ergodic theory. It states that every invariant measure on a
dynamical system is a mixture of ergodic ones. Here we formulate and prove the
theorem in terms of string diagrams, using the formalism of Markov categories.
We recover the usual measure-theoretic statement by instantiating our result in
the category of stochastic kernels. Along the way we give a conceptual
treatment of several concepts in the theory of deterministic and stochastic
dynamical systems. In particular,
  - ergodic measures appear very naturally as particular cones of deterministic
morphisms (in the sense of Markov categories);
  - the invariant $\sigma$-algebra of a dynamical system can be seen as a
colimit in the category of Markov kernels.
  In line with other uses of category theory, once the necessary structures are
in place, our proof of the main theorem is much simpler than traditional
approaches. In particular, it does not use any quantitative limiting arguments,
and it does not rely on the cardinality of the group or monoid indexing the
dynamics. We hope that this result paves the way for further applications of
category theory to dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and information theory.

by how humans detect anomalies, i.e., comparing an image in question to normal

inherently generalizable across categories, as the proxy task, to train a
category-agnostic anomaly detection model. During testing, the anomalies are
identified by comparing the registered features of the test image and its
corresponding support (normal) images. As far as we know, this is the first

called terminals, an (exact) flow sparsifier is a small network $G'$ that
preserves (exactly) all multicommodity flows that can be routed between the
terminals. Flow sparsifiers were introduced by Leighton and Moitra [STOC 2010],
and have been studied and used in many algorithmic contexts.
  A fundamental question that remained open for over a decade, asks whether
every $k$-terminal network admits an exact flow sparsifier whose size is
bounded by some function $f(k)$ (regardless of the size of $G$ or its
capacities). We resolve this question in the negative by proving that there
exist $6$-terminal networks $G$ whose flow sparsifiers $G'$ must have
arbitrarily large size. This unboundedness is perhaps surprising, since the
analogous sparsification that preserves all terminal cuts (called exact cut
sparsifier or mimicking network) admits sparsifiers of size $f_0(k)\leq
2^{2^k}$ [Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura, and Ragde, JCSS 1998].
  We prove our results by analyzing the set of all feasible demands in the
network, known as the demand polytope. We identify an invariant of this
polytope, essentially the slope of certain facets, that can be made arbitrarily
large even for $k=6$, and implies an explicit lower bound on the size of the
network. We further use this technique to answer, again in the negative, an
open question of Seymour [JCTB 2015] regarding flow-sparsification that uses
only contractions and preserves the infeasibility of one demand vector.

practice, these data-driven approaches must generalize robustly beyond the seen

to generalize is demonstrated by training on abdomen CT scans without metal
implants and testing on abdomen scans with metal implants as well as on head CT

known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to
assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. This paper analyzes the
current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature
review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used
digital GBAs to determine: (1) the context where the study has been applied;
(2) the primary purpose; (3) the domain of the game used; (4) game/tool

focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore,
the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from
the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our

for brain tumor diagnosis, cancer management and research purposes. With the
great success of the ten-year BraTS challenges as well as the advances of CNN
and Transformer algorithms, a lot of outstanding BTS models have been proposed
to tackle the difficulties of BTS in different technical aspects. However,
existing studies hardly consider how to fuse the multi-modality images in a
reasonable manner. In this paper, we leverage the clinical knowledge of how
radiologists diagnose brain tumors from multiple MRI modalities and propose a
clinical knowledge-driven brain tumor segmentation model, called CKD-TransBTS.
Instead of directly concatenating all the modalities, we re-organize the input
modalities by separating them into two groups according to the imaging
principle of MRI. A dual-branch hybrid encoder with the proposed
modality-correlated cross-attention block (MCCA) is designed to extract the
multi-modality image features. The proposed model inherits the strengths from
both Transformer and CNN with the local feature representation ability for
precise lesion boundaries and long-range feature extraction for 3D volumetric
images. To bridge the gap between Transformer and CNN features, we propose a
Trans&CNN Feature Calibration block (TCFC) in the decoder. We compare the
proposed model with five CNN-based models and six transformer-based models on
the BraTS 2021 challenge dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation performance

instances are represented by one-dimensional vectors that encode the semantic,
positional, and shape information of 3D instances. We show that instance
kernels enable easy mask inference by simply scanning kernels over the entire
scenes, avoiding the heavy reliance on proposals or heuristic clustering
algorithms in standard 3D instance segmentation pipelines. The idea of instance
kernel is inspired by recent success of dynamic convolutions in 2D/3D instance
segmentation. However, we find it non-trivial to represent 3D instances due to
the disordered and unstructured nature of point cloud data, e.g., poor instance
localization can significantly degrade instance representation. To remedy this,
we construct a novel 3D instance encoding paradigm. First, potential instance
centroids are localized as candidates. Then, a candidate merging scheme is
devised to simultaneously aggregate duplicated candidates and collect context
around the merged centroids to form the instance kernels. Once instance kernels
are available, instance masks can be reconstructed via dynamic convolutions
whose weights are conditioned on instance kernels. The whole pipeline is
instantiated with a dynamic kernel network (DKNet). Results show that DKNet
outperforms the state of the arts on both ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets with
better instance localization. Code is available:

the effect of frustration larger, which results in the stabilization of the

is modified by magnetic field annealing, and the effect of the same on the soft
Fe layer is monitored using the in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). A
considerable shift in the Fe layer hysteresis loop from the centre and an
unusual increase in the coercivity, similar to exchange bias phenomena, is
attributed to the exchange coupling at the [Co/Pt]ML and Fe interface. The
effect of the coupling on spin orientation at the interface is further explored
precisely by performing an isotope selective grazing incident nuclear resonance
scattering (GINRS) technique. Here, the interface selectivity is achieved by
introducing a 2 nm thick Fe57 marker between [Co/Pt]ML and Fe layers. Interface
sensitivity is further enhanced by performing measurements under the x-ray
standing wave conditions. The combined MOKE and GINRS analysis revealed the
unidirectional pinning of the Fe layer due to the net in-plane magnetic spin at
the interface caused by magnetic field annealing. Unidirectional exchange
coupling or pinning at the interface, which may be due to the formation of
asymmetrical closure domains, is found responsible for the origin of EB with an

neutrino mass and dark matter. For fermion dark matter $N_1$, a hierarchical
Yukawa structure $|y_{1e}|\ll|y_{1\mu}|\sim|y_{1\tau}|\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ is
usually favored to satisfy constraints from lepton flavor violation and relic
density. Such large $\mu$-related Yukawa coupling would greatly enhance the
pair production of charged scalar $\eta^\pm$ at the muon collider. In this
paper, we investigate the dilepton signature of the Scotogenic model at a 14
TeV muon collider. For the dimuon signature $\mu^+\mu^-+/ \hspace{-0.65em}
E_T$, we find that most viable samples can be probed with $200~\text{fb}^{-1}$
data. The ditau signature $\tau^+\tau^-+/ \hspace{-0.65em}E_T$ is usually less
promising but is important to probe the small $|y_{1\mu}|$ region. The
mono-photon signature $\gamma+/ \hspace{-0.65em} E_T$ could also probe the
compressed mass region $M_1\lesssim M_{\eta^\pm}$. Masses of charged scalar
$\eta^\pm$ and dark matter $N_1$ can be further extracted by a binned
likelihood fit of the dilepton energy.

GaAs-based heterostructures and of optically addressed self-assembled quantum
dots could open broad perspectives for new devices and functionalities. For
example, interfacing stationary solid-state qubits with photonic quantum states
would open a new pathway towards the realization of a quantum network with
extended quantum processing capacity in each node. While gated devices allow
very flexible confinement of electrons or holes, the confinement of excitons
without some element of self-assembly is much harder. To address this
limitation, we introduce a technique to realize exciton traps in quantum wells
via local electric fields by thinning a heterostructure down to a 220 nm thick
membrane. We show that mobilities over $1 \times 10^{6}$
cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ can be retained and that quantum point contacts and
Coulomb oscillations can be observed on this structure, which implies that the
thinning does not compromise the heterostructure quality. Furthermore, the
local lowering of the exciton energy via the quantum-confined Stark effect is
confirmed, thus forming exciton traps. These results lay the technological
foundations for devices like single photon sources, spin photon interfaces and
eventually quantum network nodes in GaAs quantum wells, realized entirely with
a top-down fabrication process.

observed, and the motion generated should be diverse. To address these
challenges, we propose ChoreoGraph, which choreographs high-quality dance
motion for a given piece of music over a Dynamic Graph. A data-driven learning
strategy is proposed to evaluate the aesthetic style and rhythmic connections
between music and motion in a progressively learned cross-modality embedding

and then incorporated as nodes of a Dynamic Motion Graph. Compatibility factors
such as the style and tempo consistency, motion context connection, action
completeness, and transition smoothness are comprehensively evaluated to
determine the node transition in the graph. We demonstrate that our

leaves a lot of uncertainty about the usefulness of these methods, particularly
for general purpose prediction systems that must perform reliably in extreme

conventional adaptive streaming methodologies often find themselves

unique features of point cloud video thus failing to provide optimal user
experience, 2) most deep learning approaches require long-span data collections

  To overcome the limitations, we present FRAS, the first federated

point cloud video streaming. We define a new QoE model which takes the unique
features of point cloud video into account. Each client uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to train video quality selection with the objective of optimizing
the user's QoE under multiple constraints. Then, a federated learning framework
is integrated with the RL algorithm to enhance training performance with
privacy preservation. Extensive simulations using real point cloud videos and
network traces reveal the superiority of the proposed scheme over baseline
schemes. We also implement a prototype that demonstrates the performance of
FRAS via real-world tests.

  Asymmetric Similarity-Popularity",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex networks are graphs representing real-life systems that exhibit
unique characteristics not found in purely regular or completely random graphs.
The study of such systems is vital but challenging due to the complexity of the
underlying processes. This task has nevertheless been made easier in recent
decades thanks to the availability of large amounts of networked data. Link
prediction in complex networks aims to estimate the likelihood that a link
between two nodes is missing from the network. Links can be missing due to
imperfections in data collection or simply because they are yet to appear.
Discovering new relationships between entities in networked data has attracted
researchers' attention in various domains such as sociology, computer science,
physics, and biology. Most existing research focuses on link prediction in
undirected complex networks. However, not all real-life systems can be
faithfully represented as undirected networks. This simplifying assumption is
often made when using link prediction algorithms but inevitably leads to loss
of information about relations among nodes and degradation in prediction
performance. This paper introduces a link prediction method designed explicitly
for directed networks. It is based on the similarity-popularity paradigm, which
has recently proven successful in undirected networks. The presented algorithms
handle the asymmetry in node relationships by modeling it as asymmetry in
similarity and popularity. Given the observed network topology, the algorithms
approximate the hidden similarities as shortest path distances using edge
weights that capture and factor out the links' asymmetry and nodes' popularity.
The proposed approach is evaluated on real-life networks, and the experimental
results demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting missing links across a
broad spectrum of networked data types and sizes.

completed 3 Target Sizes X 2 Distances X 3 feedback modalities = 18 trials. The

assessed at the end of each trial. Performance-wise, the results showed that
electrotactile feedback facilitates a significantly better accuracy compared to
vibrotactile & visual feedback, while vibrotactile provided the worst accuracy.
Electrotactile & visual feedback enabled a comparable reaction time, while the
vibrotactile offered a substantially slower reaction time than visual feedback.
Although amongst feedback types the pattern of differences in perceptual
aspects were comparable to performance differences, none of them was
statistically significant. However, performance indeed modulated perception.
Significant action-specific effects on spatial & time perception were detected.
Changes in accuracy modulate both size perception & time perception, while
changes in movement speed modulate distance perception. Also, the index of
difficulty was found to modulate perception. These outcomes highlighted the
importance of haptic feedback on performance, & importantly the significance of
action-specific effects on spatial & time perception in VR, which should be
considered in future VR studies.

entered a long-term low luminosity state, 0.4 magnitudes lower than the

  For a finite connected $G$-CW complex $Y$ such that $Y^G$ is non-empty and

static analysis, by making only an encrypted version of software executables
available to the human eye, no matter how the software is distributed, and (ii)
dynamic analysis, by guaranteeing that an encrypted executable can only be
correctly decrypted and executed by a single authenticated device. ERIC
comprises key hardware and software components to provide efficient software
obfuscation support: (i) a hardware decryption engine (HDE) enables efficient
decryption of encrypted hardware in the target device, (ii) the compiler can
seamlessly encrypt software executables given only a unique device identifier.
Both the hardware and software components are ISA-independent, making ERIC
general. The key idea of ERIC is to use physical unclonable functions (PUFs),
unique device identifiers, as secret keys in encrypting software executables.
Malicious parties that cannot access the PUF in the target device cannot
perform static or dynamic analyses on the encrypted binary. We develop ERIC's
prototype on an FPGA to evaluate it end-to-end. Our prototype extends RISC-V
Rocket Chip with the hardware decryption engine (HDE) to minimize the overheads
of software decryption. We augment the custom LLVM-based compiler to enable
partial/full encryption of RISC-V executables. The HDE incurs minor FPGA
resource overheads, it requires 2.63% more LUTs and 3.83% more flip-flops

compile time by 15.22% and the executable size by 1.59%. ERIC is publicly

obtaining subspace embeddings with a number of rows polynomial in $q$ for a

tensor networks with arbitrary graphs (which we refer to as general tensor

fixed-parameter tractability of these problems: We show that for every Boolean
constraint language $\Gamma$, either Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or
Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard but Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or Min
SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard. This generalizes recent work of Kim et al. (SODA

$\Gamma$ that cannot express implications $(u \to v)$ (as is used to, e.g.,
model digraph cut problems). Our result generalizes and subsumes multiple
previous results, including the FPT algorithms for Weighted Almost 2-SAT,
weighted and unweighted $\ell$-Chain SAT, and Coupled Min-Cut, as well as
weighted and directed versions of the latter. The main tool used in our

directed graph $G$, pairs of vertices (called terminals) $(s_1,t_1)$,
$(s_2,t_2)$, and $(s_3,t_3)$, and an integer $k$, asks to find a set of at most
$k$ non-terminal vertices in $G$ that intersect all $s_1t_1$-paths, all
$s_2t_2$-paths, and all $s_3t_3$-paths. The parameterized complexity of this
case has been open since Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, and Marx proved
fixed-parameter tractability of the 2-terminal-pairs case at SODA 2012, and
Pilipczuk and Wahlstr\""{o}m proved the W[1]-hardness of the 4-terminal-pairs

  On the technical side, we use two recent developments in parameterized
algorithms. Using the technique of directed flow-augmentation [Kim, Kratsch,
Pilipczuk, Wahlstr\""{o}m, STOC 2022] we cast the problem as a CSP problem with
few variables and constraints over a large ordered domain.We observe that this
problem can be in turn encoded as an FO model-checking task over a structure
consisting of a few 0-1 matrices. We look at this problem through the lenses of
twin-width, a recently introduced structural parameter [Bonnet, Kim,
Thomass\'{e}, Watrigant, FOCS 2020]: By a recent characterization [Bonnet,
Giocanti, Ossona de Mendes, Simon, Thomass\'{e}, Toru\'{n}czyk, STOC 2022] the
said FO model-checking task can be done in FPT time if the said matrices have
bounded grid rank. To complete the proof, we show an irrelevant vertex rule: If
any of the matrices in the said encoding has a large grid minor, a vertex
corresponding to the ``middle'' box in the grid minor can be proclaimed
irrelevant -- not contained in the sought solution -- and thus reduced.

Global Label Min-Cut (or sometimes Global Hedge Min-Cut): the edges of the
input (multi)graph are labeled (or partitioned into color classes or hedges),
and removing all edges of the same label (color or from the same hedge) costs
one. The problem asks to disconnect the graph at minimum cost.
  While the $st$-cut version of the problem is known to be NP-hard, the above
global cut version is known to admit a quasi-polynomial randomized $n^{O(\log
\mathrm{OPT})}$-time algorithm due to Ghaffari, Karger, and Panigrahi [SODA
2017]. They consider this as ``strong evidence that this problem is in P''. We
show that this is actually not the case. We complete the study of the
complexity of the Global Label Min-Cut problem by showing that the
quasi-polynomial running time is probably optimal: We show that the existence
of an algorithm with running time $(np)^{o(\log n/ (\log \log n)^2)}$ would
contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, and $p$ is the number of labels in the input. The key step for the
lower bound is a proof that Global Label Min-Cut is W[1]-hard when
parameterized by the number of uncut labels. In other words, the problem is
difficult in the regime where almost all labels need to be cut to disconnect
the graph. To turn this lower bound into a quasi-polynomial-time lower bound,
we also needed to revisit the framework due to Marx [Theory Comput. 2010] of
proving lower bounds assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis through the Subgraph
Isomorphism problem parameterized by the number of edges of the pattern. Here,
we provide an alternative simplified proof of the hardness of this problem that
is more versatile with respect to the choice of the regimes of the parameters.

studied using normal modes and is shown to have two unstable modes namely
sinuous and varicose modes. Sinuous modes are found to be more unstable
compared to the varicose modes. In the present study, we investigate the effect

Interestingly for St~10, the unstable varicose mode is completely damped.
Increasing the Stokes number by increasing the particle size, both sinuous and
varicose modes show increasing growth rates, while increasing density ratio has
a stabilizing effect on the flow. For non uniform particle loading, additional
modes apart from the sinuous and varicose modes are observed. These modes
suggests occurrence of compositional instability with an increased particle
accumulation in the shear layer that is an order of magnitude higher compared

reduction technique that preserves the structural properties of the ambient

``discrete'' notions of distance, e.g. the dynamic time warping or the discrete

the points of a time series, they are sensitive to different sampling rates or

effectively reducing the dimension. In particular, we show that one can reduce
the dimension to $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log N)$, where $N$ is the total number of
input points while preserving the continuous Fr\'echet distance between any two
determined polygonal curves within a factor of $1\pm \epsilon$. We conclude
with applications on clustering.

which is represented over a finite field of order $q$, a positive integer
weight function on the vertices of $G$, two sets of vertices $S,T \subseteq

from $S$ to $T$ so that the union of the vertices of these paths contains an
independent set of $M$ of cardinality $k$ and weight $w$, while minimizing the
sum of the lengths of the paths. We give a $2^{p+O(k^2 \log (q+k))} n^{O(1)} w$

and exchange without a trusted centralized institution. These features make
blockchain applications attractive to enhance trustworthiness in very different
contexts. Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain
has become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years.
Every participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by
cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special
incentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined
native cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain.
In many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction
throughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world.
A permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that
do not establish an entire trust relationship. Unlike permissionless
blockchains, the participants must be identified in permissioned blockchains.
By relying on the traditional crash fault-tolerant consensus protocols,
permissioned blockchains can achieve high transaction throughput and low
latency without sacrificing security. However, how to balance the security and
consensus efficiency is still the issue that needs to be solved urgently in
permissioned blockchains. As the core module of blockchain technology, the
consensus algorithm plays a vital role in the performance of the blockchain
system. Thus, this paper proposes a new consensus algorithm for permissioned
blockchain, the Risk Assessment-based Consensus protocol (RAC), combined with
the decentralized design concept and the risk-node assessment mechanism to
address the unbalance issues of performance in speed, scalability, and
security.

when the host star is not bright enough for radial velocity follow-up. However,
in the past decades, numerous works have shown that TTV-characterised planets
tend to have a lower densities than RV-characterised planets. Re-analysing 34
Kepler planets in the super-Earth to sub-Neptunes range using the RIVERS

transit timings were extracted from the light curve, which had a tendency to
under-estimate the TTV amplitudes. We recover robust mass estimates (i.e. low
prior dependency) for 23 of the planets. We compare these planets the
RV-characterised population. A large fraction of these previously had a
surprisingly low density now occupy a place of the mass-radius diagram much
closer to the bulk of the known planets, although a slight shift toward lower
densities remains, which could indicate that the compact multi-planetary
systems characterised by TTVs are indeed composed of planets which are
different from the bulk of the RV-characterised population. These results are
especially important for obtaining an unbiased view of the compact
multi-planetary systems detected by Kepler, TESS, and the upcoming PLATO

individualized treatment effects (ITE). Here, we leverage large-scale
electronic health record data, collected from Southern US academic clinics, to
emulate a clinical trial, i.e., 'target trial', and develop a machine learning

challenging condition with reduced treatment options - vancomycin is the
preferred choice, but it has non-negligible side effects. First, we use
propensity score matching to emulate the trial and create a treatment

to train various machine learning methods (including boosted/LASSO logistic

high-performance waverider and intake. Conventionally, the streamline equations
are solved after obtaining the velocity field from the solution of the
axisymmetric conical flow field. The hypersonic waverider shape is generated
from the base conical flow field by repeatedly applying the streamline tracing
approach along several planes. When exploring the design space for optimization
of the waverider, streamline tracing can be computationally expensive. We
provide a novel strategy where first the Taylor-Maccoll equations for the
inviscid axisymmetric conical flowfield and the streamlines from the shock are
solved for a wide range of cone angle and Mach number conditions resulting in
an extensive database. The streamlines are parametrized by a third-order
polynomial, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to predict the
coefficients of the polynomial for arbitrary inputs of Mach number, cone angle,
and streamline originating location on the shock . We apply this strategy to
design a cone derived waverider and compare the geometry obtained with the
standard conical waverider design method and the simplified waverider design
method. The ANN technique is highly accurate, with a difference of 0.68% with
the standard in the coordinates of the waverider. RANS computations show that
the ANN derived waverider does not indicate severe flow spillage at the leading

and recover well-known angular offsets for high ellipticities. Using the
Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-field approximation (CQSFA), we assess how the
field ellipticity affects specific holographic patterns, such as the fan and
the spider. The interplay of the external field and the binding potential leads
to twisted holographic patterns in the fan, and to loss of contrast in the
spider. This behavior can be traced back to interfering electron trajectories,
and unequal changes in tunneling probability due to non-vanishing ellipticity.
We also derive tunneling times analytically using the strong-field

interference is expected to be prominent, and discuss how to construct
continuous electron momentum distributions exploring the rotation symmetry

crisis. However, distributed PV generation, which amounts to half of the PV
installed capacity, is typically unavailable to transmission system operators
(TSOs), making it increasingly difficult to balance the load and supply and
avoid grid congestions. To assess distributed PV generation, TSOs need precise
knowledge regarding the metadata of distributed PV installations. Many remote
sensing-based approaches have been proposed to map these installations in
recent years. However, to use these methods in industrial processes, assessing
their accuracy over the mapping area, i.e., the area covered by the model
during deployment, is necessary. We define the downstream task accuracy (DTA)
as the accuracy over the mapping area, automatically computed using publicly
available data sources and the model's outputs and expressed in an
interpretable way for operators. We benchmark existing models for distributed
PV mapping and show how they perform in terms of DTA. We show that the accuracy
computed on the test set overestimates by about 30 percentage points the
accuracy on the mapping area. Our approach paves the way for safer integration
of deep-learning-based pipelines for remote PV mapping. Code is available at

if the noise intensity goes to zero, these solutions converge, up to a

present the stable invariant model (SIM), a new class of deep models that in

The key ingredient in deriving SIMs is a representation of the dynamics with
the spectra of the Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators. This perspective
approximately reveals stable dynamics with DEQs and then derives two variants

critical real-time applications. Yet, even the simplest microprocessors
implement pipelines with concurrently-accessed resources, such as the memory
bus shared by fetch and memory stages. Although their in-order pipelines are,
by nature, very deterministic, the bus can cause out-of-order accesses to the
memory and, therefore, timing anomalies: local timing effects that can have
global effects but that cannot be easily composed to estimate the global WCET.
To cope with this situation, WCET analyses have to generate important
over-estimations in order to preserve safety of the computed times or have to
explicitly track all possible executions. In the latter case, the presence of
out-of-order behavior leads to a combinatorial blowup of the number of pipeline
states for which efficient state abstractions are difficult to design. This
paper proposes instead a compact and exact representation of the timings in the
pipeline, using eXecution Decision Diagram (XDD) [1]. We show how XDD can be
used to model pipeline states all along the execution paths by leveraging the
algebraic properties of XDD. This computational model allows to compute the
exact temporal behavior at control flow graph level and is amenable to
efficiently and precisely support WCET calculation in presence of out-of-order
bus accesses. This model is finally experimented on the TACLe benchmark suite

address this issue, we present a temporal memory-based RRT (TM-RRT) exploration
strategy for multi-robot to perform robust exploration in an unknown

calculates the frontier's revenue based on the relative position of each robot.
In addition, each robot is equipped with a memory consisting of frontier

frontier. Through both simulation and actual deployment, we have shown the
robustness of TM-RRT exploration strategy by completing the exploration in a
25.0m x 54.0m (1350.0m2) area, while the conventional RRT exploration strategy

privacy leakage challenge of centralized learning. However, in FL, users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics can
deteriorate the performance of the global model. Specifically, the global model
suffers from the weight divergence challenge owing to non-IID data. To address
the aforementioned challenge, we propose a novel diffusion strategy of the
machine learning (ML) model (FedDif) to maximize the FL performance with
non-IID data. In FedDif, users spread local models to neighboring users over
D2D communications. FedDif enables the local model to experience different
distributions before parameter aggregation. Furthermore, we theoretically
demonstrate that FedDif can circumvent the weight divergence challenge. On the
theoretical basis, we propose the communication-efficient diffusion strategy of
the ML model, which can determine the trade-off between the learning
performance and communication cost based on auction theory. The performance
evaluation results show that FedDif improves the test accuracy of the global
model by 10.37% compared to the baseline FL with non-IID settings. Moreover,
FedDif improves the number of consumed sub-frames by 1.28 to 2.85 folds to the
latest methods except for the model compression scheme. FedDif also improves
the number of transmitted models by 1.43 to 2.67 folds to the latest methods.

not necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is
still important to improve drivers' situation awareness (SA) in unexpected
driving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this
study, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension
(SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation
framework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these
explanations and their modalities on drivers' situational trust, cognitive
workload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2
and SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio)
between-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 participants recruited from
Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the
explanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect
their attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their
meaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of
understanding the correspondence of AV's behavior in the particular situations
which also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that
participants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the
mental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided
insights into the relationship between the amount of information in
explanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with
visual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more
satisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition.

detecting OOD samples is to reject them so their impact on the quality of
predictions is reduced. We show under this task specification, that existing

OOD detection. This is because it is no longer an issue to conflate
in-distribution (ID) data with OOD data if the ID data is going to be
misclassified. However, the conflation within ID data of correct and incorrect
predictions becomes undesirable. We also propose a novel method for SCOD,
Softmax Information Retaining Combination (SIRC), that augments softmax-based
confidence scores with feature-agnostic information such that their ability to
identify OOD samples is improved without sacrificing separation between correct
and incorrect ID predictions. Experiments on a wide variety of ImageNet-scale

nitrogen--vacancy (NV) center in diamond, provides new opportunities for
sensitive and highly localized characterization of chemical functionality.
Notably, near-surface defects facilitate detection of the minute magnetic
fields generated by nuclear or electron spins outside of the diamond crystal,
such as those in chemisorbed and physisorbed molecules. However, the promise of
NV centers is hindered by a severe degradation of critical sensor properties,
namely charge stability and spin coherence, near surfaces (< ca. 10 nm deep).
Moreover, applications in the chemical sciences require methods for covalent
bonding of target molecules to diamond with robust control over density,
orientation, and binding configuration. This forward-looking Review provides a
survey of the rapidly converging fields of diamond surface science and
NV-center physics, highlighting their combined potential for quantum sensing of
molecules. We outline the diamond surface properties that are advantageous for
NV-sensing applications, and discuss strategies to mitigate deleterious effects
while simultaneously providing avenues for chemical attachment. Finally, we
present an outlook on emerging applications in which the unprecedented
sensitivity and spatial resolution of NV-based sensing could provide unique
insight into chemically functionalized surfaces at the single-molecule level.

have been identified. These are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring
every ~9 hr, lasting ~1 hr, and during which the X-ray count rate increases by
up to two orders of magnitude with respect to an otherwise stable quiescent
level. The X-ray spectral properties and the long-term evolution of GSN 069 in
the first few years are consistent with a long-lived tidal disruption event
(TDE). Here we derive the properties of QPEs and of the long-term X-ray
evolution in GSN 069 over the past 12 yr by studying timing and spectral X-ray
data from 11 XMM-Newton, one Chandra, and 34 Swift observations on timescales
ranging from minutes to years. QPEs in GSN 069 are a transient phenomenon with
a lifetime > 1.05 yr. The QPE intensity and recurrence time oscillate and allow
for alternating strong-weak QPEs and long-short recurrence times to be defined.
In observations with QPEs, the quiescent level exhibits a quasi-periodic
oscillation with a period equal to the average separation between consecutive
QPEs. The QPE spectral evolution is consistent with thermal emission from a
very compact region that heats up quickly and subsequently cools down via X-ray
emission while expanding by a factor of ~3 in radius. The long-term evolution
of the quiescent level is characterised by two repeating TDEs ~9 yr apart. We
detect a precursor X-ray flare prior to the second TDE that may be associated
with the circularisation phase during disc formation. A similar precursor flare
is tentatively detected just before the first TDE. Future X-ray observations of
GSN 069 promise that the QPE origin and the relation between QPEs and repeating
TDEs in this galactic nucleus will be constrained, with consequences for the
other sources where QPEs have been identified. [abridged]

Energy extraction from the deep subsurface requires engineering using a working

is an advantage compared to other working fluids. This study developed a
field-scale hydro-thermal model to examine the heat extraction potential from
Soultz-sous-For\^ets with CO2 as the working fluid. Results are compared for
the same scenario with water as the working fluid. A better understanding of
the heat extraction mechanism is established by considering the reservoir
response and the wellbore heat exchange. Sensitivity analyses are performed for
different injection temperatures and flow rates for 50 years. Results show that
the wellbore effect is multiple times higher than the reservoir response to the
production temperature. Furthermore, lowering the injection temperature
eventuates to a smaller temperature reduction at the subsurface, enhancing the
overall heat extraction potential with a minor impact on thermal breakthrough.
The cold region developed around the injection wellbore may affect the
production fluid temperature due to its proximity to the production wellbore.
To reach higher heat extraction efficiency, it is essential to use sufficient
wellbore spacing. CO2 can be used as working fluid for over 50 years as it does
not show significant thermal breakthrough and temperature plume evolution in
the reservoir under studied conditions. CO2 shows lower temperature reduction
for all injection rates and temperatures for 50 years of operation.

In-Distribution (ID) data drawn from the training distribution from OOD data

Ensembles are a well-established method of improving the quality of uncertainty
estimates produced by deep neural networks, and have been shown to have
superior OOD detection performance compared to single models. An existing
intuition in the literature is that the diversity of Deep Ensemble predictions
indicates distributional shift, and so measures of diversity such as Mutual

this intuition is not valid on ImageNet-scale OOD detection -- using MI leads
to 30-40% worse %FPR@95 compared to single-model entropy on some OOD datasets.
We suggest an alternative explanation for Deep Ensembles' better OOD detection
performance -- OOD detection is binary classification and we are ensembling
diverse classifiers. As such we show that practically, even better OOD
detection performance can be achieved for Deep Ensembles by averaging
task-specific detection scores such as Energy over the ensemble.

covering LPs, such as the dynamic fractional matching and set cover problems.
But until now, there is no non-trivial dynamic algorithm for general packing
and covering LPs.
  In this paper, we settle the complexity of dynamic packing and covering LPs,
up to a polylogarithmic factor in update time. More precisely, in the partially
dynamic setting (where updates can either only relax or only restrict the
feasible region), we give near-optimal deterministic $\epsilon$-approximation
algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time. Then, we show that both
partially dynamic updates and amortized update time are necessary; without any

  To obtain our results, we initiate a systematic study of the multiplicative
weights update (MWU) method in the dynamic setting. As by-products of our
techniques, we also obtain the first online $(1+\epsilon)$-competitive
algorithms for both covering and packing LPs with polylogarithmic recourse, and

models to cover the full analytic process starting from raw datasets. Over the
years, several solutions have been proposed to automate the building of ML
pipelines, most of them focused on semantic aspects and characteristics of the
input dataset. However, an approach taking into account the new quality
concerns needed by ML systems (like fairness, interpretability, privacy, etc.)
is still missing. In this paper, we first identify, from the literature, key
quality attributes of ML systems. Further, we propose a new engineering
approach for quality ML pipeline by properly extending the Feature Models
meta-model. The presented approach allows to model ML pipelines, their quality
requirements (on the whole pipeline and on single phases), and quality
characteristics of algorithms used to implement each pipeline phase. Finally,
we demonstrate the expressiveness of our model considering the classification
problem.

this paper, we obtain several new results in this problem including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For paths of short length, we show that $C(n,P_{4})=\Omega(n^{1/5})$
and $C(n,P_{t})=\Omega(n^{1/3})$ with $t\in\{5,6\}$, which significantly
improve the previously known lower bounds $(\log{n})^{\Omega(1)}$.

$r\geqslant 8$. This provides the first instance of graph for which the lower
bound goes beyond the natural barrier $\Omega(n^{1/2})$. Moreover, we prove
that $C(n,K_{s,t})=\Omega(n^{2/3})$ for $t\geqslant s\geqslant 7$.
  \item When $H$ is a star with at least $4$ leaves, a matching of size at
least $4$, or a path of length at least $7$, we give the new lower bound for

Spontaneous creation of such regions will inevitably lead to plasma
oscillations that will subsequently decay over a few periods via anomalous
heating and, under certain conditions, emission of high energy quanta, until
the system relaxes to a state in which $B^2-E^2 \sim 0$. For M87, assuming pair

  Participatory Design (PD), the process of including stakeholders such as end
users early in the robot design process, has been used with noteworthy success
in HRI, but typically remains limited to the early phases of development.
Resulting robot behaviors are often then hardcoded by engineers or utilized in
Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) systems that rarely achieve autonomy. End-User Programming
(EUP), i.e., the research of tools allowing end users with limited computer
knowledge to program systems, has been widely applied to the design of robot
behaviors for interaction with humans, but these tools risk being used solely
as research demonstrations only existing for the amount of time required for
them to be evaluated and published.
  In the PD/EUP Workshop, we aim to facilitate mutual learning between these
communities and to create communication opportunities that could help the
larger HRI community work towards end-user personalized and adaptable

useful for wider society. From this workshop, we expect new collaboration
opportunities to emerge and we aim to formalize new methodologies that

$n$ nodes has its own private function $f_i$, and nodes communicate with their
neighbors to cooperatively minimize the aggregate objective $\sum_{i=1}^n f_i$.
In this setting, synchronizing the nodes' updates incurs significant
communication overhead and computational costs, so much of the recent
literature has focused on the analysis and design of asynchronous optimization
algorithms, where agents activate and communicate at arbitrary times without
needing a global synchronization enforcer. However, most works assume that when
a node activates, it selects the neighbor to contact based on a fixed
probability (e.g., uniformly at random), a choice that ignores the optimization
landscape at the moment of activation. Instead, in this work we introduce an
optimization-aware selection rule that chooses the neighbor providing the
highest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a dualization of the
problem based on consensus). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent
(CD) method with the Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our
setting however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration
(because each node can communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing
literature on GS methods does not apply. To overcome this difficulty, we
develop a new analytical framework for smooth and strongly convex $f_i$ that
covers the class of set-wise CD algorithms -- a class that directly applies to
decentralized scenarios, but is not limited to them -- and we show that the
proposed set-wise GS rule achieves a speedup factor of up to the maximum degree
in the network (which is in the order of $\Theta(n)$ for highly connected
graphs). The speedup predicted by our analysis is validated in numerical
experiments with synthetic data.

semi-uniform Feller continuity of transition probabilities. The property of
semi-uniform Feller continuity was introduced in Feinberg, Kasyanov, and
Zgurovsky (2021), and, if the original transition probability has this
property, then the transition probability of the process, whose state is a pair
consisting of the belief probability and observation, also has this property.
Thus, this property implies weak continuity of nonlinear filters. This paper

which has reached the status of a paradigmatic model. Several different models
of single-file diffusion have been shown to be related by a duality relation,
which holds either microscopically or only in the hydrodynamic limit of large
time and large distances. Here, we show that, within the framework of
fluctuating hydrodynamics, these relations are not specific to these models and
that, in the hydrodynamic limit, every single-file system can be mapped onto a
dual single-file system, which we characterise. This general duality relation
allows us to obtain new results for different models, by exploiting the

the disordered system that is generated using the technique of special
quasirandom structures which mimics the site correlation of a truly random
alloy and reduces the configurational space that arises due to the vast
enumeration of alloy occupation sites. The impact of the disorder is then
evaluated on the electron effective mass and bandgap which is calculated under
the generalized gradient approximation \textit{(GGA)}. The EBS of disordered
systems gives an insight into the effect of the loss of translational symmetry
on the band topology which manifests as band broadening and can be used to
evaluate disorder induced scattering rates and electron lifetimes. This
technique of band unfolding can be further extended to alloy phonon dispersion
and subsequently phonon lifetimes can also be evaluated from the band

Meanwhile, the insufficiency of brain network data limits the model performance

statistical fidelity (SF). This allows us to better understand the advantages
and disadvantages of existing SR algorithms, which produce images at different
clusters in the 2D space of (DF, SF). Specifically, we observe an interesting
trend from more traditional SR algorithms that are typically inclined to
optimize for DF while losing SF, to more recent generative adversarial network
(GAN) based approaches that by contrast exhibit strong advantages in achieving
high SF but sometimes appear weak at maintaining DF. Furthermore, we propose an
uncertainty weighting scheme based on content-dependent sharpness and texture
assessment that merges the two fidelity measures into an overall quality
prediction named the Super Resolution Image Fidelity (SRIF) index, which
demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art IQA models when

alternative to the current state of the art: extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
lithography. However, it was recently shown that the interaction of the
metastable atoms with the mask material (SiN) leads to a strong perturbation of
the wavefront, not included in existing mask generation theory, which is based
on classical scalar waves. This means that the inverse problem (creating a mask
based on the desired pattern) cannot be solved analytically even in 1D. Here we
present a machine learning approach to mask generation targeted for metastable

proven successful for extracting and exploiting low-dimensional manifold from
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The nominal computational
cost of solving a rank-$r$ reduced-order model (ROM) based on time-dependent
basis, a.k.a. TDB-ROM, is roughly equal to that of solving the full-order model
for $r$ random samples. As of now, this nominal performance can only be
achieved for linear or quadratic SPDEs -- at the expense of a highly intrusive
process. On the other hand, for problems with non-polynomial nonlinearity, the
computational cost of solving the TDB evolution equations is the same as
solving the full-order model. In this work, we present an adaptive sparse
interpolation algorithm that enables stochastic TDB-ROMs to achieve nominal
computational cost for generic nonlinear SPDEs. Our algorithm constructs a
low-rank approximation for the right hand side of the SPDE using the discrete
empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The presented algorithm does not require
any offline computation and as a result the low-rank approximation can adapt to
any transient changes of the dynamics on the fly. We also propose a
rank-adaptive strategy to control the error of the sparse interpolation. Our
algorithm achieves computational speedup by adaptive sampling of the state and
random spaces. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach for two test cases:
(1) one-dimensional stochastic Burgers' equation, and (2) two-dimensional
compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to one-hundred-dimensional random
perturbations. In all cases, the presented algorithm results in orders of
magnitude reduction in the computational cost.

accelerate the training process and yield better machine learning models due to
the availability and diversity of data. However, privacy concerns make it
challenging to exchange data while preserving confidentiality. Federated
Learning (FL) is a promising solution that enables collaborative training
through exchange of model parameters instead of raw data. However, most
existing FL solutions work under the assumption that participating clients are
\emph{honest} and thus can fail against poisoning attacks from malicious
parties, whose goal is to deteriorate the global model performance. In this
work, we propose a robust aggregation rule called Distance-based Outlier
Suppression (DOS) that is resilient to byzantine failures. The proposed method
computes the distance between local parameter updates of different clients and
obtains an outlier score for each client using Copula-based Outlier Detection
(COPOD). The resulting outlier scores are converted into normalized weights
using a softmax function, and a weighted average of the local parameters is
used for updating the global model. DOS aggregation can effectively suppress
parameter updates from malicious clients without the need for any
hyperparameter selection, even when the data distributions are heterogeneous.
Evaluation on two medical imaging datasets (CheXpert and HAM10000) demonstrates
the higher robustness of DOS method against a variety of poisoning attacks in
comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found here

false data injection attacks (SFDIAs), as SFDIAs can bypass residual-based bad
data detection mechanisms. The SFDIA detection has become one of the focuses of
smart grid research. Methods based on deep learning technology have shown
promising accuracy in the detection of SFDIAs. However, most existing methods
rely on the temporal structure of a sequence of measurements but do not take
account of the spatial structure between buses and transmission lines. To
address this issue, we propose a spatiotemporal deep network, PowerFDNet, for
the SFDIA detection in AC-model power grids. The PowerFDNet consists of two
sub-architectures: spatial architecture (SA) and temporal architecture (TA).
The SA is aimed at extracting representations of bus/line measurements and
modeling the spatial structure based on their representations. The TA is aimed
at modeling the temporal structure of a sequence of measurements. Therefore,
the proposed PowerFDNet can effectively model the spatiotemporal structure of
measurements. Case studies on the detection of SFDIAs on the benchmark smart
grids show that the PowerFDNet achieved significant improvement compared with
the state-of-the-art SFDIA detection methods. In addition, an IoT-oriented
lightweight prototype of size 52 MB is implemented and tested for mobile
devices, which demonstrates the potential applications on mobile devices. The

generalizations of binary constraint satisfaction problems (BINARY-CSPs), that
subsume variants of graph colouring problems. Our starting point is the
observation that several algorithmic approaches that resulted in complexity
upper bounds for these problems, share a common structure. We thus explore an
algebraic approach relying on semirings that unifies different generalizations
of BINARY-CSPs (such as the counting, the list, and the weighted versions), and
that facilitates a general algorithmic approach to efficiently solving them.
The latter is inspired by the (component) twin-width parameter introduced by
Bonnet et al., which we generalize via edge-labelled graphs in order to
formulate it to arbitrary binary constraints. We consider input instances with
bounded component twin-width, as well as constraint templates of bounded
component twin-width, and obtain an FPT algorithm as well as an improved,
exponential-time algorithm, for broad classes of binary constraints. We
illustrate the advantages of this framework by instantiating our general
algorithmic approach on several classes of problems (e.g., the $H$-coloring
problem and its variants), and showing that it improves the best complexity
upper bounds in the literature for several well-known problems.

(FSO) communication systems working in the mid-infrared (Mid-IR) wavelength
range. As compared to more common FSO systems exploiting the telecom range, the
larger wavelength employed in Mid-IR systems delivers exceptional benefits in
case of adverse atmospheric conditions, as the reduced scattering rate strongly
suppresses detrimental effects on the FSO link length given by the presence of
rain, dust, fog and haze. In this work, we use a novel FSO testbed operating at
\SI{4.7}{\micro m}, to provide a detailed experimental analysis of noise
regimes that could occur in realistic FSO Mid-IR systems based on QCLs. Our
analysis reveals the existence of two distinct noise regions, corresponding to
different realistic channel attenuation conditions, which are precisely
controlled in our setup. To relate our results with real outdoor
configurations, we combine experimental data with predictions of an atmospheric
channel loss model, finding that error-free communication could be attained for
effective distances up to 8~km in low visibility conditions of 1 km. Our

individual group delays. In this study, we realize reflectionless metafilms by
arranging the meta-atoms so that the Brewster effect occurs regardless of the
