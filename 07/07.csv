lowered onto a hot surface. Evaporative flow couples to elastic deformation,
giving spontaneous bouncing or steady-state floating. The effect embodies an
unexplored interplay between thermodynamics, elasticity, and lubrication:
despite being observed, its basic theoretical description remains a challenge.
Here, we provide a theory of elastic Leidenfrost floating. As weight increases,
a rigid solid sits closer to the hot surface. By contrast, we discover an
elasticity-dominated regime where the heavier the solid, the higher it floats.
We show that this elastic regime is characterized by Hertzian behavior of the
solid's underbelly and derive how the float height scales with materials
parameters. Introducing a dimensionless elastic Leidenfrost number, we capture
the crossover between rigid and Hertzian behavior. Our results provide
theoretical underpinning for recent experiments, and point to the design of
novel soft machines.

uncontrollably in time with the fluctuating bath. This can result in an
emission/absorption spectrum that is spread over a broad range of frequencies
and presents a challenging hurdle for various applications. We consider a
quantum emitter in an environment that alters the energy levels so that the
emission frequency is represented by a Gaussian random distribution around a
given mean value with given standard deviation and correlation time. We study
the emission spectrum of this system when it is placed under the influence of a
periodic sequence of finite width $\pi$ pulses. We show that this external
field protocol can effectively overcome spectral diffusion in this system by
refocusing the bulk of the emission spectrum onto the pulse carrier frequency.
We further consider two such emitters in different noisy environments and find
that the two-photon interference operation can be made efficient by the
sequence of finite width pulses applied on both systems. Finally, we show that
an ensemble of nominally similar emitters, each with its different environment,
and thus randomly shifted emission frequency, can have its overall emission
spectrum that would otherwise be inhomogeneously broadened according to the
random distribution, refocused onto a lineshape with a well-defined central
peak that has the linewidth of an individual isolated non-noisy emitter. These
results demonstrate for this specific model of noisy environments, the
protection of spectral properties by an external control protocol here

real-world web applications such as retail, banking, and e-commerce. The
success of these web applications largely depends on the ability of the
employed machine learning model to accurately distinguish influential features
from all the predetermined features in tabular data. Intuitively, in practical
business scenarios, different instances should correspond to different sets of
influential features, and the set of influential features of the same instance
may vary in different scenarios. However, most existing methods focus on global
feature selection assuming that all instances have the same set of influential
features, and few methods considering instance-wise feature selection ignore
the variability of influential features in different scenarios. In this paper,
we first introduce a new perspective based on the influence function for
instance-wise feature selection, and give some corresponding theoretical
insights, the core of which is to use the influence function as an indicator to
measure the importance of an instance-wise feature. We then propose a new
solution for discovering instance-wise influential features in tabular data
(DIWIFT), where a self-attention network is used as a feature selection model
and the value of the corresponding influence function is used as an
optimization objective to guide the model. Benefiting from the advantage of the
influence function, i.e., its computation does not depend on a specific
architecture and can also take into account the data distribution in different
scenarios, our DIWIFT has better flexibility and robustness. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to
validate the effectiveness of our DIWIFT.

functional groups such as thiophenes, they form a very broad class of
donor-acceptor molecules: thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrroles (TDPPs). Despite
their widescale use in biosensors and photovoltaic materials, studies have yet
to establish the important link between the electronic structure of the
specific TDPP and the critical optical properties. To bridge this gap,
ultrafast transient absorption with 22 fs time resolution has been used to
explore the photophysics of three prototypical TDPP molecules: a monomer, dimer
and polymer in solution. These studies show that the photophysics of these
molecular prototypes under visible photoexcitation are determined by just two
excited electronic states, having very different electronic characters (one is
optically bright, the other dark), their relative energetic ordering and the
timescales for internal conversion from one to the other and/or to the ground
state. The underlying difference in electronic structure alters the branching
between these excited states and their associated dynamics. In turn, these
factors dictate the fluorescence quantum yields, which are shown to vary by
~1-2 orders of magnitude across the TDPP prototypes investigated here. The fast
non-radiative transfer of molecules from the bright to dark states is mediated
by conical intersections. Remarkably, wavepacket signals in the measured
transient absorption data carry signatures of the nuclear motions that enable
mixing of the electronic-nuclear wavefunction and facilitate non-adiabatic
coupling between the bright and dark states.

The element abundance on the stellar surface evolves along the lifetime of the
star because of transport processes, including atomic diffusion. However,
models of stars with masses higher than about 1.2Msun predict unrealistic
variations at the stellar surface. This indicates the need for competing
transport processes that are mostly computationally expensive for large grids
of stellar models. The purpose of this study is to implement turbulent mixing
in stellar models and assess the possibility of reproducing the effect of
radiative accelerations with turbulent mixing for elements like iron in order
to make the computation of large grids possible. We computed stellar models
with MESA and assessed the effects of atomic diffusion (with radiative
acceleration) in the presence of turbulent mixing. We parametrised the effect
of radiative accelerations on iron with a turbulent diffusion coefficient.
Finally, we tested this parametrisation by modelling two F-type stars of the
Kepler Legacy sample. We found that, for iron, a parametrisation of turbulent
mixing that simulates the effect of radiative acceleration is possible. This
leads to an increase in the efficiency of the turbulent mixing to counteract
the effect of gravitational settling. This approximation does not affect
significantly the surface abundances of the other elements we studied, except
for oxygen and calcium. We demonstrate that this parametrisation has a
negligible impact on the accuracy of the seismic properties inferred with these
models. Moreover, turbulent mixing makes the computation of realistic F-type
star models including the effect atomic diffusion possible. This leads to
differences of about 10% in the inferred ages compared to results obtained with
models that neglect these processes.

softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We find that the sensitivity of MUonE
does not extend beyond the parameter regions that are already excluded by other
constraints. MUonE will therefore provide a detailed measurement of the
hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution which then transparently informs
$a_\mu$ interpretations in 2HDMs without modifications of correlations from
beyond the Standard Model interactions. In passing we extend earlier results of
LHC and flavour projections to lepton-specific 2HDM (Types X and Y) scenarios,
and comment on the possibility of modifying the value of the W-boson mass; we
briefly discuss the implications for a strong first-order electroweak phase
transition for these models.

for sensor-fused tracking. Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust

environments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative
applications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity
leveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the
multiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions)
and scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously. In this work, we take an
important step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer
diversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We
demonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, -
passive/relative (e.g., visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g.,
infrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity
that brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the
methodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of
algorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches. RoVaR
is an embodiment of such a dual-layer diversity approach that intelligently
attends to cross-modal information using algorithmic and data-driven techniques
that jointly share the burden of accurately tracking multiple agents in the
wild. Extensive evaluations reveal RoVaR's multi-dimensional benefits in terms
of tracking accuracy (median of 15cm), robustness (in unseen environments),
light weight (runs in real-time on mobile platforms such as Jetson Nano/TX2),

be studied for the common domain of natural images, but little such research
has been attempted for radiological images. We address this here. First, we
compare the intrinsic manifold dimensionality of radiological and natural
images. We also investigate the relationship between intrinsic dimensionality
and generalization ability over a wide range of datasets. Our analysis shows
that natural image datasets generally have a higher number of intrinsic
dimensions than radiological images. However, the relationship between
generalization ability and intrinsic dimensionality is much stronger for
medical images, which could be explained as radiological images having
intrinsic features that are more difficult to learn. These results give a more
principled underpinning for the intuition that radiological images can be more
challenging to apply deep learning to than natural image datasets common to
machine learning research. We believe rather than directly applying models
developed for natural images to the radiological imaging domain, more care
should be taken to developing architectures and algorithms that are more
tailored to the specific characteristics of this domain. The research shown in
our paper, demonstrating these characteristics and the differences from natural
images, is an important first step in this direction.

or proxy discrimination is an issue of major concern. Namely, there exists the
possibility that protected policyholder characteristics are implicitly inferred

undesirable (or illegal) impact on prices. A technical solution to this problem
relies on building a best-estimate model using all policyholder characteristics
(including protected ones) and then averaging out the protected characteristics
for calculating individual prices. However, such approaches require full
knowledge of policyholders' protected characteristics, which may in itself be
problematic. Here, we address this issue by using a multi-task neural network
architecture for claim predictions, which can be trained using only partial
information on protected characteristics, and it produces prices that are free

mobility and therefore the power-electronics figure of merit. As a result, Al
compositions greater than 75% are required to obtain even a two-fold increase
of the Baliga figure of merit compared to GaN. However, beyond approximately
80% Al composition, donors in AlGaN undergo the DX transition which makes
impurity doping increasingly more difficult. Moreover, the contact resistance
increases exponentially with increasing Al content, and integration with
dielectrics becomes difficult due to the upward shift of the conduction band.
Atomically thin superlattices of AlN and GaN, also known as digital alloys, are
known to grow experimentally under appropriate growth conditions. These
chemically ordered nanostructures could offer significantly enhanced figure of
merit compared to their random-alloy counterparts due to the absence of alloy
scattering, as well as better integration with contact metals and dielectrics.
In this work, we investigate the electronic structure and phonon-limited
electron mobility of atomically thin AlN/GaN digital-alloy superlattices using
first-principles calculations based on density-functional and many-body
perturbation theory. The band gap of the atomically thin superlattices reaches
4.8 eV, and the in-plane (out-of-plane) mobility is 369 (452) cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$
s$^{-1}$. Using the modified Baliga figure of merit that accounts for the
dopant ionization energy, we demonstrate that atomically thin AlN/GaN
superlattices with a monolayer sublattice periodicity have the highest modified
Baliga figure of merit among several technologically relevant ultra-wide
band-gap materials, including random AlGaN, $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$, cBN, and
diamond.

computed and then least-squares fitted to extract a spatial attenuation rate as
a function of wave frequency. A general increase with frequency is found,
consistent with typical predictions from linear theory. However, a
non-monotonic behavior around a certain frequency is also observed, especially
in cases with a highly fragmented ice cover. Comparison to field data shows
that this result closely resembles the roll-over phenomenon as reported from

a certain range, are common in research. Most approaches to handle DLs in the
response variable implicitly make parametric assumptions on the distribution of
data outside DLs. We propose a new approach to deal with DLs based on a widely
used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM). The CPM
is a type of semiparametric linear transformation model. CPMs are rank-based
and can handle mixed distributions of continuous and discrete outcome
variables. These features are key for analyzing data with DLs because while
observations inside DLs are typically continuous, those outside DLs are
censored and generally put into discrete categories. With a single lower DL,
the CPM assigns values below the DL as having the lowest rank. When there are
multiple DLs, the CPM likelihood can be modified to appropriately distribute
probability mass. We demonstrate the use of CPMs with simulations and two HIV
data examples. The first example models a biomarker in which 15% of
observations are below a DL. The second uses multi-cohort data to model viral
load, where approximately 55% of observations are outside DLs which vary across
sites and over time.

avoid this by taking a fundamentally different approach, inspired by work on
single-pass streaming algorithms. Moreover, for constant $\epsilon$, our query
complexity significantly improves on the best known adaptive algorithm due to
Bhattacharya et al. (STACS '22), which requires $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log^{11} n)$

  Cross-frequency Coupling","24 pages, 10 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the brain, cross-frequency coupling has been hypothesized to result from
the activity of specialized microcircuits. For example, theta-gamma coupling is
assumed to be generated by specialized cell pairs (PING and ING mechanisms), or
special cells (e.g., fast bursting neurons). However, this implies that the
generating mechanisms is uniquely specific to the brain. In fact, cross-scale
coupling is a phenomenon encountered in the physics of all large, multi-scale
systems: phase and amplitude correlations between components of different
scales arise as a result of nonlinear interaction. Because the brain is a
multi-scale system too, a similar mechanism must be active in the brain. Here,
we represent brain activity as a superposition of nonlinearly interacting
patterns of spatio-temporal activity (collective activity), supported by
populations of neurons. Cross-frequency coupling is a direct consequence of the
nonlinear interactions, and does not require specialized cells or cell pairs.
It is therefore universal, and must be active in neural fields of any
composition. To emphasize this, we demonstrate the phenomenon in excitatory
fields. While there is no doubt that specialized cells play a role in
theta-gamma coupling, our results suggest that the coupling mechanism is at the
same time simpler and richer: simpler because it involves the universal
principle of nonlinearity; richer, because nonlinearity of collective activity
is likely modulated by specialized-cell populations in ways to be yet
understood.

descriptions of Einstein's gravity with a scalar field, in a conformally

explore dual universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the
mapping between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe
describes the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by
dark energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is
considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show
that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe
governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of
dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual
to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, that is, a bounce or a
collapse. The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field
determines whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the
Jordan frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an
appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to an alternative
description of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of a
bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universe in the Jordan frame. We further
study the stability of such conformal maps against linear perturbations. An
effective bouncing description of the current accelerating universe has
interesting implications, for example, one may study the late-time cosmological

estimates, especially for high-mass stars in the early stages of evolution. The
most direct method for obtaining model-independent masses is derivation from
the orbit of close binaries. Aims: To derive the first astrometric+RV orbit
solution for the single-lined spectroscopic binary MWC 166 A, based on CHARA
and VLTI near-infrared interferometry over multiple epochs and ~100 archival
radial velocity measurements, and to derive fundamental stellar parameters from
this orbit. We also sought to model circumstellar activity in the system from
K-band spectral lines. Methods: We geometrically modelled the dust continuum to
derive astrometry at 13 epochs and constrain individual stellar parameters. We
used the continuum models as a base to examine differential phases,
visibilities and closure phases over the Br-$\gamma$ and He-I emission lines.
Results: Our orbit solution suggests a period of $367.7\pm0.1$ d, twice as long
as found with previous RV orbit fits, subsequently constraining the component
masses to $M_1=12.2\pm2.2 M_\odot$ and $M_2=4.9\pm0.5 M_\odot$. The
line-emitting gas was found to be localised around the primary and is spatially
resolved on scales of ~11 stellar radii, with the spatial displacement between
the line wings consistent with a rotating disc. Conclusions: The large radius
and stable orientation of the line emission are inconsistent with
magnetospheric or boundary-layer accretion, but indicate an ionised inner gas
disk around MWC 166 Aa. We observe line variability that could be explained
either with generic line variability in a Herbig star disc or V/R variations in
a decretion disc. We also constrained the age of the system to
~$(7\pm2)\times10^5$ yr, consistent with the system being comprised of a
main-sequence primary and a secondary still contracting towards the main
sequence.

substantial fraction of this energy is transported to the lower atmosphere,
which results in chromospheric heating. The mechanisms that transport energy to

aim to estimate the temporal evolution of the radiative losses in the
chromosphere at the footpoints of a C-class flare, in order to set
observational constraints on the electron beam parameters of a RADYN flare
simulation. We estimated the radiative losses from hydrogen, and singly ionized
Ca and Mg using semi-empirical model atmospheres. To estimate the integrated
radiative losses in the chromosphere the net cooling rates were integrated
between the temperature minimum and the height where the temperature reaches 10
kK. The stratification of the net cooling rate suggests that the Ca IR triplet
lines are responsible for most of the radiative losses in the flaring
atmosphere. During the flare peak time, the contribution from Ca II H & K and
Mg II h & k lines are strong and comparable to the Ca IR triplet ($\sim$32 kW
m$^{-2}$). Since our flare is a relatively weak event the chromosphere is not
heated above 11 kK, which in turn yields a subdued Ly{\alpha} contribution
($\sim$7 kW m$^{-2}$). The temporal evolution of total integrated radiative
losses exhibits sharply-rising losses (0.4 kW m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and a
relatively slow decay (0.23 kW~m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). The maximum value of total
radiative losses is reached around the flare peak time, and can go up to 175 kW
m$^{-2}$ for a single pixel located at footpoint. After a small parameter
study, we find the best model-data consistency in terms of the amplitude of
radiative losses and the overall atmospheric structure with a RADYN flare
simulation in the injected energy flux of $5\times10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$

reconsider the factorization of $2\to 2$ scattering amplitudes in the Regge
limit. Expanding the amplitude in gauge invariant operators labelled by the
number of Glauber exchanges, allows us to further factorize the standard impact
factors into separate collinear and soft functions. The soft functions are
universal, and describe radiative corrections to the Reggeized gluon states
exchanged by the collinear projectiles. Remarkably, we find that the one-loop
soft function for the single Reggeized gluon state is given to
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in terms of the two-loop cusp and two-loop rapidity
anomalous dimensions. We argue that this iterative structure follows from the
simple action of crossing symmetry in the forward scattering limit, which in
the EFT allows us to replace the divergent part of a soft loop by a much
simpler Glauber loop. We use this correspondence to provide a simple
calculation of the two-loop Regge trajectory using the EFT. We then explore its
implications at higher perturbative orders, and derive the maximally matter
dependent contributions to the Regge trajectory to all loop orders, i.e.~the
terms $\sim \alpha_s^{k+1}n_f^k$ for any $k$, where $n_f$ is the number of
massless flavors. These simplifications suggests that the EFT approach to the

Standard Model vector meson (such as a hadronic $\rho$) resonance can be
produced via $\nu\bar{\nu}$ annihilation. This leads to a distinct absorption
feature in the cosmogenic neutrino flux at an energy solely determined by the
meson mass and the neutrino mass, apart from redshift. By numerical
coincidence, the position of the $\rho$-resonance overlaps with the originally
predicted peak of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) neutrino flux, which offers
an enhanced absorption effect at higher redshifts. We show that this absorption
feature in the GZK neutrino flux may be observable in future radio-based
neutrino observatories, such as IceCube-Gen2 radio, provided there exists a
large overdensity in the C$\nu$B distribution. This therefore provides a new
probe of C$\nu$B clustering at large redshifts, complementary to the laboratory

representations of high-dimensional data. This success would be impossible if
there was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this
existence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data
lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue
that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure
typically present in image data. Assuming that data lies on a single manifold
implies intrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does
not allow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of
variation. To address this deficiency, we consider the union of manifolds
hypothesis, which states that data lies on a disjoint union of manifolds of
varying intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on
commonly-used image datasets, finding that indeed, observed data lies on a
disconnected set and that intrinsic dimension is not constant. We also provide
insights into the implications of the union of manifolds hypothesis in deep

is still uncertain but will soon be more tightly constrained with the James

generation of stars, the so-called Population~III (Pop~III). By combining
results from detailed cosmological simulations of the assembly of the first

the stellar envelope to temperatures exceeding $\sim 50$ keV, allowing for a
vigorous production of electron and positron pairs. Pairs significantly
increase the electron scattering optical depth and regulate the temperature
through photon generation, producing distinct observational signatures in the
escaping emission. Assuming Wien equilibrium, we find analytic expressions for
the temperature and pair density profiles in the envelope immediately after
shock passage, and compute the emission during the expansion phase. Our
analysis shows that in pair loaded regions, photons are produced at a roughly
uniform rest frame energy of $\sim 200$ keV, and reinforces previous estimates
that the shock breakout signal will be detected as a short burst of energetic
$\gamma$-ray photons, followed by a longer phase of X-ray emission. We test our
model on a sample of low-luminosity gamma ray bursts using a closure relation
between the $\gamma$-ray burst duration, the radiation temperature and the
$\gamma$-ray isotropic equivalent energy, and find that some of the events are
consistent with the relativistic shock breakout model. Finally, we apply our

dependence on H$\alpha$ luminosity is largely eliminated. We model the
clustering of these galaxies within the Halo Occupation Distribution framework

variation with energy density are calculated in a far-from-equilibrium state of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory undergoing a Bjorken expansion. The calculation is
carried out holographically where we consider a collection of trajectories of
the energy density in the space of solutions by small changes to the initial
conditions of the bulk spacetime. We argue that the proper interpretation of
the variation of the diagonal energy momentum tensor components with respect to
the energy density is that of a far-from-equilibrium speed of sound. We
demonstrate remarkable agreement with a corresponding hydrodynamic prediction.
We find by Borel resummation that the holographic system has one attractor for
this speed of sound longitudinal, and another transverse to the direction of
Bjorken expansion. Attractor times for various initial flow conditions show
that reaching an attractor does not imply or require local thermal equilibrium.
In the cases studied, reaching an attractor implies hydrodynamization
(quantities evolve approximately according to hydrodynamics), justifying the
name \emph{hydrodynamic attractor }

medium (IGM) was measured to be very short, presenting a challenge to existing
reionization models. At face value, the measurement can be interpreted as
evidence that the IGM clumps on scales $M\lesssim 10^8$ M$_\odot$, a key but
largely untested prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. Motivated
by this possibility, we study the role that the underlying dark matter
cosmology plays in setting the $z > 5$ mean free path. We use two classes of
models to contrast against the standard CDM prediction: (1) thermal relic warm
dark matter (WDM), representing models with suppressed small-scale power; (2)
an ultralight axion exhibiting a white noise-like power enhancement.
Differences in the mean free path between the WDM and CDM models are subdued by
pressure smoothing and the possible contribution of neutral islands to the IGM
opacity. For example, comparing late reionization scenarios with a fixed
volume-weighted mean neutral fraction of $20\%$ at $z=6$, the mean free path is
$19~(45)~\%$ longer in a WDM model with $m_x = 3~(1)$ keV. The enhanced power
in the axion-like model produces better agreement with the short mean free path
measured at $z = 6$. However, drawing robust conclusions about cosmology is
hampered by large uncertainties in the reionization process, extragalactic
ionizing background, and thermal history of the Universe. This work highlights
some key open questions about the IGM opacity during reionization.

(ii) a ""critical"" phase with a logarithmic violation of area-law-scaling of the
entanglement entropy along with long range tripartite entanglement. A Majorana
parton description of these dynamics, which provides an out-of-equilibrium
generalization of the parton description of the Kitaev honeycomb model, permits
an analytic understanding of the universal properties of these two phases,
including the entanglement properties of the steady-state, the dynamics of the
system on the approach to equilibrium, and the phase transition between these
states. In the topologically-ordered phase, two logical qubits can be encoded
in an initial state and protected for a time which scales exponentially in the
linear dimension of the system, while no robust encoding of quantum information
persists in the critical phase. Extensive numerical simulations of these
monitored dynamics confirm our analytic predictions.

telescopes. For this study, the Bifrost simulation is configured to represent
the solar atmosphere in a coronal hole region, from which the fast solar wind
emerges. The simulation extends from the upper-convection zone (2.5 Mm below
the photosphere) to the low-corona (14.5 Mm above the photosphere), with a
horizontal extent of 24 Mm x 24 Mm. The twisting of the coronal magnetic field
by photospheric flows, efficiently injects energy into the low-corona. Poynting
fluxes of up to $2-4$ kWm$^{-2}$ are commonly observed inside twisted magnetic
structures with diameters in the low-corona of 1 - 5 Mm. Torsional Alfv\'en
waves are favourably transmitted along these structures, and will subsequently
escape into the solar wind. However, reflections of these waves from the upper
boundary condition make it difficult to unambiguously quantify the emerging
Alfv\'en wave-energy flux. This study represents a first step in quantifying
the conditions at the base of the solar wind using Bifrost simulations. It is
shown that the coronal magnetic field is readily braided and twisted by
photospheric flows. Temperature and density contrasts form between regions with
active stirring motions and those without. Stronger whirlpool-like flows in the
convection, concurrent with magnetic concentrations, launch torsional Alfv\'en
waves up through the magnetic funnel network, which are expected to enhance the
turbulent generation of magnetic switchbacks in the solar wind.

theoretical predictions for both channels require NLO accuracy. The relative
importance of the off-diagonal modes depends strongly on the considered

values of the Yukawa couplings off-diagonal contributions initiated by valence
quarks can be up to an order of magnitude higher than the diagonal production.
However, we also find that in phenomenologically viable scenarios addressing
the flavour anomalies off-diagonal production is generally negligible, with a
few exceptions of 10\%--30\% of the total rate depending on the treatment of
the charm density in the proton.

population undergoing neutral genetic drift. We introduce an abstract
formulation of the coalescent that applies to a broad class of neutral drift
models, allowing for arbitrary spatial structure and mating patterns. In this
formulation, the coalescent is a random sequence of mappings $\mathcal{C} =
\left(C_t\right)_{t=0}^\infty$ from a finite set $G$ to itself, representing
the ancestry of alleles at a single genetic locus. Here, $G$ represents the
``sites'' (in individuals, at particular spatial locations) at which these
alleles can live. The state $C_t:G \to G$ maps each site $g \in G$ to the site
containing $g$'s ancestor, $t$ time steps into the past. $\mathcal{C}$ is
obtained by iterated composition of ``parentage mappings"", drawn independently
from a fixed probability distribution. Mutation is incorporated by augmenting
the state to include a set of mutated sites. Using this formalism, we define
and analyze biologically relevant quantities, including coalescence time,
coalescence branch length, reproductive value, number of mutations prior to
coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and
identity-by-state. The limit of low mutation is analyzed in detail. We
illustrate this coalescent with applications to well-mixed and graph-structured
populations, as well as to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio.

important role in particle physics, especially in discoveries of and searches
for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM); beyond the evidence of dark matter
(DM), for example, the neutrinos produced from the dark matter annihilation is
important for the indirect DM searches. Moreover, a wide range of new,
well-motivated physics models and dark-sector scenarios have been proposed in
the last decade, predicting cosmogenic signals complementary to those in the
conventional direct detection of particle-like dark matter. Most notably,
various mechanisms to produce (semi-)relativistic DM particles in the present
universe (e.g. boosted dark matter) have been put forward, while being
consistent with current observational and experimental constraints on DM. The
resulting signals often have less intense and more energetic fluxes, to which
underground, kiloton-scale neutrino detectors can be readily sensitive. In
addition, the scattering of slow-moving DM can give rise to a sizable energy
deposit if the underlying dark-sector model allows for a large mass difference
between the initial and final state particles, and the neutrino experiments
with large volume detectors are well suited for exploring these opportunities.
  This White Paper is devoted to discussing the scientific importance of the
cosmogenic dark matter and exotic particle searches, not only overviewing the
recent efforts in both the theory and the experiment communities but also
providing future perspectives and directions on this research branch. A

flexibility required to make these measurements. However, model and prior
choices significantly affect derived SFHs, particularly for post-starburst
galaxies (PSBs) which have sharp changes in their recent SFH. In this paper, we
create mock PSBs, then use the Prospector SED fitting software to test how well
four different SFH models recover key properties. We find that a two-component
parametric model performs well for our simple mock galaxies, but is sensitive
to model mismatches. The fixed- and flexible-bin non-parametric models included
in Prospector are able to rapidly quench a major burst of star formation, but
systematically underestimate the post-burst age by up to 200 Myr. We develop a
custom SFH model that allows for additional flexibility in the recent SFH. Our
flexible non-parametric model is able to constrain post-burst ages with no
significant offset and just ~90 Myr of scatter. Our results suggest that while
standard non-parametric models are able to recover first-order quantities of
the SFH (mass, SFR, average age), accurately recovering higher-order quantities
(burst fraction, quenching time) requires careful consideration of model
flexibility. These mock recovery tests are a critical part of future SFH
studies. Finally, we show that our new, public SFH model is able to accurately
recover the properties of mock star-forming and quiescent galaxies and is
suitable for broader use in the SED fitting community.

estimate the viability, and optimize observation strategies, of enantiomeric

predict that the circular polarization fractions of emission lines of
enantiopure propylene-oxide relevant to astronomical detection of
propylene-oxide are on the order of 10^(-6). Due to the low predicted circular
polarization fractions, we conclude that enantiomeric characterization of
propylene-oxide in the gas phase of the ISM is impossible with current
astronomical observation techniques. We suggest that only chiral radical
species may be viably employed for enantiomeric excess detection. We estimate
that laboratory experiments may be successful in detecting the enantiomeric

  Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional inverse optimization inputs a solution and finds the parameters
of an optimization model that render a given solution optimal. The literature
mostly focuses on inferring the objective function in linear problems when
acceptable solutions are provided as input. In this paper, we propose an
inverse optimization model that inputs several accepted and rejected solutions
and recovers the underlying convex optimization model that correctly classifies
these given solutions. The novelty of our model is three-fold: First, while
most literature focuses on inferring the objective function only, we focus on
inferring the feasible region. Second, our model is capable of inferring the
constraints of general convex optimization models. Third, the proposed model
learns from both accepted (good) and rejected (bad) observations in inferring
the constraint set. The resulting model is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem,
and to mitigate its complexity, we use the theoretical properties of its
solutions to derive a reduced reformulation that is easier to solve. Using a
case study on radiotherapy treatment planning for breast cancer patients, we
demonstrate that our proposed model can infer a set of clinical guidelines to
classify accepted and rejected plans with over 95% accuracy.

waveguide microring resonators, perturbed with azimuthal gratings and thereby
emitting beams carrying optical orbital angular momentum, can generate radiated
fields of high circular polarization purity. We achieve this in a passive
device by taking advantage of symmetries of the structure and radiated modes,
and directly utilizing both transverse and longitudinal field components of the
guided modes. On the axis of emission and at maximum intensity, we measure an
average polarization impurity of $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ in relative intensity
across the resonance FWHM, and observe impurities below $10^{-4}$ in this
range. This constitutes a significant improvement over the ${\sim}10^{-2}$
impurity demonstrated in previous work on integrated devices. Photonic
structures allowing high circular polarization purity may assist in realizing
high-fidelity control and measurement in atomic quantum systems.

a UAV, which acts both as a communication BS and a mono-static radar, flies
over a given area to transmit downlink signal to a ground communication user.
In the meantime, the same transmitted signal is also exploited for mono-static

for both communication and sensing (C$\&$S) is explicitly considered. In
particular, we first formulate the trajectory design problem into a weighted

achieved. As a step forward, a multi-stage trajectory design approach is
proposed to improve the target estimation accuracy. While the resultant
optimization problem is difficult to solve directly, we develop an iterative
algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution. Finally, numerical results show
that the target estimation error obtained by the trade-off approach is about an
order of magnitude better than a communication-only approach with a slight

(UCT), pertains to the universality of diagrams, which are viewed as functors
mapping both objects and relationships from an indexing category of abstract
causal diagrams to an actual causal model whose nodes are labeled by random
variables, and edges represent functional or probabilistic relationships. UCT
states that any causal inference can be represented in a canonical way as the
co-limit of an abstract causal diagram of representable objects. UCT follows
from a basic result in the theory of sheaves. The second result, the Causal
Reproducing Property (CRP), states that any causal influence of a object X on
another object Y is representable as a natural transformation between two
abstract causal diagrams. CRP follows from the Yoneda Lemma, one of the deepest
results in category theory. The CRP property is analogous to the reproducing
property in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces that served as the foundation for
kernel methods in machine learning.

from cataclysmic binaries, the ejecta from the white dwarf form shocks when
interacting with the dense circumstellar wind environment of the red giant

highest-energy photons detected in some sub-intervals, are consistent with
$\pi^{\rm 0}$-decay emission from shocks in the ejecta as proposed by
Tatischeff & Hernanz (2007) for its previous 2006 outburst. The LAT light-curve
displayed a fast rise to its peak >0.1 GeV flux of $\simeq$6x10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1 beginning on day 0.745 after its optically-constrained eruption epoch of
2021 August 8.50. The peak lasted for ~1 day, and exhibited a power-law decline
up to the final LAT detection on day 45. We analyze the data on shorter
timescales at early times and found evidence of an approximate doubling of
emission over ~200 minutes at day 2.2, possibly indicating a localized
shock-acceleration event. Comparing the data collected by the AAVSO, we
measured a constant ratio of ~2.8x10^-3 between the gamma-ray and optical
luminosities except for a ~5x smaller ratio within the first day of the
eruption likely indicating attenuation of gamma rays by ejecta material and
lower high-energy proton fluxes at the earliest stages of the shock
development. The hard X-ray emission due to bremsstrahlung from shock-heated
gas traced by the Swift-XRT 2-10 keV light-curve peaked at day ~6, later than
at GeV and optical energies. Using X-ray derived temperatures to constrain the

disaster relief (HADR) where often it is critical to find signs of life in the
presence of conflicting criteria, objectives, and information. We believe
ergodic search can provide a framework for exploiting available information as
well as exploring for new information for applications such as HADR, especially
when time is of the essence. Ergodic search algorithms plan trajectories such
that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in
that region, and is able to naturally balance exploitation (myopically
searching high-information areas) and exploration (visiting all locations in
the search space for new information). Existing ergodic search algorithms, as
well as other information-based approaches, typically consider search using
only a single information map. However, in many scenarios, the use of multiple
information maps that encode different types of relevant information is common.
Ergodic search methods currently do not possess the ability for simultaneous
nor do they have a way to balance which information gets priority. This leads
us to formulate a Multi-Objective Ergodic Search (MOES) problem, which aims at
finding the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions, for the purpose of providing
human decision makers various solutions that trade off between conflicting
criteria. To efficiently solve MOES, we develop a framework called Sequential
Local Ergodic Search (SLES) that converts a MOES problem into a ""weight space
coverage"" problem. It leverages the recent advances in ergodic search methods
as well as the idea of local optimization to efficiently approximate the
Pareto-optimal front. Our numerical results show that SLES runs distinctly

feasibility and optimality. For example, the predictions at the 85\% level
reduce the CPLEX solution time by a factor of 9 on average for over 240,000
test instances with an optimality gap of less than 0.05\% and 0.4\%
infeasibility in the test set. Also, models trained using shorter planning
horizons can successfully predict the optimal solution of the instances with
longer planning horizons. For the hardest data set, the LSTM predictions at the
25\% level reduce the solution time of 70 CPU hours to less than 2 CPU minutes
with an optimality gap of 0.8\% and without any infeasibility. The LSTM-Opt
framework outperforms classical ML algorithms, such as the logistic regression
and random forest, in terms of the solution quality, and exact approaches, such
as the ($\ell$, S) and dynamic programming-based inequalities, with respect to
the solution time improvement. Our machine learning approach could be
beneficial in tackling sequential decision-making problems similar to CLSP,
which need to be solved repetitively, frequently, and in a fast manner.

three-body interaction. This method straightforwardly extends to other quantum
hardware architectures, requires only a ""firmware"" upgrade to implement, and is
faster than its constituent two-qubit gates. The three-qubit gate represents an
entire family of operations, creating flexibility in quantum-circuit

coherence limit of our device. We then generate two classes of entangled
states, the GHZ and W states, by applying the new gate only once; in
comparison, decompositions into the standard gate set would have a two-qubit
gate depth of two and three, respectively. Finally, we combine characterization
methods and analyze the experimental and statistical errors on the fidelity of
the gates and of the target states.

transparency in the composition of datasets exposes AI models to the
possibility of unintentional and avoidable mistakes. In particular, public and
private image datasets of dermatological conditions rarely include information
on skin color. As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have
appropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of
patient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic
audits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and
dermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST
annotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse
set of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology
atlases. We find the inter-rater reliability between three board-certified
dermatologists is comparable to the inter-rater reliability between the
board-certified dermatologists and two crowdsourcing methods. In contrast, we
find that the Individual Typology Angle converted to FST (ITA-FST) method
produces annotations that are significantly less correlated with the experts'
annotations than the experts' annotations are correlated with each other. These
results demonstrate that algorithms based on ITA-FST are not reliable for
annotating large-scale image datasets, but human-centered, crowd-based
protocols can reliably add skin type transparency to dermatology datasets.
Furthermore, we introduce the concept of dynamic consensus protocols with
tunable parameters including expert review that increase the visibility of
crowdwork and provide guidance for future crowdsourced annotations of large
image datasets.

contrast to label-free tissue sections, digitally matching the histological
staining, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive to tissue.
Standard virtual staining requires high autofocusing precision during the whole
slide imaging of label-free tissue, which consumes a significant portion of the
total imaging time and can lead to tissue photodamage. Here, we introduce a
fast virtual staining framework that can stain defocused autofluorescence
images of unlabeled tissue, achieving equivalent performance to virtual
staining of in-focus label-free images, also saving significant imaging time by
lowering the microscope's autofocusing precision. This framework incorporates a
virtual-autofocusing neural network to digitally refocus the defocused images
and then transforms the refocused images into virtually stained images using a
successive network. These cascaded networks form a collaborative inference
scheme: the virtual staining model regularizes the virtual-autofocusing network
through a style loss during the training. To demonstrate the efficacy of this
framework, we trained and blindly tested these networks using human lung
tissue. Using 4x fewer focus points with 2x lower focusing precision, we
successfully transformed the coarsely-focused autofluorescence images into
high-quality virtually stained H&E images, matching the standard virtual
staining framework that used finely-focused autofluorescence input images.
Without sacrificing the staining quality, this framework decreases the total
image acquisition time needed for virtual staining of a label-free whole-slide
image (WSI) by ~32%, together with a ~89% decrease in the autofocusing time,

wealth maximization per se but with utility maximization. It is therefore
possible to introduce an increasing and concave utility function $\phi(x,t)$

factor of two of the best possible quantum performance for the pure-loss (no
background radiation) channel whose roundtrip radar-to-target-to-radar
transmissivity $\kappa$ satisfies $\kappa \ll 1$. We introduce first-photon
radars (FPRs) to circumvent and beat Nair's performance limit. FPRs transmit a
periodic sequence of pulses, each containing $N_S$ photons on average, and
perform ideal direct detection (photon counting at unit quantum efficiency and
no dark counts) on the returned radiation from each transmission until at least
one photon has been detected or a pre-set maximum of $M$ pulses has been
transmitted. They decide a target is present if and only if they detect one or
more photons. We consider both quantum (each transmitted pulse is a number
state) and classical (each transmitted pulse is a coherent state) FPRs, and we
show that their error-probability exponents are nearly identical when $\kappa
\ll 1$. With the additional assumption that $\kappa N_S \ll 1$, we find that
their advantage in error-probability exponent over Nair's performance limit
grows to 3 dB as $M \rightarrow \infty$. However, because FPRs'
pulse-repetition period must exceed the radar-to-target-to-radar propagation
delay, their use in standoff sensing of moving targets will likely employ
$\kappa N_S \sim 1$ and $M \sim 10$ and achieve ~2 dB advantage. Our work

localization robustness highly relies on viewpoints and 3D feature extraction.
Our previous work provides a viewpoint-invariant descriptor to deal with
viewpoint differences; however, the global descriptor suffers from a low
signal-noise ratio in unsupervised clustering, reducing the distinguishable
feature extraction ability. We develop SphereVLAD++, an attention-enhanced
viewpoint invariant place recognition method in this work. SphereVLAD++
projects the point cloud on the spherical perspective for each unique area and
captures the contextual connections between local features and their
dependencies with global 3D geometry distribution. In return, clustered
elements within the global descriptor are conditioned on local and global
geometries and support the original viewpoint-invariant property of SphereVLAD.
In the experiments, we evaluated the localization performance of SphereVLAD++
on both public KITTI360 datasets and self-generated datasets from the city of
Pittsburgh. The experiment results show that SphereVLAD++ outperforms all
relative state-of-the-art 3D place recognition methods under small or even
totally reversed viewpoint differences and shows 0.69% and 15.81% successful

and high time efficiency also help its application for low-cost robots.

multiple robotic hands. Different grasps across multiple robotic hands are
encoded into a shared latent space. Each latent vector is learned to decode to
the 3D shape of an object and the 3D shape of a robotic hand in a grasping pose
in terms of the signed distance functions of the two 3D shapes. In addition,
the distance metric in the latent space is learned to preserve the similarity
between grasps across different robotic hands, where the similarity of grasps
is defined according to contact regions of the robotic hands. This property
enables our method to transfer grasps between different grippers including a
human hand, and grasp transfer has the potential to share grasping skills
between robots and enable robots to learn grasping skills from humans.
Furthermore, the encoded signed distance functions of objects and grasps in our
implicit representation can be used for 6D object pose estimation with grasping
contact optimization from partial point clouds, which enables robotic grasping
in the real world.

corpora of overhead imagery. Advanced computer vision object detection
techniques have demonstrated great success in identifying objects of interest

relying on computer vision opens up significant vulnerabilities, namely, the
susceptibility of object detection algorithms to adversarial attacks. In this
paper we explore the efficacy and drawbacks of adversarial camouflage in an
overhead imagery context. While a number of recent papers have demonstrated the
ability to reliably fool deep learning classifiers and object detectors with
adversarial patches, most of this work has been performed on relatively uniform
datasets and only a single class of objects. In this work we utilize the
VisDrone dataset, which has a large range of perspectives and object sizes. We
explore four different object classes: bus, car, truck, van. We build a library
of 24 adversarial patches to disguise these objects, and introduce a patch
translucency variable to our patches. The translucency (or alpha value) of the
patches is highly correlated to their efficacy. Further, we show that while
adversarial patches may fool object detectors, the presence of such patches is
often easily uncovered, with patches on average 24% more detectable than the
objects the patches were meant to hide. This raises the question of whether
such patches truly constitute camouflage. Source code is available at

molecules at the conditions of saline aquifers is critical for modelling

brine with different cations ($\mathrm{Na}^+$, $\mathrm{K}^+$,
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) containing up to 5 $\mathrm{mol/kg_{H_2O}}$ concentration
is numerically investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A wide
range of pressure (1-218 atm) and temperature (298-648 K) conditions is applied
to cover the realistic operational conditions of the aquifers. We find that the
temperature, pressure and properties of ions (compositions and concentrations)
affect the hydrogen diffusion coefficient. An Arrhenius behavior of the effect
of temperature on the diffusion coefficient has been observed with the
temperature independent parameters fitted using the ion concentration under
constant pressure. However, it is noted that the pressure strongly affects the
diffusive behavior of hydrogen at the high temperature ($\geq$ 400 K) regime,
indicating the inaccuracy of the Arrhenius model. Hence, we combine the
obtained MD results with four models of machine learning (ML), including linear
regression (LR), random forest (RF), extra tree (ET) and gradient boosting (GB)
to provide effective predictions on the hydrogen diffusion. The resultant
combination of GB model with MD data predicts the diffusion of hydrogen more
effectively as compared to the Arrhenius model and other ML models. Moreover, a
$post hoc$ analysis (feature importance rank) has been performed to extract the
correlation between physical descriptors and simulation results from ML models.

weights and activations into 1-bit. However, there is still a huge performance
gap between Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and their full-precision (FP)
counterparts. As the quantization error caused by weights binarization has been
reduced in earlier works, the activations binarization becomes the major
obstacle for further improvement of the accuracy. BNN characterises a unique
and interesting structure, where the binary and latent FP activations exist in
the same forward pass (i.e., $\text{Binarize}(\mathbf{a}_F) = \mathbf{a}_B$).
To mitigate the information degradation caused by the binarization operation
from FP to binary activations, we establish a novel contrastive learning
framework while training BNNs through the lens of Mutual Information (MI)
maximization. MI is introduced as the metric to measure the information shared
between binary and FP activations, which assists binarization with contrastive
learning. Specifically, the representation ability of the BNNs is greatly
strengthened via pulling the positive pairs with binary and FP activations from
the same input samples, as well as pushing negative pairs from different
samples (the number of negative pairs can be exponentially large). This
benefits the downstream tasks, not only classification but also segmentation
and depth estimation, etc. The experimental results show that our method can be
implemented as a pile-up module on existing state-of-the-art binarization

undergo evaluations that may be critical for downstream tasks, such as vision
for autonomous cars. Herein, we propose a framework for evaluating visual
representations for illumination invariance in the context of depth perception.
We develop a new predictive coding-based architecture and a hybrid
fully-supervised/self-supervised learning method. We propose a novel
architecture that extends the predictive coding approach: PRedictive Lateral
bottom-Up and top-Down Encoder-decoder Network (PreludeNet), which explicitly
learns to infer and predict depth from video frames. In PreludeNet, the
encoder's stack of predictive coding layers is trained in a self-supervised
manner, while the predictive decoder is trained in a supervised manner to infer
or predict the depth. We evaluate the robustness of our model on a new
synthetic dataset, in which lighting conditions (such as overall illumination,
and effect of shadows) can be be parametrically adjusted while keeping all
other aspects of the world constant. PreludeNet achieves both competitive depth
inference performance and next frame prediction accuracy. We also show how this
new network architecture, coupled with the hybrid
fully-supervised/self-supervised learning method, achieves balance between the

this paper, we take advantage of this abstraction to extend LNNs to support
equality and function symbols via first-order theories. This extension improves
the power of LNNs by significantly increasing the types of problems they can
tackle. As a proof of concept, we add support for the first-order theory of
equality to IBM's LNN library and demonstrate how the introduction of this
allows the LNN library to now reason about expressions without needing to make
the unique-names assumption.

some situations, a robot navigation solution relies only on inertial sensors
and as a consequence, the navigation solution drifts in time. In this paper, we
propose the MoRPI framework, a mobile robot pure inertial approach. Instead of
travelling in a straight line trajectory, the robot moves in a periodic motion
trajectory to enable peak-to-peak estimation. In this manner, instead of
performing three integrations to calculate the robot position in a classical
inertial solution, an empirical formula is used to estimate the travelled
distance. Two types of MoRPI approaches are suggested, where one is based on
both accelerometer and gyroscope readings while the other is only on
gyroscopes. Closed form analytical solutions are derived to show that MoRPI
produces lower position error compared to the classical pure inertial solution.
In addition, to evaluate the proposed approach, field experiments were made
with a mobile robot equipped with two types of inertial sensors. In total, 143
trajectories with a time duration of 75 minutes were collected and evaluated.
The results show the benefits of using our approach. To facilitate further

data-driven change point detection methods. Currently, change point detection
methods for multivariate high-dimensional data are scarce, with even less
available in high-level, easily accessible software packages. To this end, we
introduce the R package fabisearch, available on the Comprehensive R Archive

methodology. FaBiSearch is a novel statistical method for detecting change
points in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series
which employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised
dimension reduction and clustering technique. Given the high computational cost
of NMF, we implement the method in C++ code and use parallelization to reduce
computation time. Further, we also utilize a new binary search algorithm to
efficiently identify multiple change points and provide a new method for
network estimation for data between change points. We show the functionality of
the package and the practicality of the method by applying it to a neuroimaging

brain-specific network visualization capability in a flexible, stand-alone

In this work, we explored microservice-specific architecture reconstruction

it to alternative data visualization using 3D space. As a representative of the

metal-insulator transition as the film thickness becomes smaller than a few
unit cell (u.c.), the formation of oxygen vacancies and their effects on the
correlated electronic structure have been rarely studied. Here, we investigate
the effects of the surface termination and the oxygen vacancy position on the
electronic properties and vacancy energetics of LaNiO$_3$ ultra-thin films
using density functional theory plus U (DFT+U). We find that oxygen vacancies
can be easily formed in the Ni layers with the NiO$_2$ terminated surface (0.5
u.c. and 1.5 u.c. thickness) compared to the structures with the LaO terminated
surface and the in-plane vacancy is energetically favored than the out-of-plane
vacancy. When two vacancy sites are allowed, the Ni square plane geometry is
energetically more stable in most cases as two oxygen vacancies tend to stay
near a Ni ion. The in-plane vacancy of the NiO$_2$ terminated structure is
favored since the released charge due to the oxygen vacancy can be easily
accommodated in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which is less occupied than the
$d_{z^2}$ orbital. Remarkably, the oxygen vacancy structure containing the Ni
square-plane geometry becomes an insulating state in DFT+U with a sizable band
gap of 1.2eV because the large crystal field splitting between $d_{z^2}$ and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in the square-plane favors an insulating state and the
Mott insulating state is induced in other Ni sites due to strong electronic
correlations.

  Identification",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging device
authentication technique, which exploits the hardware characteristics of the RF
front-end as device identifiers. RFFI is implemented in the wireless receiver
and acts to extract the transmitter impairments and then perform
classification. The receiver hardware impairments will actually interfere with
the feature extraction process, but its effect and mitigation have not been
comprehensively studied. In this paper, we propose a receiver-agnostic RFFI
system that is not sensitive to the changes in receiver characteristics; it is
implemented by employing adversarial training to learn the receiver-independent
features. Moreover, when there are multiple receivers, this functionality can
perform collaborative inference to enhance classification accuracy. Finally, we
show how it is possible to leverage fine-tuning for further improvement with
fewer collected signals. To validate the approach, we have conducted extensive
experimental evaluation by applying the approach to a LoRaWAN case study
involving ten LoRa devices and 20 software-defined radio (SDR) receivers. The
results show that receiver-agnostic training enables the trained neural network
to become robust to changes in receiver characteristics. The collaborative
inference improves classification accuracy by up to 20% beyond a
single-receiver RFFI system and fine-tuning can bring a 40% improvement for
under-performing receivers.

needed to achieve ambitious emissions targets. Biofuels based on biomass,
electrofuels based on renewable hydrogen and a carbon source, as well as fossil
fuels compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are the main options.
Currently, biofuels are the only renewable fuels available at scale and are
stimulated by blending mandates. Here, we estimate the system cost of enforcing
such mandates in addition to an overall emissions cap for all energy sectors.
We model overnight scenarios for 2040 and 2060 with the sector-coupled European
energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, with a high temporal resolution. The
following cost drivers are identified: (i) high biomass costs due to scarcity,
(ii) opportunity costs for competing usages of biomass for industry heat and
combined heat and power (CHP) with carbon capture, and (iii) lower scalability
and generally higher cost for biofuels compared to electrofuels and fossil
fuels combined with CDR. With a -80% emissions reduction target in 2040,
variable renewables, partial electrification of heat, industry and transport
and biomass use for CHP and industrial heat are important for achieving the
target at minimal cost. Abatement of remaining liquid fossil fuel use increases
system cost, with a 50% biofuel mandate increasing costs by 128-229 billion
EUR, or 39-82% of the liquid fuel cost. With a negative -105% emissions target
in 2060, fuel abatement options are necessary, and electrofuels or the use of
CDR to offset fossil fuel emissions are more competitive than biofuels. Biomass
is preferred in CHP and industry heat, combined with carbon capture to serve
negative emissions or electrofuel production, thereby utilising biogenic carbon
several times. Sensitivity analyses reveal significant uncertainties but
consistently support that higher biofuel mandates lead to higher costs.

However, many neural networks, e.g., multilayer perceptron (MLP) and
convolutional neural network (CNN), require fixed-size input data. In addition,
many IoT devices work in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios but the RFFI
performance in such scenarios is rarely investigated. In this paper, we analyze
the reason why MLP- and CNN-based RFFI systems are constrained by the input
size. To overcome this, we propose four neural networks that can process
signals of variable lengths, namely flatten-free CNN, long short-term memory
(LSTM) network, gated recurrent unit (GRU) network and transformer. We adopt
data augmentation during training which can significantly improve the model's
robustness to noise. We compare two augmentation schemes, namely offline and
online augmentation. The results show the online one performs better. During
the inference, a multi-packet inference approach is further leveraged to
improve the classification accuracy in low SNR scenarios. We take LoRa as a
case study and evaluate the system by classifying 10 commercial-off-the-shelf
LoRa devices in various SNR conditions. The online augmentation can boost the
low-SNR classification accuracy by up to 50% and the multi-packet inference

how these new buildings are constructed matters since today's decisions will
last for decades. The resulting morphology of cities has lasting implications
for a city's energy needs. Estimating and projecting these needs has always
been challenging in Africa due to the lack of data. Yet, given the sweeping
urbanisation expected in Africa over the next three decades, this obstacle must
be overcome to guide cities towards a trajectory of sustainability and
resilience. Based on the location and surface of nearly 200 million buildings
on the continent, we estimate the inter-building distance of almost six
thousand cities. Buildings' footprint data enables the construction of urban
form indicators to compare African cities' elongation, sprawl and emptiness. We
establish the BASE model, where the mean distance between buildings is a
functional relation to the number of Buildings and their average Area, as well
as the Sprawl and the Elongation of its spatial arrangement. The mean distance
between structures in cities -- our proxy for its energy demands related to
mobility -- grows faster than the square root of its population, resulting from
the combined impact of a sublinear growth in the number of buildings and a
sublinear increase in building size and sprawl. We show that when a city
doubles its population, it triples the energy demand related to commutes.

amplified by the SGL. The objective is to capture this light and use it for

resolution measured in tens of kilometers and to identify signs of
habitability. The data are acquired pixel-by-pixel while moving an imaging

matrix from a sparsely located demodulation reference signal (DMRS) for spatial

systems. A supervised learning based algorithm is proposed to compute the
covariance matrix with goals of minimizing both the block-error rate (BLER) and
the whitening complexity. A single neural network is trained to select an IW
option for covariance computation in various interference scenarios consisting
of different interference occupancy, signal-to-interference ratio,
signal-to-noise ratio, modulation order, coding rate, etc. In
interference-dominant scenarios, the proposed algorithm computes the covariance
matrix using DMRS in one resource block (RB) due to the frequency selectivity
of the interference channel. On the other hand, in noise-dominant scenarios,
the covariance matrix is computed from DMRS in entire signal bandwidth.
Further, the proposed algorithm approximates the covariance matrix into a
diagonal matrix when the spatial correlation of interference-plus-noise is low.
This approximation reduces the complexity of whitening from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$
to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ where $N$ is the number of receiver antennas. Results show

topological phase is electron tunneling between the CuO$_2$ planes, whose
explicit form (in an ideal clean sample) is dictated by the symmetry of the
atomic orbitals. However, a large body of work on the interlayer transport in
cuprates indicates importance of disorder-mediated incoherent tunneling which
evades the symmetry constraints present in an idealized crystal. The latter
arises even in the cleanest single-crystal samples through oxygen vacancies in
layers separating the CuO$_2$ planes, introduced to achieve the hole doping
necessary for superconductivity. Here we assess the influence of incoherent
tunneling on the phase diagram of a twisted bilayer. We show that the model
continues to support a fully gapped topological phase with broken
$\mathcal{T}$, even in the limit of disorder-mediated interlayer coupling.
Compared to the model with a constant, momentum conserving interlayer coupling,
the extent of the topological phase around the 45$^\circ$ twist decreases with

a fundamental task in numerous computer vision applications. Here, we propose a
novel axiomatic method to match similar regions across shapes. Matching similar
regions is formulated as the alignment of the spectra of operators closely
related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO). The main novelty of the
proposed approach is the consideration of differential operators defined on a
manifold with multiple metrics. The choice of a metric relates to fundamental
shape properties while considering the same manifold under different metrics
can thus be viewed as analyzing the underlying manifold from different
perspectives. Specifically, we examine the scale-invariant metric and the
corresponding scale-invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator (SI-LBO) along with the
regular metric and the regular LBO. We demonstrate that the scale-invariant
metric emphasizes the locations of important semantic features in articulated
shapes. A truncated spectrum of the SI-LBO consequently better captures locally
curved regions and complements the global information encapsulated in the
truncated spectrum of the regular LBO. We show that matching these dual spectra
outperforms competing axiomatic frameworks when tested on standard benchmarks.

Specifically, we show that, when trained on one data set and tested on another,

  stars with NASA's TESS mission","Author's PhD thesis (Universidade do Porto, December 2021)",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven largely by multiple ground-based radial-velocity (RV) surveys and
photometric space missions such as Kepler and K2, the discovery of new
exoplanets has increased rapidly since the early 2000s. However, due to a
target selection bias in favor of main-sequence stars, only a handful of
transiting planets have been found orbiting evolved hosts. These planets, most
of which are giants, hold important information regarding the formation and
evolution of planetary systems. In this thesis, I sought to increase the sample
of known giant planets orbiting red-giant stars, focusing on data from NASA's
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, and to improve their
characterization. Specifically, I focused on close-in giant planets orbiting
(preferably) oscillating low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars. To
improve characterization, I developed a method to model planetary transits and
stellar signals simultaneously, implementing Gaussian processes to model
stellar granulation and the oscillations envelope in the time domain. My
results show that the model enables time-domain asteroseismology, inferring the
frequency of maximum oscillation amplitude, $\nu_\text{max}$, to within 1\%.
The method's implementation is open-source and available to the community.
Regarding the planet search, I assembled a pipeline, mostly comprised of
third-party open-source software and explored a sample of $\sim$40,000 bright
LLRGB stars in the southern hemisphere of TESS's field of view. The search
identified four planet candidates, two of which are not currently known planets
and orbit red-giant stars. Radial-velocity follow-up observations of both these
candidates have tentatively confirmed their planetary nature. Finally, I also
confirmed the planetary nature of an additional candidate, not part of the
above sample, through RV observations.

  Intelligence or Herd Behavior?","Accepted at CSCW 23",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social media platforms disseminate extensive volumes of online content,
including true and, in particular, false rumors. Previous literature has
studied the diffusion of offline rumors, yet more research is needed to
understand the diffusion of online rumors. In this paper, we examine the role
of lifetime and crowd effects in social media sharing behavior for true vs.
false rumors. Based on 126,301 Twitter cascades, we find that the sharing
behavior is characterized by lifetime and crowd effects that explain
differences in the spread of true as opposed to false rumors. All else equal,
we find that a longer lifetime is associated with less sharing activities, yet
the reduction in sharing is larger for false than for true rumors. Hence,
lifetime is an important determinant explaining why false rumors die out.
Furthermore, we find that the spread of false rumors is characterized by
herding tendencies (rather than collective intelligence), whereby the spread of
false rumors becomes proliferated at a larger retweet depth. These findings
explain differences in the diffusion dynamics of true and false rumors and
further offer practical implications for social media platforms.

methods to deliver effective adaptive assistance. While much work has been done
to provide adaptive assistance when students seek help, they may not seek help
optimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive
assistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of
struggle or unproductivity. Determining when and whether to provide
personalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance dilemma.
Addressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains,
where there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored
methods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these
methods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a
novel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting
their need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals
with the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a
controlled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on
predictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage. We show
empirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a
significant amount of time in training, and lead to improved posttest results,
when compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that
incorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint
policy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training
unproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help
appropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be
needed). We conclude with suggestions on the domains that can benefit from this
approach as well as the requirements for adoption.

assemblies of nanoparticles or nanopores with a spacing comparable to the

correlated, the photonic balls can show structural color with low
angle-dependence. Their colors, combined with the ability to add them to a
liquid formulation, make photonic balls a promising new type of pigment
particle for paints, coatings, and other applications. However, it is
challenging to predict the color of materials made from photonic balls, because
the sphere geometry and multiple scattering must be accounted for. To address
these challenges, we develop a multiscale modeling approach involving Monte
Carlo simulations of multiple scattering at two different scales: we simulate
multiple scattering and absorption within a photonic ball and then use the
results to simulate multiple scattering and absorption in a film of photonic
balls. After validating against experimental spectra, we use the model to show
that films of photonic balls scatter light in fundamentally different ways than
do homogeneous films of nanopores or nanoparticles, because of their increased
surface area and refraction at the interfaces of the balls. Both effects tend
to sharply reduce color saturation relative to a homogeneous nanostructured
film. We show that saturated colors can be achieved by placing an absorber
directly in the photonic balls and mitigating surface roughness. With these
design rules, we show that photonic-ball films have an advantage over
homogeneous nanostructured films: their colors are even less dependent on the

It is challenging because the ground-truth model ranking for each task can only

is brute-force and computationally expensive. Recent advanced methods proposed
several lightweight transferability metrics to predict the fine-tuning results.
However, these approaches only capture static representations but neglect the
fine-tuning dynamics. To this end, this paper proposes a new transferability
metric, called \textbf{S}elf-challenging \textbf{F}isher \textbf{D}iscriminant
\textbf{A}nalysis (\textbf{SFDA}), which has many appealing benefits that
existing works do not have. First, SFDA can embed the static features into a
Fisher space and refine them for better separability between classes. Second,
SFDA uses a self-challenging mechanism to encourage different pre-trained
models to differentiate on hard examples. Third, SFDA can easily select
multiple pre-trained models for the model ensemble. Extensive experiments on
$33$ pre-trained models of $11$ downstream tasks show that SFDA is efficient,
effective, and robust when measuring the transferability of pre-trained models.
For instance, compared with the state-of-the-art method NLEEP, SFDA
demonstrates an average of $59.1$\% gain while bringing $22.5$x speedup in

measurements of the proton's charge radius require inputs from the Compton
amplitude subtraction function. Model-dependent and non-relativistic
calculations of this subtraction function vary significantly, and hence it
contributes sizeable uncertainties to the aforementioned physical quantities.
We report on the use of Feynman-Hellmann methods in lattice QCD to calculate
the subtraction function from first principles. In particular, our initial
results show anomalous high-energy behaviour that is at odds with the
prediction from the operator product expansion (OPE). Therefore, we investigate
the possibility that this unexpected behaviour is due to lattice artifacts, by
varying the lattice spacing and volume, and comparing different discretisations
of the vector current. Finally, we explore a Feynman-Hellmann implementation
that is less sensitive to short-distance contributions and show that the
subtraction function's anomalous behaviour can be attributed to these
short-distance contributions. As such, this work represents the first steps in
achieving a complete understanding of the Compton amplitude subtraction
function.

dimensions. In this work, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles
electronic structure calculations, we predict that the Si/Bi van der Waals
heterostructure is a two-dimensional unconventional quadratic double Weyl
semimetal with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Although unprotected by the
C3v double group symmetry of the heterostructure, the two-dimensional quadratic
double Weyl semimetal is stable for compressive strains up to 6.64%. The system
transforms into a trivial semimetal with further increasing strain, where the
phase boundary is a two-dimensional triple degenerate semimetal state.
Furthermore, the Kane-Mele tight-binding model calculations show that the
quadratic double Weyl phase is derived from the competition between the Rashba
SOC and the proximity-effect-enhanced intrinsic SOC. On the other hand, by
breaking mirror symmetry, the quadratic double Weyl semimetal transforms into a
quantum spin Hall insulator as well as a quantum valley Hall insulator phase.
Thus, the Si/Bi heterostructure is an excellent platform for studying the
exotic physics of two-dimensional double Weyl semimetal and other novel
topological phases.

classical methods follow two-steps approaches, i.e., first defocus map
estimation and then the non-blind deblurring. In the era of deep learning, some
researchers have tried to address these two problems by CNN. However, the
simple concatenation of defocus map, which represents the blur level, leads to
suboptimal performance. Considering the spatial variant property of the defocus
blur and the blur level indicated in the defocus map, we employ the defocus map
as conditional guidance to adjust the features from the input blurring images
instead of simple concatenation. Then we propose a simple but effective network
with spatial modulation based on the defocus map. To achieve this, we design a
network consisting of three sub-networks, including the defocus map estimation
network, a condition network that encodes the defocus map into condition
features, and the defocus deblurring network that performs spatially dynamic
modulation based on the condition features. Moreover, the spatially dynamic
modulation is based on an affine transform function to adjust the features from
the input blurry images. Experimental results show that our method can achieve
better quantitative and qualitative evaluation performance than the existing

an oracle for the winner problem). Beyond that, we give efficient reductions

Stefan theory, the Fisher--Stefan model alleviates two limitations of the
Fisher--KPP equation for biological populations. In this work, we investigate
whether the 2D Fisher--Stefan model predicts pattern formation, by analysing
the linear stability of planar travelling wave solutions to sinusoidal
transverse perturbations. Planar fronts of the Fisher--KPP equation are
linearly stable. Similarly, we demonstrate that invading planar fronts ($c >

($c < 0$) of the Fisher--Stefan model are linearly unstable for all wave
numbers. This is analogous to unstable solutions for planar solidification in
the classical Stefan problem. Introducing a surface tension regularisation
stabilises receding fronts for short-wavelength perturbations, giving rise to a
range of unstable modes and a most unstable wave number. We supplement linear
stability analysis with level-set numerical solutions that corroborate
theoretical results. Overall, front instability in the Fisher--Stefan model

prediction strategy to form a robust elastic warp. Particularly, we first
regress the mesh deformation that can be transformed into robust initial
optical flows. Then we estimate residual optical flows to facilitate our
network the flexibility of pixel-wise deformation, further correcting the
details of the tilted images. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train

given by a one-zone model. We assume two types of dust model: dust composed
only of silicate (silicate dust) and dust with a surface covered by
$\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ ice ($\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ ice dust). When only considering
collisional coagulation, the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects are not
effective in the high-density region for both the silicate and
$\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ ice dust cases. This is because dust coagulation reduces the
abundance of small dust particles, resulting in less efficient adsorption of
charged particles on the dust surface. For the silicate dust case, when
collisional fragmentation is included, the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
effects do apply at a high density of $n_{\mathrm{H}}>10^{12} \
\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ because of the abundant production of small dust particles.
On the other hand, for the $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ ice dust case, the production of
small dust particles due to fragmentation is not efficient. Therefore, for the

only in the range $n_{\mathrm{H}}\gtrsim 10^{14} \ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, even when

Moreover, it formulates multiple goals that may be conflicting yet important to

trained based on product quality and purchase likelihood to increase revenue.
In this research, we leverage the Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) aspect of

Specifically, we propose a general framework where the information from labels

strongest advantage over classical computing methods for systems exhibiting
strong electron correlation, it is critical that the performance of VQEs be
assessed for strongly correlated systems. For classical simulation, strong
correlation often results in symmetry-breaking of the Hartree-Fock reference,
leading to L\""owdin's well-known ``symmetry dilemma'' whereby accuracy in the
energy can be increased by breaking spin or spatial symmetries. Here, we
explore the impact of symmetry breaking on the performance of ADAPT-VQE using
two strongly correlated systems: (i) the ``fermionized"" anisotropic Heisenberg
model, where the anisotropy parameter controls the correlation in the system,
and (ii) symmetrically-stretched linear \ce{H4}, where correlation increases
with increasing H-H separation. In both of these cases, increasing the level of
correlation of the system leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking (parity and
$\hat{S}^{2}$, respectively) of the mean-field solutions. We analyze the role
that symmetry breaking in the reference states and orbital mappings of the
fermionic Hamiltonians have on the compactness and performance of ADAPT-VQE. We
observe that improving the energy of the reference states by breaking symmetry
has a deleterious effect on ADAPT-VQE by increasing the length of the ansatz
necessary for energy convergence and exacerbating the problem of ``gradient

pairs based on normal augmentations brings limited returns in terms of
performance, because the contribution of contrastive pairs from the normal data
augmentation to the loss get smaller as training progresses. Therefore, we
delve into hard contrastive pairs for contrastive learning. Motivated by the
success of mixing augmentation strategy which improves the performance of many
tasks by synthesizing novel samples, we propose SkeleMixCLR: a contrastive
learning framework with a spatio-temporal skeleton mixing augmentation
(SkeleMix) to complement current contrastive learning approaches by providing
hard contrastive samples. First, SkeleMix utilizes the topological information
of skeleton data to mix two skeleton sequences by randomly combing the cropped
skeleton fragments (the trimmed view) with the remaining skeleton sequences
(the truncated view). Second, a spatio-temporal mask pooling is applied to
separate these two views at the feature level. Third, we extend contrastive
pairs with these two views. SkeleMixCLR leverages the trimmed and truncated
views to provide abundant hard contrastive pairs since they involve some
context information from each other due to the graph convolution operations,
which allows the model to learn better motion representations for action
recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD

in which multi-scale features are encoded progressively with stepwise feature
fusion and refinement. In this way, a coarse-level signal is reconstructed if
only a portion of the bitstream is received, and progressively improves the

a separate neural network to update the density distribution, we leverage the
fact that the compliance minimization problem is self-adjoint to express the
element sensitivity directly in terms of the displacement field from the DEM

The method of moving asymptotes is used as the optimizer for updating density
distribution. The implementation of Neumann, Dirichlet, and periodic boundary

electrocardiogram signals. The likely users of FL such as medical institutions
and IT companies can take these benchmarks as guides for adopting FL and
minimize their trial and error. For each dataset, each client data is from a
different source to preserve real-world heterogeneity. We evaluate six FL
algorithms designed for addressing data heterogeneity among clients, and a
hybrid algorithm combining the strengths of two representative FL algorithms.
Based on experiment results from three modalities, we discover that simple FL
algorithms tend to outperform more sophisticated ones, while the hybrid
algorithm consistently shows good, if not the best performance. We also find
that a frequent global model update leads to better performance under a fixed
training iteration budget. As the number of participating clients increases,
higher cost is incurred due to increased IT administrators and GPUs, but the
performance consistently increases. We expect future users will refer to these
empirical benchmarks to design the FL experiments in the medical domain
considering their clinical tasks and obtain stronger performance with lower
costs.

divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian
agents. The players have additive private values for the goods. The prior
distributions on those values are independent and common knowledge.
  We characterize the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose
game and show how to efficiently compute equilibria. We identify several
striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus
unknown preferences. Most notably, the divider has a compelling
""diversification"" incentive in creating the chooser's two options. This
incentive, hereto unnoticed, leads to multiple goods being divided at
equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider's optimal strategy when preferences
are known.
  In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in
judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of
the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players'
uncertainties about each other's values, the number of goods being divided, and
whether the divider can offer multiple alternative divisions. We prove that,
when values are independently and identically distributed across players and
goods, the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, while
the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.

with canonical segmentation methods, ImPulSe outputs continuous predictions of
arbitrary resolutions with higher training efficiency and fewer parameters.

  In order to overcome the non-differentiability or singularity observed in

in real world contexts is difficult as prior information pertaining to the
connectivity structure or local dynamics is often unknown and must be inferred
from time series observations of network states. Additionally, the influence of
coupling interactions between nodes further complicates the isolation of local
node dynamics. Given the architectural similarities between dynamical networks
and recurrent neural networks (RNN), we propose a network inference method
based on the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm commonly used to
train recurrent neural networks. This method aims to simultaneously infer both
the connectivity structure and local node dynamics purely from observation of
node states. An approximation of local node dynamics is first constructed using
a neural network. This is alternated with an adapted BPTT algorithm to regress
corresponding network weights by minimising prediction errors of the dynamical
network based on the previously constructed local models until convergence is
achieved. This method was found to be succesful in identifying the connectivity
structure for coupled networks of Lorenz, Chua and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators.
Freerun prediction performance with the resulting local models and weights was
found to be comparable to the true system with noisy initial conditions. The
method is also extended to non-conventional network couplings such as

Then, we aim to characterise path-independence of additive functionals for

Volterra equations are not semimartingales nor Markov processes, thus the
existing techniques for obtaining path-independence of usual, semimartingale

this difficult, we link the concerned stochastic Volterra equations to mild
formulation of certain parabolic type stochastic partial differential
equations, and further applying our previous results on path-independence for
stochastic evolution equations to get the desired result. Finally, we consider

methods align the global features extracted from the whole video clips across
the source and target domains but suffer from the spatial redundancy of feature
matching in video recognition. Motivated by the observation that in most cases
a small image region in each video frame can be informative enough for the
action recognition task, we propose to exploit informative image regions to
perform efficient domain alignment. Specifically, we first use lightweight CNNs
to extract the global information of the input two-stream video frames and
select the informative image patches by a differentiable interpolation-based
selection strategy. Then the global information from videos frames and local
information from image patches are processed by an existing video adaptation
method, i.e., TA3N, in order to perform feature alignment for the source domain
and the target domain. Our method (without model ensemble) ranks 4th among this
year's teams on the test set of EPIC-KITCHENS-100.

stage, the planar regions embedded within a sequence of depth images are
extracted individually first and then merged to establish a terrain map
containing only planar regions in a selected frame. To simplify the
representations of the planar regions that are applicable to foothold planning
for legged robots, we further approximate the extracted planar regions via
low-dimensional polytopes at the second stage. With the polytopic
representation, the proposed approach achieves a great balance between accuracy
and simplicity. Experimental validations with RGB-D cameras are conducted to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme
successfully characterizes the planar regions via polytopes with acceptable

less than 10ms (i.e., > 100Hz) throughout the tests, which strongly illustrates
the advantages of our approach developed in this paper.

information retrieval (IR) experimentation, and presented the argument that
(only) uniform-step interval scales should be used, and hence that well-known
metrics such as reciprocal rank, expected reciprocal rank, normalized
discounted cumulative gain, and average precision, should be either discarded
as measurement tools, or adapted so that their metric values lie at
uniformly-spaced points on the number line. These papers paint a rather bleak
picture of past decades of IR evaluation, at odds with the community's overall
emphasis on practical experimentation and measurable improvement.
  Our purpose in this work is to challenge that position. In particular, we
argue that mappings from categorical and ordinal data to sets of points on the
number line are valid provided there is an external reason for each target
point to have been selected. We first consider the general role of measurement
scales, and of categorical, ordinal, interval, ratio, and absolute data
collections. In connection with the first two of those categories we also
provide examples of the knowledge that is captured and represented by numeric
mappings to the real number line. Focusing then on information retrieval, we
argue that document rankings are categorical data, and that the role of an
effectiveness metric is to provide a single value that represents the
usefulness to a user or population of users of any given ranking, with
usefulness able to be represented as a continuous variable on a ratio scale.
That is, we argue that current IR metrics are well-founded, and, moreover, that
those metrics are more meaningful in their current form than in the proposed

the parameters and the unobserved hidden variables in generative statistical

classical techniques, such as deterministic annealing (DA), are used. We study
a variational Bayes (VB) inference algorithm based on a non-traditional quantum
annealing approach -- referred to as quantum annealing variational Bayes (QAVB)
inference -- and show that there is indeed a quantum advantage to QAVB over its
classical counterparts. In particular, we show that such better performance is
rooted in key concepts from quantum mechanics: (i) the ground state of the
Hamiltonian of a quantum system -- defined from the given variational Bayes
(VB) problem -- corresponds to an optimal solution for the minimization problem
of the variational free energy at very low temperatures; (ii) such a ground
state can be achieved by a technique paralleling the quantum annealing process;
and (iii) starting from this ground state, the optimal solution to the VB
problem can be achieved by increasing the heat bath temperature to unity, and
thereby avoiding local minima introduced by spontaneous symmetry breaking
observed in classical physics based VB algorithms. We also show that the update
equations of QAVB can be potentially implemented using $\lceil \log K \rceil$
qubits and $\mathcal{O} (K)$ operations per step. Thus, QAVB can match the time
complexity of existing VB algorithms, while delivering higher performance.

an instrument like the SKA will be able to probe a suppression of power in warm

the implications of these findings on interacting dark matter scenarios,

the so-called mean force Gibbs (MFG) state. The MFG state is obtained by
integrating out the bath degrees of freedom for the Gibbs state of the total

certain prediction of a black-box system. A large number of interpreting
methods focus on identifying explanatory input features, which generally fall
into two main categories: attribution and selection. A popular
attribution-based approach is to exploit local neighborhoods for learning
instance-specific explainers in an additive manner. The process is thus
inefficient and susceptible to poorly-conditioned samples. Meanwhile, many
selection-based methods directly optimize local feature distributions in an
instance-wise training framework, thereby being capable of leveraging global
information from other inputs. However, they can only interpret single-class
predictions and many suffer from inconsistency across different settings, due
to a strict reliance on a pre-defined number of features selected. This work
exploits the strengths of both methods and proposes a framework for learning
local explanations simultaneously for multiple target classes. Our model
explainer significantly outperforms additive and instance-wise counterparts on
faithfulness with more compact and comprehensible explanations. We also
demonstrate the capacity to select stable and important features through
extensive experiments on various data sets and black-box model architectures.

class of anisotropic non-homogeneous flows without global terms. By the
stationary solutions of anisotropic flows if they exist, we obtain a class of
results for the dual Orlicz Christoffel-Minkowski type problem with $c=1$,
which is equivalent to solve the PDE $G(x,u_K,\bar\nabla u_K)F(D^2u_K+u_KI)=c$
on $\mathbb S^n$ for a convex body $K$. Here $D$ and $\bar\nabla$ are the
covariant derivative with respect to the standard metric on $\mathbb S^n$ and
Euclidean space respectively, $I$ is the unit matrix of order $n$, and
$\bar\nabla u_K(x):=Du_K(x)+u_K(x)x$ is the point on $\partial K$ whose outer
unit normal vector is $x\in\mathbb S^n$. In the dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem
and Orlicz Christoffel-Minkowski problem, the constant $c$ can't be set to $1$
in general. The highlight of our arguments is that we use anisotropic flows
without global terms to set $c=1$. This result covers many previous known
solutions to $L^p$ dual Minkowski problem, $L^p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem,
etc.. In particular, we give a convergence result of anisotropic flows with
general curvature function and arbitrarily initial strictly convex hypersurface
if $G(x,u_K,\bar\nabla u_K)=\psi(x)u^{\alpha-1}\vert\bar\nabla
u\vert^\delta=\psi(x)u^{\alpha-1}\rho^\delta$, where $\rho$ is the radial
function. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other convergence result
about anisotropic flows with general curvature function and arbitrarily initial
strictly convex hypersurface. Finally we give two uniqueness results in some
particular cases.

systems, which aims to estimate learners' current knowledge mastery status and
predict their future learning performance. The significant challenge with
traditional learning diagnosis methods is the inability to balance diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability. Although the existing psychometric-based
learning diagnosis methods provide some domain interpretation through cognitive
parameters, they have insufficient modeling capability with a shallow structure
for large-scale learning data. While the deep learning-based learning diagnosis
methods have improved the accuracy of learning performance prediction, their
inherent black-box properties lead to a lack of interpretability, making their
results untrustworthy for educational applications. To settle the above
problem, the proposed unified interpretable intelligent learning diagnosis
framework, which benefits from the powerful representation learning ability of
deep learning and the interpretability of psychometrics, achieves a better
performance of learning prediction and provides interpretability from three
aspects: cognitive parameters, learner-resource response network, and weights
of self-attention mechanism. Within the proposed framework, this paper presents
a two-channel learning diagnosis mechanism LDM-ID as well as a three-channel
learning diagnosis mechanism LDM-HMI. Experiments on two real-world datasets

learners' performances compared with the state-of-the-art models, and can
provide valuable educational interpretability for applications such as precise

Unfortunately, deep RL algorithms might not be suitable for being deployed
directly into a real-world robot platform due to the difficulty in interpreting
the learned policy and lack of stability guarantee, especially for a complex
task such as a wall-climbing drone. This paper proposes a novel hybrid
architecture that reinforces a nominal controller with a robust policy learned
using a model-free deep RL algorithm. The proposed architecture employs an
uncertainty-aware control mixer to preserve guaranteed stability of a nominal
controller while using the extended robust performance of the learned policy.
The policy is trained in a simulated environment with thousands of domain
randomizations to achieve robust performance over diverse uncertainties. The
performance of the proposed method was verified through real-world experiments
and then compared with a conventional controller and the state-of-the-art
learning-based controller trained with a vanilla deep RL algorithm.

remarkable progress in processing such two data modalities has been achieved

However, unlike multi-view image-based 2D visual modeling paradigms, which have
shown leading performance in several common 3D shape recognition benchmarks,
point cloud-based 3D geometric modeling paradigms are still highly limited by
insufficient learning capacity, due to the difficulty of extracting
discriminative features from irregular geometric signals. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of boosting deep 3D point cloud encoders by
transferring visual knowledge extracted from deep 2D image encoders under a
standard teacher-student distillation workflow. Generally, we propose PointMCD,
a unified multi-view cross-modal distillation architecture, including a
pretrained deep image encoder as the teacher and a deep point encoder as the
student. To perform heterogeneous feature alignment between 2D visual and 3D
geometric domains, we further investigate visibility-aware feature projection
(VAFP), by which point-wise embeddings are reasonably aggregated into
view-specific geometric descriptors. By pair-wisely aligning multi-view visual

without exhausting and complicated network modification. Experiments on 3D

challenging problem, as access to target domain data is not permitted during

extractor and classifier parameters based on the same features. This common
practice causes the model to overfit to existing feature styles in the source
domain, resulting in sub-optimal generalization ability on target domains. To
solve this problem, we propose a novel style interleaved learning (IL)
framework. Unlike conventional learning strategies, IL incorporates two forward
propagations and one backward propagation for each iteration. We employ the
features of interleaved styles to update the feature extractor and classifiers
using different forward propagations, which helps to prevent the model from
overfitting to certain domain styles. To generate interleaved feature styles,
we further propose a new feature stylization approach. It produces a wide range
of meaningful styles that are both different and independent from the original
styles in the source domain, which caters to the IL methodology. Extensive
experimental results show that our model not only consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmarks for DG ReID, but also has
clear advantages in computational efficiency. The code is available at

descriptions, and we thus use the few-shot image classification task to
investigate whether a machine learning model can have this capability. Our
proposed model, LIDE (Learning from Image and DEscription), has a text decoder
to generate the descriptions and a text encoder to obtain the text
representations of machine- or user-generated descriptions. We confirmed that
LIDE with machine-generated descriptions outperformed baseline models.
Moreover, the performance was improved further with high-quality user-generated
descriptions. The generated descriptions can be viewed as the explanations of
the model's predictions, and we observed that such explanations were consistent
with prediction results. We also investigated why the language description
improved the few-shot image classification performance by comparing the image

(OBBs). Labels for the Cartesian velocities or contiguous sequences, which are
expensive to obtain, are not required. The general idea is to pre-train an
object detection network without velocities using single-frame OBB labels, and
then exploit the network's OBB predictions on unlabelled data for velocity
training. In detail, the network's OBB predictions of the unlabelled frames are
updated to the timestamp of a labelled frame using the predicted velocities and
the distances between the updated OBBs of the unlabelled frame and the OBB
predictions of the labelled frame are used to generate a self-supervised
training signal for the velocities. The detection network architecture is
extended by a module to account for the temporal relation of multiple scans and
a module to represent the radars' radial velocity measurements explicitly. A
two-step approach of first training only OBB detection, followed by training
OBB detection and velocities is used. Further, a pre-training with
pseudo-labels generated from radar radial velocity measurements bootstraps the
self-supervised method of this paper. Experiments on the publicly available
nuScenes dataset show that the proposed method almost reaches the velocity
estimation performance of a fully supervised training, but does not require

produced by large wind farms. In this study, we perform Large-Eddy Simulations
(LES) of 50 infinitely large offshore wind farms with different turbine layouts
and wind directions. The LES results are combined with the two-scale momentum
theory (Nishino & Dunstan 2020, J. Fluid Mech. 894, A2) to investigate the
aerodynamic performance of large but finite-sized farms as well. The power of
infinitely large farms is found to be a strong function of the array density,
whereas the power of large finite-sized farms depends on both the array density
and turbine layout. An analytical model derived from the two-scale momentum
theory predicts the impact of array density very well for all 50 farms
investigated and can therefore be used as an upper limit to farm performance.
We also propose a new method to quantify turbine-scale losses (due to
turbine-wake interactions) and farm-scale losses (due to the reduction of
farm-average wind speed). They both depend on the strength of atmospheric
response to the farm, and our results suggest that, for large offshore wind
farms, the farm-scale losses are typically more than twice as large as the
turbine-scale losses. This is found to be due to a two-scale interaction
between turbine wake and farm induction effects, explaining why the impact of
turbine layout on farm power varies with the strength of atmospheric response.

query-document pairs. We then use a supervised contrastive learning objective
to learn an effective ranking model from the augmented dataset. Our experiments
on subsets of the TREC-DL dataset show that, although data augmentation leads
to an increasing the training data sizes, it does not necessarily improve the
performance using existing pointwise or pairwise training objectives. However,
our proposed supervised contrastive loss objective leads to performance
improvements over the standard non-augmented setting showcasing the utility of
data augmentation using contrastive losses. Finally, we show the real benefit
of using supervised contrastive learning objectives by showing marked
improvements in smaller ranking datasets relating to news (Robust04), finance

high-mobility communication scenarios such as vehicular communication renders
it challenging to obtain the instantaneous channel state information (CSI)

we propose a new roadside IRS-aided vehicular communication system to tackle
this challenge. Specifically, by exploiting the symmetrical deployment of IRSs
with inter-laced equal intervals on both sides of the road and the cooperation
among nearby IRS controllers, we propose a new two-stage channel estimation
scheme with off-line and online training, respectively, to obtain the
static/time-varying CSI required by the proposed low-complexity passive
beamforming scheme efficiently. The proposed IRS beamforming and online channel
estimation designs leverage the existing uplink pilots in wireless networks and
do not require any change of the existing transmission protocol. Moreover, they
can be implemented by each of IRS controllers independently, without the need
of any real-time feedback from the user's serving BS. Simulation results show
that the proposed designs can efficiently achieve the high IRS passive
beamforming gain and thus significantly enhance the achievable communication
throughput for high-speed vehicular communications.

$\sim2$Mm above the $\tau_{5000} = 1$ level, whereas rMHD models place it in a
wider range of heights. Observational verification is scarce. We review and
discuss recent results from various instruments and spectral domains. In SDO
and TRACE images spicules appear in emission in the 1600, 1700 and 304 A bands
and in absorption in the EUV bands; the latter is due to photo-ionization of H
and He I. At the shortest available AIA wavelength and taking into account that
the photospheric limb is $\sim0.34$Mm above the $\tau_{5000}=1$ level, we found
that CCTR emission starts at $\sim3.7$Mm; extrapolating to $\lambda=0$, where
there is no chromospheric absorption, we deduced a height of $3.0\pm 0.5$Mm,
above the value of 2.14Mm of the Avrett & Loeser model. Another indicator of
the extent of the chromosphere is the height of the network structures. Height
differences produce a limbward shift of features with respect to their
counterparts in magnetograms. Using this approach, we measured heights of
$0.14\pm0.04$Mm (at 1700 A), $0.31\pm0.09$Mm (at 1600 A) and $3.31\pm 0.18$Mm
(at 304 A) for the center of the solar disk. A previously reported possible
solar cycle variation is not confirmed. A third indicator is the position of
the limb in the UV, where IRIS observations of the Mg II triplet lines show
that they extend up to $\sim2.1$Mm above the 2832 A limb, while AIA/SDO images
give a limb height of $1.4 \pm 0.2$Mm (1600 A) and $5.7\pm 0.2$Mm (304 A).
Finally, ALMA mm-$\lambda$ full-disk images provide useful diagnostics, though
not very accurate; values of $2.4\pm0.7$Mm at 1.26mm and $4.2\pm2.5$Mm at 3mm
were obtained. Putting everything together, we conclude that the average
chromosphere extends higher than homogeneous models predict, but within the
range of rMHD models.

high-dimensional data. The problem is challenging on real-world datasets,
especially with under-sampling data, and we find that previous methods perform
poorly in this case. Generally, ML methods first transform input data into a
low-dimensional embedding space to maintain the data's geometric structure and
subsequently perform downstream tasks therein. The poor local connectivity of
under-sampling data in the former step and inappropriate optimization
objectives in the latter step leads to two problems: structural distortion and
underconstrained embedding. This paper proposes a novel ML framework named Deep
Local-flatness Manifold Embedding (DLME) to solve these problems. The proposed
DLME constructs semantic manifolds by data augmentation and overcomes the
structural distortion problem using a smoothness constrained based on a local
flatness assumption about the manifold. To overcome the underconstrained
embedding problem, we design a loss and theoretically demonstrate that it leads
to a more suitable embedding based on the local flatness. Experiments on three
types of datasets (toy, biological, and image) for various downstream tasks
(classification, clustering, and visualization) show that our proposed DLME
outperforms state-of-the-art ML and contrastive learning methods.

a prominent example of such a phase. It has proven ubiquitous in correlated

exceptionally strong over an extended temperature range above phase transitions
in \bnap, the nickel homologue to the Fe-based systems. This provides evidence
for a type of electronic nematicity, dynamical in nature, which exhibits an
unprecedented coupling to the underlying crystal lattice. Fluctuations between
degenerate nematic configurations cause a splitting of phonon lines, without
lifting degeneracies nor breaking symmetries, akin to spin liquids in magnetic
systems.

full understanding of different types of OOD data: there are benign OOD data
that can be properly adapted to enhance the learning performance, while other
malign OOD data would severely degenerate the classification result. To Harness
OOD data, this paper proposes a HOOD method that can leverage the content and
style from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data.
Particularly, we design a variational inference framework to causally
disentangle content and style features by constructing a structural causal
model. Subsequently, we augment the content and style through an intervention
process to produce malign and benign OOD data, respectively. The benign OOD
data contain novel styles but hold our interested contents, and they can be
leveraged to help train a style-invariant model. In contrast, the malign OOD
data inherit unknown contents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can
improve model robustness against deceiving anomalies. Thanks to the proposed
novel disentanglement and data augmentation techniques, HOOD can effectively
deal with OOD examples in unknown and open environments, whose effectiveness is
empirically validated in three typical OOD applications including OOD
detection, open-set semi-supervised learning, and open-set domain adaptation.

Consistent with prior works, the posterior distributions we find are bimodal,
with one mode consistent with $\Lambda$CDM and one where neutrinos strongly
self-interact. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP, we
find that a delayed onset of neutrino free streaming caused by significantly
strong neutrino self-interaction is compatible with these data at the
$2-3\sigma$ level. As seen in the past, the preference shifts to $\Lambda$CDM
with the inclusion of Planck data. We determine that the preference for strong
neutrino self-interaction is largely driven by angular scales corresponding to
$700 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 1000$ in the ACT E-mode polarization data. This
region is expected to be key to discriminate between neutrino self-interacting
modes and will soon be probed with more sensitive data.

supervised end-to-end Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training with error
backpropagation (backprop). Backprop algorithms require a large number of
labelled training samples to achieve high performance. However, in many
realistic applications, even if there is plenty of image samples, very few of
them are labelled, and semi-supervised sample-efficient training strategies
have to be used. Hebbian learning represents a possible approach towards sample
efficient training; however, in current solutions, it does not scale well to
large datasets. In this paper, we present FastHebb, an efficient and scalable
solution for Hebbian learning which achieves higher efficiency by 1) merging
together update computation and aggregation over a batch of inputs, and 2)
leveraging efficient matrix multiplication algorithms on GPU. We validate our
approach on different computer vision benchmarks, in a semi-supervised learning
scenario. FastHebb outperforms previous solutions by up to 50 times in terms of
training speed, and notably, for the first time, we are able to bring Hebbian

from AIMPOL along with the distances ($d$) and extinction ($A_{V}$) data to
study the variation of polarization fraction ($P$) as a function of $A_{V}$ and
$d$ towards the star-forming region, NGC 1893. We employ a broken power-law fit
and Bayesian analysis on extinction ($A_{V}$) versus polarization efficiency
($P$/$A_{V}$) and distance ($d$) versus rate of polarization ($P$/$d$). We find
that $P$/$A_{V}$ shows a break at an extinction of $\sim$0.9 mag, whereas $P/d$
exhibits a break at a distance of $\sim$1.5 kpc. Based on these, we categorize
the dust towards NGC 1893 into two populations: (i) foreground dust confined to
$A_{V}$ $<$ $\sim$1 mag and distance up to $\sim$2 kpc and (ii) Perseus spiral
arm dust towards NGC 1893 characterized with $A_{V}$ $>$ $\sim$1 mag and
distance beyond $\sim$2 kpc. Foreground dust exhibits higher polarization
efficiency but a lower polarization rate, whereas Perseus dust shows a lower
polarization efficiency but a slightly higher polarization rate. Hence, we
suggest that while polarization efficiency reveals the dust grain alignment,
the rate of polarization infers about the distribution of dust grains towards
NGC 1893. Further, we also shed a light on the spatial variation of intrinsic
polarization and magnetic field orientation, and other parameters within the
intra-cluster medium of NGC 1893.

evolutionary game theory. Under the indirect evolutionary approach, agents make
decisions by optimizing a subjective utility function. Evolution may select for
subjective preferences that differ from the fitness function, and in
particular, subjective preferences for increasing or reducing other agents'
fitness. However, indirect evolutionary models typically artificially restrict
the space of strategies that agents might use (assuming that agents always play
a Nash equilibrium under their subjective preferences), and dropping this
restriction can undermine the finding that other-regarding preferences are
selected for. Can the indirect evolutionary approach still be used to explain
the apparent existence of other-regarding preferences, like altruism, in
humans? We argue that it can, by accounting for the costs associated with the
complexity of strategies, giving (to our knowledge) the first account of the
relationship between strategy complexity and the evolution of preferences. Our
model formalizes the intuition that agents face tradeoffs between the cognitive
costs of strategies and how well they interpolate across contexts. For a single
game, these complexity costs lead to selection for a simple fixed-action
strategy, but across games, when there is a sufficiently large cost to a
strategy's number of context-specific parameters, a strategy of maximizing
subjective (other-regarding) utility is stable again. Overall, our analysis
provides a more nuanced picture of when other-regarding preferences will

diffusion-based distributed multi-task tracking algorithm is developed. This is
done by implementing an unsupervised adaptive clustering process, which aids
nodes in forming clusters and collaborating on tasks. For distributed target

only wind observations with good global coverage. They are important features
for feeding numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Several Bayesian models
have been proposed to estimate AMVs. Although critical for correct assimilation
into NWP models, very few methods provide a thorough characterization of the
estimation errors. The difficulty of estimating errors stems from the
specificity of the posterior distribution, which is both very high dimensional,
and highly ill-conditioned due to a singular likelihood, which becomes critical
in particular in the case of missing data (unobserved pixels). This work
studies the evaluation of the expected error of AMVs using gradient-based
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Our main contribution is to propose
a tempering strategy, which amounts to sampling a local approximation of the
joint posterior distribution of AMVs and image variables in the neighborhood of
a point estimate. In addition, we provide efficient preconditioning with the
covariance related to the prior family itself (fractional Brownian motion),
with possibly different hyper-parameters. From a theoretical point of view, we
show that under regularity assumptions, the family of tempered posterior
distributions converges in distribution as temperature decreases to an
{optimal} Gaussian approximation at a point estimate given by the Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) log-density. From an empirical perspective, we evaluate the
proposed approach based on some quantitative Bayesian evaluation criteria. Our
numerical simulations performed on synthetic and real meteorological data
reveal a significant gain in terms of accuracy of the AMV point estimates and
of their associated expected error estimates, but also a substantial
acceleration in the convergence speed of the MCMC algorithms.

environments changes under the effect of three contributions: the vacuum
oscillation, the interaction with the surrounding matter, and the collective
oscillations due to interactions between different neutrinos. The latter adds a
non-linear contribution to the equations of motion, making the description of
their dynamics complex. In this work we study various strategies to simulate
the coherent collective oscillations of a system of N neutrinos in the
two-flavor approximation using quantum computation. This was achieved by using
a pair-neutrino decomposition designed to account for the fact that the flavor
Hamiltonian, in the presence of the neutrino-neutrino term, presents an
all-to-all interaction that makes the implementation of the evolution dependent
on the qubit topology.
  We analyze the Trotter error caused by the decomposition demonstrating that
the complexity of the implementation of time evolution scales polynomially with
the number of neutrinos and that the noisy from near-term quantum device
simulation can be reduced by optimizing the quantum circuit decomposition and
exploiting a full-qubit connectivity. We find that the gate complexity using
second order Trotter-Suzuki formulae scales better with system size than with
other decomposition methods such as Quantum Signal Processing. We finally

  Explicit-Implicit Rhythm Synchronization",,,,,"cs.SD cs.CV cs.MM eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although audio-visual representation has been proved to be applicable in many
downstream tasks, the representation of dancing videos, which is more specific
and always accompanied by music with complex auditory contents, remains
challenging and uninvestigated. Considering the intrinsic alignment between the
cadent movement of dancer and music rhythm, we introduce MuDaR, a novel
Music-Dance Representation learning framework to perform the synchronization of
music and dance rhythms both in explicit and implicit ways. Specifically, we
derive the dance rhythms based on visual appearance and motion cues inspired by
the music rhythm analysis. Then the visual rhythms are temporally aligned with
the music counterparts, which are extracted by the amplitude of sound
intensity. Meanwhile, we exploit the implicit coherence of rhythms implied in
audio and visual streams by contrastive learning. The model learns the joint
embedding by predicting the temporal consistency between audio-visual pairs.
The music-dance representation, together with the capability of detecting audio
and visual rhythms, can further be applied to three downstream tasks: (a) dance
classification, (b) music-dance retrieval, and (c) music-dance retargeting.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms other
self-supervised methods by a large margin.

the solution of the associated master equations as the number of states tends
to infinity. We present two approaches, to treat the case without or with
common noise, both under monotonicity assumptions. The first one uses the
system of characteristics of the master equation, which is the MFG system, to
establish a convergence rate for the master equations without common noise and
the associated optimal trajectories, both in case there is a smooth solution to
the limit master equation and in case there is not. The second approach relies
on the notion of monotone solutions introduced by Bertucci. In the presence of

non-expanding. We implement an ExSdotp unit to efficiently support in hardware
both instruction types. The fused nature of the ExSdotp module prevents
precision losses generated by the non-associativity of two consecutive FP
additions while saving around 30% of the area and critical path compared to a
cascade of two expanding fused multiply-add units. We replicate the ExSdotp

systemic risk can propagate. An important contagion channel is financial fire
sales, where a bank failure causes asset prices to fall due to asset
liquidation, which in turn drives further bank defaults, triggering the next
rounds of liquidation. This process can be considered as complex contagion, yet
it cannot be modeled using the conventional binary-state contagion models
because there is a continuum of states representing asset prices. Here, we
develop a threshold model of continuous-state cascades in which the states of
each node are represented by real values. We show that the solution of a
multi-state contagion model, for which the continuous states are discretized,
accurately replicates the simulated continuous state distribution as long as
the number of states is moderately large. This discretization approach allows
us to exploit the power of approximate master equations (AME) to trace the

asset prices that characterize the dynamics of fire sales on asset-bank

user and each item through the user-item interaction history, so that maximize
the positive samples score and minimize negative samples. Currently, two
popular loss functions are widely used to optimize recommender systems: the
pointwise and the pairwise. Although these loss functions are widely used,
however, there are two problems. (1) These traditional loss functions do not
fit the goals of recommendation systems adequately and utilize prior knowledge
information sufficiently. (2) The slow convergence speed of these traditional
loss functions makes the practical application of various recommendation models
difficult.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel loss function named Supervised
Personalized Ranking (SPR) Based on Prior Knowledge. The proposed method
improves the BPR loss by exploiting the prior knowledge on the interaction
history of each user or item in the raw data. Unlike BPR, instead of
constructing <user, positive item, negative item> triples, the proposed SPR
constructs <user, similar user, positive item, negative item> quadruples.
Although SPR is very simple, it is very effective. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed SPR not only achieves better recommendation performance, but
also significantly accelerates the convergence speed, resulting in a
significant reduction in the required training time.

on the expected interval score and propose a summary measure which can take
into account different weighting of the underlying true proportion. Under
uniform weighting, the expected interval score recommends the Wilson CI or
Bayesian credible intervals with a uniform prior. If extremely low or high
proportions receive more weight, the score recommends Bayesian credible
intervals based on Jeffreys' prior. While more work is needed to theoretically

x-ray images. Therefore, we propose an approach using the QCT for training a
generative adversarial network (GAN) and decomposing an x-ray image into a
projection of bone-segmented QCT. The proposed hierarchical learning improved
the robustness and accuracy of quantitatively decomposing a small-area target.
The evaluation of 200 patients with osteoarthritis using the proposed method,
which we named BMD-GAN, demonstrated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.888
between the predicted and ground truth DXA-measured BMD. Besides not requiring
a large-scale training database, another advantage of our method is its
extensibility to other anatomical areas, such as the vertebrae and rib bones.

that, by high-level random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations, the
formation of germanene on Al(111) is energetically unfavorable with positive

has previously been studied in a two-timescale context only. Here, we uncover
the geometric mechanisms that are responsible for complex oscillatory dynamics
in a three-timescale regime, and we demonstrate that the system exhibits a
variety of qualitatively different behaviours, such as mixed-mode oscillation
(MMO) with ``plateaus"" -- trajectories where epochs of quiescence alternate
with dramatic excursions -- and relaxation oscillation. The latter, although
emergent also in the two-timescale context in appropriate parameter regimes,
had not been documented previously. Moreover, we show that these mechanisms are
relevant to models from other fields of ecological and population dynamics, as
the underlying geometry is similar to the unfolding of
Rosenzweig--MacArthur-type models in three dimensions.

The simulated galaxies agree well with observational constraints of the UV
luminosity function in the Epoch of Reionization. The escape fraction
fluctuates strongly in individual galaxies over timescales of a few Myrs, due
to its regulation by supernova and radiation feedback, and at any given time a
tiny fraction of star-forming galaxies emits a large fraction of the ionizing
radiation escaping into the inter-galactic medium. Statistically, $f_{\rm esc}$
peaks in intermediate-mass, intermediate-brightness, and low-metallicity
galaxies ($M_{*} \approx 10^7 \ M_{\odot}$, $M_{1500} \approx -17$, $Z\lesssim
5 \times 10^{-3} \ Z_{\odot}$), dropping strongly for lower and higher masses,
brighter and dimmer galaxies, and more metal-rich galaxies. The escape fraction
correlates positively with both the short-term and long-term specific star
formation rate. According to SPHINX, galaxies too dim to be yet observed, with
$M_{1500} \gtrapprox -17$, provide about $55$ percent of the photons
contributing to reionization. The global averaged $f_{\rm esc}$ naturally
decreases with decreasing redshift, as predicted by UV background models and
low-redshift observations. This evolution is driven by decreasing specific star
formation rates over cosmic time.

Entropy-based Patch Encoder (EPE) module, for resource-constrained semantic

encoders, each extracting features from image patches with a different amount
of entropy. Patches with high entropy are being processed by the encoder with
the largest number of parameters, patches with moderate entropy are processed
by the encoder with a moderate number of parameters, and patches with low
entropy are processed by the smallest encoder. The intuition behind the module
is the following: as patches with high entropy contain more information, they
need an encoder with more parameters, unlike low entropy patches, which can be
processed using a small encoder. Consequently, processing part of the patches
via the smaller encoder can significantly reduce the computational cost of the
module. Experiments show that EPE can boost the performance of existing
real-time semantic segmentation models with a slight increase in the
computational cost. Specifically, EPE increases the mIOU performance of DFANet
A by 0.9% with only 1.2% increase in the number of parameters and the mIOU

density rises and crosses the critical density of phase transition, and a quark
core is seeded inside the star. Intermediate mass stars are more likely to have
a quark seeding in their lifetime at birth. Smaller neutron stars do not have a
quark core and remain neutron stars throughout their life, whereas in massive
stars, a quark core exists at their center from birth. In intermediate and
massive stars, the quark core grows further as the star slows down. The
appearance of a quark core leads to a sudden change in the moment of inertia of
the star in its evolutionary history, and it is also reflected in a sudden
discontinuity in the braking index of the star (at the frequency where the
quark core first seeds). The energy released during the phase transition
process as the quark core is seeded can excite the f-mode oscillation in the
star and is emitted in the form of the gravitational wave, which is in the
range of detection with present operating detectors; however, future detectors
will enable a more clean extraction of this signals. Also, neutrinos and bursts
of gamma-rays can originate from phase transition events. The spin-down induced
phase transition could be gradual or in the form of subsequent leaps producing

paper proposes a waveform design named max-aperture radar slicing (MaRS) to
gain a large time-frequency aperture, which reuses the orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) hardware and occupies only a tiny fraction of OFDM
resources. The proposed MaRS keeps the radar advantages of constant modulus,
zero auto-correlation, and simple SIC. Joint space-time processing algorithms
are proposed to recover the range-velocity-angle information from strong
clutters. Furthermore, this paper proposes a hybrid-duplex JCAS scheme where
communication is half-duplex while radar is full-duplex. In this scheme, the
half-duplex communication antenna array is reused, and a small
sensing-dedicated antenna array is specially designed. Using these two arrays,
a large space-domain aperture is virtually formed to greatly improve the angle
resolution. The numerical results show that the proposed MaRS and hybrid-duplex
schemes achieve a high sensing resolution with less than 0.4% OFDM resources

identify wave functions of (2+1)-D chiral topological phases, by studying
low-lying entanglement spectra (ES) on long cylinders of finite circumference.
Here we consider such ES of states [in fact, of wave functions of certain
Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS)] that are not chiral, but which strongly
break time-reversal as well as reflection symmetry. This leads to ES which have
branches of both right- and left-moving chiralities, but with vastly different
velocities. For circumferences much smaller than the inverse entanglement gap
scale, the low-lying ES appear chiral in some topological sectors, and
precisely follow the Li-Haldane state counting of a truly chiral phase. On its
face, this could lead one to mistakenly identify the phase as chiral. However,
by considering the ES in all possible sectors, one can observe distinct
differences from a chiral phase. We explore this phenomenon in the setting of
an $SU(3)$ spin liquid PEPS studied by Kure\v{c}i\'c, et al. [PRB 99, 045116
(2019)], where the trivial sector appeared to have the characteristic
Li-Haldane counting of a chiral $SU(3)$-level-one [$SU(3)_1$] Conformal Field
Theory (CFT). In fact, the PEPS has $D(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ topological order, with 9
sectors. We compute the ES in minimally entangled states corresponding to all
these sectors, which map to the 9 anyon types of doubled $SU(3)$-level-one
Chern-Simons Topological Field Theory. The state countings of the ES are
consistent with our expectation: specifically, the ES contain representations
of global $SU(3)$ symmetry from the tensor products of the (lowest-lying)
multiplet of primary states of a ""high-velocity"" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT with the
full content of a ""low-velocity"" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT sector, a non-chiral

new universal method for Cryptanalysis which uses a Black Box linear algebra
approach to computation of local inversion of nonlinear maps in finite fields.
It is shown that one local inverse $x$ of the map equation $y=F(x)$ can be
computed by using the minimal polynomial of the sequence $y(k)$ defined by
iterates (or recursion) $y(k+1)=F(y(k))$ with $y(0)=y$ when the sequence is
periodic. This is the only solution in the periodic orbit of the map $F$.
Further, when the degree of the minimal polynomial is of polynomial order in
number of bits of the input of $F$ (called low complexity case), the solution
can be computed in polynomial time. The method of computation only uses the
forward computations $F(y)$ for given $y$ which is why this is called a Black
Box approach. Application of this approach is then shown for cryptanalysis of
several maps arising in cryptographic primitives. It is shown how in the low
complexity cases maps defined by block and stream ciphers can be inverted to
find the symmetric key under known plaintext attack. Then it is shown how RSA
map can be inverted to find the plaintext as well as an equivalent private key
to break the RSA algorithm without factoring the modulus. Finally it is shown
that the discrete log computation in finite field and elliptic curves can be
formulated as a local inversion problem and the low complexity cases can be
solved in polynomial time.

mixing scenario in presence of matter effects. We adopt the well-known OMSD(One
Mass Scale Dominance) approximation to carry out our analysis. After that we
perform series expansion about $\sin \theta_{13}$ term upto second order. We
find that our results are consistent with the already existing $\alpha - \sin
\theta_{13}$ approximated relations in the limit of vanishing $\alpha$ and
phases involving sterile neutrinos. We also figure out that survival transition
probability becomes independent of the fundamental and sterile CP phases under
our formalism. Hence, it provides us a new way to look at only matter effects
contribution to oscillation probability. Also, the transition probability at
the same time gives an independent study of CP-violation arising from the
sterile phases, in the vicinity of fundamental CP violation phase. We provide
the relation for the atmospheric probability in the presence of matter by
performing the series expansion upto linear order about parameter $A (= 2EV)$,
with V being the effective matter potential under OMSD approximation.

the last centuries, but only few results are known about nonlinear Euler sums
of quadratic or even higher degree. The first systematic study on nonlinear
Euler sums consisting of products of hyperharmonic sums had been published by
Flajolet and Salvy in 1997 followed by similar studies presented during the
last years by different authors. Although these studies had been restricted to
sums where the nominator consists of a product of even or odd hyperharmonic
sums, where the denominator is of the type $1/k^n$. We have generalized these
results to nonlinear Euler sums with different denominators and nominators
which consist in addition of mixed products between even and odd hyperharmonic
numbers. In detail we present eight families of quadratic Euler sums which are
expressible by zeta values and special types of linear Euler sums only where
the order of the nonlinear Euler sums is always an even number. The resulting
eight different families of nonlinear Euler sums which we discovered consist of
various products between even and odd hyperharmonic numbers, divided by three
different types of denominators $1/k^n$, $1/((2k-1)^n)$ and $1/(k(2k-1))$. The
calculational scheme is based on proper two-valued integer functions, which
allow us to compute these sequences explicitly in terms of zeta values and
pairs of odd-type linear harmonic numbers and even hyperharmonic numbers of
second order.

control problems where the model parameters are highly uncertain, and the
system is partially observable in practice. However, RL of robust control
policies often relies on performing a large number of simulations. This could
easily become computationally intractable for cases with computationally
intensive simulations. To address this bottleneck, an adaptive multi-grid RL
framework is introduced which is inspired by principles of geometric multi-grid
methods used in iterative numerical algorithms. RL control policies are
initially learned using computationally efficient low fidelity simulations
using coarse grid discretization of the underlying partial differential
equations (PDEs). Subsequently, the simulation fidelity is increased in an
adaptive manner towards the highest fidelity simulation that correspond to
finest discretization of the model domain. The proposed framework is
demonstrated using a state-of-the-art, model-free policy-based RL algorithm,
namely the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm. Results are shown for
two case studies of robust optimal well control problems which are inspired
from SPE-10 model 2 benchmark case studies. Prominent gains in the
computational efficiency is observed using the proposed framework saving around
60-70% of computational cost of its single fine-grid counterpart.

the dataset is annotated with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) tagset.
However, most of the languages around the globe have used the dataset annotated

as simple and general as possible while still preserving all the symmetries of

confronting the full cosmological evolution of the field with an extensive set

a single-particle band gap $\Delta_b$. This work provides a theoretical
description for both strong ($\epsilon_b\sim\Delta_b$) and weak
($\epsilon_b\ll\Delta_b$) excitonic bound states, with particular application
to biased bilayer graphene. Standard description of excitons is based on a wave
function that is determined by a Schr\""odinger-like equation with screened
attractive potential. The wave function approach is valid only in the weak
binding regime $\epsilon_b\ll\Delta_b$. The screening depends on frequency
(dynamical screening) and this implies retardation. In the case of strong
binding, $\epsilon_b\sim\Delta_b$, a wave function description is not possible
due to the retardation. Instead we appeal to the Bethe-Salpeter equation,
written in terms of the electron-hole Green's function, to solve the problem.
So far only the weak binding regime has been achieved experimentally. Our
analysis demonstrates that the strong binding regime is also possible and we
specify conditions in which it can be achieved for the prototypical example of
biased bilayer graphene. The conditions concern the bias, the configuration of
gates, and the substrate material. To verify the accuracy of our analysis we
compare with available data for the weak binding regime. We anticipate applying
the developed dynamical screening Bethe-Salpeter techniques to various 2D
materials with strong binding.

satisfy the internal versions of the AB axioms from homological algebra. The
main subtlety lies in proving AB4, which is that coproducts indexed by
arbitrary sets are left-exact. To prove this, we replace a set with its strict
category of (ordered) finite sub-multisets. From showing that the latter is
filtered, we deduce left-exactness of the coproduct. More generally, we show
that exactness of filtered colimits (AB5) implies AB4 for any abelian category
in HoTT. Our approach is heavily inspired by Roswitha Harting's construction of
the internal coproduct of abelian groups in an elementary topos with a natural
numbers object [Har82].
  To state the AB axioms we define and study filtered (and sifted)
precategories in HoTT. A key result needed is that filtered colimits commute
with finite limits of sets. This is a familiar classical result, but has not
previously been checked in our setting.
  Finally, we interpret our most central results into an $\infty$-topos
$\mathscr{X}$. Given a ring $R$ in $\mathscr{X}$, we show that the internal
category of $R$-modules in $\mathscr{X}$ represents the presheaf which sends an
object $X \in \mathscr{X}$ to the category of $(X{\times}R)$-modules over $X$.
In general, our results yield a product-preserving left adjoint to base change
of modules over $X$. When $X$ is $0$-truncated, this left adjoint is the
internal coproduct. By an internalisation procedure, we deduce left-exactness
of the internal coproduct as an ordinary functor from its internal
left-exactness coming from HoTT.

the maximum discrepancy over all set systems obtainable by deleting a subset of

of an organization, identifying and evaluating the exposure to cyber threats.
Currently, this activity is carried out mainly manually and the identification
and correct quantification of risks deeply depend on the experience and
confidence of the human assessor. As a consequence, the process is not
completely objective and two parallel assessments of the same situation may
lead to different results. This paper takes a step in the direction of reducing
the degree of subjectivity by proposing a methodology to support risk assessors
with an automatic review of the produced assessment. Our methodology starts
from a controls-based assessment performed using well-known cybersecurity
frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST) and maps security controls over
infrastructural aspects that can be assessed automatically (e.g., ICT devices,
organization policies). Exploiting this mapping, the methodology suggests how
to identify controls needing revision. The approach has been validated through
a case study from the healthcare domain and a set of statistical analyses.

was launched in March 2021 and operates on a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous
orbit. The gamma-ray burst detector onboard GRBAlpha consists of a 75x75x5 mm
CsI(Tl) scintillator, read out by a dual-channel multi-pixel photon counter
(MPPC) setup. It is sensitive in the ~30-900 keV range. The main goal of
GRBAlpha is the in-orbit demonstration of the detector concept, verification of
the detector's lifetime, and measurement of the background level on low-Earth
orbit, including regions inside the outer Van Allen radiation belt and in the
South Atlantic Anomaly. GRBAlpha has already detected five, both long and
short, GRBs and two bursts were detected within a time-span of only 8 hours,
proving that nanosatellites can be used for routine detection of gamma-ray
transients. For one GRB, we were able to obtain a high resolution spectrum and
compare it with measurements from the Swift satellite. We find that, due to the
variable background, the time fraction of about 67 % of the low-Earth polar
orbit is suitable for gamma-ray burst detection. One year after launch, the
detector performance is good and the degradation of the MPPC photon counters
remains at an acceptable level. The same detector system, but double in size,
was launched in January 2022 on VZLUSAT-2 (3U CubeSat). It performs well and
already detected three GRBs and two solar flares. Here, we present early
results from this mission as well.

practical inertia but acts like grid-forming control in zero inertia cases.

particular, we propose three growth operations, full doubling, RC doubling and
doubling, and explore the algorithmic and structural properties of their
resulting processes under a geometric setting. In terms of modeling, our system
runs on a 2-dimensional grid and operates in discrete time-steps. The process
begins with an initial shape $S_I=S_0$ and, in every time-step $t \geq 1$, by
applying (in parallel) one or more growth operations of a specific type to the
current shape-instance $S_{t-1}$, generates the next instance $S_t$, always
satisfying $|S_t| > |S_{t-1}|$. Our goal is to characterize the classes of
shapes that can be constructed in $O(\log n)$ or polylog $n$ time-steps and
determine whether a final shape $S_F$ can be constructed from an initial shape
$S_I$ using a finite sequence of growth operations of a given type, called a
constructor of $S_F$.
  For full doubling, in which, in every time-step, every node generates a new
node in a given direction, we completely characterize the structure of the
class of shapes that can be constructed from a given initial shape. For RC
doubling, in which complete columns or rows double, our main contribution is a
linear-time centralized algorithm that for any pair of shapes $S_I$, $S_F$
decides if $S_F$ can be constructed from $S_I$ and, if the answer is yes,
returns an $O(\log n)$-time-step constructor of $S_F$ from $S_I$. For the most
general doubling operation, where up to individual nodes can double, we show
that some shapes cannot be constructed in sub-linear time-steps and give two
universal constructors of any $S_F$ from a singleton $S_I$, which are efficient
(i.e., up to polylogarithmic time-steps) for large classes of shapes. Both
constructors can be computed by polynomial-time centralized algorithms for any
shape $S_F$.

provides invariants of the singular foliations, and also provides a

explicitly constructing projective resolutions of the singular foliations
induced by the natural linear actions of endomorphisms of $V$ preserving a
subspace $W\subset V$, the Lie algebra of traceless endomorphisms, and the
symplectic Lie algebra of endomorphisms of $V$ preserving a non-degenerate

vector bundle $E$, where the role of the origin is now taken by the zero

been a key intervention in containing the COVID-19 epidemic. The focus of our
work is to better understand the options available to policy-makers under the
conditions and uncertainties created by the onset of a new pandemic. More
precisely, we focus on two control strategies. The first is aimed at
controlling the rate of new infections in order to prevent congestion of the
health care system. The latter exerts control directly on hospitalizations and
intensive care units (ICUs) occupation. By a first-order analysis we show that,
on the one hand, due to the difficulty in contact tracing and the lack of
accurate information, controlling the rate of transmission may be difficult
leading to instability. On the other hand, although hospitalizations and ICUs
are easily accessible and less noisy than the rate of new infections, a delay
is introduced in the control loop, which may endanger system stability. Our
framework allows assessing the impact on economic and social costs of the above
strategies in a scenario enriched by: i) population heterogeneity in terms of
mortality rate and risk exposure; ii) closed-loop control of the
epidemiological curve; iii) progressive vaccination of individuals.

conservation voltage reduction (DRCC-CVR) method with enriched data-based
ambiguity set in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. The increasing
penetration of distributed renewable energy not only brings clean power but
also challenges the voltage regulation and energy-saving performance of CVR by
introducing high uncertainties to distribution systems. In most cases, the
conventional robust optimization methods for CVR only provide conservative
solutions. To better consider the impacts of load and PV generation
uncertainties on CVR implementation in distribution systems and provide less
conservative solutions, this paper develops a data-based DRCC-CVR model with
tractable reformulation and data enrichment method. Even though the
uncertainties of load and photovoltaic (PV) can be captured by data, the
availability of smart meters (SMs) and micro-phasor measurement units (PMUs) is
restricted by cost budget. The limited data access may hinder the performance
of the proposed DRCC-CVR. Thus, we further present a data enrichment method to
statistically recover the high-resolution load and PV generation data from
low-resolution data with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Markov Chain
(MC) models, which can be used to construct a data-based moment ambiguity set
of uncertainty distributions for the proposed DRCC-CVR. Finally, the nonlinear
power flow and voltage dependant load models and DRCC with moment-based
ambiguity set are reformulated to be computationally tractable and tested on a
real distribution feeder in Midwest U. S. to validate the effectiveness and

clades of SARS2r-CoVs, GD and GX, infecting pangolins. However the RNA-Seq
datasets supporting pangolin genome assembly were widely contaminated,
contained synthetic vectors or were heavily enriched or filtered with little
but coronavirus sequences left in the datasets. Here we investigate two
pangolin fecal samples sequenced by Li et al. (2021) provided in support of GD
PCoV infection of pangolins in Guangdong and find the read distribution
consistent with PCR amplicon contamination and SARS-CoV-2 contamination, and
further identify the presence of synthetic plasmid sequences. We also build
upon our previous work to further analyze the dataset GX/P3B by Lam et al.
(2020), which is the only non enriched/heavily filtered pangolin tissue dataset
sequenced by Lam et al. (2020). We identify synthetic vectors and confirm human
genomic origin samples in the dataset. Finally, we find human mitochondrial
sequences in all pangolin organ datasets and mouse and tiger mitochondrial
sequences in selected pangolin organ datasets sequenced by Liu et al. (2019).
We infer that human and mouse genomic origin sequences were probably sourced
from contamination prior to sequencing, while tiger origin sequence
contamination may have occurred due to index hopping during sequencing. These
observations are problematic for attributing pangolins as SARS2r-CoV hosts in
the datasets examined. The forensic methods developed and used here can be
applied to examine any third party SRA data sets.

the elastoresistance through a weak coupling to the lattice.

information processing. One possible donor spin readout mechanism is the bound
exciton transition that can be excited optically and creates an electrical
signal when it decays. This transition has been extensively studied in bulk,
but in order to scale towards localized spin readout, microfabricated
structures are needed for detection. As these electrodes will inevitably cause
strain in the silicon lattice, it will be crucial to understand how strain
affects the exciton transitions. Here we study the phosphorous donor bound
exciton transitions in silicon using hybrid electro-optical readout with
microfabricated electrodes. We observe a significant zero-field splitting as
well mixing of the hole states due to strain. We can model these effects
assuming the known asymmetry of the hole g-factors and the Pikus-Bir
Hamiltonian describing the strain. In addition, we describe the temperature,
laser power and light polarization dependence of the transitions. Importantly,
the hole-mixing should not prevent donor electron spin readout and using our
measured parameters and numerical simulations we anticipate that hybrid spin
readout in a silicon-on-insulator platform should be possible, allowing
integration to silicon photonics platforms.

characterising its properties. We monitored TOI-1422 with the HARPS-N
spectrograph for 1.5 years to precisely quantify its radial velocity variation.
The radial velocity measurements are analyzed jointly with TESS photometry and
we also check for blended companions through high-spatial resolution images
using the AstraLux instrument. We estimate that the parent star has a radius

period $P_{\rm b}=12.9972\pm0.0006$ days and has an equilibrium temperature
$T_{\rm eq, b}=867\pm17$ K. With a radius of $R_{\rm b}=3.96^{+0.13}_{-0.11}

consequently, a density of $\rho_{\rm b}=0.795^{+0.290}_{-0.235}$ g cm$^{-3}$,
it can be considered a warm Neptune-size planet. Compared to other exoplanets
of similar mass range, TOI-1422b is among the most inflated ones and we expect
this planet to have an extensive gaseous envelope that surrounds a core with a
mass fraction around $10\%-25\%$ of the total mass of the planet. The outer
non-transiting planet candidate, TOI-1422c, has an orbital period of $P_{\rm

$11.1^{+2.6}_{-2.3} M_{\oplus}$, an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq,

in low-light conditions. Though many methods have been proposed to enhance
noisy or blurry night images, their performances on real-world night photos are
still unsatisfactory due to two main reasons: 1) Limited information in a
single image and 2) Domain gap between synthetic training images and real-world
photos (e.g., differences in blur area and resolution). To exploit the
information from successive long- and short-exposure images, we propose a
learning-based pipeline to fuse them. A D2HNet framework is developed to
recover a high-quality image by deblurring and enhancing a long-exposure image
under the guidance of a short-exposure image. To shrink the domain gap, we
leverage a two-phase DeblurNet-EnhanceNet architecture, which performs accurate
blur removal on a fixed low resolution so that it is able to handle large
ranges of blur in different resolution inputs. In addition, we synthesize a
D2-Dataset from HD videos and experiment on it. The results on the validation

backscatter communication can harvest and use the existing RF signals in the
atmosphere for communication, while NOMA provides communication to multiple
wireless devices over the same frequency and time resources. This paper has
proposed a new resource management framework for backscatter-aided cooperative
NOMA communication in upcoming 6G networks. In particular, the proposed work
has simultaneously optimized the base station's transmit power, relaying node,
the reflection coefficient of the backscatter tag, and time allocation under
imperfect successive interference cancellation to maximize the sum rate of the
system. To obtain an efficient solution for the resource management framework,
we have proposed a combination of the bisection method and dual theory, where
the sub-gradient method is adopted to optimize the Lagrangian multipliers.
Numerical results have shown that the proposed solution provides excellent
performance. When the performance of the proposed technique is compared to a
brute-forcing search technique that guarantees optimal solution however, is
very time-consuming, it was seen that the gap in performance is actually 0\%.
Hence, the proposed framework has provided performance equal to a cumbersome
brute-force search technique while offering much less complexity. The works in
the literature on cooperative NOMA considered equal time distribution for
cooperation and direct communication. Our results showed that optimizing the
time-division can increase the performance by more than 110\% for high
transmission powers.

bending stresses. The resistivity of a u-shape bended LSMO decays three times
faster than that of a n-shape bended LSMO as a response to the same magnitude

attributed to the dual actions of Jahn-Teller distortion and strain gradient

address the above problem. The BL paradigm bundles the two NER paradigms,
enabling NER models to jointly tune their parameters by weighted summing each
paradigm's training loss. However, three critical issues remain unresolved:
When does BL work? Why does BL work? Can BL enhance the existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) NER models? To address the first two issues, we
implement three NER models, involving a sequence labeling-based model--SeqNER,
a span-based NER model--SpanNER, and BL-NER that bundles SeqNER and SpanNER
together. We draw two conclusions regarding the two issues based on the
experimental results on eleven NER datasets from five domains. We then apply BL
to five existing SOTA NER models to investigate the third issue, consisting of
three sequence labeling-based models and two span-based models. Experimental
results indicate that BL consistently enhances their performance, suggesting
that it is possible to construct a new SOTA NER system by incorporating BL into

of BLS including resuscitation through by-standers gets indispensable. However,
survival rates of cardiac arrest victims could majorly increase if BLS skills

approaches utilizing augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have been proposed
in recent works. However, these approaches are not compliant with the medical
BLS guidelines or focus only on specific steps of BLS training such as
resuscitation. Furthermore, most of the existing training approaches do not
focus on automated assessment to enhance efficiency and effectiveness through
fine-grained real-time feedback. To overcome these issues, we present a novel
AR- and VR-based training environment which supports a comprehensive BLS
training compliant with the medical guidelines. Our training environment
combines AR-/VR-based BLS training with an interactive haptic manikin that
supports automated assessment, real-time feedback, and debriefing in an
integrated environment. We have conducted a usability evaluation where we
analyze the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of BLS training
based on our AR and VR environment against traditional BLS training. Results of
the evaluation indicate that AR and VR technology have the potential to
increase engagement in BLS training, improve high-quality resuscitation, and
reduce the cognitive workload compared to traditional training.

within the framework of modified Plebanski theory we construct a family of

continuum limit of spin foams and provide a starting point to explore
phenomenological aspects of the large-scale dynamics of spin foams. More
generally, they set the stage for exploring consequences of an enlargement of
the configuration space for gravity from length to area metrics. The actions we

rigidity. They are composed by agents and a set of directed constraints between
pairs of agents. When the structure cannot be flexed while preserving the

a sufficient condition for rigidity is called infinitesimal rigidity. In conic
frameworks, each agent $u$ has a spatial position $x_u$ and a clock offset
represented by a bias $\beta_u$. If the constraint from Agent $u$ to Agent $w$
is in the framework, the pseudo-range from $u$ to $w$, defined as
${\left\lVert{x_u - x_w}\right\rVert} + \beta_w - \beta_u$, is set.
Pseudo-ranges appear when measuring inter-agent distances using a
Time-of-Arrival method. This paper completely characterizes infinitesimal
rigidity of conic frameworks whose agents are in general position. Two
characterizations are introduced: one for unidimensional frameworks, the other
for multidimensional frameworks. They both rely on the graph of constraints and
use a decoupling between space and bias variables. In multidimensional cases,
this new conic paradigm sharply reduces the minimal number of constraints

analysed a deep, $900$ pc resolution ALMA observation of the sub-mm continuum,
[CII] and H$_2$O of the $z\sim 6$ QSO J2310+1855, enabling a detailed study of
dust properties and cold gas kinematics. We performed an accurate SED analysis
obtaining a dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust} = 71$ K and a dust mass of
$M_{\rm dust}= 4.4 \times 10^8\ \rm M_{\odot}$. The implied AGN-corrected SFR
is $1240 \ \rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, a factor of 2 smaller than previously

a dynamical model of the system. We found that ${\rm SFR}/M_{\rm dyn}>\dot
M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm BH}$, suggesting that AGN feedback might be efficiently
acting to slow down the SMBH accretion, while the stellar mass assembly is
still vigorously taking place in the host galaxy. In addition, we were also

As the human
kinesthetically guides the robot through demonstrations, the robot learns the
desired task. While prior works focus on how the robot learns, it is equally
important for the human teacher to understand what their robot is learning.
Visual displays can communicate this information; however, we hypothesize that
visual feedback alone misses out on the physical connection between the human
and robot. In this paper we introduce a novel class of soft haptic displays
that wrap around the robot arm, adding signals without affecting that
interaction. We first design a pneumatic actuation array that remains flexible
in mounting. We then develop single and multi-dimensional versions of this
wrapped haptic display, and explore human perception of the rendered signals
during psychophysic tests and robot learning. We ultimately find that people
accurately distinguish single-dimensional feedback with a Weber fraction of
11.4%, and identify multi-dimensional feedback with 94.5% accuracy. When
physically teaching robot arms, humans leverage the single- and
multi-dimensional feedback to provide better demonstrations than with visual
feedback: our wrapped haptic display decreases teaching time while increasing
demonstration quality. This improvement depends on the location and

present a state prediction method which takes into account a stochastic human

focus on the multi-rotor in a near-collision situation. The stochastic human

Besides, the proposed state prediction method considers the uncertainty of the

explainability and formal guaranties. Each of these individual domains gains
the ML community interest, visible by the number of related publications.
However few works tackle the interconnection between these fields. In this
paper we show a first link between uncertainty and explainability, by studying
the relation between calibration and interpretation. As the calibration of a
given model changes the way it scores samples, and interpretation approaches
often rely on these scores, it seems safe to assume that the
confidence-calibration of a model interacts with our ability to interpret such
model. In this paper, we show, in the context of networks trained on image
classification tasks, to what extent interpretations are sensitive to
confidence-calibration. It leads us to suggest a simple practice to improve the
interpretation outcomes: Calibrate to Interpret.

family is considered one of the most memorable and important activities for
people with mobility limitations. While existing robotic systems for feeding
people with mobility limitations focus on solitary dining, commensality, the
act of eating together, is often the practice of choice. Sharing meals with
others introduces the problem of socially appropriate bite timing for a robot,
i.e. the appropriate timing for the robot to feed without disrupting the social
dynamics of a shared meal. Our key insight is that bite timing strategies that
take into account the delicate balance of social cues can lead to seamless
interactions during robot-assisted feeding in a social dining scenario. We
approach this problem by collecting a Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD)

analyze human-human commensality behaviors and develop bite timing prediction
models in social dining scenarios. We also transfer these models to human-robot

algorithm uses multimodal social signaling cues between diners to model bite
timing. The HHCD dataset, videos of user studies, and code are available at

In a prophet inequality problem, a decision-maker sees a series of online
elements and needs to decide immediately and irrevocably whether or not to
select each element upon its arrival, subject to an underlying feasibility
constraint. Traditionally, the decision-maker's expected performance has been
compared to the expected performance of the prophet, i.e., the expected offline
optimum. We refer to this measure as the Ratio of Expectations (or, in short,
RoE). However, a major limitation of the RoE measure is that it only gives a
guarantee against what the optimum would be on average, while, in theory,
algorithms still might perform poorly compared to the realized ex-post optimal
value.
  Hence, we study alternative performance measures. In particular, we suggest
the Expected Ratio (or, in short, EoR), which is the expectation of the ratio
between the value of the algorithm and the value of the prophet. This measure
yields desirable guarantees, e.g., a constant EoR implies achieving a constant
fraction of the ex-post offline optimum with constant probability. Moreover, in
the single-choice setting, we show that the EoR is equivalent (in the worst
case) to the probability of selecting the maximum, a well-studied measure in
the literature. This is no longer the case for combinatorial constraints
(beyond single-choice), which is the main focus of this paper.
  Our main goal is to understand the relation between RoE and EoR in
combinatorial settings. Specifically, we establish a two-way black-box
reduction: for every feasibility constraint, the RoE and the EoR are at most a
constant factor apart. This implies a wealth of EoR results in multiple
settings where RoE results are known.

Hochschild dimension of these spaces. This allows us to compute the kernel of
the embedding into the projective space in Hochschild cohomology. Finally we
use the above computations to apply the construction by A. Rizzardo, M. Van den

It has been shown that the utility function of many machine learning

submodularity. Hence, maximizing a submodular function subject to various
constraints can be found at the heart of many of those applications. On a high
level, submodular maximization aims to select a group of most representative
items (e.g., data points). However, the design of most existing algorithms does
not incorporate the fairness constraint, leading to under- or

submodular maximization problem with group equality, where we aim to select a
group of items to maximize a (possibly non-monotone) submodular utility
function subject to a group equality constraint. To this end, we develop the
first constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. The design of
our algorithm is robust enough to be extended to solving the submodular
maximization problem under a more complicated adaptive setting. Moreover, we
further extend our study to incorporating a global cardinality constraint.

mass into the bubble, increasing its density. Mass-loading increases the
temperature of the unshocked stellar wind due to the frictional drag, and
reduces the temperature of the hot shocked gas as the available thermal energy
is shared between more particles. Mass-loading may increase or decrease the
volume-averaged bubble pressure. Mass-loaded bubbles are smaller, have less
retained energy and lower radial momentum, but in all cases examined are still
able to do significant $PdV$ work on the swept-up gas. In this latter respect,
the bubbles more closely resemble energy-conserving bubbles than the

additional model complexity correcting the deflection angles only at the

means of a collection of lists are all $\leq 1/2$ of SHANGRLA, and the
nonnegative supermartingale (NNSM) tests in ALPHA to improve the efficiency and

workload by as much as 74% in examples. We also present NNSM-based tests that

Capitalizing on this, studies in neuroscience have started to use NLMs to study
neural activity in the human brain during language processing. However, many
questions remain unanswered regarding which factors determine the ability of a
neural language model to capture brain activity (aka its 'brain score'). Here,
we make first steps in this direction and examine the impact of test loss,
training corpus and model architecture (comparing GloVe, LSTM, GPT-2 and BERT),
on the prediction of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging timecourses of
participants listening to an audiobook. We find that (1) untrained versions of
each model already explain significant amount of signal in the brain by
capturing similarity in brain responses across identical words, with the
untrained LSTM outperforming the transformerbased models, being less impacted
by the effect of context; (2) that training NLP models improves brain scores in
the same brain regions irrespective of the model's architecture; (3) that
Perplexity (test loss) is not a good predictor of brain score; (4) that
training data have a strong influence on the outcome and, notably, that
off-the-shelf models may lack statistical power to detect brain activations.
Overall, we outline the impact of modeltraining choices, and suggest good
practices for future studies aiming at explaining the human language system
using neural language models.

gained significant traction with several solutions that provide different

(HE), a method of performing computations over encrypted data. However, HE
operations even with state-of-the-art schemes are still considerably slow
compared to their plaintext counterparts. Pruning the parameters of a NN model
is a well-known approach to improving inference latency. However, pruning
methods that are useful in the plaintext context may lend nearly negligible
improvement in the HE case, as has also been demonstrated in recent work.
  In this work, we propose a novel set of pruning methods that reduce the
latency and memory requirement, thus bringing the effectiveness of plaintext
pruning methods to HE. Crucially, our proposal employs two key techniques, viz.
permutation and expansion of the packed model weights, that enable pruning
significantly more ciphertexts and recuperating most of the accuracy loss,
respectively. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on fully connected
layers where the weights are packed using a recently proposed packing technique
called tile tensors, which allows executing deep NN inference in a
non-interactive mode. We evaluate our methods on various autoencoder

of 1.5*10^{-5} on MNIST, we reduce the memory requirement and latency of
HE-enabled inference by 60%.

exhibits that a language with lesser overlap can be more amenable to

Finally, the proposed posterior transformation approach is leveraged to fuse
monolingual models for a target language. A relative improvement of ~8% over

End-to-end (e2e) modelling is preferred over conventional hybrid systems,

sociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social
interaction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable
predictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of
social media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models
from a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any
scientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work,
we present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural
Network (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by
transporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from
natural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social
psychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that
simultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent
the social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating
matrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information
(e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the
social interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training
procedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include
stochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on

  of Rainfall Maxima","18 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For modeling extreme rainfall, the widely used Brown-Resnick max-stable model
extends the concept of the variogram to suit bloc maxima, allowing the explicit
modeling of the extremal dependence shown by the spatial data. This extremal
dependence stems from the geometrical characteristics of the observed rainfall,
which is associated with different meteorological processes and is usually
considered to be constant when designing the model for a study. However,
depending on the region, this dependence can change throughout the year, as the
prevailing meteorological conditions that drive the rainfall generation process
change with the season. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of the
seasonal change in extremal dependence for the modeling of annual block maxima
in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. For this study, two seasons were considered
as proxies for different dominant meteorological conditions: summer for
convective rainfall and winter for frontal/stratiform rainfall. Using maxima
from both seasons, we compared the skill of a linear model with spatial
covariates (that assumed spatial independence) with the skill of a
Brown-Resnick max-stable model. This comparison showed a considerable
difference between seasons, with the isotropic Brown-Resnick model showing
considerable loss of skill for the winter maxima. We conclude that the
assumptions commonly made when using the Brown-Resnick model are appropriate
for modeling summer (i.e., convective) events, but further work should be done
for modeling other types of precipitation regimes.

the framework can accurately capture anisotropic behavior of 2D heterogeneous
beams with nonlocal effects localized across multiple scales. Building upon
this general continuum theory and on the multiscale character of DO operators,
a one-dimensional (1D) multiscale nonlocal Timoshenko model is also presented.
This approach enables a significant model-order reduction without compromising
the heterogeneous nonlocal description of the material, hence leading to an
efficient and accurate multiscale nonlocal modeling approach. Both 1D and 2D
approaches are applied to simulate the mechanical responses of nonlocal beams.
The direct comparison of numerical simulations produced by either the DO or an
integer-order fully-resolved model (used as ground truth) clearly illustrates
the ability of the DO formulation to capture the effect of the microstructure
on the macroscopic response. The assessment of the computational cost also

assessment framework for steel structures is proposed in this paper. The
framework is based on the integration of a high-fidelity fiber-based nonlinear
structural modeling environment with a wind-tunnel-informed stochastic wind
load model to perform nonlinear time history analysis. General uncertainty is
propagated using a stratified sampling scheme enabling the efficient estimation
of reliabilities associated with rare events. The adopted models for simulating
high-fidelity nonlinear structural behavior were found, in general, to be
adequate for capturing phenomena, including progressive yielding, buckling, and
low-cycle fatigue, that are essential for wind induced collapse analysis. In
particular, the adopted fatigue model was found to be capable of predicting
damage and potential fiber/section fracture associated with non-fully reversing
stress-strain cycles that are characteristic of wind loading. Through
illustration on a 45-story archetype steel building, critical discussions on
the types of observed collapse mechanisms, the difference between alongwind and

average number of visits below 3390, seems no new ideas appear after it.
Recently I have met several people familiar with published papers from
2002-2003 but not knowing newer results. Even after 2009 several papers on the
topic were published where the new results were not mentioned [4]. Whole book
was written about the problem [2]. This is why I am writing this summary.

  Reviews","9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.DL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Systematic Literature Reviews aim at investigating current approaches to
conclude a research gap or determine a futuristic approach. They represent a
significant part of a research activity, from which new concepts stem. However,
with the massive availability of publications at a rapid growing rate,
especially digitally, it becomes challenging to efficiently screen and assess
relevant publications. Another challenge is the continuous assessment of
related work over a long period of time and the consequent need for a
continuous update, which can be a time-consuming task. Knowledge graphs model
entities in a connected manner and enable new insights using different
reasoning and analysis methods. The objective of this work is to present an
approach to partially automate the conduction of a Systematic Literature Review
as well as classify and visualize the results as a knowledge graph. The
designed software prototype was used for the conduction of a review on
context-awareness in automation systems with considerably accurate results
compared to a manual conduction.

consideration of artificial entities. It highlights key intellectual influences
on this literature as well as research and academic discussion addressing the
topic more directly. We find that researchers addressing AI rights have often
seemed to be unaware of the work of colleagues whose interests overlap with
their own. Academic interest in this topic has grown substantially in recent
years; this reflects wider trends in academic research, but it seems that
certain influential publications, the gradual, accumulating ubiquity of AI and
robotic technology, and relevant news events may all have encouraged increased
academic interest in this specific topic. We suggest four levers that, if
pulled on in the future, might increase interest further: the adoption of
publication strategies similar to those of the most successful previous
contributors; increased engagement with adjacent academic fields and debates;
the creation of specialized journals, conferences, and research institutions;
and more exploration of legal rights for artificial entities.

  overlap with arXiv:2006.00986",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning accurate drug representations is essential for task such as
computational drug repositioning. A drug hierarchy is a valuable source that
encodes knowledge of relations among drugs in a tree-like structure where drugs
that act on the same organs, treat the same disease, or bind to the same
biological target are grouped together. However, its utility in learning drug
representations has not yet been explored, and currently described drug
representations cannot place novel molecules in a drug hierarchy. Here, we
develop a semi-supervised drug embedding that incorporates two sources of
information: (1) underlying chemical grammar that is inferred from chemical
structures of drugs and drug-like molecules (unsupervised), and (2)
hierarchical relations that are encoded in an expert-crafted hierarchy of
approved drugs (supervised). We use the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)
framework to encode the chemical structures of molecules and use the drug-drug
similarity information obtained from the hierarchy to induce the clustering of
drugs in hyperbolic space. The hyperbolic space is amenable for encoding
hierarchical relations. Our qualitative results support that the learned drug
embedding can induce the hierarchical relations among drugs. We demonstrate
that the learned drug embedding can be used for drug repositioning.

Many complex systems display (multi-)fractal behavior, correlated fluctuations
and power laws. Whether the power-grid frequency, an indicator about the
balance on supply and demand in the electricity grid, also displays such
complexity remains a mostly open question. Within the present article, we
utilize highly resolved measurements to quantify the properties of the
power-grid frequency. We show that below 1 second, the dynamics may
fundamentally change, including a suddenly increasing power spectral density,
emergence of multifractality and a change of correlation behavior. We provide a
simplified stochastic model involving positively correlated noise to reproduce
the observed dynamics, possibly linked to frequency dependent loads. Finally,
we stress the need for high-quality measurements and discuss how we obtained
the data analyzed here.

  contact excitation and detection method","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lead Zirconate Titanate [(ZrxTi1-x)O3 ]is used to make ultrasound
transducers, sensors, and actuators due to its large piezoelectric coefficient.
Several surfaces and subsurface micro defects develop within the Lead Zirconate
Titanate (PZT) sensor due to delamination, corrosion, huge temperature
fluctuation, etc., causing a decline in its performance. It is thus necessary
to identify, locate, and quantify the defects. Non-Destructive Structural
Health Monitoring (SHM) is the most optimal and economical method of
evaluation. Traditional ultrasound SHM techniques have a huge impedance
mismatch between air and any solid material. And most of the popular signal
processing methods define time-series signals in only one domain which gives
sub-optimal results. Thus to improve the accuracy of detection point contact
excitation and detection methods have been implemented to determine the
interaction of ultrasonic waves with microscale defects in the PZT. And Haar
Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) is applied to the time series data
obtained from the Coulomb coupling setup. Using the above process, defect up to
100 um in diameter could be successfully distinguished and localized.

  Hypersonic Aerothermoelastic Analysis",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents a novel physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM)
methodology for efficient and accurate modeling of non-linear dynamical
systems. The PIROM consists of a physics-based analytical component that
represents the known physical processes, and a data-driven dynamical component
that represents the unknown physical processes. The PIROM is applied to the
aerothermal load modeling for hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE) analysis and
is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two-three orders of magnitude
while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on
computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Moreover, the PIROM-based solver is
benchmarked against the conventional POD-kriging surrogate model, and is found
to significantly outperform the accuracy, generalizability and sampling
efficiency of the latter in a wide range of operating conditions and in the
presence of complex structural boundary conditions. Finally, the PIROM-based
ATE solver is demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary
conditions and rib-supports on the ATE response of a compliant and
heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the dramatic
snap-through behavior with respect to spring constraints of boundary
conditions, but also demonstrates the potential of PIROM to facilitate the
rapid and accurate design and optimization of multi-disciplinary systems such
as hypersonic structures.

positions within them. While we cannot enumerate the number of magic triangles
at larger sizes, we offer a simulated annealing method for finding magic
