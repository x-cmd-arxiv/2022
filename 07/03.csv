variety of tasks, their ever-increasing size also imposes significant overhead
on deployment. To compress these models, knowledge distillation was proposed to
transfer knowledge from a cumbersome (teacher) network into a lightweight
(student) network. However, guidance from a teacher does not always improve the
generalization of students, especially when the size gap between student and
teacher is large. Previous works argued that it was due to the high certainty
of the teacher, resulting in harder labels that were difficult to fit. To
soften these labels, we present a pruning method termed Prediction Uncertainty
Enlargement (PrUE) to simplify the teacher. Specifically, our method aims to
decrease the teacher's certainty about data, thereby generating soft
predictions for students. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the
proposed method with experiments on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet.
Results indicate that student networks trained with sparse teachers achieve
better performance. Besides, our method allows researchers to distill knowledge
from deeper networks to improve students further. Our code is made public at:

equipment such as robots. Defect inspection of these components is an efficient

Net, for industrial defect inspection of rails, insulators, commutators etc.
SSD-Faster Net is a two-stage network, including SSD for quickly locating

former, we propose a novel slice localization mechanism to help SSD scan
quickly. The second stage is based on improved Faster R-CNN, using FPN,
deformable kernel(DK) to enhance representation ability. It fuses multi-scale
information, and self-adapts the receptive field. We also propose a novel loss
function and use ROI Align to improve accuracy. Experiments show that our
SSD-Faster Net achieves an average accuracy of 84.03%, which is 13.42% higher
than the nearest competitor based on Faster R-CNN, 4.14% better than GAN-based

computing speed is improved by nearly 7%, which proves its robustness and

providing an easy and flexible way to connect different services that form a

application traffic, they can substantially increase application latency and
resource consumption. We develop a decompositional approach and a tool, called
MeshInsight, to systematically characterize the overhead of service meshes and
to help developers quantify overhead in deployment scenarios of interest. Using
MeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead -- up to
185% higher latency and up to 92% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark
applications -- but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured
and the application workload. The primary contributors to overhead vary based
on the configuration too. IPC (inter-process communication) and socket writes
dominate when the service mesh operates as a TCP proxy, but protocol parsing
dominates when it operates as an HTTP proxy. MeshInsight also enables us to
study the end-to-end impact of optimizations to service meshes. We show that
not all seemingly-promising optimizations lead to a notable overhead reduction
in realistic settings.

  coefficient",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The current study uses numerical approaches to investigate the effect of
droplet deformation and internal circulation on droplet dynamics. Although
droplet drag is a classical area of study, there are still theoretical gaps in
understanding the motion of large droplets. In applications like spray
combustion, droplets of various sizes are generated and move with the flow.
Large droplets tend to deform in the flow, and have complex interactions with
the flow because of this deformation. To better model spray, the physical
understanding of droplets need to be improved. Under spray conditions, droplets
are subjected to a high temperature and pressure environment, and the coupling
between liquid and gas is enhanced. Therefore, the deformation and internal
circulation will affect droplet drag coefficient more significantly than in
atmospheric conditions. To study the mechanism on how droplet shape and
internal circulation influence droplet dynamics, we will use direct numerical
simulation (DNS) to simulate a droplet falling at its terminal velocity in high
pressure air. An in-house code developed for interface-capturing DNS of
multiphase flows will be employed for the simulation. The drag coefficient is
calculated, and the results are consistent with existing literature for
slightly deformed droplets. The results show that the drag coefficient is
directly related to the droplet deformation and droplet internal circulation.
The paper also develops a theory to account the effect of Weber number and
liquid/gas properties in droplet deformation.

local data distributed among a set of participating workers. This makes it
possible i) to train more accurate models due to learning from rich joint
training data, and ii) to improve privacy by not sharing the workers' local
private data with others. However, the distributed nature of FL makes it
vulnerable to targeted poisoning attacks that negatively impact the integrity
of the learned model while, unfortunately, being difficult to detect. Existing
defenses against those attacks are limited by assumptions on the workers' data
distribution, may degrade the global model performance on the main task and/or
are ill-suited to high-dimensional models. In this paper, we analyze targeted
attacks against FL and find that the neurons in the last layer of a deep
learning (DL) model that are related to the attacks exhibit a different
behavior from the unrelated neurons, making the last-layer gradients valuable
features for attack detection. Accordingly, we propose \textit{FL-Defender} as
a method to combat FL targeted attacks. It consists of i) engineering more
robust discriminative features by calculating the worker-wise angle similarity
for the workers' last-layer gradients, ii) compressing the resulting similarity
vectors using PCA to reduce redundant information, and iii) re-weighting the
workers' updates based on their deviation from the centroid of the compressed
similarity vectors. Experiments on three data sets with different DL model
sizes and data distributions show the effectiveness of our method at defending
against label-flipping and backdoor attacks. Compared to several
state-of-the-art defenses, FL-Defender achieves the lowest attack success
rates, maintains the performance of the global model on the main task and
causes minimal computational overhead on the server.

lies in connecting the Hopf cycles with the canard cycles, since these are
described in different scalings. As in $\mathbb R^2$ we use blowup to overcome
this, but we also have to compensate for the lack of uniformity near the Hopf,
due to its singular nature; it is a zero-Hopf in the limit $\epsilon=0$. In the

obtain $\mu=2.839^{+0.117}_{-0.193}$ within the $1\sigma$ confidence level
providing a non-standard cosmic acceleration at late times; consequently, the
Universe would be older than the standard estimations. Additionally, we present
a stability analysis for different $\mu$ values. This analysis identifies a
late-time attractor corresponding to a power-law decelerated solution for $\mu
< 2$. Moreover, a non-relativistic critical point exists for $\mu > 1$ and a
sink for $\mu > 2$. This solution is a decelerated power-law if $1 < \mu < 2$
and an accelerated power-law solution if $\mu > 2$, consistent with the mean
values obtained from the observational analysis. Therefore, for both flat FLRW

acceleration under this paradigm without introducing a dark energy component.

  Calibration","19 pages, 17 figures, ACM Multimedia 2022 Accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the booming video era, video segmentation attracts increasing research
attention in the multimedia community. Semi-supervised video object
segmentation (VOS) aims at segmenting objects in all target frames of a video,
given annotated object masks of reference frames. Most existing methods build
pixel-wise reference-target correlations and then perform pixel-wise tracking
to obtain target masks. Due to neglecting object-level cues, pixel-level
approaches make the tracking vulnerable to perturbations, and even
indiscriminate among similar objects. Towards robust VOS, the key insight is to
calibrate the representation and mask of each specific object to be expressive
and discriminative. Accordingly, we propose a new deep network, which can
adaptively construct object representations and calibrate object masks to
achieve stronger robustness. First, we construct the object representations by
applying an adaptive object proxy (AOP) aggregation method, where the proxies
represent arbitrary-shaped segments at multi-levels for reference. Then,
prototype masks are initially generated from the reference-target correlations
based on AOP. Afterwards, such proto-masks are further calibrated through
network modulation, conditioning on the object proxy representations. We
consolidate this conditional mask calibration process in a progressive manner,
where the object representations and proto-masks evolve to be discriminative
iteratively. Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard VOS
benchmarks, YouTube-VOS-18/19 and DAVIS-17. Our model achieves the
state-of-the-art performance among existing published works, and also exhibits
superior robustness against perturbations. Our project repo is at

instrumental in obtaining such a scaling. In this paper, we have shown that
even when considering time-dependent interactions between dark energy and dark

from conservation of energy, assuming that the system to be non-ergodic at
large length scales and relying on averaging in both space and time to
homogenize the behavior. Explicit criteria are obtained to define stationary
conditions: (1) there can be no net change for extensive measures of the system
state over the time averaging interval; (2) the net energy inputs into the
system are zero, meaning that the net rate of work done on the system must
balance with the heat removed; and (3) there is no net work performed due to
the contribution of internal energy fluctuations. Results are then evaluated
based on direct numerical simulation. Dynamic connectivity is observed during
steady-state flow, which is quantitatively assessed based the Euler
characteristic. We show that even during steady-state flow at low capillary
number ($\mathsf{Ca}\sim1\times10^5$), typical flow processes will explore
multiple connectivity states. The residence time for each connectivity state is
captured based on the time-and-space average. The distribution for energy
fluctuations is shown to be multi-modal and non-Gaussian when terms are
considered independently. However, we demonstrate that their sum is zero. Given

bacterium and the stochasticity in transmembrane transport, intracellular ion
concentrations and hence the charge state of a bacterium are bound to
fluctuate. Here, we investigate the charge noise of 100s of non-motile bacteria
by combining electrical measurement techniques from condensed matter physics
with microfluidics. In our experiments, bacteria in a microchannel generate
charge density fluctuations in the embedding electrolyte due to random influx
and efflux of ions. Detected as electrical resistance noise, these charge
density fluctuations display a power spectral density proportional to $1/f^2$
for frequencies $0.05~{\rm Hz} \leq f \leq 1 ~{\rm Hz}$. Fits to a simple noise
model suggest that the steady-state charge of a bacterium fluctuates by $\pm

that bacterial ion homeostasis is highly dynamic and dominated by strong charge

that the predictions possess the targeted properties. In summary, by tuning AI

sparse entries and offset sub and super-diagonals as well algorithms for its
[pseudo]inverse and determinant calculations. Traditional algorithms for matrix
calculations, specifically inversion and determinant, of these forms are not
efficient specially for large matrices, e.g. larger datasets or deeper
networks. A decomposition for lower triangular matrices is developed and the
original matrix is factorized into a set of matrices where their inverse
matrices are calculated. For the cases where the matrix inverse does not exist,
a least square type pseudoinverse is provided. The present method is a direct
routine, i.e., executes in a predictable number of operations which is tested
for randomly generated matrices with varying size. The results show significant
improvement in computational costs specially when the size of matrix increases.

rooted in the deep nature of physical systems. Scaling relation is a typical
universality for critical phenomena around a quantum phase transition, while
topological classification provides another type of universality essentially
different from the critical universality. Both classes of universalities can be
present in a single-qubit system with light-matter interactions, as exhibiting
generally in the fundamental quantum Rabi model with anisotropy not only for
linear coupling but also for nonlinear Stark coupling (NSC). In low frequencies
different levels of scaling relations are demonstrated, holding for anisotropic
or/and NSCs, locally or globally. At finite frequencies such a critical
universality breaks down and diversity is dominant. However, common topological
feature of the ground state can be extracted from the node number, which yields
a topological class of universality amidst the critical diversity. Both
conventional and unconventional topological transitions emerge, with their
meeting, which never occurs in linear interaction, enabled by the nonlinear
coupling to form topological quadruple points which are found to be
spin-invariant points. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the NSC can be
another approach to manipulate topological transitions in addition to coupling
anisotropy.

to the starting point often reduces the mean completion time of the process.
Although many different resetting models have been studied over the past ten
years, only a few can be physically implemented. Here we study theoretically a
protocol that can be realised experimentally and which exhibits unusual
optimization properties. A Brownian particle is subject to an arbitrary
confining potential $v(x)$ which is switched on and off intermittently at fixed
rates. Motion is constrained between an absorbing wall located at the origin
and a reflective wall. When the walls are sufficiently far apart, the interplay
between free diffusion during the ""off"" phases and attraction toward the
potential minimum during the ""on"" phases gives rise to rich behaviours, not
observed in ideal resetting models. For potentials of the form
$v(x)=k|x-x_0|^n/n$, with $n>0$, the switch-on and switch-off rates that
minimise the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the origin undergo a continuous
phase transition as the potential stiffness $k$ is varied. When $k$ is above a
critical value $k_c$, potential intermittency enhances target encounter: the
minimal MFPT is lower than the Kramer's time and is attained for a
non-vanishing pair of switching rates. We focus on the harmonic case $n=2$,
extending previous results for the piecewise linear potential ($n=1$) in
unbounded domains. We also study the non-equilibrium stationary states emerging
in this process.

Beam Alignment (BA) is necessary for large antenna arrays to achieve large

challenging due to time-varying and multipath effects. In this paper, we
formulate the beam alignment problem as a non-stationary online learning
problem with the objective to maximize the received signal strength under
interference constraint. In particular, we employ the non-stationary kernelized
bandit to leverage the correlation among beams and model the complex
beamforming and multipath channel functions. Furthermore, to mitigate
interference to other user equipment, we leverage the primal-dual method to
design a constrained UCB-type kernelized bandit algorithm. Our theoretical
analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm can adaptively adjust the beam
in time-varying environments, such that both the cumulative regret of the
received signal and constraint violations have sublinear bounds with respect to
time. This result is of independent interest for applications such as adaptive
pricing and news ranking. In addition, the algorithm assumes the channel is a
black-box function and does not require any prior knowledge for dynamic channel
modeling, and thus is applicable in a variety of scenarios. We further show
that if the information about the channel variation is known, the algorithm
will have better theoretical guarantees and performance. Finally, we conduct
simulations to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

larger amounts of estimation errors. The drift reducing neural network
identifies such errors based on the motion of features in the successive camera

fabric manipulation, in which successful sim2real transfer is especially
challenging due to the difficulties of precisely modeling the dynamics and

strings that encode time series data, with applications to areas including
bioinformatics, signature verification, and speech recognition. The standard
dynamic-programming algorithm for DTW takes $O(n^2)$ time, and there are
conditional lower bounds showing that no algorithm can do substantially better.
  In many applications, however, the strings $x$ and $y$ may contain long runs
of repeated letters, meaning that they can be compressed using run-length
encoding. A natural question is whether the DTW-distance between these
compressed strings can be computed efficiently in terms of the lengths $k$ and
$\ell$ of the compressed strings. Recent work has shown how to achieve
$O(k\ell^2 + \ell k^2)$ time, leaving open the question of whether a
near-quadratic $\tilde{O}(k\ell)$-time algorithm might exist.
  We show that, if a small approximation loss is permitted, then a
near-quadratic time algorithm is indeed possible: our algorithm computes a $(1

time, where $k$ and $\ell$ are the number of runs in $x$ and $y$. Our algorithm
allows for $DTW$ to be computed over any metric space $(\Sigma, \delta)$ in
which distances are $O(log(n))$-bit integers. Surprisingly, the algorithm also
works even if $\delta$ does not induce a metric space on $\Sigma$ (e.g.,
$\delta$ need not satisfy the triangle inequality).

When $b\in[e^{-e},e^{1/e}]$, $a<1<b$, or $a=0$, the power tower converges
almost surely. When $b<e^{-e}$, we define a special function $G$ such that
almost sure convergence is equivalent to $a<G(b)$. Only in the case when $a=1$

convergence. We show a rather complicated necessary and sufficient condition
for convergence when $a=1$ and $b$ is finite.
  We also briefly discuss the relationship between the distribution of $A_1$

multivariate response and multiple predictors, and is widely used in biology,
chemometrics, econometrics, engineering, and other fields. In the reduced-rank
regression modelling, a central objective is to estimate the rank of the
coefficient matrix that represents the number of effective latent factors in
predicting the multivariate response. Although theoretical results such as rank
estimation consistency have been established for various methods, in practice
rank determination still relies on information criterion based methods such as
AIC and BIC or subsampling based methods such as cross validation.
Unfortunately, the theoretical properties of these practical methods are
largely unknown. In this paper, we present a novel method called StARS-RRR that
selects the tuning parameter and then estimates the rank of the coefficient
matrix for reduced-rank regression based on the stability approach. We prove
that StARS-RRR achieves rank estimation consistency, i.e., the rank estimated
with the tuning parameter selected by StARS-RRR is consistent to the true rank.
Through a simulation study, we show that StARS-RRR outperforms other tuning
parameter selection methods including AIC, BIC, and cross validation as it
provides the most accurate estimated rank. In addition, when applied to a
breast cancer dataset, StARS-RRR discovers a reasonable number of genetic
pathways that affect the DNA copy number variations and results in a smaller
prediction error than the other methods with a random-splitting process.

the role of emotion in social decision-making. Here we examine an understudied
aspect of emotion in such games: how an individual's feelings are shaped by
their partner's expressions. Prior research has tended to focus on other
aspects of emotion. Research on felt-emotion has focused on how an individual's
feelings shape how they treat their partner, or whether these feelings are
authentically expressed. Research on expressed-emotion has focused on how an
individual's decisions are shaped by their partner's expressions, without
regard for whether these expressions actually evoke feelings. Here, we use
computer-generated characters to examine how an individual's moment-to-moment
feelings are shaped by (1) how they are treated by their partner and (2) what
their partner expresses during this treatment. Surprisingly, we find that
partner expressions are far more important than actions in determining
self-reported feelings. In other words, our partner can behave in a selfish and
exploitive way, but if they show a collaborative pattern of expressions, we
will feel greater pleasure collaborating with them. These results also
emphasize the importance of context in determining how someone will feel in
response to an expression (i.e., knowing a partner is happy is insufficient; we
must know what they are happy-at). We discuss the implications of this work for
cognitive-system design, emotion theory, and methodological practice in
affective computing.

vast works have been done, controlling the false discoveries remains a
challenging task when the corresponding test statistics are dependent. Various
methods have been proposed to estimate the false discovery proportion (FDP)
under arbitrary dependence among the test statistics. One of the main ideas is
to reduce arbitrary dependence to weak dependence and then to establish
theoretically the strong consistency of the FDP and false discovery rate (FDR)
under weak dependence. As a consequence, FDPs share the same asymptotic limit
in the framework of weak dependence. We observe that the asymptotic variance of
the FDP, however, may rely heavily on the dependence structure of the
corresponding test statistics even when they are only weakly dependent; and it
is of great practical value to quantify this variability, as it can serve as an
indicator of the quality of the FDP estimate from the given data. As far as we
are aware, the research on this respect is still limited in the literature. In
this paper, we first derive the asymptotic expansion of FDP under mild
regularity conditions and then examine how the asymptotic variance of FDP
varies under different dependence structures both theoretically and
numerically. With the observations in this study, we recommend that in a
multiple testing performed by an FDP procedure, we may report both the mean and
the variance estimates of FDP to enrich the study outcome.

fully dynamic setting, where both edge insertion and deletions are allowed,
Gupta and Peng (see \cite{GP13}) gave an algorithm for this problem with an
update time of $O(\sqrt{m}/\epsilon^2)$.
  Motivated by the fact that the $O_{\epsilon}(\sqrt{m})$ barrier is hard to
overcome (see Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai, and Saranurak [HKNS15]);
Kopelowitz, Pettie, and Porat [KPP16]), we study this problem in the
\emph{decremental} model, where the adversary is only allowed to delete edges.
Recently, Bernstein, Probst-Gutenberg, and Saranurak (see [BPT20]) gave an

giving an $O_{\epsilon}(1)$ update time algorithm that maintains a

proposes a temporal super-resolution network(TSRNet). The data is reconstructed
into a dense feature sequence to reduce the overall model computation while
keeping the final recognition accuracy loss to a minimum. The continuous sign
language recognition model(CSLR) via TSRNet mainly consists of three parts:
frame-level feature extraction, time series feature extraction and TSRNet,
where TSRNet is located between frame-level feature extraction and time-series
feature extraction, which mainly includes two branches: detail descriptor and
rough descriptor. The sparse frame-level features are fused through the
features obtained by the two designed branches as the reconstructed dense
frame-level feature sequence, and the connectionist temporal
classification(CTC) loss is used for training and optimization after the
time-series feature extraction part. To better recover semantic-level
information, the overall model is trained with the self-generating adversarial
training method proposed in this paper to reduce the model error rate. The
training method regards the TSRNet as the generator, and the frame-level
processing part and the temporal processing part as the discriminator. In
addition, in order to unify the evaluation criteria of model accuracy loss
under different benchmarks, this paper proposes word error rate
deviation(WERD), which takes the error rate between the estimated word error
rate (WER) and the reference WER obtained by the reconstructed frame-level
feature sequence and the complete original frame-level feature sequence as the
WERD. Experiments on two large-scale sign language datasets demonstrate the

a low-resolution (LR) image, which is usually degraded by down-sampling blur
kernels and additive noises. This task is extremely difficult due to the
challenges of complicated image degradations in the real-world. Existing SR
approaches either assume a predefined blur kernel or a fixed noise, which
limits these approaches in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose a
Degradation-guided Meta-restoration network for blind Super-Resolution (DMSR)
that facilitates image restoration for real cases. DMSR consists of a
degradation extractor and meta-restoration modules. The extractor estimates the
degradations in LR inputs and guides the meta-restoration modules to predict
restoration parameters for different degradations on-the-fly. DMSR is jointly
optimized by a novel degradation consistency loss and reconstruction losses.
Through such an optimization, DMSR outperforms SOTA by a large margin on three
widely-used benchmarks. A user study including 16 subjects further validates
the superiority of DMSR in real-world blind SR tasks.

Existing systems, such as blockchains and certificate transparency, are based
on transparency logs -- a simple abstraction allowing users to verify that a
log maintained by an untrusted server is append-only. They expose a simple
key-value interface. Building a practical database from transparency logs, on
the other hand, remains a challenge.
  In this paper, we explore the design space of verifiable ledger databases
along three dimensions: abstraction, threat model, and performance. We survey
existing systems and identify their two limitations, namely, the lack of
transaction support and the inferior efficiency. We then present GlassDB, a
distributed database that addresses these limitations under a practical threat
model. GlassDB inherits the verifiability of transparency logs, but supports
transactions and offers high performance. It extends a ledger-like key-value
store with a data structure for efficient proofs, and adds a concurrency
control mechanism for transactions. GlassDB batches independent operations from
concurrent transactions when updating the core data structures. In addition, we
design a new benchmark for evaluating verifiable ledger databases, by extending
YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks. Using this benchmark, we compare GlassDB against
four baselines: reimplemented versions of three verifiable databases, and a
verifiable map backed by a transparency log. Experimental results demonstrate
that GlassDB is an efficient, transactional, and verifiable ledger database.

two orthogonal linear polarizers on each half of the DHPSF phase mask and then

this stepsize ratio suggests a slow training of the min player, practical GAN
algorithms typically adopt similar stepsizes for both variables, indicating a

Since the manual inspection of wafer defects is costly, an automated artificial

previous works on defect analysis have several limitations, such as low
accuracy and the need for separate models for classification and segmentation.
For analyzing mixed-type defects, some previous works require separately
training one model for each defect type, which is non-scalable. In this paper,
we present WaferSegClassNet (WSCN), a novel network based on encoder-decoder
architecture. WSCN performs simultaneous classification and segmentation of
both single and mixed-type wafer defects. WSCN uses a ""shared encoder"" for
classification, and segmentation, which allows training WSCN end-to-end. We use
N-pair contrastive loss to first pretrain the encoder and then use BCE-Dice
loss for segmentation, and categorical cross-entropy loss for classification.
Use of N-pair contrastive loss helps in better embedding representation in the
latent dimension of wafer maps. WSCN has a model size of only 0.51MB and
performs only 0.2M FLOPS. Thus, it is much lighter than other state-of-the-art
models. Also, it requires only 150 epochs for convergence, compared to 4,000
epochs needed by a previous work. We evaluate our model on the MixedWM38
dataset, which has 38,015 images. WSCN achieves an average classification
accuracy of 98.2% and a dice coefficient of 0.9999. We are the first to show
segmentation results on the MixedWM38 dataset. The source code can be obtained

and other potential forming defects, of which the mechanism analysis is
difficult to deal with. At the same time, the existing methods are mainly
conducted in offline space, ignoring the real-time information in the physical
world, which is unreliable and inefficient. To address this issue, a
digital-twin-enhanced (DT-enhanced) metal tube bending forming real-time
prediction method based on multi-source-input multi-task learning (MTL) is
proposed. The new method can achieve comprehensive MTBF real-time prediction.
By sharing the common feature of the multi-close domain and adopting group
regularization strategy on feature sharing and accepting layers, the accuracy
and efficiency of the multi-source-input MTL can be guaranteed. Enhanced by DT,
the physical real-time deformation data is aligned in the image dimension by an
improved Grammy Angle Field (GAF) conversion, realizing the reflection of the
actual processing. Different from the traditional offline prediction methods,
the new method integrates the virtual and physical data to achieve a more
efficient and accurate real-time prediction result. and the DT mapping
connection between virtual and physical systems can be achieved. To exclude the
effects of equipment errors, the effectiveness of the proposed method is
verified on the physical experiment-verified FE simulation scenarios. At the
same time, the common pre-training networks are compared with the proposed
method. The results show that the proposed DT-enhanced prediction method is
more accurate and efficient.

estimate of entropy of their probability distributions over the state space.
This is difficult because unsampled states can contribute substantially to the
entropy, while they do not contribute to the Maximum Likelihood estimator of
entropy, which replaces probabilities by the observed frequencies. Bayesian
estimators overcome this obstacle by introducing a model of the low-probability
tail of the probability distribution. Which statistical features of the
observed data determine the model of the tail, and hence the output of such
estimators, remains unclear. Here we show that well-known entropy estimators
for probability distributions on discrete state spaces model the structure of
the low probability tail based largely on few statistics of the data: the
sample size, the Maximum Likelihood estimate, the number of coincidences among
the samples, the dispersion of the coincidences. We derive approximate
analytical entropy estimators for undersampled distributions based on these
statistics, and we use the results to propose an intuitive understanding of how
the Bayesian entropy estimators work.

feed-forwards the features of low-light images from the generator of

learned information of real low-light images, dGAN can synthesize more
realistic diverse illumination and contrast in low-light images. Moreover, the

to obtain multi-view data, and then offload the quantized version of extracted
features to a centralized edge server, which conducts model inference based on
the cascaded feature vectors. Under this setup and by considering
classification tasks, we measure the inference accuracy by adopting an
approximate but tractable metric, namely discriminant gain, which is defined as
the distance of two classes in the Euclidean feature space under normalized
covariance. To maximize the discriminant gain, we first quantify the influence
of the sensing, computation, and communication processes on it with a derived
closed-form expression. Then, an end-to-end task-oriented resource management

This integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) design approach,
however, leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem, due to the
complicated form of discriminant gain and the device heterogeneity in terms of
channel gain, quantization level, and generated feature subsets. Remarkably,
the considered non-convex problem can be optimally solved based on the
sum-of-ratios method. This gives the optimal ISCC scheme, that jointly
determines the transmit power and time allocation at multiple devices for

computation distortion control. By using human motions recognition as a
concrete AI inference task, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the

benefits of geometry-aware generative approaches and normal-assisted physical
face models. In a nutshell, NARRATE first inverts the input portrait to a
coarse geometry and employs neural rendering to generate images resembling the
input, as well as producing convincing pose changes. However, inversion step
introduces mismatch, bringing low-quality images with less facial details. As
such, we further estimate portrait normal to enhance the coarse geometry,
creating a high-fidelity physical face model. In particular, we fuse the neural
and physical renderings to compensate for the imperfect inversion, resulting in
both realistic and view-consistent novel perspective images. In relighting
stage, previous works focus on single view portrait relighting but ignoring
consistency between different perspectives as well, leading unstable and
inconsistent lighting effects for view changes. We extend Total Relighting to
fix this problem by unifying its multi-view input normal maps with the physical
face model. NARRATE conducts relighting with consistent normal maps, imposing
cross-view constraints and exhibiting stable and coherent illumination effects.

reliable results over prior works. We further bridge NARRATE with animation and
style transfer tools, supporting pose change, light change, facial animation,

great research interest in the science community. In particular, several
methods such as SPIEC-EASI, gCoda, and CD-trace have been proposed to model the
conditional dependency between microbial taxa, in order to eliminate the
detection of spurious correlations. However, all those methods are built upon
the central log-ratio (CLR) transformation, which results in a degenerate
covariance matrix and thus an undefined inverse covariance matrix as the
estimation of the underlying network. Jiang et al. (2021) and Tian et al.
(2022) proposed bias-corrected graphical lasso and compositional graphical
lasso based on the additive log-ratio (ALR) transformation, which first selects
a reference taxon and then computes the log ratios of the abundances of all the

underlying role that microorganisms play in the host or environment and to
identifying microorganisms as an agent that can potentially alter the host or

associate with parasitic infection can help resolve potential drug or
diagnostic test for parasitic infection. To unravel the microbial interactions,
existing tools often rely on graphical models to infer the conditional
dependence of microbial abundances to represent their interactions. However,
current methods do not simultaneously account for the discreteness,
compositionality, and heterogeneity inherent to microbiome data. Thus, we build
a new approach called ""compositional graphical lasso"" upon existing tools by
incorporating the above characteristics into the graphical model explicitly. We
illustrate the advantage of compositional graphical lasso over current methods
under a variety of simulation scenarios and on a benchmark study, the Tara
Oceans Project. Moreover, we present our results from the analysis of a dataset
from the Zebrafish Parasite Infection Study. Our approach identifies changes in
interaction degree between infected and uninfected individuals for three taxa,
Photobacterium, Gemmobacter, and Paucibacter, which are inversely predicted by
other methods. Further investigation of these method-specific taxa interaction
changes reveals their biological plausibility. In particular, we speculate on
the potential pathobiotic roles of Photobacterium and Gemmobacter in the
zebrafish gut, and the potential probiotic role of Paucibacter. Collectively,
our analyses demonstrate that compositional graphical lasso provides a powerful

allow, with a high level of automation, to carry out short-term and medium-term

the proposed methods can be used to predict the values of the parameters of a
large complex system with the aim of monitoring its state, when the number of

the absence of requirements for time series stationarity and a small number of

we first propose a mechanism based on graph isomorphism, which has the merit of
efficiently generating a factorial of $\boldsymbol n$ (i.e., $\boldsymbol n!$)

GIAug can be flexibly utilized by various existing performance predictors-based

Specifically, we introduce a self-attention-based module on the received latent

hybrid segment-level and frame-level frequency-domain discriminator is employed
to guide the network to focus on both the generative quality of lost frames and
the continuity with neighbouring frames. Experimental results on several error
patterns show that the proposed scheme can achieve better robustness compared
with the corresponding error-free and error-resilient baselines. We also show
that feature-domain concealment is superior to waveform-domain counterpart as
post-processing.

initial state of the ${{\textrm{SU}(3)}}$ Hubbard model, not only mesons
(doublons) but also baryons (trions) are naturally generated during the time
evolution. In the strongly interacting limit, baryons become heavy and attract
each other strongly, and their residual interaction with mesons generates meson
diffusion, as captured by the evolution of the equal time density correlation
function. Hadrons remain present in the long time limit, while the system
thermalizes to a negative temperature state. Our conclusions extend to a large

and calculate in detail the post-Keplerian (PK) effects (periastron advance,
Einstein delay, Shapiro delay, orbital period decay and eccentricity decay) of
binary orbit. The differences in PK effects between general relativity (GR) and
chameleon $f(R)$ are elegantly quantified by a combination of star's
compactness and theory parameter. We use the mass-radius relation to break the
degeneracy between these two parameters, thus allowing us to constrain the
theory. We simulate the temporal evolution of the orbital period and
eccentricity of neutron star (NS) - white dwarf (WD) binaries, and the results
indicate that the orbital evolution is typically faster than in GR due to the
emission of dipole radiation in chameleon $f(R)$. We use the observables of PK
parameters from the three NS-WD binary pulsars to place constraints on
chameleon $f(R)$ and possible deviations from GR by performing Monte-Carlo
simulations. We find that PSR J1738$+$0333 is the most constraining test of

in this study: a disk (OS1), a square (OS2), two rectangles with aspect ratio >
1 (OS3) and < 1 (OS4) respectively, and an equilateral triangle (OS5). The
vertical velocity of the oscillating object was observed to be a function of
amplitude and frequency (f) (inverse of time period (T)) of oscillation, and
the shape of the object. The dynamics of the motion are modelled with the help
of a cavity based model which can empirically produce the regimes observed by
incorporating the free fall of the particles filling the cavity.The cavity
based model assumes that there is a point on the surface of each oscillating
object unique to its shape that any grain crossing it will irreversibly reach
the bottom of the cavity. This leads to the creation of bed of particles at the
bottom of the cavity which increases intruder's elevation as it oscillates,
leading to its vertical rise in the granular medium. When an intruder
oscillates much faster than the falling rate of the grains, the intruder cannot
rise up and thus sinks due to energy provided by the oscillation to the bottom
layer. On the contrary, if the intruder oscillates too slow, the cavity gets
completely filled much before it returns. The maximum rise rate is thus
observed at the oscillation time period where the cavity filling time is equal
to the half time period of oscillation. In addition, we observed a minimum
amplitude (Amin) below which the vertical position of the IO remains unaltered
for various T. We have also presented the time-averaged pressure P, velocity V,

  Intelligence in Medicine, Elsevier",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The use of 3D cameras for gait analysis has been highly questioned due to the
low accuracy they have demonstrated in the past. The objective of the study
presented in this paper is to improve the accuracy of the estimations made by
robot-mounted 3D cameras in human gait analysis by applying a supervised
learning stage. The 3D camera was mounted in a mobile robot to obtain a longer
walking distance. This study shows an improvement in detection of kinematic
gait signals and gait descriptors by post-processing the raw estimations of the
camera using artificial neural networks trained with the data obtained from a
certified Vicon system. To achieve this, 37 healthy participants were recruited
and data of 207 gait sequences were collected using an Orbbec Astra 3D camera.
There are two basic possible approaches for training: using kinematic gait
signals and using gait descriptors. The former seeks to improve the waveforms
of kinematic gait signals by reducing the error and increasing the correlation
with respect to the Vicon system. The second is a more direct approach,
focusing on training the artificial neural networks using gait descriptors
directly. The accuracy of the 3D camera was measured before and after training.
In both training approaches, an improvement was observed. Kinematic gait
signals showed lower errors and higher correlations with respect to the ground
truth. The accuracy of the system to detect gait descriptors also showed a
substantial improvement, mostly for kinematic descriptors rather than
spatio-temporal. When comparing both training approaches, it was not possible
to define which was the absolute best. Therefore, we believe that the selection
of the training approach will depend on the purpose of the study to be
conducted. This study reveals the great potential of 3D cameras and encourages
the research community to continue exploring their use in gait analysis.

exact results for the large-time behavior of sequences of (slowly varying)

Broglie-Bohm-Bell dynamics allows an arbitrary initial probability distribution
to relax to quantum equilibrium; i.e., there is no need to make the ad-hoc
assumption that the initial distribution of particle locations has to be
identical to the initial probability distribution prescribed by the system's
initial wave function. The results presented in this paper moreover suggest
that the intrinsically stochastic nature of Bell's formulation, which is
arguable most naturally formulated on an underlying discrete space-time, is
sufficient to ensure dynamical relaxation to quantum equilibrium for a large
class of quantum systems without the need to introduce coarse-graining or any
other modification in the formulation.

embeds information in neural activity. Recently, deep learning techniques have
facilitated attempts to address visual reconstructions by mapping brain
activity to image stimuli using generative adversarial networks (GANs).
However, none of these studies have considered the semantic meaning of latent
code in image space. Omitting semantic information could potentially limit the
performance. In this study, we propose a new framework to reconstruct facial
images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. With this
framework, the GAN inversion is first applied to train an image encoder to
extract latent codes in image space, which are then bridged to fMRI data using
linear transformation. Following the attributes identified from fMRI data using
an attribute classifier, the direction in which to manipulate attributes is
decided and the attribute manipulator adjusts the latent code to improve the
consistency between the seen image and the reconstructed image. Our
experimental results suggest that the proposed framework accomplishes two
goals: (1) reconstructing clear facial images from fMRI data and (2)
maintaining the consistency of semantic characteristics.

these regions correspond to the fluid, hexatic and solid phases, while in the

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.01145",,,,"cs.SE cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on
projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on
activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the
hackathon code. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of code used in and
created during hackathon events, with a particular focus on the code blobs,
specifically, how frequently hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much
new code they develop, if that code gets reused afterward, and what factors
affect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects
from DevPost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project characteristics,
original author, code creation time, language, and size information from World
of Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by identifying all commits
containing blobs created during hackathons and identifying all projects that
contain those commits. We also conducted a series of surveys in order to gain a
deeper understanding of hackathon code evolution that we sent out to hackathon
participants whose code was reused, whose code was not reused, and developers
who reused some hackathon code. Result: 9.14% of the code blobs in hackathon
repositories and 8% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during hackathons
and around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other projects by both
blob count and LOC. The number of associated technologies and the number of
participants in hackathons increase the reuse probability. Conclusion: The
results of our study demonstrate hackathons are not always ""one-off"" events as
common knowledge dictates and they can serve as a starting point for further
studies in this area.

can work with any machine learning model to design powerful test statistics. In
turn, the common practice in the model-X literature is to form a test statistic
using machine learning models, trained to maximize predictive accuracy with the

motion. This article focuses on the cover skeleton and addresses the
challenging problems of node design, system modeling, motor positioning, and
control design of the morphing system. The cover modeling focuses on
kinematics, and a systematic approach for defining the system kinematic
constraints is presented. Then, we apply genetic algorithms to find the motor
locations so that the morphing cover is fully actuated. Finally, we present
control algorithms that allow the cover to morph into a time-varying shape. The
entire approach is validated by performing kinematic simulations with four
different covers of square dimensions and having 3x3, 4x8, 8x8, and 20x20

The majority of existing works focus exclusively on the topology and ignore the

community search is further proposed to include the node's influence. Each node
has a weight, namely influence value, in the influential community search
problem to represent its network influence. The influence value of a community
is produced by an aggregated function, e.g., max, min, avg, and sum, over the
influence values of the nodes in the same community. The objective of the
influential community search problem is to locate the top-r communities with
the highest influence values while satisfying the topology constraints.
Existing studies on influential community search have several limitations: (i)
they focus exclusively on simple aggregation functions such as min, which may
fall short of certain requirements in many real-world scenarios, and (ii) they
impose no limitation on the size of the community, whereas most real-world
scenarios do. This motivates us to conduct a new study to fill this gap. We
consider the problem of identifying the top-r influential communities
with/without size constraints while using more complicated aggregation
functions such as sum or avg. We give a theoretical analysis demonstrating the

extended. It is also the key of the proof of the Gr\""obner Ring Conjecture in
the lexicographic order case, namely the fact that for any valuation domain
$\mathbf{R}$ of Krull dimension $\leq 1$, any $n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, and any
finitely generated ideal $I$ of $\mathbf{R}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$, the ideal
$\operatorname{LT}(I)$ generated by the leading terms of the elements of $I$
with respect to the lexicographic monomial order is finitely generated. Since
the ring $\mathbf{R}\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle$ can also be defined directly
as the localization of the multivariate polynomial ring
$\mathbf{R}[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ at polynomials whose leading coefficients according
to the lexicographic monomial order with $X_1<X_2<\cdots<X_n$ is $1$, we
propose to generalize the fact that $\mathbf{R}\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle$
is a B\'ezout domain of Krull dimension $\leq 1$ if so is $\mathbf{R}$ to any
rational monomial order, bolstering the evidence for the Gr\""obner Ring

algorithms that can continually learn a sequence of new tasks from a few

causes the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing researches
mainly utilize the image information, such as storing the image knowledge of
previous tasks or limiting classifiers updating. However, they ignore analyzing
the informative and less noisy text information of class labels. In this work,
we propose leveraging the label-text information by adopting the memory prompt.
The memory prompt can learn new data sequentially, and meanwhile store the
previous knowledge. Furthermore, to optimize the memory prompt without
undermining the stored knowledge, we propose a stimulation-based training
strategy. It optimizes the memory prompt depending on the image embedding
stimulation, which is the distribution of the image embedding elements.
Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all prior

  Cross-modal Learning for Conversational ASR","Accepted by Interspeech2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leveraging context information is an intuitive idea to improve performance on
conversational automatic speech recognition(ASR). Previous works usually adopt
recognized hypotheses of historical utterances as preceding context, which may
bias the current recognized hypothesis due to the inevitable
historicalrecognition errors. To avoid this problem, we propose an
audio-textual cross-modal representation extractor to learn contextual
representations directly from preceding speech. Specifically, it consists of
two modal-related encoders, extracting high-level latent features from speech
and the corresponding text, and a cross-modal encoder, which aims to learn the
correlation between speech and text. We randomly mask some input tokens and
input sequences of each modality. Then a token-missing or modal-missing
prediction with a modal-level CTC loss on the cross-modal encoder is performed.
Thus, the model captures not only the bi-directional context dependencies in a
specific modality but also relationships between different modalities. Then,
during the training of the conversational ASR system, the extractor will be
frozen to extract the textual representation of preceding speech, while such
representation is used as context fed to the ASR decoder through attention
mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on several
Mandarin conversation corpora and the highest character error rate (CER)
reduction up to 16% is achieved on the MagicData dataset.

hypergraphs. In such colourings, one assigns colours to all subsets of vertices
of cardinality $t$ such that in any hyperedge of cardinality at least $t$ there
is a uniquely coloured $t$-subset.
  The case $t=1$, i.e., vertex conflict-free colouring, is a well-studied
notion. Already the case $t=2$ (i.e., colouring pairs) seems to present a new
challenge. Many of the tools used for conflict-free colouring of geometric
hypergraphs rely on hereditary properties of the underlying hypergraphs. When
dealing with subsets of vertices, the properties do not pass to subfamilies of
subsets. Therefore, we develop new tools, which might be of independent
interest.
  (i) For any fixed $t$, we show that the $\binom n t$ $t$-subsets in any set
$P$ of $n$ points in the plane can be coloured with $O(t^2 \log^2 n)$ colours
so that any axis-parallel rectangle that contains at least $t$ points of $P$
also contains a uniquely coloured $t$-subset.
  (ii) For a wide class of ""well behaved"" geometrically defined hypergraphs, we
provide near tight upper bounds on their $t$-subset conflict-free chromatic

$H$, the hypergraph $H'$ obtained by taking union of two hyperedges from $H$,
admits a $2$-subset conflict-free colouring with roughly the same number of
colours as $H$. For example, we show that the $\binom n 2$ pairs of points in

such that for any two discs $d_1,d_2$ in the plane with $|(d_1\cup d_2)\cap
P|\geq 2$ there is a uniquely (in $d_1 \cup d_2$) coloured pair.

FE${}^\text{ANN}$ which is based on two main keystones: the usage of
physics-constrained artificial neural networks (ANNs) as macroscopic surrogate
models and an autonomous data mining process. Our approach allows the efficient
simulation of materials with complex underlying microstructures which reveal an
overall anisotropic and nonlinear behavior on the macroscale. Thereby, we
restrict ourselves to finite strain hyperelasticity problems for now. By using
a set of problem specific invariants as the input of the ANN and the Helmholtz
free energy density as the output, several physical principles, e.g.,
objectivity, material symmetry, compatibility with the balance of angular
momentum and thermodynamic consistency are fulfilled a priori. The necessary
data for the training of the ANN-based surrogate model, i.e., macroscopic
deformations and corresponding stresses, are collected via computational
homogenization of representative volume elements (RVEs). Thereby, the core
feature of the approach is given by a completely autonomous mining of the
required data set within an overall loop. In each iteration of the loop, new
data are generated by gathering the macroscopic deformation states from the
macroscopic finite element (FE) simulation and a subsequently sorting by using
the anisotropy class of the considered material. Finally, all unknown
deformations are prescribed in the RVE simulation to get the corresponding
stresses and thus to extend the data set. The proposed framework consequently
allows to reduce the number of time-consuming microscale simulations to a
minimum. It is exemplarily applied to several descriptive examples, where a
fiber reinforced composite with a highly nonlinear Ogden-type behavior of the
individual components is considered.

  Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Machine learning models are often brittle on production data despite
achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets. Benchmark datasets have
traditionally served dual purposes: first, benchmarks offer a standard on which
machine learning researchers can compare different methods, and second,
benchmarks provide a model, albeit imperfect, of the real world. The
incompleteness of test benchmarks (and the data upon which models are trained)
hinder robustness in machine learning, enable shortcut learning, and leave
models systematically prone to err on out-of-distribution and adversarially
perturbed data. The mismatch between a single static benchmark dataset and a
production dataset has traditionally been described as a dataset shift. In an
effort to clarify how to address the mismatch between test benchmarks and
production data, we introduce context shift to describe semantically meaningful
changes in the underlying data generation process. Moreover, we identify three
methods for addressing context shift that would otherwise lead to model
prediction errors: first, we describe how human intuition and expert knowledge
can identify semantically meaningful features upon which models systematically
fail, second, we detail how dynamic benchmarking - with its focus on capturing
the data generation process - can promote generalizability through
corroboration, and third, we highlight that clarifying a model's limitations
can reduce unexpected errors. Robust machine learning is focused on model
performance beyond benchmarks, and as such, we consider three model organism
domains - facial expression recognition, deepfake detection, and medical
diagnosis - to highlight how implicit assumptions in benchmark tasks lead to
errors in practice. By paying close attention to the role of context,
researchers can design more comprehensive benchmarks, reduce context shift
errors, and increase generalizability.

to produce UV variability from the varying hard X-ray illumination. We model
the spectral energy distribution including an outer standard disc (optical), an
intermediate warm Comptonisation region (UV and soft X-ray) and a hot corona
(hard X-rays). Unlike the lower Eddington fraction AGN (NGC 4151 and NGC 5548
at $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02$ and $0.03$ respectively), the SED of Akn 120 ($L\sim
0.05L_{Edd}$) is dominated by the UV, restricting the impact of reverberating
hard X-rays by energetics alone. Illumination from a hard X-ray corona with
height $\sim10 R_g$ produces minimal UV variability. Increasing the coronal
scale height to $\sim 100 R_g$ improves the match to the observed amplitude of
UV variability as the disc subtends a larger solid angle, but results in too
much fast variability to match the UV data. The soft X-rays (connected to the
UV in the warm Comptonisation model) are more variable than the hard, but again
contain too much fast variability to match the observed smoother variability
seen in the UV. Results on lower Eddington fraction AGN have emphasised the
contribution from reverberation from larger scales (the broad line region), but
reverberation induces lags on similar timescales to the smoothing, producing a
larger delay than is compatible with the data. We conclude that the majority of
the UV variability is therefore intrinsic, connected to mass accretion rate
fluctuations in the warm Comptonisation region.

NP-Match. NP-Match is suited to this task for two reasons. Firstly, NP-Match
implicitly compares data points when making predictions, and as a result, the
prediction of each unlabeled data point is affected by the labeled data points
that are similar to it, which improves the quality of pseudo-labels. Secondly,
NP-Match is able to estimate uncertainty that can be used as a tool for
selecting unlabeled samples with reliable pseudo-labels. Compared with
uncertainty-based SSL methods implemented with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout,
NP-Match estimates uncertainty with much less computational overhead, which can
save time at both the training and the testing phases. We conducted extensive
experiments on four public datasets, and NP-Match outperforms state-of-the-art

effectiveness of NP-Match and its potential for SSL.

explicit breaking. It has long been recognized that these can disrupt the axion
solution to the strong CP problem. There have also been suggestions that, under
certain circumstances, these can lead to a surprisingly large mass for the
axion. Two types of corrections to this computation have been widely
considered: higher dimension symmetry breaking operators, in theories where
there is a complex field responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the PQ
symmetry, and small instantons. Motivated by situations where small instantons
dominate the $\theta$ potential of non-abelian gauge theories, we formulate the
question of axion quality in terms of constraints on a Wilsonian effective
action at scales somewhat above the scale of QCD. In this language, the
standard axion mass computation assumes a nearly exact PQ symmetry in this
action. The higher dimension operators and/or small instantons represent
symmetry breaking terms in the Wilsonian action. This picture permits a uniform
treatment of the problem of {\it axion quality}. If one assumes order one CP
violation at high energies, then solving the strong CP problem constrains the
axion potential terms in this Wilsonian action; in particular, the axion mass
must be extremely close to its ""standard"" value.

inference. Although many methods have been proposed to control false
discoveries, it is still a challenging task when the tests are correlated to
each other. To overcome this challenge, various methods have been proposed to
estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) and/or the false discovery proportion
(FDP) under arbitrary covariance among the test statistics. An interesting
finding of these works is that the estimation of FDP and FDR under weak
dependence is identical to that under independence. However, Mei et al. (2021)
pointed out that unlike FDR, the asymptotic variance of FDP can still differ
drastically from that under independence, and the difference depends on the
covariance structure among the test statistics. In this paper, we further
extend this result from $z$-tests to $t$-tests when the marginal variances are
unknown and need to be estimated. With weakly dependent $t$-tests, we show that
FDP still converges to a fixed quantity unrelated to the dependence structure,
and further derive the asymptotic expansion and uncertainty of FDP leading to
similar results as in Mei et al. (2021). In addition, we develop an
approximation method to efficiently evaluate the asymptotic variance of FDP for
dependent $t$-tests. We examine how the asymptotic variance of FDP varies as
well as the performance of its estimators under different dependence structures

  described?",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For over 200 years, wettability has made significant contributions to
understanding the properties of objects, advancing technological progress.
Theoretical model of the contact angle (CA) for evaluating wettability has
constantly been modified to address relevant emerging issues. However, these
existing models disregard the difference in the CA along the contact line and
use a single-point CA to evaluate the entire contact line. From this
perspective, there is no reasonable explanation for noncircular wetting. Here,
we reveal that noncircular wetting boundaries result from property differences
in the surfaces along the boundary, and utilize friction as a comprehensive
factor reflecting local wettability. Average CA is proposed to evaluate the
contact line instead of the single-point CA, making the Cassie method and
Wenzel method obsolete, which will take an average property of the whole
surface as a weight coefficient of the single-point CA, ignoring the
subordination between physical properties and roughness in systematics.

from acoustic speech signals has been widely explored over the past few years.
While accurate estimation of activation and dominance from speech seem to be
possible, the same for valence remains challenging. Previous research has shown
that the use of lexical information can improve valence estimation performance.
Lexical information can be obtained from pre-trained acoustic models, where the
learned representations can improve valence estimation from speech. We
investigate the use of pre-trained model representations to improve valence
estimation from acoustic speech signal. We also explore fusion of
representations to improve emotion estimation across all three emotion
dimensions: activation, valence and dominance. Additionally, we investigate if
representations from pre-trained models can be distilled into models trained
with low-level features, resulting in models with a less number of parameters.
We show that fusion of pre-trained model embeddings result in a 79% relative
improvement in concordance correlation coefficient CCC on valence estimation
compared to standard acoustic feature baseline (mel-filterbank energies), while
distillation from pre-trained model embeddings to lower-dimensional
representations yielded a relative 12% improvement. Such performance gains were
observed over two evaluation sets, indicating that our proposed architecture
generalizes across those evaluation sets. We report new state-of-the-art
""text-free"" acoustic-only dimensional emotion estimation $CCC$ values on two
MSP-Podcast evaluation sets.

microdata, usually with sample fractions under 10% and with other forms of
statistical disclosure control (SDC) applied. An alternative to SDC is data
synthesis, which has been attracting growing interest, yet there is no clear
consensus on how to measure the associated utility and disclosure risk of the
data. The ability to produce synthetic Census microdata, where the utility and
associated risks are clearly understood, could mean that more timely and
wider-ranging access to microdata would be possible.
  This paper follows on from previous work by the authors which mapped
synthetic Census data on a risk-utility (R-U) map. The paper presents a
framework to measure the utility and disclosure risk of synthetic data by
comparing it to samples of the original data of varying sample fractions,
thereby identifying the sample fraction which has equivalent utility and risk
to the synthetic data. Three commonly used data synthesis packages are compared
with some interesting results. Further work is needed in several directions but
the methodology looks very promising.

neutron star systems has rekindled our hopes for a deeper understanding of the
unknown nature of ultradense matter. In particular, gravitational wave
constraints on the tidal deformability of a neutron star can be translated into
constraints on several neutron star properties using a set of universal
relations. Apart from binary neutron star mergers, supernova explosions are
also important candidates for the detection of multimessenger signals. Such
observations may allow us to impose significant constraints on the binding
energy of neutron stars. The purpose of the present study is twofold. Firstly,
we investigate the agreement of finite temperature equations of state with
established universal relations. Secondly, we examine the possible existence of
a universal relation between the binding energy and the dimensionless tidal
deformability, which are the bulk properties connected to the most promising
sources for multimessenger signals. We find that hot equations of state are not
always compatible with accepted universal relations. Therefore, the use of such
expressions for probing general relativity or imposing constraints on the
structure of neutron stars would be inconclusive (when thermal effects are
present). Additionally, we show that the binding energy and the dimensionless
tidal deformability exhibit a universal trend at least for moderate neutron
star masses. The latter allows us to set bounds on the binding energy of a 1.4
$M_\odot$ neutron star using data from the GW170817 event. Finally, we provide
a relation between the compactness, the binding energy and the dimensionless
tidal deformability of a neutron star that is accurate for cold and hot
isentropic equations of state.

  Surfaces","This paper was submitted to a conference May 2022",,,,"cs.IT cs.ET math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  5G network operators consider the dense deployment of small base-stations
(SBSs) to increase network coverage and capacity. Hence, operators face the
challenge of X-hauling, i.e., backhauling or fronthauling, their traffic to the
core network. Also, SBSs densification will increase the possibility of failure
of these X-haul links. To cope with this problem, an X-haul outage compensation
scheme with the assistance of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is
proposed to mitigate or at least alleviate the effect of X-haul failure. The
RIS is a newly adopted technology that is able to improve the performance of
wireless networks. In this paper, we present and evaluate an X-haul outage
compensation scheme based on placing a number of RIS panels in pre-planned
locations to mitigate the effect of X-haul failure. This evaluation is done
using frequencies below and beyond 6 GHz. Based on our analytical results, the
proposed RIS scheme shows that placing a sufficient number of RIS elements in
proximity to the failed SBS under certain conditions can help acquire the same
X-haul rate before the occurrence of the failure. Also, we show that for high
X-haul spectral density, the RIS-assisted transmission with a certain number of
elements can be more energy-efficient than line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
transmissions. Finally, the system's energy efficiency is addressed with and
without RIS, and the optimal number of RIS reflecting elements is derived.

21th century to date, concerning national health systems on a daily basis,
since December 2019 when it appeared in Wuhan City. Nevertheless, most of the
proposed mathematical methodologies aiming to describe the dynamics of an
epidemic, rely on deterministic models that are not able to reflect the true
nature of its spread. In this paper, we propose a SEIHCRDV model - an
extension/improvement of the classic SIR compartmental model - which also takes
into consideration the populations of exposed, hospitalized, admitted in
intensive care units (ICU), deceased and vaccinated cases, in combination with
an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), providing a dynamic estimation of the time
dependent system's parameters. The stochastic approach is considered necessary,
as both observations and system equations are characterized by uncertainties.
Apparently, this new consideration is useful for examining various pandemics
more effectively. The reliability of the model is examined on the daily
recordings of COVID-19 in France, over a long period of 265 days. Two major
waves of infection are observed, starting in January 2021, which signified the
start of vaccinations in Europe providing quite encouraging predictive
performance, based on the produced NRMSE values. Special emphasis is placed on
proving the non-negativity of SEIHCRDV model, achieving a representative basic
reproductive number R0 and demonstrating the existence and stability of disease
equilibria according to the formula produced to estimate R0. The model
outperforms in predictive ability not only deterministic approaches but also
state-of-the-art stochastic models that employ Kalman filters.
