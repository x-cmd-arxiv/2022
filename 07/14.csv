the entanglement entropy in a free fermion theory on a torus with three typical
deforma- tions, e.g., T\bar{T} deformation, local bilinear operator
deformation, and mass deformation. For T\bar{T} deformation, we find that the
leading order correction of entanglement entropy is proportional to the
expectation value of the undeformed modular Hamiltonian. As a check, in the
high/low-temperature limit, the entanglement entropy coincides with that
obtained by the replica trick in the literature. Following the same
perturbative strategy, we obtain the entanglement entropy of the free fermion
vacuum state up to second-order by inserting a local bilinear operator
deformation in a moving mirror set- ting. In the uniformly accelerated mirror,
the first-order and second-order correction of entanglement entropy vanishes in
the late time limit. For mass deformation, we derive the entanglement entropy
up to first-order deformation and comment on the second-order correction.

due to the denser deployments of gNodeBs (gNBs) and higher single-gNB power
consumption. In an effort to achieve an energy-conserving RAN, this paper
develops a dynamic on-off switching paradigm, where the ON/OFF states of gNBs
can be dynamically configured according to the evolvements of the associated
users. We formulate the dynamic sleep control for a cluster of gNBs as a Markov
decision process (MDP) and analyze various switching policies to reduce the
energy expenditure. The optimal policy of the MDP that minimizes the energy
expenditure can be derived from dynamic programming, but the computation is
expensive. To circumvent this issue, this paper puts forth a greedy policy and
an index policy for gNB sleep control. When there is no constraint on the
number of gNBs that can be turned off, we prove the dual-threshold structure of
the greedy policy and analyze its connections with the optimal policy. Inspired
by the dual-threshold structure and Whittle index, we develop an index policy
by decoupling the original MDP into multiple one-dimensional MDPs -- the
indexability of the decoupled MDP is proven and an algorithm to compute the
index is proposed. Extensive simulation results verify that the index policy
exhibits close-to-optimal performance in terms of the energy expenditure of the
gNB cluster. As far as the computational complexity is concerned, on the other
hand, the index policy is much more efficient than the optimal policy, which is
computationally prohibitive when the number of gNBs is large.

satellite signals to infer the position of a receiver. This is ideal for
low-power applications such as animal tracking. However, there are few existing
snapshot systems, none of which is open source. To address this, we developed
SnapperGPS, a fully open-source, low-cost, and low-power location tracking
system designed for wildlife tracking. SnapperGPS comprises three parts, all of
which are open-source: (i) a small, low-cost, and low-power receiver; (ii) a
web application to configure the receiver via USB; and (iii) a cloud-based
platform for processing recorded data. This paper presents the hardware side of
this project. The total component cost of the receiver is under $30, making it
feasible for field work with restricted budgets and low recovery rates. The
receiver records very short and low-resolution samples resulting in
particularly low power consumption, outperforming existing systems. It can run
for more than a year on a 40 mAh battery. We evaluated SnapperGPS in controlled
static and dynamic tests in a semi-urban environment where it achieved median

magnitudes depending on the intrinsic pulsar's timing properties (proxies to
relevant physical pulsar features), to analyze whether the information
contained by the pulsar's period and period derivative is enough to describe
the variety of the pulsar population. Even when the variables of interest
depend on $P$ and $\dot P$, we show that $P\dot P$ are not principal

$\dot P$ is potentially misleading. Next, we define and compute a properly
normalized distance to measure pulsar nearness, calculate the minimum spanning
tree of the population, and discuss possible applications. The pulsar tree
hosts information about pulsar similarities that go beyond $P$ and $\dot P$,
and are thus naturally difficult to read from the $P\dot P$-diagram. We use

turbulence in nonuniform coronal loops with a purely axial magnetic field. Here
we explore the role of the magnetic twist. We model a coronal loop as a
transversely nonuniform straight flux tube, anchored in the photosphere, and
embedded in a uniform coronal environment. We consider that the magnetic field
is twisted and control the strength of magnetic twist by a free parameter of
the model. We excite the longitudinally fundamental mode of standing torsional
Alfv\'en waves, whose temporal evolution is obtained by means of
high-resolution three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic numerical
simulations. We find that phase mixing of torsional Alfv\'en waves creates
velocity shear in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. The
velocity shear eventually triggers the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi). In
weakly twisted magnetic tubes, the KHi is able to grow nonlinearly and,
subsequently, turbulence is driven in the coronal loop in a similar manner as
in the untwisted case. Provided that magnetic twist remains weak, the effect of
magnetic twist is to delay the onset of the KHi and to slow down the
development of turbulence. In contrast, magnetic tension can suppress the
nonlinear growth of the KHi when magnetic twist is strong enough, even if the
KHi has locally been excited by the phase-mixing shear. Thus, turbulence is not
generated in strongly twisted loops

in the mirror, which is beneficial in distinguishing mirrors from real objects.
Based on this observation, we propose a dual-path Symmetry-Aware

global information aggregation in images, extracting multi-scale features in
two paths. We then feed the high-level dual-path features to SAAMs to capture
the symmetry relations. Finally, we fuse the dual-path features and refine our
prediction maps progressively with CFDMs to obtain the final mirror mask.
Experimental results show that SATNet outperforms both RGB and RGB-D mirror

finite element method (AFEM). Experience shows that a na\""{i}ve marking policy
leads to inefficient use of computational resources for adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR). Consequently, using AFEM in practice often involves ad-hoc or
time-consuming offline parameter tuning to set appropriate parameters for the
marking subroutine. To address these practical concerns, we recast AMR as a
Markov decision process in which refinement parameters can be selected
on-the-fly at run time, without the need for pre-tuning by expert users. In
this new paradigm, the refinement parameters are also chosen adaptively via a
marking policy that can be optimized using methods from reinforcement learning.
We use the Poisson equation to demonstrate our techniques on $h$- and
$hp$-refinement benchmark problems, and our experiments suggest that superior
marking policies remain undiscovered for many classical AFEM applications.
Furthermore, an unexpected observation from this work is that marking policies
trained on one family of PDEs are sometimes robust enough to perform well on
problems far outside the training family. For illustration, we show that a
simple $hp$-refinement policy trained on 2D domains with only a single
re-entrant corner can be deployed on far more complicated 2D domains, and even
3D domains, without significant performance loss. For reproduction and broader
adoption, we accompany this work with an open-source implementation of our

centralized counterparts when clients have dissimilar data distributions. For
neural networks, even when centralized SGD easily finds a solution that is
simultaneously performant for all clients, current federated optimization
methods fail to converge to a comparable solution. We show that this
performance disparity can largely be attributed to optimization challenges
presented by nonconvexity. Specifically, we find that the early layers of the
network do learn useful features, but the final layers fail to make use of
them. That is, federated optimization applied to this non-convex problem
distorts the learning of the final layers. Leveraging this observation, we
propose a Train-Convexify-Train (TCT) procedure to sidestep this issue: first,
learn features using off-the-shelf methods (e.g., FedAvg); then, optimize a
convexified problem obtained from the network's empirical neural tangent kernel
approximation. Our technique yields accuracy improvements of up to +36% on
FMNIST and +37% on CIFAR10 when clients have dissimilar data.

high-quality videos with higher resolution and higher frame rates. Existing
advanced methods accomplish ST-VSR tasks through the association of Spatial and
Temporal video super-resolution (S-VSR and T-VSR). These methods require two
alignments and fusions in S-VSR and T-VSR, which is obviously redundant and
fails to sufficiently explore the information flow of consecutive spatial LR
frames. Although bidirectional learning (future-to-past and past-to-future) was
introduced to cover all input frames, the direct fusion of final predictions
fails to sufficiently exploit intrinsic correlations of bidirectional motion
learning and spatial information from all frames. We propose an effective yet
efficient recurrent network with bidirectional interaction for ST-VSR, where
only one alignment and fusion is needed. Specifically, it first performs
backward inference from future to past, and then follows forward inference to
super-resolve intermediate frames. The backward and forward inferences are
assigned to learn structures and details to simplify the learning task with
joint optimizations. Furthermore, a Hybrid Fusion Module (HFM) is designed to
aggregate and distill information to refine spatial information and reconstruct
high-quality video frames. Extensive experiments on two public datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency,

Tb act as very efficient orbital-to-spin current converters, boosting the
spin-orbit torques generated by Cr by a factor of 4 and reversing the sign of

scenarios in order to identify the occurring events and their respective

Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), how birdsong polyphonic scenarios can be
detected when dealing with higher polyphony and how effectively this type of
model can face a very dense scene with up to 10 overlapping birds. We found
that models trained with denser examples (i.e., higher polyphony) learn at a
similar rate as models that used simpler samples in their training set.
Additionally, the model trained with the densest samples maintained a
consistent score for all polyphonies, while the model trained with the least
dense samples degraded as the polyphony increased. Our results demonstrate that
highly dense acoustic scenarios can be dealt with using CRNNs. We expect that
this study serves as a starting point for working on highly populated bird

namely, relative roughness (Rr) and fractal dimension (FD). The contact
behaviour of rough spheres with a rigid flat surface is simulated using FEM to
quantify the influences of surface structure and sphere morphology by focusing
on contact stiffness and true contact area. The dependence of normal contact
stiffness (k) on applied normal force (F) is found to follow a power law over
four orders of magnitude, with both alpha and beta being highly correlated with
Rr and FD. With increasing load, the power exponent converges to that of
Hertzian contact, e.g., 1/3, independent of Rr. Regions of true contact evolve
through the formation of new microcontacts and their progressive merging,
meanwhile the area distributions of contact island induced by various forces
tend to obey similar Weibull distributions due to fractal nature in their
surfaces. Contacts with larger values of Rr are found to produce contact
contours with higher fractal dimension as calculated by a 2D box-counting
method. Our results suggest that the correlation between radial lengths in a
quasi spherical particle should be considered in studying contact behaviour.

finding problems commonly found in applications to optimization and
reinforcement learning. The general constant gain algorithm may be expressed as
the time-inhomogeneous ODE $ \frac{d}{dt} \Theta_t= \alpha f_t (\Theta_t)$,
with state process $\Theta$ evolving on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Theory is based on an
almost periodic vector field, so that in particular the time average of
$f_t(\theta)$ defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field $\bar{f} \colon
\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\bar{f}(\theta^*)=0$. Under smoothness
assumptions on the functions involved, the following exact representation is
obtained: \[
  \frac{d}{dt} \Theta_t= \alpha [\bar{f}(\Theta_t) -\alpha \bar \Upsilon_t +
\alpha^2 \mathcal{W}_t^0 + \alpha \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{W}_t^1 +

combined with new conditions for ultimate boundedness, has many applications
for furthering the theory of QSA and its applications, including the following
implications developed in this paper:
  (i) A proof that the estimation error $\| \Theta_t - \theta^* \|$ is of order
$O(\alpha)$, but can be reduced to $O(\alpha^2)$ using a second order linear
filter.
  (ii) In application to extremum seeking control, it is found that the results
do not apply because the standard algorithms are not Lipschitz continuous. A
new approach is presented to ensure that the required Lipschitz bounds hold,
and from this we obtain stability, transient bounds, and asymptotic bias of
order $O(\alpha^2)$, and asymptotic variance of order $O(\alpha^4)$.
  (iii) It is in general possible to obtain better than $O(\alpha)$ bounds on
error in traditional stochastic approximation when there is Markovian noise.

However, unlike many standard restoration problems such as deconvolution, the

simple expression. Thanks to the Zernike representation of the phase, one can
show that the forward model is a combination of tilt (pixel shifting due to the

aberrations).
  Confusions then arise between the ordering of the two operators. Should the

the context of a three-dimensional line-intensity mapping measurement to be
undertaken by current and proposed phases of the CO Mapping Array Project
(COMAP). The WST coefficients demonstrate interpretable behaviour in the
context of noiseless CO line-intensity simulations. The contribution of the
cosmological $z\sim3$ signal to these coefficients is also detectable in
principle even in the Pathfinder phase of COMAP. Using the peak-patch method to
generate large numbers of simulations and incorporating observational noise, we
numerically estimate covariance matrices and show that careful choices of WST
hyperparameters and rescaled or reduced coefficient sets are both necessary to
keep covariances well-conditioned. Fisher forecasts show that even a reduced
`shapeless' set of $\ell$-averaged WST coefficients show constraining power
that can exceed that of the power spectrum alone even with similar detection
significance. The full WST could improve parameter constraints even over the
combination of the power spectrum and the voxel intensity distribution, showing
that it uniquely encapsulates shape information about the line-intensity field.
However, practical applications urgently require further understanding of the
WST in key contexts like covariances and cross-correlations.

arXiv:1408.4133. There it was established that there always exists (finitely
many) efficient geodesics between any two vertices, $ v_{\alpha} , v_{\beta}
\in \mathcal{C}(S_g)$, representing homotopy classes of simple closed curves,
$\alpha , \beta \subset S_g$. The main tool for used in establishing the
existence of efficient geodesic was a dot graph, a booking scheme for recording
the intersection pattern of a reference arc, $\gamma \subset S_g$, with the
simple closed curves associated with the vertices of geodesic path in the zero
skeleton, $\mathcal{C}^0(S_g)$. In particular, for an efficient geodesic
between $v_\alpha $ and $v_\beta$ of length $d \geq 3$, it was shown that any
curve corresponding to the vertex that is distance one from $v_\alpha$
intersects any $\gamma$ at most $d -2$ times. In this note we make a more
expansive study of the characterizing ""shape"" of the dot graphs over the entire
set of vertices in an efficient geodesic edge-path. The key take away of this
study is that the shape of a dot graph for any efficient geodesic is contained
within a spindle shape region. Since the Nielson-Thurston coordinates of any
curve on $S_g$ are directly derived from its intersection number with finitely
many reference arcs, spindle shaped dot graphs control the coordinate behavior
of curves associated with the vertices of an efficient geodesic.

in forensics palmprint recognition, it is usual to find only a small piece of

the gap between the amounts of salient points of both images, which is related

  Text-to-Speech","Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved
leading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative
sampling process costs hinder their applications to text-to-speech deployment.
Through the preliminary study on diffusion model parameterization, we find that
previous gradient-based TTS models require hundreds or thousands of iterations
to guarantee high sample quality, which poses a challenge for accelerating
sampling. In this work, we propose ProDiff, on progressive fast diffusion model
for high-quality text-to-speech. Unlike previous work estimating the gradient
for data density, ProDiff parameterizes the denoising model by directly
predicting clean data to avoid distinct quality degradation in accelerating
sampling. To tackle the model convergence challenge with decreased diffusion
iterations, ProDiff reduces the data variance in the target site via knowledge
distillation. Specifically, the denoising model uses the generated
mel-spectrogram from an N-step DDIM teacher as the training target and distills
the behavior into a new model with N/2 steps. As such, it allows the TTS model
to make sharp predictions and further reduces the sampling time by orders of
magnitude. Our evaluation demonstrates that ProDiff needs only 2 iterations to
synthesize high-fidelity mel-spectrograms, while it maintains sample quality
and diversity competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps.
ProDiff enables a sampling speed of 24x faster than real-time on a single
NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to
text-to-speech synthesis deployment for the first time. Our extensive ablation
studies demonstrate that each design in ProDiff is effective, and we further
show that ProDiff can be easily extended to the multi-speaker setting. Audio

more computationally intensive and there are several models being trained with
accuracy and latency trade-offs. However, modern latency accuracy trade-offs
largely report mean accuracy for single-step vision tasks, but there is little
work showing which model to invoke for multi-step control tasks in robotics.
The key challenge in a multi-step decision making is to make use of the right
models at right times to accomplish the given task. That is, the accomplishment
of the task with a minimum control cost and minimum perception time is a
desideratum; this is known as the model selection problem. In this work, we
precisely address this problem of invoking the correct sequence of perception
models for multi-step control. In other words, we provide a provably optimal
solution to the model selection problem by casting it as a multi-objective
optimization problem balancing the control cost and perception time. The key
insight obtained from our solution is how the variance of the perception models
matters (not just the mean accuracy) for multi-step decision making, and to
show how to use diverse perception models as a primitive for energy-efficient
robotics. Further, we demonstrate our approach on a photo-realistic drone

ideal-theoretic generalization of the vertex decomposability property for
simplicial complexes. Indeed, a homogeneous geometrically vertex decomposable
ideal is radical and Cohen-Macaulay, and is in the Gorenstein liaison class of
a complete intersection (glicci). In this paper, we initiate an investigation
into when the toric ideal $I_G$ of a finite simple graph $G$ is geometrically
vertex decomposable. We first show how geometric vertex decomposability behaves
under tensor products, which allows us to restrict to connected graphs. We then
describe a graph operation that preserves geometric vertex decomposability,
thus allowing us to build many graphs whose corresponding toric ideals are
geometrically vertex decomposable. Using work of Constantinescu and Gorla, we
prove that toric ideals of bipartite graphs are geometrically vertex
decomposable. We also propose a conjecture that all toric ideals of graphs with
a square-free degeneration with respect to a lexicographic order are
geometrically vertex decomposable. As evidence, we prove the conjecture in the
case that the universal Gr\""obner basis of $I_G$ is a set of quadratic
binomials. We also prove that some other families of graphs have the property
that $I_G$ is glicci.

socially desirable behaviors. While static games offer a pragmatic model for
such interactions, and modifying the utilities of the agents in such games
provides a means toward achieving socially desirable behavior, manipulating the
utilities is hard-if not impossible-after the system is deployed. We
investigate an alternative means where each agent incorporates others'
utilities into its own utility based on a relationship network, which
characterizes how much one agent cares about another and hence the extent of
their utility incorporation. We introduce the notion of a relationship game, a
static game with a set of weighted relationship networks and a social cost
function. The main problem we study is the design of the weight vector on the
relationships such that the Nash equilibrium of the associated game is socially
desirable. We propose an ordering-based exact method and a gradient-based
approximate method to solve this problem. We show theoretically that the exact
solution scales exponentially with the number of players. Empirical results
show both methods are effective and scale exponentially, with the runtime of
gradient-based solution growing slower.

supermassive black hole (SMBH) by means of direct $N$-body simulations. We show
that an isolated nuclear stellar disc exhibits anisotropic mass segregation
meaning that massive stars settle to lower orbital inclinations and more
circular orbits than the light stars. However, in systems in which the stellar
disc is embedded in a much more massive isotropic stellar cluster, anisotropic
mass segregation tends to be suppressed. In both cases, an initially thin
stellar disc becomes thicker, especially in the inner parts due to the
fluctuating anisotropy in the spherical component. We find that vector resonant
relaxation is quenched in the disc by nodal precession, but it is still the
most efficient relaxation process around SMBHs of mass $10^6M_\odot$ and above.
Two body relaxation may dominate for less massive SMBHs found in dwarf
galaxies. Stellar discs embedded in massive isotropic stellar clusters
ultimately tend to become isotropic on the local two-body relaxation
time-scale. Our simulations show that the dynamics of young stars at the centre
of the Milky Way is mostly driven by vector resonant relaxation leading to an
anticorrelation between the scatter of orbital inclinations and distance from
the SMBH. If the $S$-stars formed in a disc less than 10 Myr ago, they may
coexist with a cusp of stellar mass black holes or an intermediate mass black
hole with mass up to $1000M_\odot$ to reproduce the observed scatter of angular
momenta.

we design a set of 917 DNA tiles that can self-assemble in three alternative

co-localization of high-concentration tiles within the three structures. The

full-body models from monocular images. This task is very challenging since
minor parametric deviation may lead to noticeable misalignment between the
estimated mesh and the input image. Moreover, when integrating part-specific
estimations into the full-body model, existing solutions tend to either degrade
the alignment or produce unnatural wrist poses. To address these issues, we
propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression
network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it as PyMAF-X for the
recovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage
a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the
mesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted
parameters, mesh-aligned evidence will be extracted from finer-resolution
features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the
alignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide
mesh-image correspondence guidance while spatial alignment attention is
introduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When
extending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy
is proposed in PyMAF-X to produce natural wrist poses while maintaining the
well-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations. The efficacy of our
approach is validated on several benchmark datasets for body, hand, face, and
full-body mesh recovery, where PyMAF and PyMAF-X effectively improve the
mesh-image alignment and achieve new state-of-the-art results. The project page

single eigenfrequency, by monolithically integrating a suspended dielectric
membrane with a counter-propagating optical trap. The periodic optical field
modulates the dielectrophoretic force on the membrane at the overtones of a
membrane's motion. These overtones share a fixed frequency and phase relation,
and constitute a mechanical frequency comb. The periodic optical field also
creates an optothermal parametric drive that requires no additional power or
external frequency reference. This combination of effects results in an
easy-to-use mechanical frequency comb platform that requires no precise
alignment, no additional feedback or control electronics, and only uses a
single, mW continuous wave laser beam. This highlights the overtone frequency
comb as the straightforward future for applications in sensing, metrology and
quantum acoustics.

(i.e. segmenting and learning visual concepts) by looking at RGBD images and
reasoning about paired questions and answers. Existing visual reasoning
approaches typically utilize supervised methods to extract 2D segmentation
masks on which concepts are grounded. In contrast, humans are capable of
grounding concepts on the underlying 3D representation of images. However,
traditionally inferred 3D representations (e.g., point clouds, voxelgrids, and
meshes) cannot capture continuous 3D features flexibly, thus making it
challenging to ground concepts to 3D regions based on the language description
of the object being referred to. To address both issues, we propose to leverage
the continuous, differentiable nature of neural fields to segment and learn
concepts. Specifically, each 3D coordinate in a scene is represented as a
high-dimensional descriptor. Concept grounding can then be performed by
computing the similarity between the descriptor vector of a 3D coordinate and
the vector embedding of a language concept, which enables segmentations and
concept learning to be jointly learned on neural fields in a differentiable
fashion. As a result, both 3D semantic and instance segmentations can emerge
directly from question answering supervision using a set of defined neural
operators on top of neural fields (e.g., filtering and counting). Experimental
results show that our proposed framework outperforms
unsupervised/language-mediated segmentation models on semantic and instance
segmentation tasks, as well as outperforms existing models on the challenging
3D aware visual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our framework can generalize well
to unseen shape categories and real scans.

boundary operators with suitable smearing functions it is possible to
reconstruct all local bulk operators in the free theory. We argue, using
perturbation theory, that our extrapolation procedure continues to be well

Signals from 10 students were recorded along with the students' self-assessment
of their affective state after each stimulus, in terms of 6 basic emotion
states. All the signals were captured using portable, wearable, wireless,
low-cost, and off-the-shelf equipment that has the potential to allow the use

predict biomarkers from medical imaging beyond traditional clinician
interpretation of medical imaging. Given the black box nature of artificial
intelligence (AI) models, caution should be exercised in applying models to
healthcare as prediction tasks might be short-cut by differences in
demographics across disease and patient populations. Using large
echocardiography datasets from two healthcare systems, we test whether it is
possible to predict age, race, and sex from cardiac ultrasound images using
deep learning algorithms and assess the impact of varying confounding
variables. We trained video-based convolutional neural networks to predict age,
sex, and race. We found that deep learning models were able to identify age and
sex, while unable to reliably predict race. Without considering confounding
differences between categories, the AI model predicted sex with an AUC of 0.85
(95% CI 0.84 - 0.86), age with a mean absolute error of 9.12 years (95% CI 9.00
- 9.25), and race with AUCs ranging from 0.63 - 0.71. When predicting race, we
show that tuning the proportion of a confounding variable (sex) in the training
data significantly impacts model AUC (ranging from 0.57 to 0.84), while in
training a sex prediction model, tuning a confounder (race) did not
substantially change AUC (0.81 - 0.83). This suggests a significant proportion
of the model's performance on predicting race could come from confounding
features being detected by AI. Further work remains to identify the particular
imaging features that associate with demographic information and to better
understand the risks of demographic identification in medical AI as it pertains
to potentially perpetuating bias and disparities.

number of implications between them and other quantum functional inequalities.
In particular, we show that the quantum Beckner's inequalities interpolate
between the Sobolev-type inequalities and the Poincar\'{e} inequality in a
sharp way. We provide a uniform lower bound for the Beckner constants
$\alpha_p$, and establish the stability of $\alpha_p$ with respect to the
invariant state. As applications of Beckner's inequalities, we derive an
improved bound for the mixing time. For the symmetric quantum Markov
semigroups, we obtain moment estimates, which further implies a concentration

key challenge for real-world KWS tasks: when a new model is deployed on device,
the gating of the accepted data undergoes a shift in distribution, making the
problem of timely updates via subsequent deployments hard. Despite the shift,
we assume that the marginal distributions on labels do not change. We utilize a
modified teacher/student training framework, where labeled training data is
augmented with unlabeled data. Note that the teacher does not have access to
the new distribution as well. To train effectively with a mix of human and
teacher labeled data, we develop a teacher labeling strategy based on
confidence heuristics to reduce entropy on the label distribution from the
teacher model; the data is then sampled to match the marginal distribution on
the labels. Large scale experimental results show that a convolutional neural

drawn from a different distribution, obtains a 14.3% relative improvement in
false discovery rate (FDR) at equal false reject rate (FRR), while yielding a
5% improvement in FDR under no distribution shift. Under a more severe

elastomer actuated flexible multibody dynamics systems is presented. The
Dielectric Elastomer Actuator (DEA) behaves like a flexible artificial muscles
in soft robotics. It is modeled as an electromechanically coupled geometrically
exact beam, where the electric charges serve as control variables. The DEA-beam
is integrated as an actuator into multibody systems consisting of rigid and
flexible components. The model also represents contact interaction via
unilateral constraints between the beam actuator and e.g. a rigid body during
the grasping process of a soft robot. Specifically for the DEA, a work
conjugated electric displacement and strain-like electric variables are derived
for the Cosserat beam. With a mathematically concise and physically
representative formulation, a reduced free energy function is developed for the
beam-DEA. In the optimal control problem, an objective function is minimized
while the dynamic balance equations for the multibody system have to be
fulfilled together with the complementarity conditions for the contact and
boundary conditions. The optimal control problem is solved via a direct
transcription method, transforming it into a constrained nonlinear optimization
problem. The beam is firstly semidiscretized with 1D finite elements and then
the multibody dynamics is temporally discretized with a variational integrator
leading to the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations, which are further reduced
with the null space projection. The discrete Euler-Lagrange equations and the
boundary conditions serve as equality constraints, whereas the contact
constraints are treated as inequality constraints in the optimization of the
discretized objective. The effectiveness of the developed model is demonstrated
by three numerical examples, including a cantilever beam, a soft robotic worm
and a soft grasper.

underlies many of the leading efforts to demonstrate scalable quantum
computing. Central to our discussion is the minimum-weight perfect-matching
decoder. The decoder works by exploiting underlying structure that arises due
to materialised symmetries among surface-code stabilizer elements. By
concentrating on these symmetries, we begin to address the question of how a
minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder might be generalised for other types of
code. We approach this question first by investigating examples of matching
decoders for other codes. These include decoding algorithms that have been
specialised to correct for noise models that demonstrate a particular structure
or bias with respect to certain types of code. In addition to this, we propose
a systematic way of constructing a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for
codes with certain characteristic properties. The properties we make use of are
common among topological codes. We discuss the broader applicability of the
proposal, and we suggest some questions we can address that may show us how to
design a generalised matching decoder for arbitrary stabilizer codes.

corresponding particle interpretation for these fluctuations is flexible, and
we clarify the role of this choice at the level of calculations and their
diagrammatic interpretation. We consider several possibilities aside from the
standard Bunch Davies vacuum prescription for the initial state, and trace the
change in pole structure as one begins adding excitations; starting from just a
single particle, to highly excited states and special cases such as a coherent
state. We illustrate - with the example of coherent states - the subtleties in
concluding a Bunch Davies initial state from the absence of physical poles in
the bispectrum, which is interesting in light of some recent literature.
Initial states with a finite number of excitations are plagued with
disconnected diagrams isolated in phase space, and we highlight their
implications on the observation of these signals, and how the situation changes
as one begins to excite more and more particles. We also comment about the
implications of various initial conditions on the squeezed limit of the
bispectrum. These new pole structures are a direct consequence of mixing of
positive and negative frequency modes which is a characteristic of curved
spacetimes; in particular, we see in detail how particles in an initial state
replicate mode mixing structures. This study aims to clarify the missing
details that link quantum and classical initial conditions, and sharpen our

is achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction offers a path to
algorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many
physical qubits, where increasing the number of physical qubits enhances
protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also
increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be
sufficiently low in order for logical performance to improve with increasing
code size. Here, we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling
across multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting
qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from
increasing qubit number. We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit
modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, both
in terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per
cycle ($2.914\%\pm 0.016\%$ compared to $3.028\%\pm 0.023\%$). To investigate
damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code
and observe a $1.7\times10^{-6}$ logical error per round floor set by a single
high-energy event ($1.6\times10^{-7}$ when excluding this event). We are able
to accurately model our experiment, and from this model we can extract error
budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results
mark the first experimental demonstration where quantum error correction begins
to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to
reaching the logical error rates required for computation.

framework of the lamp-post reprocessing model, our findings are: 1) The
continuum emission (CE) sizes inferred from the data are larger than the disk
sizes predicted by the standard thin disk model; 2) For a subset of the sample,
the CE size exceeds the theoretical limit of the self-gravity radius (12
lt-days) for geometrically thin disks; 3) The CE size scales with continuum
luminosity as $R_{\mathrm{CE}} \propto L^{0.48\pm0.04}$ with a scatter of 0.2
dex, analogous to the well-known radius-luminosity relation of broad
H$\mathrm{\beta}$. These findings suggest a significant contribution of diffuse
continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR) to AGN continuum lags. We
find that the $R_{\mathrm{CE}}-L$ relation can be explained by a
photoionization model that assumes $\sim$23% of the total flux comes from the
diffuse BLR emission. In addition, the ratio of the CE size and model-predicted
disk size anti-correlates with the continuum luminosity, indicative of a
potential non-disk BLR lag contribution evolving with luminosity. Finally, a
robust positive correlation between CE size and black hole mass is detected.

subject to the rigidity, they jump at conformal fixed points. The jump happens
in a specific way, so the double braiding relation further constrains
renormalization group flows. The new constraints enable us three things; 1) to
predict infrared conformal dimensions in massless flow, 2) to reveal some

reduction of the relativistic Abelian $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric QED in 3+1
dimensions and study its renormalization properties directly in
non-relativistic superspace. Despite the existence of a non-renormalization
theorem induced by the causal structure of the non-relativistic dynamics, we
find that the theory is non-renormalizable. Infinite dimensionless,
supersymmetric and gauge-invariant terms, which combine into an analytic
function, are generated at quantum level. Renormalizability is then restored by
generalizing the theory to a non-linear sigma model where the usual minimal
coupling between gauge and matter is complemented by infinitely many marginal
couplings driven by a dimensionless gauge scalar and its fermionic
superpartner. Superconformal invariance is preserved in correspondence of a

numerous modified theories of gravity retain these principles, it is also
possible to introduce another affine connection as a fundamental field, and
consider its properties - curvature, torsion, nonmetricity - as the mediators
of gravity. In the most general case, this gives rise to the class of
metric-affine gravity theories, while restricting to metric-compatible
connections, for which nonmetricity vanishes, comprises the class of Poincar\'e
gauge theories. Alternatively, one may also consider connections with vanishing

deprojected S\'ersic profile with an assumed intrinsic geometry. The case of
flattened, deprojected S\'ersic models has previously been applied to flattened
bulges in local star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but can also be used to describe
the thick, turbulent disks in distant SFGs. Here we extend this previous work
that derived density ($\rho$) and circular velocity ($v_{\rm circ}$) curves by
additionally calculating the spherically-enclosed 3D mass profiles ($M_{\rm
sph}$). Using these profiles, we compare the projected and 3D mass
distributions, quantify the differences between the projected and 3D half-mass
radii ($R_{\rm e}; r_{\rm 1/2,mass,3D}$), and present virial coefficients
relating $v_{\rm circ}(R)$ and $M_{\rm sph}(<r=R)$ or $M_{\rm tot}$. We then
quantify differences between mass fraction estimators for multi-component
systems, particularly for dark matter fractions, and consider the compound
effects of measuring dark matter fractions at the projected versus 3D half-mass
radii. While the fraction estimators produce only minor differences, using
different aperture radius definitions can strongly impact the inferred dark
matter fraction. As pressure support is important in analysis of gas kinematics
(particularly at high redshifts), we also calculate the self-consistent
pressure support correction profiles, which generally predict less pressure
support than for the self-gravitating disk case. These results have
implications for comparisons between simulation and observational measurements,

by minimizing interpolation models that approximate the objective in
low-dimensional affine subspaces, thus significantly reducing per-iteration
costs in terms of function evaluations and yielding strong performance on
large-scale stochastic DFO problems. The user-determined dimension of these
subspaces, when the latter are defined, for example, by the columns of

martingale theory under the latter assumptions, an almost sure global
convergence of STARS to a first-order stationary point is shown, and the
expected number of iterations required to reach a desired first-order accuracy

permutation invariance into our model. In particular, we show that graph neural
networks (GNNs) can be used to estimate the reward function, assuming it
resides in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of a permutation-invariant
additive kernel. By establishing a novel connection between such kernels and
the graph neural tangent kernel (GNTK), we introduce the first GNN confidence
bound and use it to design a phased-elimination algorithm with sublinear
regret. Our regret bound depends on the GNTK's maximum information gain, which
we also provide a bound for. While the reward function depends on all $N$ node
features, our guarantees are independent of the number of graph nodes $N$.
Empirically, our approach exhibits competitive performance and scales well on
graph-structured domains.

the electronic properties of sputtered NbN layers with a nominal thickness of
100 nm are studied by means of low-$T$/high-$\mu_{0}H$ magnetotransport

ions. In the as-grown NbN films, a local onset of superconductivity at
$T_\mathrm{loc}^\mathrm{onset}=15.72\,\mathrm{K}$ is found, while the global
superconducting ordering is achieved at
$T_\mathrm{glo}^\mathrm{offset}=15.05\,\mathrm{K}$, with a normal state
resistivity $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}=22\,{\mu\Omega}\cdot{\mathrm{cm}}$. Moreover,
upon Fe doping of NbN, $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}=40\,{\mu\Omega}\cdot{\mathrm{cm}}$

bosonic insulator state and the normal-metal-to-superconductor transition is
accompanied by six different electronic phases characterized by a $N$-shaped
$T$ dependence of $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}(T)$. The bosonic insulator state in a
$s$-wave conventional superconductor doped with dilute paramagnetic impurities
is predicted to represent a workbench for emergent phenomena, such as gapless

problem due to the spatially varying nature of the distortion, nonlinearity of

Existing methods often have strong statistical assumptions on the distortion
model which in many cases will lead to a limited performance in real-world
scenarios as they do not generalize. To overcome the challenge, this paper
presents an end-to-end physics-driven approach that is efficient and can
generalize to real-world turbulence. On the data synthesis front, we
significantly increase the image resolution that can be handled by the SOTA
turbulence simulator by approximating the random field via wide-sense
stationarity. The new data synthesis process enables the generation of
large-scale multi-level turbulence and ground truth pairs for training. On the
network design front, we propose the turbulence mitigation transformer (TMT), a
two stage U-Net shaped multi-frame restoration network which has a noval
efficient self-attention mechanism named temporal channel joint attention
(TCJA). We also introduce a new training scheme that is enabled by the new
simulator, and we design new transformer units to reduce the memory
consumption. Experimental results on both static and dynamic scenes are
promising, including various real turbulence scenarios.

Chandra X-ray (0.5-7 keV) data. This shows that the molecular ring, forming the
waist of the bipolar nebula, expands with a velocity of 1 - 1.9 km s$^{-1}$. We
also observe an increased linewidth in the ring indicating that turbulence is
driven by energy injection from the stellar feedback. The bipolar cavity hosts
blue-shifted expanding [CII] shells at 5.2$\pm$0.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$
(statistical and systematic uncertainty) which indicates that expansion out of
the dense gas happens non-uniformly and that the observed bipolar phase might
be relatively short ($\sim$0.2 Myr). The X-ray observations show diffuse
emission that traces a hot plasma, created by stellar winds, in and around RCW
36. At least 50 \% of the stellar wind energy is missing in RCW 36. This is
likely due to leakage which is clearing even larger cavities around the bipolar
RCW 36 region. Lastly, the cavities host high-velocity wings in [CII] which
indicates relatively high mass ejection rates ($\sim$5$\times$10$^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). This could be driven by stellar winds and/or radiation
pressure, but remains difficult to constrain. This local mass ejection, which
can remove all mass within 1 pc of RCW 36 in 1-2 Myr, and the large-scale
clearing of ambient gas in the Vela C cloud indicates that stellar feedback

efficiency increases with increasing coupling to the superconducting reservoir.
The second mechanism occurs in the regime of quasiparticle transport. Here we
obtain large efficiencies due to the presence of the superconducting gap and
the strong energy dependence of the electronic density of states around the gap
edges. Finally, in the third regime there exists a competition between Andreev

instance, spin-orbit interactions affect the magnetization and transport
dynamics in solids, while spins and momenta are locked in topological matter.
Alternatively, spin-orbit entanglement may play an important role in exotic
phenomena, like quantum spin liquids in 4d and 5d systems. An interesting
question is how electronic states mixed by spin orbit coupling interact with
electromagnetic fields, which may hold potential to tune their properties and
reveal interesting physics. Motivated by our recent discovery of large
gyrotropic signals in some Jahn-Teller manganites, here we explore the
interaction of light with spin-mixed states in a d4 transition metal. We show
that spin-orbit mixing enables electronic transitions that are sensitive to
circularly polarized light, giving rise to a gyrotropic response that increases
with spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, photoexcited transitions that involve
spin reversal are behind such gyrotropic resonances. Additionally, we find that
the interaction with the electromagnetic field depends strongly on the relative
orientation of the propagation of light with respect to Jahn-Teller distortions
and spin quantization. We suggest that such interactions offer the opportunity
to use electromagnetic waves at optical wavelengths to entangle orbital and
spin degrees of freedom. Our approach, which includes a group-theoretical
treatment of spin-orbit coupling, has wide applicability and provides a
versatile tool to explore the interaction of electromagnetic fields with
electronic states in transition metals with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling
strength and pointgroup symmetries.

synthesis models that translate source- onto target-contrast images. To
facilitate collaboration, federated learning (FL) adopts decentralized training
and mitigates privacy concerns by avoiding sharing of imaging data. However,
FL-trained synthesis models can be impaired by the inherent heterogeneity in
the data distribution, with domain shifts evident when common or variable
translation tasks are prescribed across sites. Here we introduce the first
personalized FL method for MRI Synthesis (pFLSynth) to improve reliability
against domain shifts. pFLSynth is based on an adversarial model that produces
latents specific to individual sites and source-target contrasts, and leverages
novel personalization blocks to adaptively tune the statistics and weighting of
feature maps across the generator stages given latents. To further promote site
specificity, partial model aggregation is employed over downstream layers of
the generator while upstream layers are retained locally. As such, pFLSynth
enables training of a unified synthesis model that can reliably generalize
across multiple sites and translation tasks. Comprehensive experiments on
multi-site datasets clearly demonstrate the enhanced performance of pFLSynth
against prior federated methods in multi-contrast MRI synthesis.

form more quiescently than hot Jupiters, which, in single-star systems, are
likely perturbed into a misaligned state through planet-planet interactions in

microstructural optimization, but the density field is represented through the
NN's weights and biases. The main characteristics of the proposed NN framework
are: (1) it supports automatic differentiation, eliminating the need for manual
sensitivity derivations, (2) smoothing filters are not required due to implicit
filtering, (3) the framework can be easily extended to multiple-materials, and
(4) a high-resolution microstructural topology can be recovered through a
simple post-processing step. The framework is illustrated through a variety of

patient specific abnormalities relating to surgical failure. We propose three
mechanisms contributing to poor surgical outcome; 1) failure to resect
abnormalities, 2) failing to remove all epileptogenic abnormalities, and 3)
insufficiently impacting the overall cortical abnormality. We develop markers
of these mechanisms, validating them against patient outcomes. Resting-state
MEG data were acquired for 70 healthy controls and 32 patients with refractory
neocortical epilepsy. Relative bandpower maps were computed using source
localised recordings from healthy controls. Patient and region-specific
bandpower abnormalities were estimated as the maximum absolute z-score, using
healthy data as a baseline. Resected regions were identified from
post-operative MRI. We hypothesised our mechanism markers would discriminate
patient's post-surgery seizure outcomes. Mechanisms of surgical failure
discriminate surgical outcome groups (Abnormalities not targeted: AUC=0.80,
Partial resection of the epileptogenic zone: AUC=0.68, Insufficient cortical
abnormality impact: AUC=0.64). Leveraging all markers together found that 95%
of those who were not seizure free had markers of surgical failure in at least
one of the three proposed mechanisms. In contrast, of those patients markers
for any mechanism, 80% were seizure-free. Abnormality mapping across the brain

observations and classically scheduled time; and ensuring fairness and
scientific independence of different Keck TACs and different KPF PIs. We
recommend establishing a new category of Keck time allocation, ""KPF Community

provided by CPS, but with higher observational cadence appropriate for KPF
science and with universal access to the program for all Keck users. We
recommend that KPF-CC time be scheduled classically into blocks as small as a
quarter night subject to considerations of bright/dark time, variations in
proposal pressure with the seasons, and the needs of non-KPF observing
programs. Within KPF-CC time, the Keck Observing Assistants would execute

the understanding and interpretation of GPR data. Traditional forward solvers
require excessive computational resources, especially when their repetitive
executions are needed in signal processing and/or machine learning algorithms
for GPR data inversion. To alleviate the computational burden, a deep
learning-based 2D GPR forward solver is proposed to predict the GPR B-scans of
subsurface objects buried in the heterogeneous soil. The proposed solver is
constructed as a bimodal encoder-decoder neural network. Two encoders followed
by an adaptive feature fusion module are designed to extract informative
features from the subsurface permittivity and conductivity maps. The decoder
subsequently constructs the B-scans from the fused feature representations. To
enhance the network's generalization capability, transfer learning is employed
to fine-tune the network for new scenarios vastly different from those in
training set. Numerical results show that the proposed solver achieves a mean
relative error of 1.28%. For predicting the B-scan of one subsurface object,
the proposed solver requires 12 milliseconds, which is 22,500x less than the
time required by a classical physics-based solver.

to handle the idiosyncrasies of category-specific confidence estimation. Chief
among these methods is the use of kernel density ratios for confidence
calibration including a novel, bulletproof algorithm for choosing the

Finally, our analysis argues that post-hoc calibration should always be
performed, should be based only on the test dataset, and should be
sanity-checked visually.

out-of-cellular-coverage areas, comparatively inefficient distributed radio

learn a scheduling policy that is robust and adaptable to environmental

real-life environments. We evaluate the performance of VRLS under varying

outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed scheduling algorithm in zones
without cellular network coverage by reducing the packet error rate by half in
highly loaded conditions and achieving near-maximum reliability in low-load

collapse in BNN due to its extreme sparsity, we design the Retention Matrices
to approximate spectral norms of the targeted weight matrices, which can be
deployed as the approximation for the Lipschitz constant of BNNs without the
exact Lipschitz constant computation (NP-hard). Our experiments prove that our

tasks. However, the design of model architecture remains an open question: In
general, learning all tasks with a shared set of parameters suffers from severe
interference between tasks; while learning each task with a dedicated parameter
subspace is limited by scalability. In this work, we theoretically analyze the
generalization errors for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual
learning, which can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task
distributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space.
Then, inspired by the robust biological learning system that processes
sequential experiences with multiple parallel compartments, we propose
Cooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL) as a general strategy for
continual learning. Specifically, we present an architecture with a fixed
number of narrower sub-networks to learn all incremental tasks in parallel,
which can naturally reduce the two errors through improving the three
components of the upper bound. To strengthen this advantage, we encourage to
cooperate these sub-networks by penalizing the difference of predictions made

improve a variety of representative continual learning approaches by a large

that we can reasonably approximate it as such on suitably large scales. The

builds on these assumptions to describe the origin and evolution of
fluctuations. With standard assumptions about stress-energy sources, this
system is specified by just seven phenomenological parameters, whose precise
relations to underlying fundamental theories are complicated and may depend on
details of those fields. Nevertheless, it is common practice to set the
parameter that characterizes the spatial curvature, $\Omega_K$, exactly to
zero. This parameter-fixed $\Lambda$CDM is awarded distinguished status as
separate model, ""flat $\Lambda$CDM.'' Ipso facto this places the onus on
proponents of ""curved $\Lambda$CDM'' to present sufficient evidence that
$\Omega_K\neq0$, and is needed as a parameter. While certain inflationary model
Lagrangians, with certain values of their parameters, and certain initial
conditions, will lead to a present-day universe well-described as containing
zero curvature, this does not justify distinguishing that subset of
Lagrangians, parameters and initial conditions into a separate model. Absent
any theoretical arguments, we cannot use observations that suggest small
$\Omega_K$ to enforce $\Omega_K=0$. Our track record in picking inflationary
models and their parameters a priori makes such a choice dubious, and concerns
about tensions in cosmological parameters and large-angle
cosmic-microwave-background anomalies strengthens arguments against this
choice. We argue that $\Omega_K$ must not be set to zero, and that $\Lambda$CDM
remains a phenomenological model with at least 7 parameters.

all other players follow their recommendations, each player is incentivized to
follow her recommendations regardless of whether she has done so at previous

interpretation of quantum phenomena observed in atomic systems. The bewildering
explanations advanced during the construction of quantum mechanics are shown to
have distanced the new theory from the rest of scientific knowledge, by
introducing indeterminism, acausality, nonlocality, and even subjectivism as
part of its interpretative framework. The conclusion drawn from this
unsatisfactory interpretative landscape is that quantum mechanics lacks a key
ontological ingredient. Arguments are given in favour of the random zero-point
radiation field (ZPF) as the element needed to complete the quantum ontology.
The (wave-mediated) quantum stochastic process is shown to be essentially
different from Brownian motion, and more amenable to an analogy with the
hydrodynamic case. The new perspective provided by the introduction of the ZPF
is used to explain some salient features of quantum systems, such as the
stationary atomic states and the transitions between them, and the apparent
nonlocality expressed in the entangled states. Notably, the permanent presence
of the field drastically affects the dynamics of the (otherwise classical)
particle, which eventually falls under the control of the field. This
qualitative change is reflected in the transition from the initial classical
description in space-time, to the final quantum one in the Hilbert space. The
clarification of the mechanism of quantization leads us to consider the
possibility that a similar phenomenon occurs in other physical systems of
corpuscles subjected to an oscillating background, of which the walking-droplet
system is a paradigmatic example.

a CT reconstruction problem using limited data. However, this approach relies

this work, we formulate the problem from the semantic image extension

samples are simulated using CT slices with complete body in FOV, making the
model development self-supervised. We evaluate the validity of the proposed

proposed method effectively restores the missing tissues and reduces BC

framework is termed disease specific imaging. Previously, 150 breast lesions
were segmented and classified utilizing a modified fully convolutional network
and a modified GoogLeNet, respectively. In this study multiparametric analysis
was performed within the contoured lesions. Features were extracted from
ultrasound radiofrequency, envelope, and log compressed data based on
biophysical and morphological models. The support vector machine with a
Gaussian kernel constructed a nonlinear hyperplane, and we calculated the
distance between the hyperplane and data point of each feature in
multiparametric space. The distance can quantitatively assess a lesion, and
suggest the probability of malignancy that is color coded and overlaid onto B
mode images. Training and evaluation were performed on in vivo patient data.
The overall accuracy for the most common types and sizes of breast lesions in
our study exceeded 98.0% for classification and 0.98 for an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve, which is more precise than the
performance of radiologists and a deep learning system. Further, the
correlation between the probability and BI RADS enables a quantitative
guideline to predict breast cancer. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed

interpreting rankings problematic as they are often treated as absolute

truncated during hard spectral states remains a contentious open question in
black hole astrophysics. During its singular observed outburst in
$2009\mbox{--}2010$, the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1752-223 spent
$\sim1$~month in a long-stable hard spectral state at a luminosity of
$\sim0.02\mbox{--}0.1~L_{\rm Edd}$. It was observed with 56 RXTE pointings
during this period, with simultaneous Swift-XRT daily coverage during the first
10 days of the RXTE observations. Whilst reflection modeling has been
extensively explored in the analysis of these data, there is a disagreement
surrounding the geometry of the accretion disk and corona implied by the
reflection features. We re-examine the combined, high signal-to-noise,
simultaneous Swift and RXTE observations, and perform extensive reflection
modeling with the latest relxill suite of reflection models, including newer
high disk density models. We show that reflection modeling requires that the
disk be within $\sim5~R_{\rm ISCO}$ during the hard spectral state, whilst
weaker constraints from the thermal disk emission imply higher truncation
($R_{\rm in}=6\mbox{--}80~R_{\rm ISCO}$). We also explore more complex coronal
continuum models, allowing for two Comptonization components instead of one,
and show that the reflection features still require only a mildly truncated
disk. Finally we present a full comparison of our results to previous
constraints found from analyses of the same dataset.

Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) through both the dielectron and dimuon

($R_{\mathrm{AA}}$), which quantify the level of yield suppression in heavy-ion
collisions compared to $p$+$p$ collisions, for $\Upsilon$(1S) and
$\Upsilon$(2S) are $0.40 \pm 0.03~\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.03~\textrm{(sys.)} \pm

limit of the $\Upsilon$(3S) $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ is 0.17 at a 95% confidence

significantly more suppressed than the $\Upsilon$(1S) at RHIC. The level of
suppression for $\Upsilon$(1S) is comparable to that observed at the much
higher collision energy at the Large Hadron Collider. These results point to
the creation of a medium at RHIC whose temperature is sufficiently high to
strongly suppress excited $\Upsilon$ states.

recent scientific study of interpolating methods, which perfectly fit their
training data. Certain interpolating methods, including neural networks, can
fit noisy training data without catastrophically bad test performance, in
defiance of standard intuitions from statistical learning theory. Aiming to
explain this, a body of recent work has studied benign overfitting, a
phenomenon where some interpolating methods approach Bayes optimality, even in
the presence of noise. In this work we argue that while benign overfitting has
been instructive and fruitful to study, many real interpolating methods like
neural networks do not fit benignly: modest noise in the training set causes
nonzero (but non-infinite) excess risk at test time, implying these models are
neither benign nor catastrophic but rather fall in an intermediate regime. We
call this intermediate regime tempered overfitting, and we initiate its
systematic study. We first explore this phenomenon in the context of kernel
(ridge) regression (KR) by obtaining conditions on the ridge parameter and
kernel eigenspectrum under which KR exhibits each of the three behaviors. We
find that kernels with powerlaw spectra, including Laplace kernels and ReLU
neural tangent kernels, exhibit tempered overfitting. We then empirically study
deep neural networks through the lens of our taxonomy, and find that those
trained to interpolation are tempered, while those stopped early are benign. We
hope our work leads to a more refined understanding of overfitting in modern
learning.

experienced a long-term runaway greenhouse condition because of a slow decline
in host-stellar luminosity in its pre-main sequence phase. Accordingly, they
might have lost significant portions of their atmospheres including water vapor
at high concentration by hydrodynamic escape induced by the strong stellar XUV
irradiation. However, the atmospheric escape rates remain highly uncertain due
partly to a lack of understanding of the effect of radiative cooling in the
escape outflows. Here we carry out 1-D hydrodynamic escape simulations for an
H$_{2}$-H$_{2}$O atmosphere on a planet with mass of $1M_{\oplus}$ considering
radiative and chemical processes to estimate the atmospheric escape rate and
follow the atmospheric evolution during the early runaway greenhouse phase. We
find that the atmospheric escape rate decreases with the basal H$_{2}$O/H$_{2}$
ratio due to the energy loss by the radiative cooling of H$_{2}$O and chemical
products such as OH and H$_{3}^{+}$: the escape rate of H$_{2}$ becomes one
order of magnitude smaller when the basal H$_{2}$O/H$_{2}=0.1$ than that of the
pure hydrogen atmosphere. The timescale for H$_{2}$ escape exceeds the duration
of the early runaway greenhouse phase, depending on the initial atmospheric
amount and composition, indicating that H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O could be left
behind after the end of the runaway greenhouse phase. Our results suggest that
temperate and reducing environments with oceans could be formed on some
terrestrial planets around M dwarfs.

  Human-Robot Interaction Loops","8+24 pages",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sim-to-real transfer is a powerful paradigm for robotic reinforcement
learning. The ability to train policies in simulation enables safe exploration
and large-scale data collection quickly at low cost. However, prior works in
sim-to-real transfer of robotic policies typically do not involve any
human-robot interaction because accurately simulating human behavior is an open
problem. In this work, our goal is to leverage the power of simulation to train
robotic policies that are proficient at interacting with humans upon
deployment. But there is a chicken and egg problem -- how to gather examples of
a human interacting with a physical robot so as to model human behavior in
simulation without already having a robot that is able to interact with a
human? Our proposed method, Iterative-Sim-to-Real (i-S2R), attempts to address
this. i-S2R bootstraps from a simple model of human behavior and alternates
between training in simulation and deploying in the real world. In each
iteration, both the human behavior model and the policy are refined. For all
training we apply a new evolutionary search algorithm called Blackbox Gradient
Sensing (BGS). We evaluate our method on a real world robotic table tennis
setting, where the objective for the robot is to play cooperatively with a
human player for as long as possible. Table tennis is a high-speed, dynamic
task that requires the two players to react quickly to each other's moves,
making for a challenging test bed for research on human-robot interaction. We
present results on an industrial robotic arm that is able to cooperatively play
table tennis with human players, achieving rallies of 22 successive hits on
average and 150 at best. Further, for 80% of players, rally lengths are 70% to
175% longer compared to the sim-to-real plus fine-tuning (S2R+FT) baseline. For

different from that of other road entities. Different conflict risk indicators,

assessment. In this study, correlated grouped random parameter logit models
with heterogeneity in the means are established to capture the unobserved
heterogeneity, with additional flexibility, at road user level for the
association between conflict risk and influencing factors. In addition,
modified conflict risk indicator is developed to assess the safety of
diverging, merging, and weaving movements of traffic, with which vehicles'
dimensions (width and length), and longitudinal and angular movements are
considered. Also, prevalence and severity of both rear-end and sideswipe
conflicts are assessed. Results indicate that toll collection type, vehicle's
location, average longitudinal speed, angular speed, acceleration, and vehicle
class all affect the risk of traffic conflicts. Furthermore, there are
significant correlation among the random parameters of severe traffic
conflicts. Proposed analytic method can accommodate the conflict risk analysis
for different conflict types and account for the correlation of unobserved
heterogeneity. Findings should shed light on appropriate remedial measures like
traffic signs, road markings, and advanced traffic management system that can

stained thin tissue specimens, where different types of stains are applied to
bring contrast to and highlight various desired histological features. However,
the destructive histochemical staining procedures are usually irreversible,
making it very difficult to obtain multiple stains on the same tissue section.
Here, we demonstrate a virtual stain transfer framework via a cascaded deep
neural network (C-DNN) to digitally transform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stained tissue images into other types of histological stains. Unlike a single
neural network structure which only takes one stain type as input to digitally
output images of another stain type, C-DNN first uses virtual staining to
transform autofluorescence microscopy images into H&E and then performs stain
transfer from H&E to the domain of the other stain in a cascaded manner. This
cascaded structure in the training phase allows the model to directly exploit
histochemically stained image data on both H&E and the target special stain of
interest. This advantage alleviates the challenge of paired data acquisition
and improves the image quality and color accuracy of the virtual stain transfer
from H&E to another stain. We validated the superior performance of this C-DNN
approach using kidney needle core biopsy tissue sections and successfully
transferred the H&E-stained tissue images into virtual PAS (periodic
acid-Schiff) stain. This method provides high-quality virtual images of special

overwhelmingly large number of proposals per video. This leads to complex model
designs due to proposal generation and/or per-proposal action instance
evaluation and the resultant high computational cost. In this work, for the
first time, we propose a proposal-free Temporal Action detection model with
Global Segmentation mask (TAGS). Our core idea is to learn a global
segmentation mask of each action instance jointly at the full video length. The
TAGS model differs significantly from the conventional proposal-based methods
by focusing on global temporal representation learning to directly detect local
start and end points of action instances without proposals. Further, by
modeling TAD holistically rather than locally at the individual proposal level,
TAGS needs a much simpler model architecture with lower computational cost.
Extensive experiments show that despite its simpler design, TAGS outperforms
existing TAD methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on two
benchmarks. Importantly, it is ~ 20x faster to train and ~1.6x more efficient
for inference. Our PyTorch implementation of TAGS is available at

important equations in fluid dynamics. The system describes the motion of
temperature-dependent incompressible flows. And the temperature naturally has
diffusion. Recently, Elgindi, Ghoul and Masmoudi constructed a $C^{1,\alpha}$
finite time blow-up solutions for Euler systems with finite energy. Inspired by
their works, we constructed $C^{1,\alpha}$ finite time blow-up solution for
Boussinesq equations where the temperature has diffusion and finite energy.
Generally speaking, the diffusion of temperature smooths the solution of the
system which is against the formations of singularity. The main difficulty is
that the Laplace operator of the temperature equation is not coercive under the
Sobolev weighted norm introduced by Elgindi. We introduced a new time depending
scaling formulation and new weighted Sobolev norms, under which we obtain the
nonlinear estimate. The new norm is well-coupled with the original norm, which
enables us to finish the proof.

report the analysis of {\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope's data towards the

4FGL sources. We also present the CO observational results of molecular clouds
in this region, using the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting

distribution of molecular gas at the distance of Masgomas-6a, indicating that
these gamma rays may be produced by CRs accelerated by massive stars in
Masgomas-6a. At the distance of $3.9{\rm \ kpc}$ of Masgomas-6a, the luminosity
of the extended source is $(1.81\pm0.02)\times 10^{35}{\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$.
With a kinetic luminosity of $\sim 10^{37}{\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ in the stellar
winds, the WR stars are capable of powering the $\gamma$-ray emission via
neutral pion decay resulted from cosmic ray $pp$ interactions. The size of the
GeV source and the energetic requirement suggests a CR diffusion coefficient
smaller than that in the Galactic interstellar medium, indicating strong

excessive computational load per iteration. To solve such large-scale ill-posed
systems efficiently, we develop in this paper a stochastic mirror descent

design. Therefore, our method scales very well with the problem size and has
the capability of capturing features of sought solutions. The convergence
property of the method depends crucially on the choice of step-sizes. We
consider various rules for choosing step-sizes and obtain convergence results

effect of semi-convergence. Furthermore, we establish an order optimal
convergence rate result when the sought solution satisfies a benchmark source

compact radio emission unresolved at a scale of <0.7 pc, with a brightness
temperature of T_b>5x10^7 K. The radio emission is variable by more than a
factor of 2.5 over a few days, based on the data taken from VLA monitoring
campaigns. The short-term radio variability suggests that the radio emitting
region has a size as small as 8x10^{-4} pc, resulting in an even higher
brightness temperature of T_b ~10^{12} K. A similar limit on the source size

the interstellar scintillation effect. The overall radio spectrum is steep with
a time-averaged spectral index alpha=-0.78+/-0.03 between 0.89 GHz and 14 GHz.

whether the compact and variable radio emission is correlated with the

demonstrate that this approach allows the detection of accreted stars that are

on flexible threshold values that can be adjusted easily to refine the

one-time encryption scheme with the following security guarantee: any non-local
adversary (A, B, C) cannot simultaneously distinguish encryptions of two equal
length messages. This notion is termed as unclonable indistinguishability.
Prior works focused on achieving a weaker notion of unclonable encryption,
where we required that any non-local adversary (A, B, C) cannot simultaneously
recover the entire message m. Seemingly innocuous, understanding the
feasibility of encryption schemes satisfying unclonable indistinguishability
(even for 1-bit messages) has remained elusive.
  We make progress towards establishing the feasibility of unclonable
encryption.
  - We show that encryption schemes satisfying unclonable indistinguishability
exist unconditionally in the quantum random oracle model.
  - Towards understanding the necessity of oracles, we present a negative
result stipulating that a large class of encryption schemes cannot satisfy
unclonable indistinguishability.
  - Finally, we also establish the feasibility of another closely related
primitive: copy-protection for single-bit output point functions. Prior works
only established the feasibility of copy-protection for multi-bit output point
functions or they achieved constant security error for single-bit output point
functions.

their magnetic field structures, i.e., magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), must be
revealed. We use three-dimensional magnetofriction simulations in a spherical
subdomain to investigate the role of typical supergranular motions in the
long-term formation of a prominence magnetic field. Time-dependant horizontal
supergranular motions with and without the effect of Coriolis force are
simulated on the solar surface via Voronoi tessellation. The vortical motions
by the Coriolis effect at boundaries of supergranules inject magnetic helicity
into the corona. The helicity is transferred and accumulated along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) as strongly sheared magnetic field via helicity
condensation. The diverging motions of supergranules converge opposite magnetic
polarities at the PIL and drive the magnetic reconnection between footpoints of
the sheared magnetic arcades to form an MFR. The magnetic network,
negative-helicity MFR in the northern hemisphere, and fragmented-to-continuous
formation process of magnetic dip regions are in agreement with observations.
Although diverging supergranulations, differential rotation, and meridional
flows are included, the simulation without the Coriolis effect can not produce
an MFR or sheared arcades to host a prominence. Therefore Coriolis force is a
key factor for helicity injection and the formation of magnetic structures of
quiescent solar prominences.

multi-level feature fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between
features from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation
to achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require heavy
cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result,
making them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address
these issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that
can help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the
computational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight
that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of
representations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a
locally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation,
where the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the
latter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global context
cues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to
investigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and
then refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and
light-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can
boost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive
experimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is
compatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection
accuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision and reduce their
complexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve

divergence, mutual information, Fisher information, and causality, are not
well-defined between complex networks. As a compromise, commonly used
strategies (e.g., network embedding, matching, and kernel approaches) measure
network relations in data-driven ways. These approaches are
computation-oriented and inapplicable to analytic derivations in mathematics
and physics. To resolve these issues, we present a theory to derive an optimal
characterization of network topological properties. Our theory shows that a
network can be fully represented by a Gaussian variable defined by a function
of the discrete Schr\""{o}dinger operator (i.e., the Laplacian), which
simultaneously satisfies network-topology-dependent smoothness and maximum
entropy properties. Based on this characterization, we can analytically measure
diverse relations between complex networks in terms of topology properties. As
illustrations, we primarily show how to define encoding (e.g., information
divergence and mutual information), decoding (e.g., Fisher information), and
causality (e.g., transfer entropy and Granger causality) between complex

evolutionary random network models, protein-protein interaction network, and
chemical compound networks), and demonstrate that a series of science and

information is encoded in the feeble quantum correlation after entanglement is
destroyed by loss and noise. For this reason, the optimal measurement design is
still elusive for various entanglement-enhanced protocols long after their
debut. We propose a conversion module to capture and transform the quantum
correlation to coherent quadrature displacement, which enables the optimal
receiver design for a wide range of entanglement-enhanced protocols, including
quantum illumination, phase estimation, classical communication, and arbitrary
thermal-loss channel pattern classification. Via heterodyne and passive linear
optics, the conversion module maps the multi-mode quantum detection problem to
the semi-classical detection problem of a single-mode noisy coherent state, so
that explicit measurements can be constructed to achieve the optimal
performance. Our module provides a paradigm of processing noisy quantum

Inspired by that, this paper proposes a simple yet effective patch-level

is then fed into a vision transformer to achieve robust representation.
Specifically, a spatiotemporal dropout operation is proposed to fully explore

binds to an antigen. The binding affinity is governed by the 3D binding
interface where antibody residues (paratope) closely interact with antigen
residues (epitope). Thus, predicting 3D paratope-epitope complex (docking) is
the key to finding the best paratope. In this paper, we propose a new model
called Hierarchical Equivariant Refinement Network (HERN) for paratope docking
and design. During docking, HERN employs a hierarchical message passing network
to predict atomic forces and use them to refine a binding complex in an
iterative, equivariant manner. During generation, its autoregressive decoder
progressively docks generated paratopes and builds a geometric representation
of the binding interface to guide the next residue choice. Our results show
that HERN significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on paratope docking
and design benchmarks.

extremely demanding: First, a WS entails very low densities where the Coulomb
interaction dominates over the kinetic (Fermi) energy. Attaining such low
densities while keeping the disorder low is very challenging. Second, the
low-density requirement has to be fulfilled in a material that hosts an
anisotropic Fermi sea. Here, we report transport measurements in a clean
(low-disorder) 2D electron system with anisotropic effective mass and Fermi
sea. The data reveal that at extremely low electron densities, when the r_s
parameter, the ratio of the Coulomb to the Fermi energy, exceeds 38, the
current-voltage characteristics become strongly nonlinear at small dc biases.
Several key features of the nonlinear characteristics, including their
anisotropic voltage thresholds, are consistent with the formation of a
disordered, anisotropic WS pinned by the ubiquitous disorder potential.

of corner-sharing isosceles triangles that are made of two crystallographically
distinct 3d7 Co2+ sites (Co(1) and Co(2)). The chains run along the b-axis and
are interconnected via [SeO3] groups to form a three-dimensional structure
mediating super-exchange interactions. The temperature dependent magnetization
data show a ferromagnetic-like (FM) transition at 11 K (T1) followed by an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 6 K (T2). Neutron-powder

magnetically, forming ferromagnetic zigzag chains along the b-axis. Below T2 =
6 K, both Co(1) and Co(2) sites order in an nearly orthogonal configuration,
with Co(1) moments lying inside the plane of the sawtooth chain while Co(2)
moments cant out of the plane. The canting of the magnetic moments leads to a
net ferromagnetic component along b-axis, parallel to the chain direction. The
ordered moments are fully compensated in the ac-plane.

\mathrm{keV}$ band from the nucleus of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A),
using a 100ks observation from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).
Nearly simultaneous observations of Cen A were also taken with the Swift,
NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL observatories. No statistically significant degree of
polarization is detected with IXPE. These observations have a minimum
detectable polarization at $99 \%$ percent confidence (MDP$_{99}$) of $6.5 \%$
using a weighted, spectral model-independent calculation in the $2-8 \thinspace
\mathrm{keV}$ band. The polarization angle $\psi$ is consequently
unconstrained. Spectral fitting across three orders of magnitude in X-ray
energy ($0.3-400 \thinspace \mathrm{keV}$) demonstrates that the SED of Cen A
is well described by a simple power law with moderate intrinsic absorption
($N_H \sim 10^{23} \thinspace \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and a Fe K$\alpha$ emission
line, although a second unabsorbed power law is required to account for the
observed spectrum at energies below $2 \thinspace \mathrm{keV}$. This spectrum
suggests that the reprocessing material responsible for this emission line is
optically thin and distant from the central black hole. Our upper limits on the
X-ray polarization are consistent with the predictions of Compton scattering,
although the specific seed photon population responsible for production of the
X-rays cannot be identified. The low polarization degree, variability in the
core emission, and the relative lack of variability in the Fe K$\alpha$
emission line support a picture where electrons are accelerated in a region of
highly disordered magnetic fields surrounding the innermost jet.

accumulated signal of continuous sharp moments during the exposure time, most
existing single image deblurring approaches aim to restore a fixed number of
frames using multiple networks and training stages. To address this problem, we
propose a continuous facial motion deblurring network based on GAN (CFMD-GAN),
which is a novel framework for restoring the continuous moment latent in a
single motion-blurred face image with a single network and a single training
stage. To stabilize the network training, we train the generator to restore
continuous moments in the order determined by our facial motion-based
reordering process (FMR) utilizing domain-specific knowledge of the face.
Moreover, we propose an auxiliary regressor that helps our generator produce
more accurate images by estimating continuous sharp moments. Furthermore, we
introduce a control-adaptive (ContAda) block that performs spatially deformable
convolution and channel-wise attention as a function of the control factor.
Extensive experiments on the 300VW datasets demonstrate that the proposed
framework generates a various number of continuous output frames by varying the
moment control factor. Compared with the recent single-to-single image
deblurring networks trained with the same 300VW training set, the proposed
method show the superior performance in restoring the central sharp frame in
terms of perceptual metrics, including LPIPS, FID and Arcface identity
distance. The proposed method outperforms the existing single-to-video
deblurring method for both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

candidates consistent with unresolved point sources at redshift $z\sim8$ using
deep Hubble Space Telescope images. We also examine G141 grism spectroscopic

identify three, bright ($M_{UV}\lesssim-22$ ABmag) dropout point sources at
$7.5<z<8.1$. Spectral energy distribution analyses suggest that these sources
are either quasars or compact star-forming galaxies. The flux captured by the
IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m channel suggests that they have moderate $H\beta$+$[OIII]$

non-negligible contribution to the bright-end excess. The fact that the point

we ignore the dynamical friction caused by the slip processes of contact
points. The theoretical rigidity agrees with that obtained by molecular
dynamics simulations. We confirm that the rigidity is smoothly connected to the
value in the frictionless limit. For the density of states, we find that there
are two modes in the density of states for sufficiently small $k_{T}/k_{N}$,
which is the ratio of the tangential to normal stiffness. Rotational modes
exist at low frequencies or small eigenvalues, whereas translational modes
exist at high frequencies or large eigenvalues. The location of the rotational
band shifts to the high-frequency region with an increase in $k_{T}/k_{N}$ and
becomes indistinguishable from the translational band for large $k_{T}/k_{N}$.
The rigidity determined by the translational modes agrees with that obtained by
the molecular dynamics simulations, whereas the contribution of the rotational
modes is almost zero for small $k_{T}/k_{N}$.

fifth-generation (5G-advanced) cellular networks to enable a wide variety of

relied on (1) cellular temporal/angular-based positioning methods to provide
the indoor environments with a moderate positioning accuracy that is well below
the positioning requirements of these future use cases and (2) highly precise
satellite carrier phase/code-based positioning methods for the outdoor
deployments that are limited by the availability of the satellite coverage.
This paper defines the relevant standard mechanisms and algorithms to use the
carrier phase cellular-based measurements as a potential solution to achieve a
high-precision positioning estimation accuracy in 5G-advanced NR networks. The
presented positioning technique is evaluated using high-fidelity system-level
simulations for indoor factory (InF) deployment scenarios. The numerical
results demonstrate that the presented technique can significantly improve the
positioning accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art NR positioning methods.
Our findings in this paper also show that the carrier phase method not only
provides an indoor complement to the outdoor satellite positioning but also
provides an outdoor alternative to the high-precision satellite methods.

sub-optimal solutions for unpaired I2I. To this end, we propose energy-guided
stochastic differential equations (EGSDE) that employs an energy function
pretrained on both the source and target domains to guide the inference process
of a pretrained SDE for realistic and faithful unpaired I2I. Building upon two
feature extractors, we carefully design the energy function such that it
encourages the transferred image to preserve the domain-independent features
and discard domain-specific ones. Further, we provide an alternative
explanation of the EGSDE as a product of experts, where each of the three
experts (corresponding to the SDE and two feature extractors) solely
contributes to faithfulness or realism. Empirically, we compare EGSDE to a
large family of baselines on three widely-adopted unpaired I2I tasks under four
metrics. EGSDE not only consistently outperforms existing SBDMs-based methods
in almost all settings but also achieves the SOTA realism results without
harming the faithful performance. Furthermore, EGSDE allows for flexible
trade-offs between realism and faithfulness and we improve the realism results
further (e.g., FID of 51.04 in Cat to Dog and FID of 50.43 in Wild to Dog on
AFHQ) by tuning hyper-parameters. The code is available at

However, how to detect and classify multipartite non-Gaussian entanglement has

practical method to characterize continuous-variable multipartite non-Gaussian

involving accessible higher-order moments of phase-space quadratures. As these
parameters can depend on arbitrary operators, we consider their analytical
optimization over a set of practical measurements, in order to detect different
classes of multipartite non-Gaussian entanglement ranging from fully separable
to fully inseparable. We demonstrate that the nonlinear squeezing parameters
act as an excellent approximation to the quantum Fisher information within
accessible third-order moments. The level of the nonlinear squeezing quantifies
the metrological advantage provided by those entangled states. Moreover, by
analyzing the above mentioned experiment, we show that our method can be
readily used to confirm fully inseparable tripartite non-Gaussian entangled
states by performing a limited number of measurements without requiring full

method utilizes the scattering angles of particles precisely measured in the

information on the decrease of the energy as the particle travels through the
detector. According to the Monte Carlo simulations, this method can measure
momentum with a resolution of 10% for muons of 500 MeV/c passing through the

depending on the momentum and emission angle of the particle. By accounting for
the effect of the energy decrease, the momentum can be reconstructed correctly
with less bias, particularly in the low-momentum region. We apply this method
to measure the momentum of muon tracks detected in the NINJA experiment where
the momentum is also measured independently by using the track range. The two
measurements agree well within experimental uncertainties, verifying the method
experimentally. This method will extend the measurable phase space of muons and
hadrons in the NINJA experiment.

which is used to pass information by constructing C2 networks. And they often
use the method of frequently changing domain names and server IP addresses to
evade monitoring, which makes it extremely difficult to detect them. However,
they carry DNS tunnel information traffic in normal DNS communication, which
inevitably brings anomalies in some statistical characteristics of DNS traffic,
so that it would provide security personnel with the opportunity to find them.
Based on the above considerations, this paper studies the statistical discovery
methodology of typical DNS tunnel high-frequency query behavior. Firstly, we
analyze the distribution of the DNS domain name length and times and finds that
the DNS domain name length and times follow the normal distribution law.
Secondly, based on this distribution law, we propose a method for detecting and
discovering high-frequency DNS query behaviors of non-single domain names based
on the statistical rules of domain name length and frequency and we also give
three theorems as theoretical support. Thirdly, we design a sliding window
difference scheme based on the above method. Experimental results show that our
method has a higher detection rate. At the same time, since our method does not
need to construct a data set, it has better practicability in detecting unknown
DNS tunnels. This also shows that our detection method based on mathematical
models can effectively avoid the dilemma for machine learning methods that must
have useful training data sets, and has strong practical significance.

unlabeled real hazy images can adapt existing well-trained source networks.
Besides, the unsupervised losses are applied to guide the learning of the DRN

losses provide structure and style constraints, while the prior loss explores
the inherent statistic property of haze-free images. Equipped with our DRN

which problem structures admit a DD representation is still open in the DDs
community. In this paper, we address this question by introducing a geometric

necessary and sufficient conditions for a general MIP to be representable by

  Retrieval Model","Accepted by ICML 23'",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  User embeddings (vectorized representations of a user) are essential in
recommendation systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a
representation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks,
and they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems as
well. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to
represent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's
interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important
to model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference
change with time. However, existing approaches either fail to estimate the
user's affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every interest of every
user fades with an equal rate with time, thus hurting the recall of candidate
retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference (MIP) model,
an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using the user's
sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns a set of
weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates
can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have
been done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach.

The existence of $H$-subdivisions within a graph $G$ has deep connections with

of such connections, due to Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason and independently
Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi, asserts that the average degree of $G$ being $d$
ensures a $K_{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$-subdivision in $G$. Although this square-root
bound is best possible, various results showed that much larger clique
subdivisions can be found in a graph from many natural classes. We investigate
the connection between crux, a notion capturing the essential order of a graph,
and the existence of large clique subdivisions. This reveals the unifying cause
underpinning all those improvements for various classes of graphs studied.
Roughly speaking, when embedding subdivisions, natural space constraints arise;
and such space constraints can be measured via crux.
  Our main result gives an asymptotically optimal bound on the size of a
largest clique subdivision in a generic graph $G$, which is determined by both
its average degree and its crux size. As corollaries, we obtain (1) a
characterisation of extremal graphs for which the square-root bound above is
tight: they are essentially disjoint union of graphs each of which has the crux
size linear in $d$; (2) a unifying approach to find a clique subdivision of
almost optimal size in graphs which does not contain a fixed bipartite graph as
a subgraph; (3) and that the clique subdivision size in random graphs $G(n,p)$
witnesses a dichotomy: when $p = \omega(n^{-1/2})$, the barrier is the space,

implicit models which can be simulated from, but for which the corresponding
likelihood is intractable. However, common likelihood-free methods do not scale
well to a large number of model parameters. A promising approach to
high-dimensional likelihood-free inference involves estimating low-dimensional
marginal posteriors by conditioning only on summary statistics believed to be
informative for the low-dimensional component, and then combining the
low-dimensional approximations in some way. In this paper, we demonstrate that
such low-dimensional approximations can be surprisingly poor in practice for
seemingly intuitive summary statistic choices. We describe an idealized
low-dimensional summary statistic that is, in principle, suitable for marginal
estimation. However, a direct approximation of the idealized choice is
difficult in practice. We thus suggest an alternative approach to marginal
estimation which is easier to implement and automate. Given an initial choice
of low-dimensional summary statistic that might only be informative about a
marginal posterior location, the new method improves performance by first
crudely localising the posterior approximation using all the summary statistics
to ensure global identifiability, followed by a second step that hones in on an
accurate low-dimensional approximation using the low-dimensional summary
statistic. We show that the posterior this approach targets can be represented
as a logarithmic pool of posterior distributions based on the low-dimensional

is illustrated in several examples.

(WTAL) applies a localization-by-classification paradigm to detect and classify

class-specific background snippets are inevitably mis-activated to improve the
discriminability of the classifier in WTAL. To alleviate the disturbance of
background, existing methods try to enlarge the discrepancy between action and
background through modeling background snippets with pseudo-snippet-level
annotations, which largely rely on artificial hypotheticals. Distinct from the
previous works, we present an adversarial learning strategy to break the
limitation of mining pseudo background snippets. Concretely, the background
classification loss forces the whole video to be regarded as the background by
a background gradient reinforcement strategy, confusing the recognition model.
Reversely, the foreground(action) loss guides the model to focus on action
snippets under such conditions. As a result, competition between the two
classification losses drives the model to boost its ability for action
modeling. Simultaneously, a novel temporal enhancement network is designed to
facilitate the model to construct temporal relation of affinity snippets based
on the proposed strategy, for further improving the performance of action
localization. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS14 and

distances often achieve a better estimation of rigid transformation than those
minimizing point-to-point distances. Nevertheless, recent deep-learning-based
methods minimize the point-to-point distances. In contrast to these methods,
this paper proposes the first deep-learning-based approach to point-to-plane
registration. A challenging part of this problem is that a typical solution for
point-to-plane registration requires an iterative process of accumulating small
transformations obtained by minimizing a linearized energy function. The
iteration significantly increases the size of the computation graph needed for
backpropagation and can slow down both forward and backward network
evaluations. To solve this problem, we consider the estimated rigid
transformation as a function of input point clouds and derive its analytic
gradients using the implicit function theorem. The analytic gradient that we
introduce is independent of how the error minimizing function (i.e., the rigid
transformation) is obtained, thus allowing us to calculate both the rigid
transformation and its gradient efficiently. We implement the proposed
point-to-plane registration module over several previous methods that minimize
point-to-point distances and demonstrate that the extensions outperform the
base methods even with point clouds with noise and low-quality point normals

understanding (SLU) systems and are beginning to achieve competitive
performance to pipeline-based approaches. However, recent work has shown that
these models struggle to generalize to new phrasings for the same intent
indicating that models cannot understand the semantic content of the given
utterance. In this work, we incorporated language models pre-trained on
unlabeled text data inside E2E-SLU frameworks to build strong semantic
representations. Incorporating both semantic and acoustic information can
increase the inference time, leading to high latency when deployed for
applications like voice assistants. We developed a 2-pass SLU system that makes
low latency prediction using acoustic information from the few seconds of the
audio in the first pass and makes higher quality prediction in the second pass
by combining semantic and acoustic representations. We take inspiration from
prior work on 2-pass end-to-end speech recognition systems that attends on both
audio and first-pass hypothesis using a deliberation network. The proposed
2-pass SLU system outperforms the acoustic-based SLU model on the Fluent Speech
Commands Challenge Set and SLURP dataset and reduces latency, thus improving
user experience. Our code and models are publicly available as part of the

entered the United States from Mexico in the late 1800s. This pest has been
nearly eradicated; however, southern part of Texas still faces this issue and

climate where cotton plants can grow year-round. Volunteer cotton (VC) plants
growing in the fields of inter-seasonal crops, like corn, can serve as hosts to
these pests once they reach pin-head square stage (5-6 leaf stage) and
therefore need to be detected, located, and destroyed or sprayed . In this
paper, we present a study to detect VC plants in a corn field using YOLOv3 on
three band aerial images collected by unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The
two-fold objectives of this paper were : (i) to determine whether YOLOv3 can be
used for VC detection in a corn field using RGB (red, green, and blue) aerial
images collected by UAS and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on
images at three different scales (320 x 320, S1; 416 x 416, S2; and 512 x 512,
S3 pixels) based on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP) and

also found for F1-score between S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). The lack of significant

designed to maintain collectively a distributed machine tolerant to Byzantine

centralized computers that perform trustable verifiable computations, where all
computations are deterministic and the results cannot be manipulated or undone.
Smart-contracts are written in a special-purpose programming language with
deterministic semantics. Each transaction begins with an invocation from an
external user to a smart contract. Contracts have local storage and can call
other contracts, and more importantly, they store, send and receive
cryptocurrency. It is very important to guarantee that contracts are correct
before deployment since their code cannot be modified afterward deployment.
However, the resulting ecosystem makes it very difficult to reason about
program correctness, since contracts can be executed by malicious users or
malicious contracts can be designed to exploit other contracts that call them.
Many attacks and bugs are caused by unexpected interactions between multiple
contracts, the attacked contract and unknown code that performs the exploit.
Moreover, there is a very aggressive competition between different blockchains
to expand their user base. Ideas are implemented fast and blockchains compete
to offer and adopt new features quickly. In this paper, we propose a formal
extensible playground that allows reasoning about multi-contract interactions
to ultimately prove properties before features are incorporated into the real
blockchain. We implemented a model of computation that models the execution
platform, abstracts the internal code of each individual contract and focuses
on contract interactions. Moreover, we show how many features, existing or

network is based on the deployment of urban and rural scenarios with an unknown
CSI (Channel State Information). Depending on the achieved path loss based on
the distance of the user from the BS, the user with the highest path loss is
particularized for the attack. The formulation of AD divulges the increased
susceptibilities of the secure network specifically for the selected legitimate
user. The parameter of visibility defines the amount of AD present in the
communication channel. Based on the enumerated attenuation created by the
artificial dust, the parameter of secrecy rate is evaluated with varying
distance of the user from the BS and the operating frequency. Furthermore, the
proposed scheme of the HD attack is initiated by the intruder at the specified
valid user. The strategy of the attack focuses on the continuous monitor of the
uplink and attempts the spoofing attack on the downlink wherein the allocation
of the resources takes place. The efficacy of the proposed approach is

benefits on global optimization and high maintainability for real applications.
However, the input scale has always been a tough trade-off since recognizing a

high computational costs. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a
novel cost-efficient Dynamic Low-resolution Distillation (DLD) text spotting
framework, which aims to infer images in different small but recognizable
resolutions and achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency.
Concretely, we adopt a resolution selector to dynamically decide the input
resolutions for different images, which is constraint by both inference
accuracy and computational cost. Another sequential knowledge distillation
strategy is conducted on the text recognition branch, making the low-res input
obtains comparable performance to a high-res image. The proposed method can be
optimized end-to-end and adopted in any current text spotting framework to
improve the practicability. Extensive experiments on several text spotting

explored by direct detection experiments that used calorimetric techniques to
measure the energy of the cosmic particles. Interesting spectral features have
been observed in both all-electron and nuclei spectra. However, the
interpretation of the results is compromised by the disagreements between the
data obtained from the various experiments, that are not reconcilable with the
quoted experimental uncertainties. Understanding the reason for the discrepancy
among the measurements is of fundamental importance in view of the forthcoming
high-energy cosmic-ray experiments planned for space, as well as for the
correct interpretation of the available results. The purpose of this work is to
investigate the possibility that a systematic effect may derive from the
non-proportionality of the light response of inorganic crystals, typically used
in high-energy calorimetry due to their excellent energy-resolution
performance. The main reason for the non-proportionality of the crystals is
that scintillation light yield depends on ionisation density. Experimental data
obtained with ion beams were used to characterize the light response of various
scintillator materials. The obtained luminous efficiencies were used as input
of a Monte Carlo simulation to perform a comparative study of the effect of the
light-yield non-proportionality on the detection of high-energy electromagnetic
and hadronic showers. The result of this study indicates that, if the
calorimeter response is calibrated by using the energy deposit of minimum
ionizing particles, the measured shower energy might be affected by a
significant systematic shift, at the level of few percent, whose sign and
magnitude depend specifically on the type of scintillator material used.

  In this paper, we develop rank classification heuristics modeled by deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Similarly to widely used Mestre-Nagao
sums, it takes as an input the conductor of E and a sequence of normalized
a_p-s (where a_p=p+1-#E(F_p) if p is a prime of good reduction) in some range
(p<10^k for k=3,4,5), and tries to predict rank (or detect curves of ``high''

custom dataset consisting of elliptic curves with trivial torsion, conductor up
to 10^30, and rank up to 10. For comparison, eight simple neural network models

  Experiments showed that CNN performed better than Mestre-Nagao sums on the

Mestre-Nagao sums performed much better than each sum individually), while they
were roughly equal on custom made dataset.

estimating aggregate quantities for a population based on an observation of
individuals in a subpopulation. In this context, a geostatistical workflow must
account for three major sources of `aggregation error': aggregation weights,
fine scale variation, and finite population variation. However, common practice
is to treat the unknown population distribution as a known population density
and ignore empirical variability in outcomes. We improve common practice by
introducing a `sampling frame model' that allows aggregation models to account
for the three sources of aggregation error simply and transparently.
  We compare the proposed and the traditional approach using two simulation
studies that mimic neonatal mortality rate (NMR) data from the 2014 Kenya
Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS2014). For the traditional approach,
undercoverage/overcoverage depends arbitrarily on the aggregation grid
resolution, while the new approach exhibits low sensitivity. The differences
between the two aggregation approaches increase as the population of an area
decreases. The differences are substantial at the second administrative level
and finer, but also at the first administrative level for some population
quantities. We find differences between the proposed and traditional approach
are consistent with those we observe in an application to NMR data from the
KDHS2014.

decoherence process, with or without energy dissipation, and compare the
results with the case in which the initial state of the system is a mixed state
and thus decoherence is absent. When we choose an interaction Hamiltonian such
that the energy and coherence of the system change simultaneously, the
population change of the system and the energy change are the same when the
initial state is mixed. However, the decoherence terms increase the von Neumann
entropy of the system. In this case the energy change and decoherence of the
system are not independent physical processes. The decoherence process
maintains unitarity. On the other hand, if the interaction Hamiltonian does not
change the energy of the system, there is only the decoherence effect. The

a new method for phononic crystal engineering of nanomechanical oscillators

the introduction of additional bending losses resulting from the variation of
material density, the added mass constitutes an array of nanopillars in which
the losses will be diluted. Using this novel technique for phononic crystal
engineering, we design and fabricate corrugated mechanical oscillators with
quality factors approaching one billion in a room temperature environment. The
flexibility space of these new phononic crystals is large and further
advancement can be attained through optimized phononic crystal patterning and
strain engineering via topology optimization. This will allow for the
engineering of mechanical membranes with quality factors approaching 10

model with global three-dimensional (3D) geometry, has been implemented in the
space weather forecasting tool EUHFORIA (Pomoell and Poedts, 2018). By
incorporating this advanced flux rope model in EUHFORIA, we aim to improve the
modelling of CME flank encounters and, most importantly, the magnetic field
predictions at Earth. After using synthetic events to showcase FRi3D's
capabilities of modelling CME flanks, we optimize the model to run robust
simulations of real events and test its predictive capabilities. We perform
observation-based modelling of the halo CME event that erupted on 12 July 2012.
The geometrical input parameters are constrained using the forward modelling
tool included in FRi3D with additional flux rope geometry flexibilities as
compared to the pre-existing models. The magnetic field input parameters are
derived using the differential evolution algorithm to fit FRi3D parameters to
the in situ data at 1 AU. An observation-based approach to constrain the
density of CMEs is adopted, in order to achieve a better estimation of mass
corresponding to the FRi3D geometry. The CME is evolved in EUHFORIA's
heliospheric domain and a comparison of FRi3D's predictive performance with the
previously implemented spheromak CME in EUHFORIA is presented. For this event,
FRi3D improves the modelling of the total magnetic field magnitude and Bz at
Earth by ~30% and ~70%, respectively. Moreover, we compute the expected
geoeffectiveness of the storm at Earth using an empirical Dst model and find
that the FRi3D model improves the predictions of minimum Dst by ~20% as
compared to the spheromak CME model. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the
current implementation of FRi3D in EUHFORIA and propose possible improvements.

interpreted on sequences of valuations of variables over an infinite domain.
The atomic formulas are interpreted as constraints on the valuations. The
atomic formulas can constrain valuations over a range of positions along a
sequence, with the range being bounded by a parameter depending on the formula.
The satisfiability and model checking problems for CLTL have been studied by
Demri and D'Souza. We consider the realizability problem for CLTL. The set of
variables is partitioned into two parts, with each part controlled by a player.
Players take turns to choose valuations for their variables, generating a
sequence of valuations. The winning condition is specified by a CLTL formula --
the first player wins if the sequence of valuations satisfies the specified
formula. We study the decidability of checking whether the first player has a
winning strategy in the realizability game for a given CLTL formula. We prove
that it is decidable in the case where the domain satisfies the completion
property, a property introduced by Balbiani and Condotta in the context of
satisfiability. We prove that it is undecidable over $(\mathbb{Z},<,=)$, the
domain of integers with order and equality. We prove that over
$(\mathbb{Z},<,=)$, it is decidable if the atomic constraints in the formula
can only constrain the current valuations of variables belonging to the second
player, but there are no such restrictions for the variables belonging to the
first player. We call this single-sided games.

femtosecond timescale magnetization dynamics. However, sub-femtosecond spin
dynamics have not yet been observed or predicted. Here, we explore ultrafast
light-driven spin dynamics in a highly non-resonant strong-field regime.
Through state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations, we predict that a non-magnetic
material can be transiently transformed into a magnetic one via dynamical
extremely nonlinear spin-flipping processes, which occur on attosecond
timescales and are mediated by a combination of multi-photon and spin-orbit
interactions. These are non-perturbative non-resonant analogues to the inverse
Faraday effect that build up from cycle-to-cycle as electrons gain angular
momentum. Remarkably, we show that even for linearly polarized driving, where
one does not intuitively expect any magnetic response, the magnetization
transiently oscillates as the system interacts with light. This oscillating
response is enabled by transverse anomalous light-driven currents in the solid,
and typically occurs on timescales of ~500 attoseconds. We further demonstrate
that the speed of magnetization can be controlled by tuning the laser
wavelength and intensity. An experimental set-up capable of measuring these
dynamics through pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy is outlined and
simulated. Our results pave the way for new regimes of ultrafast manipulation
of magnetism.

from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with our method. The time-frequency maps
of the binary black hole coalescence cases show much better details compared to
those wavelet spectra. Moreover, the oscillation in the instantaneous frequency
caused by mode-mixing could be reduced with our algorithm. For the CCSNe data,
the oscillation from the proto-neutron star and the radiation from the standing
accretion shock instability can be precisely determined with the HHT in great
detail. More importantly, the initial stage of different modes of oscillations
can be clearly separated. These results provide new hints for further

involving Neumann boundary conditions (BCs). This is also due to
ill-conditioning issues affecting the interpolation matrix when boundary
derivatives are imposed in strong form. In this paper these ill-conditioning
issues and subsequent instabilities affecting the application of the RBF-FD
method in presence of Neumann BCs are analyzed both theoretically and
numerically. The theoretical motivations for the onset of such issues are
derived by highlighting the dependence of the determinant of the local
interpolation matrix upon the boundary normals. Qualitative investigations are
also carried out numerically by studying a reference stencil and looking for
correlations between its geometry and the properties of the associated
interpolation matrix. Based on the previous analyses, two approaches are
derived to overcome the initial problem. The corresponding stabilization
properties are finally assessed by succesfully applying such approaches to the
stabilization of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition.

Measurements from TW-1 and near-Earth spacecraft show similar double-power-law

qubits in an $\mathcal{APT}$-symmetric system. In the $\mathcal{APT}$-symmetric
unbroken regime, our theoretical simulations demonstrate the periodic
oscillations of entanglement when each qubit evolves identically, while the
nonperiodic oscillations of entanglement when each qubit evolves differently.
In particular, when each qubit evolves near the exceptional point in the
$\mathcal{APT}$-symmetric unbroken regime, there exist entanglement sudden
vanishing and revival. Moreover, our simulations demonstrate rapid decay and
delayed death of entanglement provided one qubit evolves in the
$\mathcal{APT}$-symmetric broken regime. In this work, we also perform an

two subparts: the text reading part for obtaining the plain text from the
original document images and the information extraction part for extracting key
contents. These methods mainly focus on improving the second, while neglecting
that the two parts are highly correlated. This paper proposes a unified
end-to-end information extraction framework from visually rich documents, where
text reading and information extraction can reinforce each other via a
well-designed multi-modal context block. Specifically, the text reading part
provides multi-modal features like visual, textual and layout features. The
multi-modal context block is developed to fuse the generated multi-modal
features and even the prior knowledge from the pre-trained language model for
better semantic representation. The information extraction part is responsible
for generating key contents with the fused context features. The framework can
be trained in an end-to-end trainable manner, achieving global optimization.
What is more, we define and group visually rich documents into four categories

provide or recommend the corresponding benchmarks, experimental settings and
strong baselines for remedying the problem that this research area lacks the
uniform evaluation standard. Extensive experiments on four kinds of benchmarks

nonequilibrium process from the measurements of first-passage quantities
associated with a single current. For first-passage processes with large
thresholds, Refs. [1, 2] identified a ratio of first-passage observables -
involving the mean first-passage time, the splitting probability, and the
first-passage thresholds - that lower bounds the entropy production rate and is
an unbiased estimator of the entropy production rate when applied to a current
that is proportional to the stochastic entropy production. Here, we show that
also at finite thresholds, a finite number of realisations of the
nonequilibrium process, and for currents that are not proportional to the
stochastic entropy production, first-passage ratios can accurately estimate the
rate of dissipation. In particular, first-passage ratios capture a finite
fraction of the total entropy production rate in regimes far from thermal
equilibrium where thermodynamic uncertainty ratios capture a negligible
fraction of the total entropy production rate. Moreover, we show that
first-passage ratios incorporate nonMarkovian statistics in the estimated value
of the dissipation rate, which are difficult to include in estimates based on
Kullback-Leibler divergences. Taken together, we show that entropy production
estimation with first-passage ratios is complementary to estimation methods
based on thermodynamic uncertainty ratios and Kullback-Leibler divergences.

  Deep Learning",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel imaging technique whose working
principle is based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory. In SPI, data is
obtained through a series of compressive measurements and the corresponding
image is reconstructed. Typically, the reconstruction algorithm such as basis
pursuit relies on the sparsity assumption in images. However, recent advances
in deep learning have found its uses in reconstructing CS images. Despite
showing a promising result in simulations, it is often unclear how such an
algorithm can be implemented in an actual SPI setup. In this paper, we
demonstrate the use of deep learning on the reconstruction of SPI images in
conjunction with block compressive sensing (BCS). We also proposed a novel
reconstruction model based on convolutional neural networks that outperforms
other competitive CS reconstruction algorithms. Besides, by incorporating BCS
in our deep learning model, we were able to reconstruct images of any size
above a certain smallest image size. In addition, we show that our model is
capable of reconstructing images obtained from an SPI setup while being priorly
trained on natural images, which can be vastly different from the SPI images.
This opens up opportunity for the feasibility of pretrained deep learning
models for CS reconstructions of images from various domain areas.

determined host galaxy contributions, the narrow emission lines of SDSS J0838
in the SDSS spectrum and in the eBOSS spectrum can be well measured by Gaussian

the eBOSS fiber with diameter of 2 arcseconds. Meanwhile, both none broad

catastrophic forgetting problem in incremental learning. Considering that
different tasks may need different structures, recent methods design dynamic
structures adapted to different tasks via sophisticated skills. Their routine
is to search expandable structures first and then train on the new tasks,
which, however, breaks tasks into multiple training stages, leading to
suboptimal or overmuch computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end trainable adaptively expandable network named E2-AEN, which
dynamically generates lightweight structures for new tasks without any accuracy
drop in previous tasks. Specifically, the network contains a serial of powerful
feature adapters for augmenting the previously learned representations to new
tasks, and avoiding task interference. These adapters are controlled via an
adaptive gate-based pruning strategy which decides whether the expanded
structures can be pruned, making the network structure dynamically changeable
according to the complexity of the new tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel
sparsity-activation regularization to encourage the model to learn
discriminative features with limited parameters. E2-AEN reduces cost and can be
built upon any feed-forward architectures in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments on both classification (i.e., CIFAR and VDD) and detection (i.e.,
COCO, VOC and ICCV2021 SSLAD challenge) benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves the new remarkable

directed acyclic network. In such a network, a sink node is required to compute
with zero error a target function of which the inputs are generated as source
messages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access any one
but not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not
allowed to obtain any information about a security function of the source
messages. The secure computing capacity for the above model is defined as the
maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely
computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap
sets and security function for one use of the network. The characterization of
this capacity is in general overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we
consider securely computing linear functions with a wiretapper who can
eavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size r, referred to as the
security level, with the security function being the identity function. We
first prove an upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is
applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. When
the security level r is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing
capacity without security consideration. We discover the surprising fact that
for some models, there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared
with the computing capacity without security consideration. We further obtain
an equivalent expression of the upper bound by using a graph-theoretic
approach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this
bound. Furthermore, we present a construction of linear function-computing
secure network codes and obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity.

an essential video processing technique that can be applied to various

motion well, especially in high-resolution videos such as 4K videos. To
eliminate such limitations, we introduce a neighbor correspondence matching
(NCM) algorithm for flow-based frame synthesis. Since the current frame is not
available in video frame synthesis, NCM is performed in a
current-frame-agnostic fashion to establish multi-scale correspondences in the
spatial-temporal neighborhoods of each pixel. Based on the powerful motion
representation capability of NCM, we further propose to estimate intermediate
flows for frame synthesis in a heterogeneous coarse-to-fine scheme.
Specifically, the coarse-scale module is designed to leverage neighbor
correspondences to capture large motion, while the fine-scale module is more
computationally efficient to speed up the estimation process. Both modules are
trained progressively to eliminate the resolution gap between training dataset

state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. In addition, NCM can be
applied to various practical scenarios such as video compression to achieve

expanded and analysed using the asymptotic homogenisation technique which
yields three partially novel systems of PDEs, one governing the

with the interplay between language and meaning, can be used to describe
vocabulary acquisition, that is the process with which a speaker $p$ acquires
new vocabulary (through experience or interaction). We model two different
kinds of vocabulary acquisition, which we call `by example' and `by
paraphrasis'. The former captures the idea of acquiring the meaning of a word
by being shown a witness representing that word, as in `understanding what a
cat is, by looking at a cat'. The latter captures the idea of acquiring meaning
by listening to some other speaker rephrasing the word with others already
known to the learner. We provide a category-theoretic model for vocabulary
acquisition by paraphrasis based on the construction of free promonads. We draw
parallels between our work and Wittgenstein's dynamical approach to language,
commonly known as 'language games'.

object-level misclassification or the boundary-level ambiguity. In this paper,
we present a robust semantic segmentation network by deeply exploring the

multi-geometry based encoder and a boundary-guided decoder. In the encoder, we
develop a new residual geometry module from multi-geometry perspectives to
extract object-level features. In the decoder, we introduce a contrastive
boundary learning module to enhance the geometric representation of boundary

can infer the segmentation of objects effectively while making the
intersections (boundaries) of two or more objects clear. Experiments show
obvious improvements of our method over its competitors in terms of the overall
segmentation accuracy and object boundary clearness. Code is available at

different parameters affecting progressive lens comforts, such as distortions,

unveiled, and ratings could be predicted without performing additional

briefly reviewing models without tree-level FCNC, several models with such

flavor-changing couplings are the geometric mean of the individual flavor
couplings, is presented. While it provided a target for experimentalists for
three decades, it in now being severely challenged by experiments. Couplings
expected to be of O(1) must be substantially smaller and the ansatz is now not

models are presented, including the Branco-Grimus-Lavoura models. These models
are not yet excluded experimentally, but they are highly predictive and will be
tested once heavy Higgs bosons are discovered. We then turn to flavorful models
and flavor-changing decays of heavy Higgs bosons, and it is shown that in many
of these models, the heavy Higgs could predominantly decay in a flavor-changing
manner (such as $ct$ or $\mu\tau$) and experimentalists are encouraged to
include these possibilities in their searches.

proposed with its feasibility study and its real-time demonstration is
conducted for the first time in this study. In the wind tunnel test, the PIV
measurement and real-time measurement using SPPIV were conducted for the flow
velocity field around the NACA0015 airfoil model. The off-line analysis results
of the test show that the flow velocity field can be estimated from a small
number of processing points by applying SPPIV, and also illustrates the
following characteristics of SPPIV. The estimation accuracy improves as the
number of processing points increases, whereas the processing time per step
increases in proportion to the number of processing points. Therefore, it is
necessary to set an optimal number of processing points. In addition, the
application of the Kalman filter significantly improves the estimation accuracy
with a small number of processing points while suppressing the processing time.
When the flow velocity fields with different angles of attack are used as the
training data with that of test data, the estimation using SPPIV is found to be
reasonable if the difference in angle of attack between the training and test
data is equal to or less than 2 deg and the flow phenomena of the training data
are similar to that of the test data. For this reason, training data should be
prepared at least every 4 deg. Finally, the demonstration of SPPIV as a
real-time flow observation was conducted for the first time. In this
demonstration, the real-time measurement is found to be possible at a sampling
rate of 2000 Hz at 20 or less processing points in the top 10 modes estimation

The central idea is to study the universal Jacobian over the moduli space of
curves (following Caporaso, Kass-Pagani, and Abreu-Pacini) for certain
stability conditions. Using the criterion of Holmes-Schwarz, the universal
double ramification theory of Bae-Holmes-Pandharipande-Schmitt-Schwarz applied
to the universal line bundle determines the logarithmic double ramification
cycle. The resulting formula, written in the language of piecewise polynomials,
depends upon the stability condition (and admits a wall-crossing study).
Several examples of logarithmic and higher double ramification cycles are

lithium in three best-observed Galactic red nova remnants. Explaining the
origin of lithium may point to mixing mechanism present before, during, or
after the merger. Methods. The lithium line at 6707.81 A was compared to a
feature of [Ca I at 6572.78 A to derive relative abundances in circumstellar
gas. Absolute abundances were next calculated assuming the Solar calcium to
lithium abundance ratio. Results. Lithium abundances were measured in the
merger remnants of V838 Mon with A(Li)=2.3, CK Vul with A(Li)=2.5, and V1309
Sco with A(Li)=1.8. Conclusions. Lithium is overabundant in red novae,
suggesting that at least some merger products activate the Cameron-Fowler
mechanism whereby convective mixing can reach the deep stellar interior.
Whether deep convection and associated diffusion alone or some other processes
(e.g. spin down) can be responsible for driving the Cameron-Fowler mechanism in
the remnants requires further studies. Early observations of lithium in V838
Mon hint that these mechanisms can activate early, perhaps already in the
common envelope phase. These observations should be taken into account in
modelling these complex systems.

well-motivated informative priors for some parameters but not for others. The
Bayesian methodology uses the Bayes factor and is helpful for the informative
priors, as it incorporates Occam's razor via multiplicity or trials factor in
the Look Elsewhere Effect. However, if the prior is not known completely, the
frequentist hypothesis test via the false positive rate is a better approach,
as it is less sensitive to the prior choice. We argue that when only partial
prior information is available, it is best to combine the two methodologies by
using the Bayes factor as a test statistic in the frequentist analysis. We show
that the standard frequentist likelihood-ratio test statistic corresponds to
the Bayes factor with a non-informative Jeffrey's prior. We also show that
mixed priors increase the statistical power in frequentist analyses over the
likelihood ratio test statistic. We develop an analytic formalism that does not
require expensive simulations using a statistical mechanics approach to
hypothesis testing in Bayesian and frequentist statistics. We introduce the
counting of states in a continuous parameter space using the uncertainty volume
as the quantum of the state. We show that both the p-value and Bayes factor can
be expressed as energy versus entropy competition. We present analytic
expressions that generalize Wilks' theorem beyond its usual regime of validity
and work in a non-asymptotic regime. In specific limits, the formalism
reproduces existing expressions, such as the p-value of linear models and
periodograms. We apply the formalism to an example of exoplanet transits, where
multiplicity can be more than $10^7$. We show that our analytic expressions
reproduce the p-values derived from numerical simulations.

point-like sources in DESI-LIS Data Release 9. To quantify the classifier's
performance, we also inject a testing set into the to-be-applied data.
Eventually, we obtained $1,953,932$ Grade-A quasar candidates and $22,486, 884$

properties of the candidates agree with that given by the method of color-cut

quasars with the upcoming DESI data by eliminating enormous non-quasars but
remaining high completeness. All data in this paper is publicly available

However, there exist scenarios where this is not fulfilled and where the image
information only is available for a non-regular subset of pixel position. For
processing, transmitting or displaying such an image signal, a re-sampling to a
regular grid is required. Recently, Frequency Selective Reconstruction (FSR)
has been proposed as a very effective sparsity-based algorithm for solving this
under-determined problem. For this, FSR iteratively generates a model of the
signal in the Fourier-domain. In this context, a fixed frequency prior inspired
by the optical transfer function is used for favoring low-frequency content.
However, this fixed prior is often too strict and may lead to a reduced
reconstruction quality. To resolve this weakness, this paper proposes an
adaptive frequency prior which takes the local density of the available samples
into account. The proposed adaptive prior allows for a very high reconstruction
quality, yielding gains of up to 0.6 dB PSNR over the fixed prior,
independently of the density of the available samples. Compared to other
state-of-the-art algorithms, visually noticeable gains of several dB are
possible.

spectral analysis of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the young Kepler's
SNR, aiming to study in detail its non-thermal emission in hard X-rays. We
selected a set of regions all around the rim of the shell and extracted the
corresponding spectra. The spectra were analyzed by adopting a model of
synchrotron radiation in the loss-limited regime, to constrain the dependence
of the cutoff energy of the synchrotron radiation on the shock velocity. We
identify two different regimes of particle acceleration, characterized by
different Bohm factors. In the north, where the shock interacts with a dense
circumstellar medium (CSM), we found a more efficient acceleration than in the
south, where the shock velocity is higher and there are no signs of shock
interaction with dense CSM. Our results suggest an enhanced efficiency of the
acceleration process in regions where the shock-CSM interaction generates an
amplified and turbulent magnetic field. By combining hard X-ray spectra with
radio and $\gamma-$ray observations of Kepler's SNR, we modelled the spectral
energy distribution. In the light of our results we propose that the observed
$\gamma-$ray emission is mainly hadronic, and originates in the northern part
of the shell.

days since each individual microservice can be independently modified,

requires automated testing with a focus on the interactions between the
services. While this is achievable with end-to-end tests, they are error-prone,
brittle, expensive to write, time-consuming to run, and require the entire
application to be deployed. Integration tests are an alternative to end-to-end
tests since they have a smaller test scope and require the deployment of a
significantly fewer number of services. The de-facto standard for deploying
microservice applications in the cloud is containers with Kubernetes being the
most widely used container orchestration platform. To support the integration
testing of microservices in Kubernetes, several tools such as Octopus, Istio,

functionality or lead to a substantial increase in the complexity and growth of
the tool landscape when introduced into a project. To this end, we present
\emph{Bunk8s}, a tool for integration testing of microservice applications in

\emph{Bunk8s} is independent of the test framework used for writing integration
tests, independent of the used CI/CD infrastructure, and supports test result

However, the expected facular and spot signals in stellar data are quite

Consequently, corrections of stellar data for magnetic activity can greatly
benefit from the insight on whether the stellar signal is dominated by spots or
faculae. Here, we utilise a surface flux transport model (SFTM) to show that
more effective cancellation of diffuse magnetic flux associated with faculae
leads to spot area coverages increasing faster with stellar magnetic activity
than that by faculae. Our calculations explain the observed dependence between

labeled data in meta-training, which is a major limit. To reduce the
requirement of labels, a semi-supervised meta-training (SSMT) setting has been
proposed for FSL, which includes only a few labeled samples and numbers of
unlabeled samples in base classes. However, existing methods under this setting
require class-aware sample selection from the unlabeled set, which violates the
assumption of unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a practical
semi-supervised meta-training setting with truly unlabeled data to facilitate
the applications of FSL in realistic scenarios. To better utilize both the
labeled and truly unlabeled data, we propose a simple and effective
meta-training framework, called pseudo-labeling based meta-learning (PLML).
Firstly, we train a classifier via common semi-supervised learning (SSL) and
use it to obtain the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Then we build few-shot
tasks from labeled and pseudo-labeled data and design a novel finetuning method
with feature smoothing and noise suppression to better learn the FSL model from
noise labels. Surprisingly, through extensive experiments across two FSL
datasets, we find that this simple meta-training framework effectively prevents
the performance degradation of various FSL models under limited labeled data,
and also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SSMT models. Besides,
benefiting from meta-training, our method also improves two representative SSL

recorded in adverse visual conditions, there has been a keen interest in
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for the semantic segmentation of such
images. UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target
adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes
provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions,
which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose
Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages
these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning
the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using
an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse
prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction
mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new
state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several
adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach
introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead --
during training only -- and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any

particular interest focused on phonon polaritons (PhPs) - lattice vibrations
coupled to electromagnetic fields in the mid-infrared spectral range with - in
biaxial crystals, such as e.g. MoO3. In particular, hyperbolic PhPs - having
hyperbola-like shape of their isofrequency curves - in MoO3 can exhibit
ultra-high momenta and strongly directional in-plane propagation, promising
novel applications in imaging, sensing or thermal management at the nanoscale

a technological platform for the effective excitation and control of in-plane

attention over the years. However, the performance gap between point supervised

this paper, we attribute such a large performance gap to the failure of
generating high-quality proposal bags which are crucial for multiple instance
learning (MIL). To address this problem, we introduce a lightweight alternative
to the off-the-shelf proposal (OTSP) method and thereby create the Point-to-Box
Network (P2BNet), which can construct an inter-objects balanced proposal bag by
generating proposals in an anchor-like way. By fully investigating the accurate
position information, P2BNet further constructs an instance-level bag, avoiding
the mixture of multiple objects. Finally, a coarse-to-fine policy in a cascade
fashion is utilized to improve the IoU between proposals and ground-truth (GT).
Benefiting from these strategies, P2BNet is able to produce high-quality
instance-level bags for object detection. P2BNet improves the mean average

subjective opinions or experiences of different medical experts. Therefore, an
efficient and interpretable automatic PD diagnosis system is valuable for
supporting clinicians with more robust diagnostic decision-making. To this end,
we propose to classify Parkinson's tremor since it is one of the most

While most of the light curves correspond to a low variability state of Sgr A*,
the April 11 observations follow an X-ray flare, and exhibit strongly enhanced
variability. All of the light curves are consistent with a red noise process,
with a power spectral density (PSD) slope measured to be between -2 and -3 on

image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce
partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking
convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address

mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant

by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces
the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by
pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing
layer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our
approach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive

the dephasing time ($T_2$) of superconducting qubits fluctuate considerably
over time. To appropriately consider this time-varying nature of the $T_1$ and
$T_2$ parameters, a new class of quantum channels, known as Time-Varying
Quantum Channels (TVQCs), has been proposed. In previous works, realizations of
multi-qubit TVQCs have been assumed to be equal for all the qubits of an error
correction block, implying that the random variables that describe the
fluctuations of $T_1$ and $T_2$ are block-to-block uncorrelated, but qubit-wise
perfectly correlated for the same block. Physically, the fluctuations of these
decoherence parameters are explained by the incoherent coupling of the qubits
with unstable near-resonant two-level-systems (TLS), which indicates that such
variations may be local to each of the qubits of the system. In this article,
we perform a correlation analysis of the fluctuations of the relaxation times
of multi-qubit quantum processors ibmq\_quito, ibmq\_belem, ibmq\_lima,
ibmq\_santiago and ibmq\_bogota. Our results show that it is reasonable to
assume that the fluctuations of the relaxation and dephasing times of

these results, we discuss the multi-qubit TVQCs when the fluctuations of the
decoherence parameters for an error correction block are qubit-wise
uncorrelated (as well as from block-to-block), a scenario we have named the
Fast Time-Varying Quantum Channel (FTVQC). Furthermore, we lower bound the
quantum capacity of general FTVQCs based on a quantity we refer to as the
ergodic quantum capacity. Finally, we use numerical simulations to study the
performance of quantum error correction codes (QECC) when they operate over

dictionary learning, failing to further explore the category information.~To
make full use of the category information of different samples, we propose a
novel deep dictionary learning model with an intra-class constraint (DDLIC) for
visual classification. Specifically, we design the intra-class compactness
constraint on the intermediate representation at different levels to encourage
the intra-class representations to be closer to each other, and eventually the
learned representation becomes more discriminative.~Unlike the traditional DDL
methods, during the classification stage, our DDLIC performs a layer-wise
greedy optimization in a similar way to the training stage. Experimental
results on four image datasets show that our method is superior to the
state-of-the-art methods.

the rate of $O(t^{-(1-\f{1}{p})})$, $u_3(t)$ decays at the rate of
$O(t^{-\f{3}{2}(1-\f{1}{p})})$ and $B(t)$ decays at the rate of
$O(t^{-\f{3}{2}(1-\f{1}{p})-\f{1}{2}})$. Furthermore, we give the asymptotic
expansion of solutions. We prove that the leading term of $\uh(t)$ is a
combination of linear solution and two integrals from nonlinear coupling
effects, while for $u_3(t)$ the leading term is given by only the linear
solution without the influence of magnetic field. Though the dissipation of
velocity is weak, we show that the full magnetic diffusion is robust enough to
keep the asymptotic expansion of magnetic field basically expected. However,
the magnetic field turns out to affect the higher order asymptotic expansions
of $u_3(t)$. The obtained results reveal the crucial role played by the
magnetic field in the asymptotic analysis of anisotropic incompressible MHD
equations and are expected to enhance the understanding of incompressible MHD
equations from the viewpoint of mathematics.

implementation of the methods to estimate the variability parameters into a
specific object study module for AGN. Then we describe the selection procedure
that led to the definition of the high-purity variable AGN sample and analyse
the properties of the selected sources. We started from a sample of millions of
sources, which were identified as AGN candidates by 11 different classifiers
based on variability processing. Because the focus was on the variability
properties, we first defined some pre-requisites in terms of number of data
points and mandatory variability parameters. Then a series of filters was
applied using only Gaia data and the Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3
(Gaia-CRF3) sample as a reference.The resulting Gaia AGN variable sample, named
GLEAN, contains about 872000 objects, more than 21000 of which are new
identifications. We checked the presence of contaminants by cross-matching the
selected sources with a variety of galaxies and stellar catalogues. The
completeness of GLEAN with respect to the variable AGN in the last Sloan
Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogue is about 47%, while that based on the
variable AGN of the Gaia-CRF3 sample is around 51%. From both a comparison with
other AGN catalogues and an investigation of possible contaminants, we conclude
that purity can be expected to be above 95%. Multiwavelength properties of
these sources are investigated. In particular, we estimate that about 4% of
them are radio-loud. We finally explore the possibility to evaluate the time
lags between the flux variations of the multiple images of strongly lensed
quasars, and show one case.

demonstrations having already been performed. In this perspective, we discuss
in a very broad sense what it means for an algorithm to be hybrid
quantum-classical. We first explore this concept very directly, by building a
definition based on previous work in abstraction/representation theory, arguing
that what makes an algorithm hybrid is not directly how it is run (or how many
classical resources it consumes), but whether classical components are crucial
to an underlying model of the computation. We then take a broader view of this
question, reviewing a number of hybrid algorithms and discussing what makes
them hybrid, as well as the history of how they emerged, and considerations
related to hardware. This leads into a natural discussion of what the future
holds for these algorithms. To answer this question, we turn to the use of
specialized processors in classical computing.The classical trend is not for
new technology to completely replace the old, but to augment it. We argue that
the evolution of quantum computing is unlikely to be different: hybrid
algorithms are likely here to stay well past the NISQ era and even into full
fault-tolerance, with the quantum processors augmenting the already powerful
classical processors which exist by performing specialized tasks.

and solvable on a pixel level. It consists of two simple sub-networks: an
anchor-free detection head for bounding box predictions and an edge-guided
parsing head for human segmentation. The anchor-free detector head inherits the
pixel-like merits and effectively avoids the sensitivity of hyper-parameters as
proved in object detection applications. By introducing the part-aware boundary
clue, the edge-guided parsing head is capable to distinguish adjacent human
parts from among each other up to 58 parts in a single human instance, even
overlapping instances. Meanwhile, a refinement head integrating box-level score
and part-level parsing quality is exploited to improve the quality of the
parsing results. Experiments on two multiple human parsing datasets (i.e., CIHP

technical difficulties and high costs in photographing interosseous

understanding the obstacles encountered in capillary growth. However, existing
datasets for blood vessel segmentation mainly focus on the large blood vessels
of the body, and the lack of labeled capillary image datasets greatly limits
the methodological development and applications of vessel segmentation and
capillary filling. Here, we present a benchmark dataset, named IFCIS-155,
consisting of 155 2D capillary images with segmentation boundaries and vessel
fillings annotated by biomedical experts, and 19 large-scale, high-resolution
3D capillary images. To obtain better images of interosseous capillaries, we
leverage state-of-the-art immunofluorescence imaging techniques to highlight
the rich vascular morphology of interosseous capillaries. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the dataset and the
benchmarking deep learning models (\eg UNet/UNet++ and the modified

minimal division machinery. The animal cell division apparatus is mechanically
the simplest, in which an actin-based ring constricts the membrane, as compared
to microbes and plant cells where a cell wall is involved. Furthermore,
reconstitution of the actin division machinery helps to understand the physical
and molecular mechanisms of cytokinesis in animal cells and thus our own cells.
In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art research on reconstitution of
minimal actin-mediated cytokinetic machineries. Based on the conceptual
requirements that we obtained from the physics of the shape changes involved in
cell division, we propose two major routes for building a minimal actin
apparatus capable of division. Importantly, we acknowledge both the passive and
active roles that the confining lipid membrane can play in synthetic
cytokinesis. We conclude this chapter by identifying the most pressing
challenges for future reconstitution work, thereby laying out a roadmap for
building a synthetic cell equipped with a minimal actin division machinery.

However, the last generation of these telescopes encountered an unexpected
problem: their optics focused not only X-rays but low-energy (so called soft)
protons as well. These protons are very hard to model and can not be
distinguished from X-rays. For example, 40\% of XMM-Newton observations is
significantly contaminated by soft proton induced background flares. In order
to minimize the background from such low-energy protons the Advanced Telescope
for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) satellite introduced a novel concept, the
so called Charged Particle Diverter (CPD). It is an array of magnets in a
Hallbach design, which deflects protons below 76 keV before they would hit the
Wide Field Imager (WFI) detector. In this work, we investigate the effect of
scattering of the deflected protons with the CPD walls and the inner surfaces
of the WFI detector assembly. Such scattered protons can loose energy, change
direction and still hit the WFI. In order to adopt the most realistic
instrument model, we imported the CAD model of both the CPD and the WFI focal
plane assembly. Soft protons corresponding to $\approx$2.5 hours of exposure to
the L1 solar wind are simulated in this work. The inhomogeneous magnetic field
of the CPD is included in the simulation. We present a preliminary estimate of
the WFI residual background induced by soft proton secondary scattering, in the
case of the optical blocking filter present in the field of view. A first
investigation of the volumes responsible for scattering the protons back into
the field of view is reported.

normally, before it encounters the traps, then undergoes a period of transient
anomalous diffusion, after which it reaches a final diffusive regime. The
asymptotic regime is governed by an effective diffusion coefficient
$D_\text{eff}$, which is induced by the trapping environment and is typically
different from the original one. We show that when the number of traps is
\emph{finite}, the environment enhances diffusion and induces an effective
diffusion coefficient that is systematically equal to $D_\text{eff}=2D$,
independently of the number of the traps, the trapping intensity $\beta$ and
the distance $L$. On the contrary, when the number of traps is \emph{infinite},

coefficient that depends on the traps intensity $\beta$ and the distance $L$
through a non-trivial scaling function $D_\text{eff}=D \mathcal{F}(\beta L/D)$,

algorithm to generate surviving trajectories by deriving an effective Langevin
equation with an effective repulsive potential induced by the traps. Finally,
we extend our results to other trapping environments.

performance for several speech downstream tasks. Since the parameters of SSL

memory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models
without a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods
such as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink
the depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research
on how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the
small-footprint model. This paper provides an empirical study that addresses
the question. We investigate the performance on SUPERB while varying the
structure and KD methods so as to keep the number of parameters constant; this
allows us to analyze the contribution of the representation introduced by
varying the model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that a certain depth is
essential for solving content-oriented tasks (e.g. automatic speech
recognition) accurately, whereas a certain width is necessary for achieving
high performance on several speaker-oriented tasks (e.g. speaker
identification). Based on these observations, we identify, for SUPERB, a more
compressed model with better performance than previous studies.

largely control the year-to-year variability of Australia's CO2 balance, due to

training them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not
always yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many
of the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and
deployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates.
To address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity
mapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation. BayesCap is a
memory-efficient method that can be trained on a small fraction of the original
dataset, enhancing pretrained non-Bayesian computer vision models by providing
calibrated uncertainty estimates for the predictions without (i) hampering the
performance of the model and (ii) the need for expensive retraining the model
from scratch. The proposed method is agnostic to various architectures and

diverse set of architectures, including image super-resolution, deblurring,
inpainting, and crucial application such as medical image translation.
Moreover, we apply the derived uncertainty estimates to detect
out-of-distribution samples in critical scenarios like depth estimation in
autonomous driving. Code is available at

components in nowadays perovskite solar cells. Crystallization of these
materials is often complicated by the formation of various phases with the same
stoichiometry but structural types deviating from perovskites such as
well-known the hexagonal delta FAPbI3 polytype. Such phases are rarely placed
in the focus of device engineering due to their unattractive optoelectronic
properties while they are, indeed, highly important because they influence on
the optoelectronic properties and efficiency of final devices. However, the
total number of such phases has not been yet discovered and the complete
configurational space of the polytypes and their band structures have not been
studied systematically. In this work, we predicted and described all possible
hexagonal polytypes of hybrid lead halides with the APbI3 composition using the
group theory approach, also we analyzed theoretically the relationship between
the configuration of close-packed layers in polytypes and their band gap using
DFT calculations. Two main factors affecting the bandgap were found including
the ratio of cubic (c) and hexagonal (h) close-packed layers and the thickness
of blocks of cubic layers in the structures. We also show that the dependence
of the band gap on the ratio of cubic (c) and hexagonal (h) layers in these
structures are non-linear. We believe that the presence of such polytypes in
the perovskite matrix might be a reason for a decrease in the charge carrier

chemical abundances that does not change significantly over time. An analysis
of the XSM spectra confirms the EIS results, and shows that the low First
Ionization Potential (FIP) elements are enhanced, compared to their
photospheric values. The frequent microflares produced by the AR did not affect
the abundances of the quiescent AR core. We also present an analysis of one of
the flares it produced, SOL2020-04-09T09:32. The XSM analysis indicates
isothermal temperatures reaching 6 MK. The lack of very high-T emission is
confirmed by AIA. We find excellent agreement between the observed XSM spectrum

Be-thin filter ratio gives lower temperatures for the quiescent and flaring
phases. We show that this is due to the sensitivity of this ratio to low
temperatures, as the XRT filter ratios predicted with a DEM analysis based on
EIS and AIA gives values in good agreement with the observed ones.

Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational

of pivotal importance for star and planet formation. We describe how X-ray data
provide important insight into the physics of accretion and outflows. First,
mass accreted from a circumstellar disk onto the stellar surface reaches
velocities up to a few hundred km/s, fast enough to generate soft X-rays in the
post-shock region of the accretion shock. X-ray observations together with
laboratory experiments and numerical simulations show that the accretion
geometry is complex in young stars. Specifically, the center of the accretion
column is likely surrounded by material shielding the inner flow from view but
itself also hot enough to emit X-rays. Second, X-rays are observed in two
locations of protostellar jets: an inner stationary emission component probably
related to outflow collimation and outer components, which evolve withing years
and are likely related to working surfaces where the shock travels through the
jet. Jet-powered X-rays appear to trace the fastest jet component and provide
novel information on jet launching in young stars. We conclude that X-ray data
will continue to be highly important for understanding star and planet
formation, because they directly probe the origin of many emission features
studied in other wavelength regimes. In addition, future X-ray missions will
improve sensitivity and spectral resolution to probe key model parameters (e.g.
velocities) in large samples of PMS stars.

explicitly incorporate the manifold hypothesis as a prior in modern Deep Neural

Distance Learner, to incorporate this prior for DNN-based classifiers. Distance
Learner is trained to predict the distance of a point from the underlying

Distance Learner then chooses the class corresponding to the closest predicted
class manifold. Distance Learner can also identify points as being out of
distribution (belonging to neither class), if the distance to the closest
manifold is higher than a threshold. We evaluate our method on multiple
synthetic datasets and show that Distance Learner learns much more meaningful

our method on the task of adversarial robustness, and find that it not only
outperforms standard classifier by a large margin, but also performs at par

generalization performance. More importantly, such a scheme is applicable to
any existing BNN backbones for SISR without introducing any additional

mobility restrictions during the pandemic have forced people to substantially
reduce urban physical encounters, raising questions on the social implications
of such behavioral changes. In this paper, we study how the income diversity of
urban encounters have changed during different periods throughout the pandemic,
using a large-scale, privacy-enhanced mobility dataset of more than one million
anonymized mobile phone users in four large US cities, collected across three
years spanning before and during the pandemic. We find that the diversity of
urban encounters have substantially decreased (by 15% to 30%) during the
pandemic and has persisted through late 2021, even though aggregated mobility
metrics have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Counterfactual analyses show
that while the reduction of outside activities (higher rates of staying at

stages of the pandemic, behavioral changes including lower willingness to
explore new places and changes in visitation preferences further worsened the
long-term diversity of encounters. Our findings suggest that the pandemic could
have long-lasting negative effects on urban income diversity, and provide
implications for managing the trade-off between the stringency of COVID-19
policies and the diversity of urban encounters as we move beyond the pandemic.

scene is one of the desired experiences for photography applications. Although
photo extrapolation has been well studied, it is much more challenging to
extrapolate a photo (i.e., selfie) from a narrow field of view to a wider one
while maintaining a similar visual style. In this paper, we propose a
factorized neural re-rendering model to produce photorealistic novel views from
cluttered outdoor Internet photo collections, which enables the applications
including controllable scene re-rendering, photo extrapolation and even
extrapolated 3D photo generation. Specifically, we first develop a novel
factorized re-rendering pipeline to handle the ambiguity in the decomposition
of geometry, appearance and illumination. We also propose a composited training
strategy to tackle the unexpected occlusion in Internet images. Moreover, to
enhance photo-realism when extrapolating tourist photographs, we propose a
novel realism augmentation process to complement appearance details, which
automatically propagates the texture details from a narrow captured photo to
the extrapolated neural rendered image. The experiments and photo editing
examples on outdoor scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in both photo-realism and downstream applications.

important for applied animal behavior research. Thus, there is a need to elicit
statistical models to analyze data collected from pairwise behavioral

dyadic observations and propose a statistical model for their analysis. We
performed posterior predictive checks of the model through different validation
strategies: stratified 5-fold random cross-validation, block-by-social-group
cross-validation, and block-by-focal-animals validation. The proposed model was
applied to a pig behavior dataset collected from 797 growing pigs freshly
remixed into 59 social groups that resulted in 10,032 records of directional
dyadic interactions. The response variable was the duration in seconds that
each animal spent delivering attacks on another group mate. Generalized linear
mixed models were fitted. Fixed effects included sex, individual weight, prior
nursery mate experience, and prior littermate experience of the two pigs in the
dyad. Random effects included aggression giver, aggression receiver, dyad, and
social group. A Bayesian framework was utilized for parameter estimation and
posterior predictive model checking. Prior nursery mate experience was the only
significant fixed effect. In addition, a weak but significant correlation
between the random giver effect and the random receiver effect was obtained
when analyzing the attacking duration. The predictive performance of the model
varied depending on the validation strategy, with substantially lower
performance from the block-by-social-group strategy than other validation
strategies. Collectively, this paper demonstrates a statistical model to
analyze interactive animal behaviors, particularly dyadic interactions.

networks (NNs) on quantum chemical reference data is quantitatively explored.
For this, the architecture of the PhysNet NN was suitably modified and the
resulting model was evaluated with different metrics to quantify calibration,
quality of predictions, and whether prediction error and the predicted
uncertainty can be correlated. The results from training on the QM9 database
and evaluating data from the test set within and outside the distribution
indicate that error and uncertainty are not linearly related. The results
clarify that noise and redundancy complicate property prediction for molecules
even in cases for which changes - e.g. double bond migration in two otherwise
identical molecules - are small. The model was then applied to a real database
of tautomerization reactions. Analysis of the distance between members in
feature space combined with other parameters shows that redundant information
in the training dataset can lead to large variances and small errors whereas
the presence of similar but unspecific information returns large errors but
small variances. This was, e.g., observed for nitro-containing aliphatic chains
for which predictions were difficult although the training set contained
several examples for nitro groups bound to aromatic molecules. This underlines
the importance of the composition of the training data and provides chemical
insight into how this affects the prediction capabilities of a ML model.
Finally, the approach put forward can be used for information-based improvement
of chemical databases for target applications through active learning
optimization.

obtaining the analytical eigenfunctions of the linearized, incompressible,

stochastic interacting $P$-particle system, a set of $P$ coupled
$d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Importance sampling
(IS) is a common technique to reduce high relative variance of Monte Carlo
estimators of rare event probabilities. In the SDE context, optimal measure
change is derived using stochastic optimal control theory to minimize estimator
variance, which when applied to stochastic particle systems yields a $P \times
d$-dimensional partial differential control equation, which is cumbersome to
solve. The work in (dos Reis et al., 2018) circumvented this problem by a
decoupling approach, producing a $d$-dimensional control PDE. Based on the
decoupling approach, we develop a computationally efficient double loop Monte
Carlo (DLMC) estimator. We offer a systematic approach to our DLMC estimator by
providing a comprehensive error and work analysis and formulating optimal
computational complexity. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive DLMC method
combined with IS to estimate rare event probabilities, significantly reducing
relative variance and computational runtimes required to achieve a given
relative tolerance compared with standard Monte Carlo estimators without IS.
The proposed estimator has $\mathcal{O}(TOL^{-4})$ computational complexity
with significantly reduced constant. Numerical experiments, which are performed
on the Kuramoto model from statistical physics, show substantial computational
gains achieved by our estimator.

simulations of the interaction between shock wave and inhomogeneous density

turbulence is mainly driven by the strongest preshock density contrast and
follows the Kolmogorov scaling. The resulting turbulence amplifies the
postshock magnetic field. The time evolution of the magnetic fields agrees with
the prediction of the nonlinear turbulent dynamo theory in Xu & Lazarian
(2016). When the initial weak magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock
normal, the maximum amplification of the field's strength achieves a factor of
$\approx200$, which is twice larger than that for a parallel shock. We find
that the perpendicular shock exhibits a smaller turbulent Alfv\'en Mach number
in the vicinity of the shock front than the parallel shock. However, the
strongest magnetic field has a low volume filling factor and is limited by the
turbulent energy due to the reconnection diffusion taking place in a turbulent
and magnetized fluid. The magnetic field strength averaged along the $z$-axis
is reduced by a factor $\gtrsim10$. We decompose the turbulent velocity and
magnetic field into solenoidal and compressive modes. The solenoidal mode is
dominant and evolves to follow the Kolmogorov scaling, even though the preshock

previous experience - priors - is beneficial in individual settings, it could
represent a problem in social scenarios where other agents might not have the

demonstrator. Participants reproduced the lengths shown by the robot in two

desired aggregate behavior, while simultaneously satisfying state and input

System level synthesis is a recent technique which has been used to
reparametrize the optimal control problem as a convex program. Prior work on
system level synthesis with state and input constraints has included
closed-loop finite impulse response and locality constraints or, in the case
where these constraints were lifted using a simple pole approximation, only a
centralized design was considered. However, closed-loop finite impulse response
and locality constraints cannot be satisfied in many applications. Furthermore,
the centralized design using the simple pole approximation lacks robustness to
communication failures and disturbances, has high computational cost and does
not preserve data privacy of local controllers. The main contribution of this
work is to develop a distributed solution to system level synthesis with the
simple pole approximation in order to incorporate state and input constraints
without closed-loop finite impulse response or locality constraints, and in a
distributed implementation. To achieve this, it is first shown that the dual of
this problem is a distributed consensus problem. Then, an algorithm is
developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the
dual while recovering a primal solution, and a convergence certificate is
provided. Finally, the method's performance is demonstrated on a test case of

In a recent experiment [W. Khan et al., Nat. Commun. 12, 5130 (2021)], it was
demonstrated that a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a microwave resonator
can act as an efficient and continuous photodetector by converting an incoming
stream of photons to an electrical photocurrent. In the experiment, average
photon and electron flows were analyzed. Here we theoretically investigate, in
the same system, the fluctuations of the photocurrent through the DQD for a
coherent microwave drive of the resonator. We consider both the low frequency
full counting statistics as well as the finite-frequency noise (FFN) of the
photocurrent. Numerical results and analytical expressions in limiting cases
are complemented by a mean-field approach neglecting dot-resonator
correlations, providing a compelling and physically transparent picture of the
photocurrent statistics. We find that for ideal, unity efficiency detection,
the fluctuations of the charge current reproduce the Poisson statistics of the
incoming photons, while the statistics for non-ideal detection is
sub-Poissonian. Moreover, the FFN provides information of the system parameter
dependence of detector short-time properties. Our results give novel insight
into microwave photon-electron interactions in hybrid dot-resonator systems and
provide guidance for further experiments on continuous detection of single

  Prediction","14 pages,8 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Demystifying the delay propagation mechanisms among multiple airports is
fundamental to precise and interpretable delay prediction, which is crucial
during decision-making for all aviation industry stakeholders. The principal
challenge lies in effectively leveraging the spatiotemporal dependencies and
exogenous factors related to the delay propagation. However, previous works
only consider limited spatiotemporal patterns with few factors. To promote more
comprehensive propagation modeling for delay prediction, we propose
SpatioTemporal Propagation Network (STPN), a space-time separable graph
convolutional network, which is novel in spatiotemporal dependency capturing.
From the aspect of spatial relation modeling, we propose a multi-graph
convolution model considering both geographic proximity and airline schedule.
From the aspect of temporal dependency capturing, we propose a multi-head
self-attentional mechanism that can be learned end-to-end and explicitly reason
multiple kinds of temporal dependency of delay time series. We show that the
joint spatial and temporal learning models yield a sum of the Kronecker
product, which factors the spatiotemporal dependence into the sum of several
spatial and temporal adjacency matrices. By this means, STPN allows cross-talk
of spatial and temporal factors for modeling delay propagation. Furthermore, a
squeeze and excitation module is added to each layer of STPN to boost
meaningful spatiotemporal features. To this end, we apply STPN to multi-step
ahead arrival and departure delay prediction in large-scale airport networks.
To validate the effectiveness of our model, we experiment with two real-world
delay datasets, including U.S and China flight delays; and we show that STPN
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, counterfactuals produced by
STPN show that it learns explainable delay propagation patterns.

from ionized stellar wind or circumstellar dust. With the newly published
LAMOST-OB catalog and GOSSS data, this work steps further on understanding the
infrared excess of OB stars. Based on a forward modeling approach comparing the
spectral slope of observational Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) and
photospheric models, 1147 stars are found to have infrared excess from 7818
stars with good-quality photometric data. After removing the objects in the
sightline of dark clouds, 532 ($\sim7\%$) B-type stars and 118 ($\sim23\%$)
O-type stars are identified to be true OB stars with circumstellar infrared
excess emission. The ionized stellar wind model and the circumstellar dust
model are adopted to explain the infrared excess, and Bayes Factors are
computed to quantitatively compare the two. It is shown that the infrared
excess can be accounted for by the stellar wind for about 65\% cases in which
33\% by free-free emission and 32\% by synchrotron radiation. Other 30\%
sources could have and 4\% should have a dust component or other mechanisms to
explain the sharply increase flux at $\lambda > 10\mu$m. The parameters of dust
model indicate a large-scale circumstellar halo structure which implies the
origin of the dust from the birthplace of the OB stars. A statistical study
suggests that the proportion with infrared excess in OB stars increases with
stellar effective temperature and luminosity, and that there is no systematic
change of the mechanism for infrared emission with stellar parameters.

doubling the number of DSFGs with deep observations of these lines. We detect

are a factor of a few lower than suggested by the two previous DSFG detections.
Our results imply that most DSFGs have low dense-gas fractions. A comparison

the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing

methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs,
there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We
find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable
architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied
to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse
architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made
for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper,
we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures.
We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and
modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and
SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse
operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to
using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The
proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity
of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our
search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse
networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and
hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of

machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile,
breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual
agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this
correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed

of topology is facilitated through discretization, i.e. defining and examining
appropriate finite sub-structures. Topologizing the dynamics provides an
elegant solution to their discretization by discretizing the associated flow

a new invariant for positive braids in terms of a bi-graded differential module

gravitational tides on the atmosphere itself has so far been ignored. We first
develop a simplified analytic theory of tides acting on the atmosphere of a
planet. We then implement gravitational tides into a general circulation model
of a static-ocean planet in a short-period orbit around a low-mass star -- the
results agree with our analytic theory. Because atmospheric tides and
solid-body tides share a scaling with the semi-major axis, we show that there
is a maximum amplitude of the atmospheric tide that a terrestrial planet can
experience while still having a solid surface; Proxima Centauri b is the poster
child for a planet that could be geophysically Earth-like but with atmospheric
tides more than 500$\times$ stronger than Earth's. In this most extreme
scenario, we show that atmospheric tides significantly impact the planet's
meteorology -- but not its climate. Two possible modest climate impacts are
enhanced longitudinal heat transport and cooling of the lowest atmospheric
layers. The strong radiative forcing of such planets dominates over
gravitational tides, unlike moons of cold giant planets, such as Titan. We
speculate that atmospheric tides could be climatologically important on planets
where the altitude of maximal tidal forcing coincides with the altitude of
cloud formation and that the effect could be detectable for non-Earth-like

population properties, namely age, metallicity ([M/H]), and the abundance ratio
of $\alpha$ elements ([$\alpha$/Fe]), by fitting observed spectral indices with
a robust, iterative procedure, and infer their star formation history (SFH) by
means of full spectral fitting. We find that these nine dEs are more metal-poor

the Virgo and Coma clusters with similar stellar mass, cluster-centric
distance, and infall time. Moreover, for six dEs, we find evidence for a recent
episode of star formation during or right after the time of accretion onto
Virgo. We interpret the high [$\alpha$/Fe] of our sample of dEs as the result
of the previous exposure of these galaxies to an environment hostile to star
formation, and/or the putative short burst of star formation they underwent
after infall into Virgo. Our results suggest that the stellar population

cities and suburban areas, often leaving those potential customers in
non-popular zones stranded without access to taxis. To overcome this problem,
many practices have been implemented, such as penalties to drivers, bans, and
new pricing strategies. This paper presents a double auction taxi fare scheme,
which gives both passengers and taxi drivers to influence the price, coupled
with a clustering method to discourage strategic service rejection in the case
study of Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand, which has detailed data
availability and uneven taxi journey distributions. The double auction
mechanism is tailored to 2019 taxi trips, service rejection complaints, and
local travel behaviour to boost transportation equity. To benchmark the
performance of the new double auction scheme, a bespoke agent-based model of
the taxi service in Bangkok Metropolitan Region at different rejection rates of
0%-20% was created. On one hand, the current rejection behaviour was modelled,
and on the other, the double auction pricing strategy was applied. The results
indicate that the double auction strategy generates a spatially distributed
accessibility and leads to a higher taxi assignment success rate by up to 30%.
The double auction scheme increases pickups from locations that are 20-40 km
from central Bangkok by 10-15%, despite being areas of low profit. Due to the
changing taxi travel landscape and longer taxi journeys, the total air
pollutant emissions from the taxis increase by 10% while decreasing local
emissions within central areas of Bangkok by upto 40%. Using a 5 Baht average
surcharge, the total revenue drops by 20%. The results show that an
equity-driven pricing strategy as an implementation of transport policy would
be beneficial.

vocabulary bottleneck when we attempt to scale the number of supported
languages. Tackling this bottleneck results in a trade-off between what can be
represented in the embedding matrix and computational issues in the output
layer. This paper introduces PIXEL, the Pixel-based Encoder of Language, which
suffers from neither of these issues. PIXEL is a pretrained language model that
renders text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across
languages based on orthographic similarity or the co-activation of pixels.
PIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches instead of
predicting a distribution over tokens. We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL
model on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic
tasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts.
We find that PIXEL substantially outperforms BERT on syntactic and semantic
processing tasks on scripts that are not found in the pretraining data, but
PIXEL is slightly weaker than BERT when working with Latin scripts.
Furthermore, we find that PIXEL is more robust than BERT to orthographic
attacks and linguistic code-switching, further confirming the benefits of
modelling language with pixels.

in the signature with conjunction, disjunction, negation, and the universal and

present a Fitch-style natural deduction system for the logic that contains only
the introduction and elimination rules for the logical constants. From this
starting point, if one adds the rule that Fitch called Reiteration, one obtains
a proof system for intuitionistic logic in the given signature; if instead of
adding Reiteration, one adds the rule of Reductio ad Absurdum, one obtains a
proof system for orthologic; by adding both Reiteration and Reductio, one
obtains a proof system for classical logic. Arguably neither Reiteration nor
Reductio is as intimately related to the meaning of the connectives as the
introduction and elimination rules are, so the base logic we identify serves as
a more fundamental starting point and common ground between proponents of
intuitionistic logic, orthologic, and classical logic. The algebraic semantics
for the logic we motivate proof-theoretically is based on bounded lattices
equipped with what has been called a weak pseudocomplementation. We show that
such lattice expansions are representable using a set together with a reflexive
binary relation satisfying a simple first-order condition, which yields an
elegant relational semantics for the logic. This builds on our previous study
of representations of lattices with negations, which we extend and specialize
for several types of negation in addition to weak pseudocomplementation.
Finally, we discuss ways of extending these representations to lattices with a
conditional or implication operation.

Given known fundamental differences between our simulation codes, we find that
faster rigid-body simulations produce nearly the same result as rubble-pile
models in scenarios with a moderate value for the momentum enhancement factor,
$\beta$ ($\beta{\sim}3$) and an ellipsoidal secondary. This indicates that the
rigid-body approach is likely adequate for propagating the post-impact dynamics
necessary to meet DART Mission requirements. Although, if Dimorphos has a
highly-irregular shape or structure, or if $\beta$ is unexpectedly large, then
rubble-pile effects may become important. If Dimorphos's orbit and spin state
are sufficiently excited, then surface particle motion is also possible.
However, these simulations are limited in their resolution and range of
material parameters, so they serve as a demonstration of principle, and Future
work is required to fully understand the likelihood and magnitude of surface
motion.

to the successful use, since 2005, of the polarized hydrogen jet target

ratio of the $h^\uparrow{p}$ and $p^\uparrow{h}$ analyzing powers. For elastic
scattering, this ratio can be evaluated with sufficient accuracy if
$p^\uparrow{p}$ analyzing power is precisely known. In this paper, the deuteron
beam data acquired at HJET in RHIC Run 16 was used to evaluate corrections to
the measured helion beam polarization due to the ${}^3\text{He}$ breakup. The
breakup effect was found to be negligible if the ratio of the beam and target

""Type I"" flares are characterized by slipping motions of flare loops and
ribbons and a stable filament underlying the flare loops. ""Type II"" flares are
associated with the failed eruptions of the filaments, which can be explained
by the classical 2D flare model. A total of 59 flares are ""Type I"" flares

significant differences in distributions of the total unsigned magnetic flux

confined flares, with ""Type I"" confined flares from ARs with a larger
$\Phi$$_{AR}$ than ""Type II"". We calculate the mean shear angle

find that it is slightly smaller for ""Type I"" flares than that for ""Type II""
events. The relative non-potentiality parameter
$\Psi$$_\mathrm{HFED}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ has the best performance in
distinguishing the two types of flares. About 73\% of ""Type I"" confined flares
have $\Psi$$_\mathrm{HFED}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$$<$1.0$\times$$10^{-21}$ degree

reconnections within the complex magnetic systems probably leads to the
observed flare.

approximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was
established more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been
extremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and
finally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main
result is a simple and intuitive algorithm, that improves the approximation
guarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in
particular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the
payoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the
same approximation guarantee in a query-efficient way.

computer vision applications. Recently, commercial RGB-depth (RGB-D) cameras
have been widely adopted as single-view depth-sensing devices owing to their
efficient depth-sensing abilities. However, the depth quality of most RGB-D
sensors remains insufficient owing to the inherent noise from a single-view
environment. Recently, several studies have focused on the single-view depth
enhancement of RGB-D cameras. Recent research has proposed deep-learning-based
approaches that typically train networks using high-quality supervised depth
datasets, which indicates that the quality of the ground-truth (GT) depth
dataset is a top-most important factor for accurate system; however, such
high-quality GT datasets are difficult to obtain. In this study, we developed a
novel method for high-quality GT depth generation based on an RGB-D stream
dataset. First, we defined consecutive depth frames in a local spatial region
as a local frame set. Then, the depth frames were aligned to a certain frame in
the local frame set using an unsupervised point cloud registration scheme. The
registration parameters were trained based on an overfit-training scheme, which
was primarily used to construct a single GT depth image for each frame set. The
final GT depth dataset was constructed using several local frame sets, and each
local frame set was trained independently. The primary advantage of this study
is that a high-quality GT depth dataset can be constructed under various
scanning environments using only the RGB-D stream dataset. Moreover, our
proposed method can be used as a new benchmark GT dataset for accurate
performance evaluations. We evaluated our GT dataset on previously benchmarked
GT depth datasets and demonstrated that our method is superior to
state-of-the-art depth enhancement frameworks.

post-main sequence engulfment, currently orbiting white dwarf stars. Infrared
and optical spectroscopy of GD 1400 reveal a 9.98 h orbital period, where the
benchmark brown dwarf has $M_2=68\pm8$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, $T_{\rm eff}\approx2100$
K, and a cooling age under 1 Gyr. A substellar mass in the lower range of
allowed values is favoured by the gravitational redshift of the primary.
Synthetic brown dwarf spectra are able to reproduce the observed CO bands, but
lines below the bandhead are notably overpredicted. The known infrared excess
towards PG 0010+281 is consistent with a substellar companion, yet no radial
velocity or photometric variability is found despite extensive searches. Three
independent stellar mass determinations all suggest enhanced mass loss
associated with binary evolution, where the youngest total age for an isolated
star is $7.5\pm2.5$ Gyr. A possible solution to this conundrum is the
cannibalization of one or more giant planets, which enhanced mass loss
post-main sequence, but were ultimately destroyed. PG 0010+281 is likely
orbited by a debris disk that is comfortably exterior to the Roche limit,
adding to the growing number of non-canonical disks orbiting white dwarfs. At
present, only L-type (brown) dwarfs are known to survive direct engulfment
during the post-main sequence, whereas T- and Y-type substellar companions
persist at wide separations. These demographics indicate that roughly 50
M$_{\rm Jup}$ is required to robustly avoid post-main sequence annihilation,
suggesting all closely-orbiting giant planets are consumed, which may
contribute to mass loss and magnetic field generation in white dwarfs and their
immediate progenitors.

relaxation time with geometric characteristics of the nozzle's inner profile.
These characteristics include volume, cross-sectional area, and inner surface
area of the nozzle. Using boundary layer theory for a simple geometry, we show
that the meniscus settles faster when the ratio of inner surface area to volume
is increased. High-fidelity multiphase flow simulations verify this scaling. We
use these laws to explore several design concepts with parameterized classes of
shapes that reduce the meniscus relaxation time while preserving desired
droplet specs. Finally, we show that for various nozzle profile concepts, the
optimal performance can be achieved by increasing the ratio of the
circumferential surface area to the bulk volume to the extent that is allowable

1D scattering problem, we argue that the scattering phases encode non-trivial
information about the DOS and can be extracted by ""renormalizing"" the DOS with
respect to a reference. This defines a renormalized free energy up to an
arbitrary additive constant. Interestingly, the 1-loop Euclidean path integral,
as computed by the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula, fixes the reference free
energy to be that on a Rindler space, and the renormalized DOS captures the
quasinormal modes for the scalar. We support these claims with the examples of
scalars on static BTZ, Nariai black holes and the de Sitter static patch. For
black holes in asymptotically flat space, the renormalized DOS is captured by
the phase of the transmission coefficient whose magnitude squared is the
greybody factor. We comment on possible connections with recent works from an

but not in all active region observations, where the ratio is often lower than

mechanisms that could affect this ratio, such as opacity and absorption from

critical to ensure proper treatments for patients. Among the first-line
modalities investigated in studies of early diagnosis are features distilled
from protein mass spectra. This method, however, considers only a specific
subset of spectral responses and ignores the interplay among protein expression
levels, which can also contain diagnostic information. We propose a new
modality that automatically searches protein mass spectra for discriminatory
features by considering the self-similar nature of the spectra. Self-similarity
is assessed by taking a wavelet decomposition of protein mass spectra and
estimating the rate of level-wise decay in the energies of the resulting
wavelet coefficients. Level-wise energies are estimated in a robust manner
using distance variance, and rates are estimated locally via a rolling window
approach. This results in a collection of rates that can be used to
characterize the interplay among proteins, which can be indicative of cancer
presence. Discriminatory descriptors are then selected from these evolutionary
rates and used as classifying features. The proposed wavelet-based features are
used in conjunction with features proposed in the existing literature for early
stage diagnosis of ovarian cancer using two datasets published by the American
National Cancer Institute. Including the wavelet-based features from the new
modality results in improvements in diagnostic performance for early-stage
ovarian cancer detection. This demonstrates the ability of the proposed
modality to characterize new ovarian cancer diagnostic information.

many applications while suffering from incompleteness issues. The KG completion
task (KGC) automatically predicts missing facts based on an incomplete KG.
However, existing methods perform unsatisfactorily in real-world scenarios. On
the one hand, their performance will dramatically degrade along with the
increasing sparsity of KGs. On the other hand, the inference procedure for
prediction is an untrustworthy black box.
  This paper proposes a novel explainable model for sparse KGC, compositing
high-order reasoning into a graph convolutional network, namely HoGRN. It can
not only improve the generalization ability to mitigate the information
insufficiency issue but also provide interpretability while maintaining the
model's effectiveness and efficiency. There are two main components that are
seamlessly integrated for joint optimization. First, the high-order reasoning
component learns high-quality relation representations by capturing endogenous
correlation among relations. This can reflect logical rules to justify a
broader of missing facts. Second, the entity updating component leverages a
weight-free Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to efficiently model KG
structures with interpretability. Unlike conventional methods, we conduct
entity aggregation and design composition-based attention in the relational
space without additional parameters. The lightweight design makes HoGRN better
suitable for sparse settings. For evaluation, we have conducted extensive
experiments-the results of HoGRN on several sparse KGs present impressive
improvements (9% MRR gain on average). Further ablation and case studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of the main components. Our codes will be
released upon acceptance.

numerical operations, and QBSASM is a by-product generated with the evolution

matrix. Then, the framework and the quantum circuit of QSAN are designed with 9
execution steps and 5 special functional sub-modules, which can acquire QBSASM
effectively in the intermediate process, as well as compressing the number of

vision and natural language processing. However, relevant applications in time
series classification (TSC) have not been explored deeply yet, causing a
significant number of TSC algorithms still suffer from general problems of
attention mechanism, like quadratic complexity. In this paper, we promote the
efficiency and performance of the attention mechanism by proposing our flexible
multi-head linear attention (FMLA), which enhances locality awareness by
layer-wise interactions with deformable convolutional blocks and online
knowledge distillation. What's more, we propose a simple but effective mask
mechanism that helps reduce the noise influence in time series and decrease the
redundancy of the proposed FMLA by masking some positions of each given series
proportionally. To stabilize this mechanism, samples are forwarded through the
model with random mask layers several times and their outputs are aggregated to
teach the same model with regular mask layers. We conduct extensive experiments
on 85 UCR2018 datasets to compare our algorithm with 11 well-known ones and the
results show that our algorithm has comparable performance in terms of top-1
accuracy. We also compare our model with three Transformer-based models with
respect to the floating-point operations per second and number of parameters

core of modern recommender systems. Due to the diverse nature of user
interests, recent advances propose the multi-interest networks to encode
historical behaviors into multiple interest vectors. In real scenarios, the
corresponding items of captured interests are usually retrieved together to get
exposure and collected into training data, which produces dependencies among
interests. Unfortunately, multi-interest networks may incorrectly concentrate
on subtle dependencies among captured interests. Misled by these dependencies,
the spurious correlations between irrelevant interests and targets are
captured, resulting in the instability of prediction results when training and
test distributions do not match. In this paper, we introduce the widely used
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of
independence among captured interests and empirically show that the continuous
increase of HSIC may harm model performance. Based on this, we propose a novel
multi-interest network, named DEep Stable Multi-Interest Learning (DESMIL),
which tries to eliminate the influence of subtle dependencies among captured
interests via learning weights for training samples and make model concentrate
more on underlying true causation. We conduct extensive experiments on public
recommendation datasets, a large-scale industrial dataset and the synthetic
datasets which simulate the out-of-distribution data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed DESMIL outperforms state-of-the-art models by a
significant margin. Besides, we also conduct comprehensive model analysis to
reveal the reason why DESMIL works to a certain extent.

we then use decision procedures supporting quantifiers to check satisfiability

perform BMC using a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) encoding for purely

function, to compute element-level state variables and their derivatives within
a nonlinear, iterative numerical solution. This process is conducted jointly
with conventional finite element methods that involve shape functions: the NN
receives input data that resembles the material point deformation and its
output is used to construct element-level field variables such as the element
Jacobian matrix and residual vector. Here we introduce I-FENN to the continuum
damage analysis of quasi-brittle materials, and we establish a new non-local
gradient-based damage framework which operates at the cost of a local damage
approach. First, we develop a physics informed neural network (PINN) to
resemble the non-local gradient model and then we train the neural network
offline. The network learns to predict the non-local equivalent strain at each
material point, as well as its derivative with respect to the local strain.
Then, the PINN is integrated in the element stiffness definition and conducts
the local to non-local strain transformation, whereas the two PINN outputs are
used to construct the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. This process
is carried out within the nonlinear solver, until numerical convergence is
achieved. The resulting method bears the computational cost of the conventional
local damage approach, but ensures mesh-independent results and a diffused

be achieved with arbitrary two degenerate resonances in a closed resonator
regardless of whether they have the same or opposite parity. Moreover, their
eigenmode profiles can be arbitrarily engineered by adjusting the position of
attached waveguide. That suggests an effective way of continuous switching the
nature of BIC from FW BIC to symmetry-protected BIC or accidental BICs. Also,
such BICs are sustained in the coupled waveguide-resonator system with shapes
such as rectangle, ellipse, and rhomboid. These interesting phenomena are well
explained by the two-level effective non Hermitian Hamiltonian, where two
strongly coupled degenerate modes play a major role in forming such FW BICs.
Besides, we found that such an open system also supports accidental BICs in
geometry space instead of momentum space via tuning the position of attached
waveguide, which are attributed to the quenched coupling between the waveguide
and eigenmodes of the closed cavity. Finally, we fabricated a series of 3D

from time-series data. Unlike existing approaches, our approach provides a
whole family of models. Each model in the family is guaranteed to capture the
input data up to a precision error {\epsilon}, in the following sense: For each
time series, the model contains an execution that is {\epsilon}-close to the
data points. Our construction allows to effectively choose a model from this
family with minimal precision error {\epsilon}. We demonstrate the algorithm's
efficiency and its ability to find precise models in two case studies.

reward by constantly redistributing the portfolio's assets according to certain
goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Unfortunately, there is no
simple formula that can find the right allocation for every individual. As a
result, investors may use different asset allocations' strategy to try to
fulfil their financial objectives. In this work, we conduct an extensive
benchmark study to determine the efficacy and reliability of a number of
optimization techniques. In particular, we focus on traditional approaches
based on Modern Portfolio Theory, and on machine-learning approaches based on
deep reinforcement learning. We assess the model's performance under different
market tendency, i.e., both bullish and bearish markets. For reproducibility,
we provide the code implementation code in this repository.

the limits of perception capability of on-board sensors. In contrast,
vehicle-road collaboration technology can overcome those limits and improve the
traffic safety and efficiency, by expanding the sensing range, improving the
perception accuracy, and reducing the response time. However, such a technology
is still under development; it requires rigorous testing and verification
methods to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the technology. In
this thesis, we focus on three major tasks: (1) analyze the functional
characteristics related to the scenarios of vehicle-road cooperations,
highlightening the differences between vehicle-road cooperative systems and
traditional single-vehicle autonomous driving systems; (2) refine and classifiy
the functional characteristics of vehicle-road cooperative systems; (3) design
and develop a simulation system, and provide a visual interface to facilitate
development and analysis. The efficiency and effectiveness the proposed method
are verfied by experiments.

metric-type spaces, classifying almost all possible metric types into upward

discuss convergence, sequential continuity, first countability and T$_2$
separation. The topology of an O-metric space can be generated by an upward
O-metric on the space hence the focus on upward O-metric spaces. A theorem on
the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point of some contractive-like map is
proved and related with some other well known fixed point results in
literature. Applications to the estimation of distances, polygon inequalities,
and optimization of entries in infinite symmetric matrices are also given.

  Problem","42 pages","Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience (2022)","10.1155/2022/7055910",,"cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Economic Load Dispatch depicts a fundamental role in the operation of power
systems, as it decreases the environmental load, minimizes the operating cost,
and preserves energy resources. The optimal solution to Economic Load Dispatch
problems and various constraints can be obtained by evolving several
evolutionary and swarm-based algorithms. The major drawback to swarm-based
algorithms is premature convergence towards an optimal solution. Fitness
Dependent Optimizer is a novel optimization algorithm stimulated by the
decision-making and reproductive process of bee swarming. Fitness Dependent
Optimizer (FDO) examines the search spaces based on the searching approach of
Particle Swarm Optimization. To calculate the pace, the fitness function is
utilized to generate weights that direct the search agents in the phases of
exploitation and exploration. In this research, the authors have carried out
Fitness Dependent Optimizer to solve the Economic Load Dispatch problem by
reducing fuel cost, emission allocation, and transmission loss. Moreover, the
authors have enhanced a novel variant of Fitness Dependent Optimizer, which
incorporates novel population initialization techniques and dynamically
employed sine maps to select the weight factor for Fitness Dependent Optimizer.
The enhanced population initialization approach incorporates a quasi-random
Sabol sequence to generate the initial solution in the multi-dimensional search
space. A standard 24-unit system is employed for experimental evaluation with
different power demands. Empirical results obtained using the enhanced variant
of the Fitness Dependent Optimizer demonstrate superior performance in terms of
low transmission loss, low fuel cost, and low emission allocation compared to
the conventional Fitness Dependent Optimizer. The experimental study obtained
