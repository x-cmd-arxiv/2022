  in LISA",,,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a study of the use and limits of the Time-Delay Interferometry
null channels for in flight estimation of the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna instrumental noise. The paper considers how the two main limiting noise
sources, test-mass acceleration noise and interferometric phase measurement
noise, propagate through different Time-Delay Interferometry channels: the
Michelson combination X that is the most sensitive to gravitational waves, then
the less-sensitive combinations $\alpha$, and finally the null channel $\zeta$.
We note that the null channel $\zeta$, which is known to be equivalent to any
null channel, not only has a reduced sensitivity to the gravitational waves,
but also feature a larger degree of cancellation of the test mass acceleration
noise relative to the interferometry noise. This severely limits its use in
quantifying the low frequency instrumental noise in the Michelson X
combination, which is expected to be dominated by acceleration noise. However,
we show that one can still use in-flight noise estimations from $\zeta$ to put
an upper bound on the considered noises entering in the X channel, which allows
to distinguish them from a strong stochastic gravitational wave background.

CSSR replaces prototype points with manifolds represented by class-specific
AEs. Unlike conventional prototype-based methods, CSSR models each known class
on an individual AE manifold, and measures class belongingness through AE's
reconstruction error. Class-specific AEs are plugged into the top of the DNN
backbone and reconstruct the semantic representations learned by the DNN
instead of the raw image. Through end-to-end learning, the DNN and the AEs
boost each other to learn both discriminative and representative information.

oscillator Hamiltonian and calculate the canonical partition function. The
permutation invariant sector of the Hilbert space, for general Hamiltonians,
can be described using partition algebra diagrams forming the bases of a tower
of partition algebras $P_k(N)$. The integer $k$ is interpreted as the degree of
matrix oscillator polynomials in the quantum mechanics. Families of interacting
Hamiltonians are described which are diagonalised by a representation theoretic
basis for the permutation invariant subspace which we construct for $ N \ge 2k
$. These include Hamiltonians for which the low-energy states are permutation
invariant and can give rise to large ground state degeneracies related to the
dimensions of partition algebras. A symmetry-based mechanism for quantum many
body scars discussed in the literature can be realised in these matrix systems
with permutation symmetry. A mapping of the matrix index values to lattice
sites allows a realisation of the mechanism in the context of modified
Bose-Hubbard models. Extremal correlators analogous to those studied in AdS/CFT
are shown to obey selection rules based on Clebsch-Gordan multiplicities
(Kronecker coefficients) of symmetric groups.

where three magnetic orders are found, including 120$^\circ$, commensurate
counter-rotating spiral, and zigzag orders. Interestingly, the two first order
phase transition lines separating these three magnetic orders merge at a single
point at $K = -2 \Gamma$ and $J=0$, which is predicted to be a quantum critical
point. The current theory captures the experimentally observed counter-rotating
spiral order in $\alpha$-Li$_22$IrO$_3$ and the zigzag order in Na$_2$IrO$_3$,

are quite a few works of studying this method on various aspects, an
interesting question is how to choose its integration time to achieve
acceleration. In this work, we consider accelerating the process of sampling
from a distribution $\pi(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))$ via HMC via time-varying
integration time. When the potential $f$ is $L$-smooth and $m$-strongly convex,
i.e.\ for sampling from a log-smooth and strongly log-concave target
distribution $\pi$, it is known that under a constant integration time, the
number of iterations that ideal HMC takes to get an $\epsilon$ Wasserstein-2
distance to the target $\pi$ is $O( \kappa \log \frac{1}{\epsilon} )$, where
$\kappa := \frac{L}{m}$ is the condition number. We propose a scheme of
time-varying integration time based on the roots of Chebyshev polynomials. We
show that in the case of quadratic potential $f$, i.e., when the target $\pi$
is a Gaussian distribution, ideal HMC with this choice of integration time only
takes $O( \sqrt{\kappa} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon} )$ number of iterations to
reach Wasserstein-2 distance less than $\epsilon$; this improvement on the
dependence on condition number is akin to acceleration in optimization. The
design and analysis of HMC with the proposed integration time is built on the
tools of Chebyshev polynomials. Experiments find the advantage of adopting our
scheme of time-varying integration time even for sampling from distributions
with smooth strongly convex potentials that are not quadratic.

matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. Crucially, PDS
is proven theoretically to converge to the original target distribution of a

As the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can

reveal an amazingly detailed and clear picture of galaxy evolution. Within the
Local Group, the ability to probe the stellar populations of small and large
galaxies opens up the possibility of exploring key questions such as the nature
of dark matter, the detailed formation history of different galaxy components,
and the role of accretion in galactic formation. Upcoming wide-field surveys
promise to extend this ability to all galaxies within 10~Mpc, drastically
increasing our capability to decipher galaxy evolution and enabling statistical
studies of galaxies' stellar populations. To facilitate the optimum use of
these upcoming capabilities we develop a simple formalism to predict the
density of resolved stars for an observation of a stellar population at fixed
surface brightness and population parameters. We provide an interface to
calculate all quantities of interest to this formalism via a public release of
the code: \texttt{walter}. This code enables calculation of (i) the expected
number density of detected stars, (ii) the exposure time needed to reach
certain population features, such as the horizontal branch, and (iii) an
estimate of the crowding limit, among other features. These calculations will
be very useful for planning surveys with NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman

introduce CENSAT, a new algorithm to define whether a galaxy is a central or a
satellite system based on an isolation criterion. We find that the conformity
signal is present, up to at least 5 Mpc from the centres of low- and
intermediate-mass centrals in the latest version of L-GALAXIES (Ayromlou et al.
2021), IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, as well as in SDSS and DESI observational

older version of L-GALAXIES (Henriques et al. 2020). One of the main
differences between this older model and the other models is its neglect of
ram-pressure stripping of the gas reservoirs of galaxies except within the
boundaries of massive cluster haloes. Our observational comparisons demonstrate
that this difference significantly affects the observed large-scale conformity
signal. Furthermore, by examining the contribution of backsplash, fly-by,
central, and satellite galaxies to the conformity signal, we show that much,

the prompt decay signals of dark-sector particles, which are often challenging

Tucana's radial velocity is consistent with being at rest relative to M31.
Further, Tucana is located close to M33's orbital plane around M31, and simple
orbit integrations indicate that Tucana may have been ejected during an early
pericentric passage of M33 $\sim11$ Gyr ago, a timing which approximately
coincides with Tucana's last episode of star formation. We suggest that Tucana
may have been an early-infalling satellite of M31 or M33, providing a

major merger with a mass ratio $1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.5}$. According to our two-body
kinematic description, the encounter happened $0.58_{-0.20}^{+0.15}$ Gyr ago,
in a scenario that supports the observed radio relic position at the cluster
outskirts. However, the same analysis showed that the companion cluster, eFEDS
J093501.1+005418, is not gravitationally bound to the interacting system and
therefore it is not part of the supercluster. We also checked the impact of
adopting a scaling relation to determine the halo concentration $c_{200}$. At
the observed merger stage, where the clusters have travelled $\sim$55 per cent
of the path to reach the apoapsis, the choice of the $c_{200}$ (whether from a
scaling relation or a free parameter in the mass model) does not change
significantly either the cluster masses or the kinematic description.

(LFs) have typically treated the star-forming galaxy and active galactic nuclei
(AGN) populations separately, as they have different survey depth and area
requirements. However, the recent advent of wide-area deep ground-based imaging
surveys now probe volumes large enough to discover AGNs, at depths sensitive
enough for fainter star-forming galaxies, bridging these two populations. Using
results from such surveys as observational constraints, we present a
methodology to jointly empirically model the evolution of the rest-UV
luminosity functions at z=3-9. We assume both populations have a LF
well-described by a double power law modified to allow a flattening at the
faint-end, and that all LF parameters evolve smoothly with redshift. This
provides a good fit to the observations, and makes predictions to volume
densities and redshifts not yet observed. We find that the volume density of
bright (M_UV = -28) AGNs rises by five orders of magnitude from z=9 to z=3,
while modestly bright (M_UV = -21) galaxies rise by only two orders of
magnitude across the same epoch. The observed bright-end flattening of the z=9
LF is unlikely to be due to AGN, and rather is due to a shallowing of the
bright-end slope, implying reduced feedback in bright galaxies at early times.
Integrating our LFs we find that the intrinsic ionizing emissivity is dominated
by galaxies at all z > 3, and this result holds even after applying a notional
escape fraction. We compare our AGN LFs to predictions based on different
black-hole seeding models, finding decent agreement on average, but that all
models are unable to predict the observed abundance of bright AGNs. We make
predictions for the upcoming Euclid and Roman observatories, showing that their
respective wide-area surveys should be capable of discovering AGNs to z ~ 8.

chemical heating significantly reduce the total CO2 column in the emitting
layer. Water UV-shielding is the more efficient effect, reducing the CO2 column
by $\sim$ 2 orders of magnitude. These lower CO2 abundances lead to CO2-to-H2O
flux ratios that are closer to the observed values, but CO2 emission is still
too bright, especially in relative terms. Invoking the depletion of elemental
oxygen outside of the water mid-plane iceline more strongly impacts the CO2
emission than it does the H2O emission, bringing the CO2-to-H2O emission in
line with the observed values. We conclude that the CO2 emission observed with
Spitzer-IRS is coming from a thin layer in the photo-sphere of the disk,
similar to the strong water lines. Below this layer, we expect CO2 not to be

developments in distribution-free uncertainty quantification present practical
solutions for these issues by providing reliability guarantees for black-box
models on arbitrary data distributions as formally valid finite-sample
prediction intervals. Our work applies these new uncertainty quantification
methods -- specifically conformal prediction -- to a deep-learning model for
grading the severity of spinal stenosis in lumbar spine MRI. We demonstrate a
technique for forming ordinal prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain
the correct stenosis severity within a user-defined probability (confidence
interval). On a dataset of 409 MRI exams processed by the deep-learning model,
the conformal method provides tight coverage with small prediction set sizes.
Furthermore, we explore the potential clinical applicability of flagging cases

increase in the prevalence of significant imaging abnormalities (e.g. motion
artifacts, metallic artifacts, and tumors) that could degrade confidence in
predictive performance when compared to a random sample of cases.

limits the feasibility of tracking a surgeon's progress over many cases. In
this work, we introduce a motion-based approach to automatically assess
surgical skills from surgical case video feed. The proposed pipeline first
tracks surgical tools reliably to create motion trajectories and then uses
those trajectories to predict surgeon technical skill levels. The tracking
algorithm employs a simple yet effective re-identification module that improves
ID-switch compared to other state-of-the-art methods. This is critical for
creating reliable tool trajectories when instruments regularly move on- and
off-screen or are periodically obscured. The motion-based classification model
employs a state-of-the-art self-attention transformer network to capture short-

proposed method is evaluated on an in-vivo (Cholec80) dataset where an

i.e. FU Ori objects (FUors). Here, we report on molecular emission line
observations of the FUor system, V883 Ori. In order to image the FUor object
with full coverage from ~0.5 arcsec to the map size of ~30 arcsec, i.e. from
disc to outflow scales, we combine the ALMA main array (the 12-m array) with
the Atacama Compact Array (7-m array) and the total power (TP) array. We detect
HCN, HCO$^{+}$, CH$_{3}$OH, SO, DCN, and H$_{2}$CO emissions with most of these
lines displaying complex kinematics. From PV diagrams, the detected molecules
HCN, HCO$^{+}$, CH$_{3}$OH, DCN, SO, and H$_{2}$CO probe a Keplerian rotating
disc in a direction perpendicular to the large-scale outflow detected
previously with the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO lines. Additionally, HCN and
HCO$^{+}$ reveal kinematic signatures of infall motion. The north outflow is
seen in HCO$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, and SO emissions. Interestingly, HCO$^{+}$
emission reveals a pronounced inner depression or ""hole"" with a size comparable
to the radial extension estimated for the CH$_{3}$OH and 230 GHz continuum. The
inner depression in the integrated HCO$^{+}$ intensity distribution of V883 Ori
is most likely the result of optical depth effects, wherein the optically thick
nature of the HCO$^{+}$ and continuum emission towards the innermost parts of
V883 Ori can result in a continuum subtraction artifact in the final HCO$^{+}$
flux level.

to model situations where some quantitative strength is associated with
arguments. In this setting, the notion of accrual corresponds to sets of
arguments that collectively attack an argument. Some semantics have already
been defined, which are sensitive to the existence of accruals that
collectively defeat their target, while their individual elements cannot.
However, until now, only the surface of this framework and semantics have been
studied. Indeed, the existing literature focuses on the adaptation of the
stable semantics to StrAFs. In this paper, we push forward the study and
investigate the adaptation of admissibility-based semantics. Especially, we
show that the strong admissibility defined in the literature does not satisfy a
desirable property, namely Dung's fundamental lemma. We therefore propose an
alternative definition that induces semantics that behave as expected. We then
study computational issues for these new semantics, in particular we show that
complexity of reasoning is similar to the complexity of the corresponding
decision problems for standard argumentation frameworks in almost all cases. We
then propose a translation in pseudo-Boolean constraints for computing (strong
and weak) extensions. We conclude with an experimental evaluation of our
approach which shows in particular that it scales up well for solving the
problem of providing one extension as well as enumerating them all.

discretized by using the DEC, which is the discretized version of the exterior
calculus in differential geometry. In general, DEC can be viewed as a
generalized version of the finite difference method, where Stokes' theorem and
Gauss's theorem are naturally preserved. Furthermore, compared with finite
difference method, where rectangular grids are applied, DEC can be implemented
with unstructured mesh schemes, such as tetrahedral meshes. Thus, the proposed
DEC A-Phi solver is inherently stable, free of spurious solutions and can
capture highly complex structures efficiently. In this paper, the background

the annotation bottleneck of supervised learning. Recent SSL methods can
effectively leverage a large repository of unlabeled data to improve
performance while relying on a small set of labeled data. One common assumption
in most SSL methods is that the labeled and unlabeled data are from the same
data distribution. However, this is hardly the case in many real-world
scenarios, which limits their applicability. In this work, instead, we attempt
to solve the challenging open-world SSL problem that does not make such an

samples of known classes, and simultaneously detect and cluster samples
belonging to novel classes present in unlabeled data. This work introduces
OpenLDN that utilizes a pairwise similarity loss to discover novel classes.
Using a bi-level optimization rule this pairwise similarity loss exploits the
information available in the labeled set to implicitly cluster novel class
samples, while simultaneously recognizing samples from known classes. After
discovering novel classes, OpenLDN transforms the open-world SSL problem into a
standard SSL problem to achieve additional performance gains using existing SSL
methods. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenLDN outperforms the
current state-of-the-art methods on multiple popular classification benchmarks
while providing a better accuracy/training time trade-off.

high-fidelity speech, their use of recurrent or convolutional layers often
restricts their effective receptive fields, which prevents them from
compressing speech efficiently. We propose to further reduce the bitrate of
neural speech codecs through the use of pretrained Transformers, capable of
exploiting long-range dependencies in the input signal due to their inductive
bias. As such, we use a pretrained Transformer in tandem with a convolutional
encoder, which is trained end-to-end with a quantizer and a generative
adversarial net decoder. Our numerical experiments show that supplementing the
convolutional encoder of a neural speech codec with Transformer speech
embeddings yields a speech codec with a bitrate of $600\,\mathrm{bps}$ that
outperforms the original neural speech codec in synthesized speech quality when
trained at the same bitrate. Subjective human evaluations suggest that the
quality of the resulting codec is comparable or better than that of
conventional codecs operating at three to four times the rate.

(1976), and by Balachandran and Khare (2009). It follows from the structure of
those extremal graphs that deciding whether this maximum number decreases or
not when restricted to claw-free graphs, to $C_4$-free graphs or to
triangle-free graphs are separately interesting research questions. The first
two cases being already settled, respectively by Dibek, Ekim and Heggernes
(2017), and by Blair, Heggernes, Lima and D.Lokshtanov (2020). In this paper we
focus on triangle-free graphs. We show that unlike most cases for claw-free
graphs and $C_4$-free graphs, forbidding triangles from extremal graphs causes
a strict decrease in the number of edges and adds to the hardness of the
problem. We provide a formula giving the maximum number of edges in a
triangle-free graph with degree at most $d$ and matching number at most $m$ for
all cases where $d\geq m$, and for the cases where $d<m$ with either $d\leq 6$
or $Z(d)\leq m < 2d$ where $Z(d)$ is a function of $d$ which is roughly $5d/4$.
We also provide an integer programming formulation for the remaining cases and
as a result of further discussion on this formulation, we conjecture that our
formula giving the size of triangle-free extremal graphs is also valid for
these open cases.

We find that models trained using 3D simulations from our SPATIAL dataset
outperform conventional 2D computer vision models trained on a similar task,
and, on initial inspection, that differences between concepts correspond to
expected features (e.g., roll entails rotation). Our results suggest a way in
which modern deep learning approaches to grounded language learning can be
integrated with traditional formal semantic notions of lexical representations.

wind farms. On the other hand, the uncertainties in weather conditions, asset

holistic opportunistic scheduler--a maintenance scheduling approach tailored to
address the unique challenges and uncertainties in offshore wind farms. Given
probabilistic forecasts of key environmental and operational parameters,
STOCHOS optimally schedules the offshore maintenance tasks by harnessing the
opportunities that arise due to favorable weather conditions, on-site
maintenance resources, and maximal operating revenues. STOCHOS is formulated as
a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program, which we solve using a

offshore wind farms are in-development, STOCHOS demonstrates considerable
improvements relative to prevalent maintenance benchmarks, across various O&M

mobile robots that autonomously roam in an industrial floor and perform a
variety of tasks at different locations whilst utilizing high directivity
beamformers in mmWave small cells. In such scenarios, the potential close
proximity of mobile robots connected to different base stations, may cause
excessive levels of interference having as a net result a decrease in the
overall achievable data rate in the network. To resolve this issue, a novel
mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed where the trajectory
of the mobile robots is considered jointly with the interference level at
different beam sectors. Therefore, creating a low interference path for each
mobile robot in the industrial floor. A wide set of numerical investigations
reveal that the proposed path planning optimization approach for the mmWave
connected mobile robots can improve the overall achievable throughput by up to
31% compared to an interference oblivious scheme, without penalizing the

attracted a surge of interest as recent studies have shown that a moderate
change in the spin orientation of a collinear antiferromagnet may have a
significant effect on the electronic band structure. Among numerous electrical
probes to read out such magnetic order, unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR),
where the resistance changes under the reversal of the current direction, can
provide rich insights into the transport properties of spin-orbit coupled
systems. However, UMR has never been observed in antiferromagnets before, given
the absence of intrinsic spin-dependent scattering. Here, we report a UMR in
the antiferromagnetic phase of a FeRh$|$Pt bilayer, which undergoes a sign
change and then increases strongly with an increasing external magnetic field,
in contrast to UMRs in ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic systems. We show that
Rashba spin-orbit coupling alone cannot explain the sizable UMR in the
antiferromagnetic bilayer and that field-induced spin canting distorts the
Fermi contours to greatly enhance the UMR by two orders of magnitude. Our
results can motivate the growing field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, and
suggest a route to the development of tunable antiferromagnet-based spintronics
devices.

be much richer than suggested by the original data of Kudo et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 109, 097002 (2012)]. The transition to the commensurate
charge-density-wave (C-CDW) is always preceded by a four-fold symmetry-breaking
transition associated with the long-range ordering of a strongly fluctuating
unidirectional incommensurate charge-density wave (I-CDW). Significant
precursors above the I-CDW and C-CDW transitions are seen in the thermal
expansion and resistivity and are particularly evident in the temperature
dependence of the $c/a$ ratio of the lattice parameters. Heat-capacity
measurements of the crystals with a higher P content and a higher critical
temperature of 3.2 K uncover a Debye-like behavior of a soft-phonon mode with a
very low Debye temperature of roughly 15 K. Associated with this soft phonon
are unusually large thermal-expansion anomalies, resulting in logarithmically
diverging uniaxial phonon Grueneisen parameters. Young-modulus data of these
higher-Tc crystals exhibit a significant softening in both B1g and B2g
channels, which is argued to be incompatible with nematic criticality and is
rather associated with a broad phase transition to an hitherto unknown
structure. Possible origins of the increase in the superconducting critical
temperature with P-substitution are discussed.

the development of AI approaches to replace the human effort. Unfortunately, it
is currently not possible to deploy AI models on network devices due to their
limited computational capabilities. Here, we offer a solution to this problem
by building a computationally-light solution based on a recent reinforcement

by x500 by distilling its complex neural network into decision trees. This
transformation enables real-time inference within the $\mu$-sec decision-time

policy on NVIDIA NICs in a live cluster. Compared to popular CC algorithms used
in production, RL-CC is the only method that performs well on all benchmarks
tested over a large range of number of flows. It balances multiple metrics
simultaneously: bandwidth, latency, and packet drops. These results suggest
that data-driven methods for CC are feasible, challenging the prior belief that
handcrafted heuristics are necessary to achieve optimal performance.

The ejected material from neutron star mergers, or kilonova, is a good

evidence for the astrophysical site of the synthesis of heavy nuclei through
the rapid neutron capture process or rprocess. Since properties of the emission
are largely affected by opacities of the ejected material, enhancements in the

However, given the complexity of the electronic structure of these heavy
elements, considerable efforts are still needed to converge to a reliable set
of atomic structure data. The aim of this work is to alleviate this situation

Despite its profound impact on the field of topological physics and recent
implementation in cold-atom experiments, the Haldane model has remained elusive
in solid-state materials. Here, we report the experimental realization of a
Haldane Chern insulator in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, which form a

show that the moir\'e bilayer filled with two charge particles per unit cell is
a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator with a tunable charge gap. Under a small
out-of-plane magnetic field, it becomes a Chern insulator with Chern number c=1
from magneto-transport studies. The results are qualitatively captured by a
generalized Kane-Mele tight-binding Hamiltonian. The Zeeman field splits the
QSH insulator into two halves of opposite valley--one with a positive and the
other a negative moir\'e band gap. Our study highlights the unique potential of
semiconductor moir\'e materials in engineering topological lattice
Hamiltonians.

bulk microcrystalline samples by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and
serial sectioning can be used to reconstruct relative grain boundary energy
distributions (GBED) based on the 3D geometry of triple lines, assuming that
the Herring condition of force balance is satisfied. These GBEDs correlate to
those predicted from molecular dynamics (MD); furthermore, the GBCD and GBED
are found to be inversely correlated. For nanocrystalline thin films,
orientation mapping via precession enhanced electron diffraction (PED) has
proven effective in measuring the GBCD, but the GBED has not been extracted.
Here, the established relative energy extraction technique is adapted to PED
data from four sputter deposited samples: a 40 nm-thick tungsten film and a 100
nm aluminum film as-deposited, after 30 and after 150 minutes annealing at
400{\deg}C. These films have columnar grain structures, so serial sectioning is
not required to determine boundary inclination. Excepting the most
energetically anisotropic and highest population boundaries, i.e. aluminum
{\Sigma}3 boundaries, the relative GBED extracted from these data do not
correlate with energies calculated using MD nor do they inversely correlate
with the experimentally determined GBCD for either the tungsten or aluminum
films. Failure to reproduce predicted energetic trends implies that the
conventional Herring equation cannot be applied to determine relative GBEDs and
thus geometries at triple junctions in these films are not well described by
this condition; additional geometric factors must contribute to determining
triple junction geometry and boundary network structure in spatially
constrained, polycrystalline materials.

mechanisms to support cooperation is spatial reciprocity, usually accomplished
by distributing players in a spatial structure allowing cooperators to cluster
together and avoid exploitation. This raises an important question: how is the
survival of cooperation affected by different topologies? Here, to address this
question, we explore the Focal Public Goods (FPGG) and classic Public Goods
Games (PGG), and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) on several regular lattices:
honeycomb, square (with von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods), kagome,
triangular, cubic, and 4D hypercubic lattices using both analytical methods and
agent-based Monte Carlo simulations. We found that for both Public Goods Games,
a consistent trend appears on all two-dimensional lattices: as the number of
first neighbors increases, cooperation is enhanced. However, this is only
visible by analysing the results in terms of the payoff's synergistic factor
normalized by the number of connections. Besides this, clustered topologies,
i.e., those that allow two connected players to share neighbors, are the most
beneficial to cooperation for the FPGG. The same is not always true for the
classic PGG, where having shared neighbors between connected players may or may
not benefit cooperation. We also provide a reinterpretation of the classic PGG
as a focal game by representing the lattice structure of this category of games
as a single interaction game with longer-ranged, weighted neighborhoods, an
approach valid for any regular lattice topology. Finally, we show that
depending on the payoff parametrization of the PD, there can be an equivalency
between the PD and the FPGG; when the mapping between the two games is
imperfect, the definition of an effective synergy parameter can still be useful
to show their similarities.

seamless in theory, it requires that the conditions of an interaction are
accurately made available in the blockchain. Time is a prominent such
condition. In the paper at hand, we empirically measure the consistency of a
smart contract to yield equal results on the basis of the time of an
interaction and its potentially inaccurate representation in the blockchain. We
propose a novel metric called execution accuracy to measure this consistency.
We specifically measure the execution accuracy of a time interval-constrained
smart contract that executes distinct logic within and without some constraint
interval. We run experiments for the local Ganache and Quorum and the public
G\""orli and Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains. Our experiments confirm our intuition
that execution accuracy decreases near interval bounds. The novelty of our

distinct blockchains comparable with respect to their capacity to accurately
stipulate time contraints.

compact representations for data analysis applications such as disease
classification. In this paper, we propose a novel parcellation-free WBT
analysis framework, TractoFormer, that leverages tractography information at
the level of individual fiber streamlines and provides a natural mechanism for
interpretation of results using the attention mechanism of transformers.
TractoFormer includes two main contributions. First, we propose a novel and
simple 2D image representation of WBT, TractoEmbedding, to encode 3D fiber
spatial relationships and any feature of interest that can be computed from
individual fibers (such as FA or MD). Second, we design a network based on
vision transformers (ViTs) that includes: 1) data augmentation to overcome
model overfitting on small datasets, 2) identification of discriminative fibers
for interpretation of results, and 3) ensemble learning to leverage fiber
information from different brain regions. In a synthetic data experiment,
TractoFormer successfully identifies discriminative fibers with simulated group

TractoFormer achieves the highest accuracy in classifying schizophrenia vs

However, most published connectome studies have focused on either structural or
functional connectome, yet complementary information between them, when
available in the same dataset, can be jointly leveraged to improve our
understanding of the brain. To this end, we propose a function-constrained
structural graph variational autoencoder (FCS-GVAE) capable of incorporating
information from both functional and structural connectome in an unsupervised
fashion. This leads to a joint low-dimensional embedding that establishes a
unified spatial coordinate system for comparing across different subjects. We
evaluate our approach using the publicly available OASIS-3 Alzheimer's disease

encode functional brain dynamics. Further, the proposed joint embedding

lowest energy state and acquire coherence at low temperatures. It is realized
not only in $^4$He and dilute atomic gases, but also in quantum magnets, where
hardcore bosons, introduced by the Matsubara-Matsuda transformation of spins,
condense. In 3D antiferromagnets, an XY-type long-range ordering (LRO) occurs
near a magnetic-field-induced transition to a fully polarized state (FP) and
has been successfully described as a BEC in the last few decades. An attractive
extension of the BEC in 3D magnets is to make their 2D analogue. For a strictly
2D system, BEC cannot take place due to the presence of a finite density of
states at zero energy, and a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition
may instead emerge. In a realistic quasi-2D magnet consisting of stacked 2D
magnets, a small but finite interlayer coupling stabilizes marginal LRO and
BEC, but such that 2D physics, including BKT fluctuations, is still expected to
dominate. A few systems were reported to show such 2D-limit BEC, but at very
high magnetic fields that are difficult to access. The honeycomb $S$ = 1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbCl$_3$ with an intra-layer coupling $J\sim$ 5 K
exhibits a transition to a FP state at a low in-plane magnetic field of $H_{\rm
s}$ = 5.93 T. Here, we demonstrate that the LRO right below $H_{\rm s}$ is a
BEC in the 2D-limit stabilized by an extremely small interlayer coupling
$J_{\perp}$ of 10$^{-5}J$. Reflecting the 2D limit, an extended region of
thermal fluctuations is observed from the BEC transition temperature $T_{\rm
c}$ up to $\sim 2T_{\rm c}$, which may carry certain BKT characteristics. At
$H_{\rm s}$, we clearly capture 2D-limit quantum fluctuations that can be
described as the formation of a highly mobile, interacting 2D Bose gas in the
dilute limit.

provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs by hypothesizing that
training PINNs relies on successful ""propagation"" of solution from initial

poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are
propagation failures, characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields.

with a range of amplitudes. We studied two young stars, which triggered the
Gaia Science Alerts system due to brightenings on a time-scale of a year.
Gaia20bwa brightened by about half a magnitude, whereas Gaia20fgx brightened by
about two and half magnitudes. We analyzed the Gaia light curves, additional
photometry, and spectra taken with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the
Gran Telescopio Canarias. Several emission lines were detected toward
Gaia20bwa, including hydrogen lines from H$\alpha$ to H$\delta$, Pa$\beta$,
Br$\gamma$, and lines of Ca II, O I, and Na I. The H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$
lines were detected toward Gaia20fgx in emission in its bright state, with
additional CO lines in absorption, and the Pa$\beta$ line with an inverse P
Cygni profile during its fading. Based on the Br$\gamma$ lines the accretion
rate was $(2.4-3.1)\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Gaia20bwa and
$(4.5-6.6)\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Gaia20fgx during their bright
state. The accretion rate of Gaia20fgx dropped by almost a factor of 10 on a
time-scale of half a year. The accretion parameters of both stars were found to
be similar to those of classical T Tauri stars, lower than those of young
eruptive stars. However, the amplitude and time-scale of these brightenings
place these stars to a region of the parameter space, which is rarely populated
by young stars. This suggests a new class of young stars, which produce
outbursts on a time-scale similar to young eruptive stars, but with smaller
amplitudes.

climate science, fluid dynamics and biophysics. However, so far its correct
thermodynamic foundation is lacking or even believed to be impossible. A
physically correct definition should not be based on mathematical notions of
the means (e.g. the mean geometric or mean arithmetic), because they ignore the
peculiarities of the notion of temperature, and because they are not unique. We
offer a thermodynamic definition of the mean temperature that is based upon the
following two assumptions. First, as the correct definition should necessarily
involve equilibration processes in the initially non-equilibrium system, the
mean temperature is bounded from below and above via looking at (respectively)
the reversible versus fully irreversible extremes of equilibration. Second,
within the thermodynamic approach we assume that the mean temperature is
determined mostly by energy and entropy. Together with the dimensional
analysis, the two assumptions lead to a unique definition of the mean
temperature. The mean temperature for ideal and (van der Waals) non-ideal gases
with temperature-independent heat capacity is given by a general and compact
formula that (besides the initial temperatures) only depends on the
heat-capacities and concentration of gases.

with environmental and control noises that introduce decoherence of qubit

extremely difficult for a single photon to ""talk"" to another deterministically.
Here, we propose a universal distributed quantum computing scheme based on
photons and atomic-ensemble-based quantum memories. Taking the established
photonic advantages, we mediate two-qubit nonlinear interaction by converting
photonic qubits into quantum memory states and employing Rydberg blockade for
controlled gate operation. We further demonstrate spatial and temporal

concept of community engagement in all stages of cultural heritage management
is accepted for almost everyone. But the idea of citizen participation is a
little like eating spinach: no one is against it in principle because it is
good for you. If we accept that community engagement is good for us, the
problem is how to let people participate? Not only communities are not very
aware of their rights on their cultural heritage, but also cultural heritage
authorities are unwilling to involve people in their decision-making process.

driven by a uniform flow of $\mathscr L$ at spatial infinity, characterized by

show that as long as $\lambda\in(0,\lambda_c)$, with $\lambda_c$ a distinct

$\mathscr S$ where $\mathscr B$ is in a (locally) stable equilibrium and the
flow of $\mathscr L$ is steady. Moreover, in that range of $\lambda$, no
oscillatory flow may occur. Successively we prove that if certain suitable
spectral properties of the relevant linearized operator are met, there exists a
$\lambda_0>\lambda_c> 0$ where an oscillatory regime for $\mathscr S$ sets in.
More precisely, a bifurcating time-periodic branch stems out of the
time-independent solution. The significant feature of this result is that {\em
no} restriction is imposed on the frequency, $\omega$, of the bifurcating
solution, which may thus coincide with the natural structural frequency,
$\omega_{\sf n}$, of $\mathscr B$, or any multiple of it. This implies that a
dramatic structural failure cannot take place due to resonance effects.
However, our analysis also shows that when $\omega$ becomes sufficiently close
to $\omega_{\sf n}$ the amplitude of oscillations can become very large in the

following safety constraints for a single freeway with arbitrary number of on-
and off-ramps. The arrival times of vehicles to the on-ramps, as well as their
destinations are modeled by exogenous stochastic processes. Once a vehicle is
released from an on-ramp, it accelerates towards the free flow speed if it is
not obstructed by another vehicle; once it gets close to another vehicle, it
adopts a safe gap vehicle following behavior. The vehicle exits the freeway
once it reaches its destination off-ramp. We design traffic-responsive RM
policies that maximize the freeway throughput. For a given routing matrix, the
throughput of a RM policy is characterized by the set of on-ramp arrival rates
for which the queue sizes at all the on-ramps remain bounded in expectation.
The proposed RM policies work in synchronous cycles during which an on-ramp
does not release more vehicles than its queue size at the beginning of the

modulates the release rate during a cycle, or (iii) adopts a conservative safe
gap criterion for release during a cycle. All the proposed policies are
reactive, meaning that they only require real-time traffic measurements without
the need for demand prediction. The throughput of these policies is
characterized by studying stochastic stability of the induced Markov chains,

the free flow speed. Simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of

a compound that does not fit the conventional mixed-valence paradigm. Instead,
experimental evidence points at a resistance driven by strong magnetic
fluctuations within the two-dimensional ($2d$) ferromagnetic (FM) planes of the
layered antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure. While the experimental results have
not yet been fully understood, a recent theory relates the CMR to a topological
vortex-antivortex unbinding, i.e., Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT), phase
transition. Motivated by these observations, in this work we explore the
magnetic phases hosted by a microscopic classical magnetic model for
EuCd$_2$P$_2$, which easily generalizes to other Eu A-type antiferromagnetic
compounds. Using Monte Carlo techniques to probe the specific heat and the
helicity modulus, we show that our model can exhibit a vortex-antivortex
unbinding phase transition. We find that this phase transition displays the
same sensitivity to in-plane magnetization, interlayer coupling, and easy-plane
anisotropy that is observed experimentally in the CMR signal, providing
qualitative numerical evidence that the effect is related to a magnetic BKT
transition.

are investing in grading systems to maximise value extraction throughout their

internationally by predicting quality grades of specific muscles processed by a
designated cooking method. The model currently underpinning the MSA system

less accurate in the presence of unbalanced data sets where many ""muscle x

quality that bridges a spectrum of muscle x cook-specific models. At one
extreme, each muscle x cook combination is modelled independently; at the other
extreme a pooled predictive model is obtained across all muscle x cook

Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints,
which are themselves consistent. The effective volume covered by the supernovae
is small compared to the other probes, and it is therefore interesting to
consider whether sample variance (often also called cosmic variance) is a
significant contributor to the offset. We consider four ways of calculating the
sample variance: (i) perturbation theory applied to the luminosity distance,
which is the most common method considered in the literature; (ii) perturbation
of cosmological parameters, as is commonly used to alleviate super-sample
covariance in sets of N-body simulations; (iii) a new method based on the
variance between perturbed spherical top-hat regions; (iv) using numerical
N-body simulations. All give consistent results showing that, for the Pantheon
supernova sample, sample variance can only lead to fluctuations in $H_0$ of
order $\pm1$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ or less. While this is not in itself a new
result, the agreement between the methods used adds to its robustness.
Furthermore, it is instructive to see how the different methods fit together.
We also investigate the internal variance of the $H_{0}$ measurement using
SH0ES and Pantheon data. By searching for an offset between measurements in
opposite hemispheres, we find that the direction coincident with the CMB dipole
has a higher $H_{0}$ measurement than the opposite hemisphere by roughly 4 km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. We compare this with a large number of simulations and find
that the size of this asymmetry is statistically likely, but the preference of
direction may indicate that further calibration is needed.

Feature selection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple individual
base feature selectors, have been investigated as a means of stabilising
feature selection results, but do not address the problem of correlated
features. We present a novel framework to create feature selection ensembles
from multivariate feature selectors while taking into account the biases
produced by groups of correlated features, using agglomerative hierarchical
clustering in a pre-processing step. These methods were applied to two
real-world datasets from studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive
neurodegenerative disease that has no cure and is not yet fully understood. Our
results show a marked improvement in the stability of features selected over
the models without clustering, and the features selected by these models are in
keeping with the findings in the AD literature.

application of an instant optical pulse to a half-infinite region in an

that the corresponding linear response is described by a universal quantized
formula in the thermal dynamical limit, which is invariant under local
continuous deformations of the trapping potential $V$, atom distribution
$f_\Lambda$, the spatial envelope of the optical pulse $\Theta_p$, and the
measurement region $\Theta_m$. We test the statement by various numerical
analysis, the result of which is consistent with the analytical prediction to
high accuracy. We further show that a short but finite optical pulse duration
only results in a violation of the quantization near the transition time, which
suggests that quantized response could be observed in realistic experiments. We
also generalize our results to non-linear quantized topological responses for

the rows of an orthogonal array of degree $k$, size $n$ (respectively, $m$),
$q$ levels and strength $t$. Such arrays are used in experimental design. In
this context, for a row-column factorial design of strength $t$, all subsets of
interactions of size at most $t$ can be estimated without confounding by the

  In this manuscript, we study row-column factorial designs with strength

In this work, we for the first time, uncover the problem from two aspects:
unbalanced interaction distribution and biased model learning. To overcome the

the proposed ODM allows rare interaction instances to be more frequently

quantitatively study the object bias problem, we advocate a new protocol for
evaluating model performance. As demonstrated in the experimental results, our

prediction using microstructure measurements estimated from diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography, focusing on predicting performance on a
receptive vocabulary assessment task based on a critical fiber tract for
language, the arcuate fasciculus (AF). We directly utilize information from all
points in a fiber tract, without the need to average data along the fiber as is
traditionally required by diffusion MRI tractometry methods. Specifically, we
represent the AF as a point cloud with microstructure measurements at each
point, enabling adoption of point-based neural networks. We improve prediction
performance with the proposed Paired-Siamese Loss that utilizes information
about differences between continuous neuropsychological scores. Finally, we
propose a Critical Region Localization (CRL) algorithm to localize informative
anatomical regions containing points with strong contributions to the
prediction results. Our method is evaluated on data from 806 subjects from the
Human Connectome Project dataset. Results demonstrate superior
neuropsychological score prediction performance compared to baseline methods.
We discover that critical regions in the AF are strikingly consistent across
subjects, with the highest number of strongly contributing points located in

widely used in pattern recognition and machine learning. A main drawback of the
k-medoids algorithm is that it can be trapped in local optima. An improved
k-medoids algorithm (INCKM) was recently proposed to overcome this drawback,
based on constructing a candidate medoids subset with a parameter choosing
procedure, but it may fail when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In this
paper, we propose a novel incremental k-medoids algorithm (INCKPP) which
dynamically increases the number of clusters from 2 to k through a
nonparametric and stochastic k-means++ search procedure. Our algorithm can
overcome the parameter selection problem in the improved k-medoids algorithm,
improve the clustering performance, and deal with imbalanced datasets very
well. But our algorithm has a weakness in computation efficiency. To address
this issue, we propose a fast INCKPP algorithm (called INCKPP$_{sample}$) which
preserves the computational efficiency of the simple and fast k-medoids
algorithm with an improved clustering performance. The proposed algorithm is
compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms: the improved k-medoids
algorithm (INCKM), the simple and fast k-medoids algorithm (FKM) and the
k-means++ algorithm (KPP). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real
world datasets including imbalanced datasets illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

In low-mass
stars, mass loss is most significant on the red giant branch (RGB), and will
impact the star's evolutionary path and final stellar remnant. Directly
measuring the mass difference of stars in various phases of evolution
represents one of the best ways to quantify integrated mass loss. Globular
clusters (GCs) are ideal objects for this. M4 is currently the only GC for
which asteroseismic data exists for stars in multiple phases of evolution.
Using K2 photometry, we report asteroseismic masses for 75 red giants in M4,
the largest seismic sample in a GC to date. We find an integrated RGB mass loss
of $\Delta\bar{M} = 0.17 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, equivalent to a
Reimers' mass-loss coefficient of $\eta_R = 0.39$. Our results for initial
mass, horizontal branch mass, $\eta_R$, and integrated RGB mass loss show
remarkable agreement with previous studies, but with higher precision using
asteroseismology. We also report the first detections of solar-like
oscillations in early asymptotic giant branch (EAGB) stars in GCs. We find an
average mass of $\bar{M}_{\text{EAGB}}=0.54 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,
significantly lower than predicted by models. This suggests
larger-than-expected mass loss on the horizontal branch. Alternatively, it
could indicate unknown systematics in seismic scaling relations for the EAGB.
We discover a tentative mass bi-modality in the RGB sample, possibly due to the
multiple populations. In our red horizontal branch sample, we find a mass
distribution consistent with a single value. We emphasise the importance of
seismic studies of GCs since they could potentially resolve major uncertainties
in stellar theory.

which is repulsive on the Matsubara axis, where it is real, but does depend on
the transferred frequency. Such a situation holds, e.g., for systems with a
screened Coulomb and retarded electron-phonon interaction. We show that despite
repulsion, superconductivity is possible in a certain range of system
parameters. However, at $T=0$ the gap function on the Matsubara axis, $\Delta
(\omega_m)$, must pass through zero and change sign at least once. These zeros
of $\Delta (\omega_m)$ have a topological interpretation in terms of dynamical
vortices, and their presence imposes a constraint on the variation of the phase
of the gap function along the real frequency axis, which can potentially be
extracted from ARPES and other measurements. We discuss how superconductivity
vanishes when the repulsion becomes too strong, and obtain a critical line
which terminates at $T=0$ at a quantum-critical point for superconductivity. We
show that the behavior of the gap function near this point is highly
non-trivial. In particular, an infinitesimally small $\Delta (\omega_m)$
contains a singular $\delta-$function piece $\omega_m \delta (\omega_m)$. We
argue that near the critical point superconductivity may be a mixed state with
even-frequency and odd-frequency gap components.

conditions violations, it is observed a clear correlation with different
plateau structures formed in the far from equilibrium entropy, indicating the
presence of transient, early time windows where the Bjorken expanding plasma
has zero entropy production even while being far from equilibrium. The
hydrodynamization of the pressure anisotropy and also the much later
thermalization of the scalar condensate are generally found to be delayed,

nonlinear Dirac cone emerges at $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$ point of the Bloch band,
with a three-fold degenerate nonlinear Dirac point. Each degenerate Bloch wave
at nonlinear Dirac point spontaneously breaks $C3$ rotational symmetry of the
moir\'e potential, and themselves differ by $C3$ rotations. Since they reside

income structure of the film industry. The income of the traditional film
industry depends on the box office and also includes movie merchandising,
advertisement, home entertainment, book sales etc. Movie merchandising can even
become more profitable than the box office. Therefore, market analysis and
forecasting methods for multi-feature merchandising of multi-type films are
particularly important. Traditional market research is time-consuming and
labour-intensive, and its practical value is restricted. Due to the limited
research method, more effective predictive analysis technology needs to be
formed. With the rapid development of machine learning and big data, a large
number of machine learning algorithms for predictive regression and
classification recognition have been proposed and widely used in product design
and industry analysis. This paper proposes a high-precision movie merchandising
prediction model based on machine learning technology: WE model. This model
integrates three machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the movie
merchandising market. The WE model learns the relationship between the movie
merchandising market and movie features by analyzing the main feature
information of movies. After testing, the accuracy rate of prediction and
evaluation in the merchandising market reaches 72.5%, and it has achieved a
strong market control effect.

and spatial coupling between keypoints due to the biological constraints of
different body parts. This group-wise structural correlation can be explored to
improve the accuracy and robustness of human pose estimation. In this work, we
develop a self-constrained prediction-verification network to characterize and
learn the structural correlation between keypoints during training. During the
inference stage, the feedback information from the verification network allows
us to perform further optimization of pose prediction, which significantly
improves the performance of human pose estimation. Specifically, we partition
the keypoints into groups according to the biological structure of human body.
Within each group, the keypoints are further partitioned into two subsets,
high-confidence base keypoints and low-confidence terminal keypoints. We
develop a self-constrained prediction-verification network to perform forward
and backward predictions between these keypoint subsets. One fundamental
challenge in pose estimation, as well as in generic prediction tasks, is that
there is no mechanism for us to verify if the obtained pose estimation or
prediction results are accurate or not, since the ground truth is not
available. Once successfully learned, the verification network serves as an
accuracy verification module for the forward pose prediction. During the
inference stage, it can be used to guide the local optimization of the pose
estimation results of low-confidence keypoints with the self-constrained loss
on high-confidence keypoints as the objective function. Our extensive
experimental results on benchmark MS COCO and CrowdPose datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method can significantly improve the pose estimation results.

complicated scenes (e.g., occlusions and accessories). Moreover, it enables
full-body image translation via one elegant evaluation network trained by
partial observations (i.e., stylized heads). Few-shot learning based style
transfer is challenging since the learned model can easily become overfitted in
the target domain, due to the biased distribution formed by only a few training
examples. This paper aims to handle the challenge by adopting the key idea of
""calibration first, translation later"" and exploring the augmented global
structure with locally-focused translation. Specifically, the proposed DCT-Net
consists of three modules: a content adapter borrowing the powerful prior from
source photos to calibrate the content distribution of target samples; a
geometry expansion module using affine transformations to release spatially
semantic constraints; and a texture translation module leveraging samples
produced by the calibrated distribution to learn a fine-grained conversion.
Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over the

become correspondingly high, both per channel use, beating the repeaterless
bound, and per second thanks to the relatively high clock rates of the
memoryless scheme. It is predicted from these results that a larger elementary
distance might also keep both the fidelity and the success probability close to
unity if higher-loss codes are employed. Based upon the cavity-QED setting,
this scheme can be realized at room temperature and at optical frequencies.

increasingly developed and deployed to support healthcare in a variety of
settings. However, clinical decision support (CDS) technologies based on ML
need to be portable if they are to be adopted on a broad scale. In this
respect, models developed at one institution should be reusable at another. Yet
there are numerous examples of portability failure, particularly due to naive
application of ML models. Portability failure can lead to suboptimal care and
medical errors, which ultimately could prevent the adoption of ML-based CDS in
practice. One specific healthcare challenge that could benefit from enhanced
portability is the prediction of 30-day readmission risk. Research to date has
shown that deep learning models can be effective at modeling such risk. In this
work, we investigate the practicality of model portability through a cross-site
evaluation of readmission prediction models. To do so, we apply a recurrent
neural network, augmented with self-attention and blended with expert features,
to build readmission prediction models for two independent large scale claims
datasets. We further present a novel transfer learning technique that adapts
the well-known method of born-again network (BAN) training. Our experiments
show that direct application of ML models trained at one institution and tested
at another institution perform worse than models trained and tested at the same
institution. We further show that the transfer learning approach based on the
BAN produces models that are better than those trained on just a single
institution's data. Notably, this improvement is consistent across both sites
and occurs after a single retraining, which illustrates the potential for a
cheap and general model transfer mechanism of readmission risk prediction.

represented by multi-dimensional arrays. In practice, tensor data is often
accompanied by temporal information, namely the time points when the entry
values were generated. This information implies abundant, complex temporal
variation patterns. However, current methods always assume the factor
representations of the entities in each tensor mode are static, and never
consider their temporal evolution. To fill this gap, we propose NONparametric
FActor Trajectory learning for dynamic tensor decomposition (NONFAT). We place
Gaussian process (GP) priors in the frequency domain and conduct inverse
Fourier transform via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to sample the trajectory
functions. In this way, we can overcome data sparsity and obtain robust
trajectory estimates across long time horizons. Given the trajectory values at
specific time points, we use a second-level GP to sample the entry values and
to capture the temporal relationship between the entities. For efficient and
scalable inference, we leverage the matrix Gaussian structure in the model,
introduce a matrix Gaussian posterior, and develop a nested sparse variational
learning algorithm. We have shown the advantage of our method in several
real-world applications.

we express the CT image as a combination of qubits. After the Radon transform
of the undetermined CT image, we find the combination of the actual sinogram

determine the value of qubits through a gate model quantum computer or quantum

turbulence in the Taylor--Couette flow of a dilute polymer solution. Unlike
previously reported transitions, this newly discovered scenario, dubbed vortex
merging and splitting (VMS) transition, occurs in the centrifugally unstable
regime and the mechanisms underlying it are two-dimensional: the flow becomes
chaotic due to the proliferation of events where axisymmetric vortex pairs may
be either created (vortex splitting) or annihilated (vortex merging). In this
paper, we present direct numerical simulations, using the FENE-P constitutive
equation to model polymer dynamics, which reproduce the experimental
observations with great accuracy and elucidate the reasons for the onset of
this surprising dynamics. Starting from the Newtonian limit and increasing
progressively the fluid's elasticity, we demonstrate that the VMS dynamics is
not associated with the well-known Taylor vortices, but with a steady pattern
of elastically induced axisymmetric vortex pairs known as diwhirls. The amount
of angular momentum carried by these elastic vortices becomes increasingly
small as the fluid's elasticity increases and it eventually reaches a marginal
level. When this occurs, the diwhirls become dynamically disconnected from the
rest of the system and move independently from each other in the axial
direction. It is shown that vortex merging and splitting events, along with
local transient chaotic dynamics, result from the interactions among diwhirls,
and that this complex spatio-temporal dynamics persists even at elasticity
levels twice as large as those investigated experimentally.

like failed satellites and space junk. These objects are usually operated or
collected by free-float dual-arm space manipulators. Thanks to eliminating the
difficulties of modeling and manual parameter-tuning, reinforcement learning
(RL) methods have shown a more promising sign in the trajectory planning of
space manipulators. Although previous studies demonstrate their effectiveness,
they cannot be applied in tracking dynamic targets with unknown rotation
(non-cooperative objects). In this paper, we proposed a learning system for
motion planning of free-float dual-arm space manipulator (FFDASM) towards
non-cooperative objects. Specifically, our method consists of two modules.
Module I realizes the multi-target trajectory planning for two end-effectors
within a large target space. Next, Module II takes as input the point clouds of
the non-cooperative object to estimate the motional property, and then can
predict the position of target points on an non-cooperative object. We
leveraged the combination of Module I and Module II to track target points on a
spinning object with unknown regularity successfully. Furthermore, the

the classical energy conditions, and the forces between hemispheres. We find
that in the physically acceptable region the NEC, WEC, and SEC are always
satisfied, while the DEC can be violated if the Dyson mega-sphere is
sufficiently close to forming a black hole. We also demonstrate that the

violating the DEC. Finally, we very briefly discuss the possibility of nested

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inherent ambiguity in ground-truth annotations of 3D bounding boxes,
caused by occlusions, signal missing, or manual annotation errors, can confuse
deep 3D object detectors during training, thus deteriorating detection
accuracy. However, existing methods overlook such issues to some extent and
treat the labels as deterministic. In this paper, we formulate the label
uncertainty problem as the diversity of potentially plausible bounding boxes of
objects. Then, we propose GLENet, a generative framework adapted from
conditional variational autoencoders, to model the one-to-many relationship
between a typical 3D object and its potential ground-truth bounding boxes with
latent variables. The label uncertainty generated by GLENet is a plug-and-play
module and can be conveniently integrated into existing deep 3D detectors to
build probabilistic detectors and supervise the learning of the localization
uncertainty. Besides, we propose an uncertainty-aware quality estimator
architecture in probabilistic detectors to guide the training of the IoU-branch
with predicted localization uncertainty. We incorporate the proposed methods
into various popular base 3D detectors and demonstrate significant and
consistent performance gains on both KITTI and Waymo benchmark datasets.
Especially, the proposed GLENet-VR outperforms all published LiDAR-based
approaches by a large margin and achieves the top rank among single-modal
methods on the challenging KITTI test set. The source code and pre-trained
models are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Eaphan/GLENet}.

items from a very large corpus, has attracted more and more attention from
academia and industry. As the initial stage of RS, large-scale matching is
fundamental yet challenging. A typical recipe is to learn user and item
representations with a two-tower architecture and then calculate the similarity
score between both representation vectors, which however still struggles in how
to properly deal with negative samples. In this paper, we find that the common
practice that randomly sampling negative samples from the entire space and
treating them equally is not an optimal choice, since the negative samples from
different sub-spaces at different stages have different importance to a
matching model. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Unbiased
Model-Agnostic Matching Approach (UMA$^2$). It consists of two basic modules
including 1) General Matching Model (GMM), which is model-agnostic and can be
implemented as any embedding-based two-tower models; and 2) Negative Samples
Debias Network (NSDN), which discriminates negative samples by borrowing the
idea of Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) and re-weighs the loss in GMM.
UMA$^2$ seamlessly integrates these two modules in an end-to-end multi-task
learning framework. Extensive experiments on both real-world offline dataset

result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's

Pikulin \textit{et al.} [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test
composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and non-local transport
measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron
density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high
probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as
determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are
consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting
phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and
several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred
micro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the
semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk
gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at \textit{both} ends of the
devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted
maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20-$60\,\mu$eV. This demonstration
is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana
zero modes.

$+$ plateau' form. Techniques to determine its form in the semiclassical or the
thermodynamic limit have been devised, in both cases based on the average over
an energy range or an ensemble of systems. For a single instance, fluctuations
are large, do not go away in the limit, and depend on the element of the
ensemble itself, thus seeming to question the whole procedure. Considered as
the modulus of a partition function in complex inverse temperature
$\beta_R+i\beta_I$ ($\beta_I \equiv \tau$ the time), the spectral factor has
regions of Fisher zeroes, the analogue of Yang-Lee zeroes for the complex
temperature plane. The large spikes in the spectral factor are in fact a
consequence of near-misses of the line parametrized by $\beta_I$ to these
zeroes. The largest spikes are indeed extensive and extremely sensitive to
details, but we show that they are both exponentially rare and exponentially
thin. Motivated by this, and inspired by the work of Derrida on the Random
Energy Model, we study here a modified model of random energy levels in which
we introduce level repulsion. We also check that the mechanism giving rise to
spikes is the same in the SYK model.

campaign of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PKS 0558-504 carried out with the

the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) method that the short-wavelength
continuum variations lagged behind variations at longer wavelengths, the
opposite of the trend expected for thermal reprocessing of X-rays by the
accretion disc, and they interpreted their results as evidence against the
reprocessing model. We carried out new DCF measurements that demonstrate that
the inverted lag-wavelength relationship found by Gliozzi et al.\ resulted from
their having interchanged the order of the driving and responding light curves
when measuring the lags. To determine the inter-band lags and uncertainties
more accurately, we carried out new measurements with four independent methods.
These give consistent results showing time delays increasing as a function of
wavelength, as expected for the disc reprocessing scenario. The slope of the
re-analysed delay spectrum appears to be roughly compatible with the predicted
$\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relationship for reprocessing by an optically
thick and geometrically thin accretion disc, although the data points exhibit a
large scatter about the fitted power-law trend.

accompanied by a distributed network, where peers are connected to each other

intermixing caused by He$^+$ irradiation at the interfaces of the multilayer
allows us to tune the saturation magnetostriction value with increasing He$^+$
fluences, and even to induce a reversal of the sign of the magnetostrictive
effect. Additionally, the critical fluence at which the absolute value of the
magnetostriction is dramatically reduced is identified. Therefore insensitivity
to strain of the magnetic stack is nearly reached, as required for many
applications. All the above mentioned effects are attributed to the combination
of the negative saturation magnetostriction of sputtered Ni, Fe layers and the
positive magnetostriction of the Ni$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ alloy at the intermixed
interfaces, whose contribution is gradually increased with irradiation.
Importantly the irradiation does not alter the layers polycrystalline

in-plane easy-axis anisotropy transverse to the strip. The domain walls move in
a rigid-body manner at low field, and show complex Walker breakdown behavior at
high field. We observe a multi-step Walker breakdown through vortex nucleation
in wide strips. In the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the
first Walker breakdown field first decreases then increases with interfacial
DMI, while keeps increasing with bulk DMI. These findings complement the

recognition accuracy, which incurs inevitable latency even if the computation
is fast enough. A causal model that computes without any future frames can
avoid this latency, but its performance is significantly worse than traditional
methods. In this paper, we propose corresponding revision strategies to improve
the causal model. Firstly, we introduce a real-time encoder states revision
strategy to modify previous states. Encoder forward computation starts once the
data is received and revises the previous encoder states after several frames,
which is no need to wait for any right context. Furthermore, a CTC spike
position alignment decoding algorithm is designed to reduce time costs brought
by the revision strategy. Experiments are all conducted on Librispeech
datasets. Fine-tuning on the CTC-based wav2vec2.0 model, our best method can
achieve 3.7/9.2 WERs on test-clean/other sets, which is also competitive with
the chunk-based methods and the knowledge distillation methods.

extent encoded in the shape of the one-point density probability distribution
functions (PDF). In order to successfully exploit such observables, a detailed
functional form of the covariance matrix of the one-point PDF is needed. Aims:
The objectives are to model the properties of this covariance for general
stochastic density fields in a cosmological context. Methods: Leading and
subleading contributions to the covariance were identified within a large class
of models, the so-called hierarchical models. The validity of the proposed
forms for the covariance matrix was assessed with the help of a toy model, the
minimum tree model, for which a corpus of exact results could be obtained
(forms of the one- and two-point PDF, large-scale density-bias functions, and
full covariance matrix of the one-point PDF). Results: It is first shown that
the covariance matrix elements are directly related to the spatial average of
the two-point density PDF within the sample. The dominant contribution to this
average is explicitly given for hierarchical models, which leads to the
construction of specific density-bias functions. However, this contribution
alone cannot be used to construct an operational likelihood function. Short
distance effects are found to be have an important impact but are more
difficult to derive as they depend more on the details of the model. However, a
simple and generic form of these contributions is proposed. Detailed
comparisons in the context of the Rayleigh-Levy flight model show that the
large-scale effects capture the bulk of the supersample effects and that, by
adding the short-distance contributions, a qualitatively correct model of the
likelihood function can be obtained.

Experts carefully design replicated data types (RDTs) that resemble sequential
data types and embed conflict resolution mechanisms that ensure convergence.
Designing RDTs is challenging as their correctness depends on subtleties such
as the ordering of concurrent operations. Currently, researchers manually
verify RDTs, either by paper proofs or using proof assistants. Unfortunately,
paper proofs are subject to reasoning flaws and mechanized proofs verify a
formalisation instead of a real-world implementation. Furthermore, writing
mechanized proofs is reserved to verification experts and is extremely time
consuming. To simplify the design, implementation, and verification of RDTs, we
propose VeriFx, a high-level programming language with automated proof
capabilities. VeriFx lets programmers implement RDTs atop functional
collections and express correctness properties that are verified automatically.
Verified RDTs can be transpiled to mainstream languages (currently Scala or
JavaScript). VeriFx also provides libraries for implementing and verifying
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transformation (OT)
functions. These libraries implement the general execution model of those
approaches and define their correctness properties. We use the libraries to

potential for in-plane electrons once the apical oxygen is missing, the change
of Fermi surface topology as the van Hove point is passed, self-energy
corrections caused by d-wave pairing, and vertex corrections caused by forward
scattering. These concerns are interesting but are either irrelevant or further

main challenges of OPS are twofold: (1) the infinite possibility of the
\unknown object appearances makes it difficult to model them from a limited
number of training data. (2) at training time, we are only provided with the
""void"" category, which essentially mixes the ""unknown thing"" and ""background""
classes. We empirically find that directly using ""void"" category to supervise
\known class or ""background"" classifiers without screening will lead to an
unsatisfied OPS result. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer scheme
to develop a dual decision process for OPS. We show that by properly combining
a \known class discriminator with an additional class-agnostic object
prediction head, the OPS performance can be significantly improved.
Specifically, we first propose to create a classifier with only \known
categories and let the ""void"" class proposals achieve low prediction
probability from those categories. Then we distinguish the ""unknown things""
from the background by using the additional object prediction head. To further
boost performance, we introduce ""unknown things"" pseudo-labels generated from
up-to-date models to enrich the training set. Our extensive experimental
evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves \unknown class
panoptic quality, with more than 30\% relative improvements than the existing
best-performed method.

two distinct rational $k$th powers, between which the distance is twice another
nonzero rational $m$th power. In particular, reflecting numbers of type $(2,2)$

H_{\pmb\mu},$ induced by an $m$-tuple $\pmb \mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_{m})$ of
finite non-negative Borel measures on the unit circle. In particular, it is
shown that any weighted Dirichlet-type space of order $m,$ for $m\geqslant 3,$
forms an algebra under pointwise product. We also prove that every non-zero
closed $M_z$-invariant subspace of $\mathcal H_{\pmb\mu},$ has codimension $1$

application of local Douglas formula obtained in this article, it is shown that
for any $m\geqslant 2,$ weighted Dirichlet-type space of order $m$ does not
coincide with any de Branges-Rovnyak space $\mathcal H(b)$ with equivalence of

Additionally, we improve the estimation of the per-axon radial diffusivity
compared to estimates based on spherical averaging. The use of strong diffusion
weightings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to approximate the signal
in white matter as the sum of the contributions from axons. At the same time,
spherical averaging leads to a major simplification of the modeling by removing
the need to explicitly account for the unknown orientation distribution of
axons. However, the spherically averaged signal acquired at strong diffusion
weightings is not sensitive to the axial diffusivity, which cannot therefore be
estimated. After revising existing theory, we introduce a new general method
for the estimation of both axonal diffusivities at strong diffusion weightings
based on zonal harmonics modeling. We additionally show how this could lead to
estimates that are free from partial volume bias with, for instance, gray
matter. We test the method on publicly available data from the MGH Adult
Diffusion Human Connectome project dataset. We report reference values of
axonal diffusivities based on 34 subjects, and derive estimates of axonal

corresponding solutions are used to establish an approximate mapping from the
problem's parametric space to its solution space using deep feedforward neural
networks and convolutional autoencoders. This mapping serves a means to obtain
very accurate initial predictions of the system's response to new query points
at negligible computational cost. Subsequently, an iterative solver inspired by
the Algebraic Multigrid method in combination with Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition, termed POD-2G, is developed that successively refines the
initial predictions towards the exact system solutions. The application of
POD-2G as a standalone solver or as preconditioner in the context of
preconditioned conjugate gradient methods is demonstrated on several numerical
examples of large scale systems, with the results indicating its superiority

rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into node

the multi-layer structure. These mechanisms bring excessive complexity, but
seldom work studies whether they are really effective on heterogeneous graphs.
This paper conducts an in-depth and detailed study of these mechanisms and
proposes Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SeHGNN). To
easily capture structural information, SeHGNN pre-computes the neighbor
aggregation using a light-weight mean aggregator, which reduces complexity by
removing overused neighbor attention and avoiding repeated neighbor aggregation
in every training epoch. To better utilize semantic information, SeHGNN adopts
the single-layer structure with long metapaths to extend the receptive field,
as well as a transformer-based semantic fusion module to fuse features from
different metapaths. As a result, SeHGNN exhibits the characteristics of simple
network structure, high prediction accuracy, and fast training speed. Extensive
experiments on five real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority
of SeHGNN over the state-of-the-arts on both accuracy and training speed.

converge to Fourier modes for increasing domain length is challenged. Numerical
results indicate that the discrepancy between POD and Fourier modes along
\textit{locally} translationally invariant coordinates is coupled to the Taylor
macro/micro scale ratio (MMSR) of the kernel in question. Increasing
discrepancies are observed for smaller MMSRs, which are characteristic of low
Reynolds number flows. It is observed that the asymptotic convergence rate of
the eigenspectrum matches the corresponding convergence rate of the exact
analytical Fourier spectrum of the kernel in question - even for extremely
small domains and small MMSRs where the corresponding DFT spectra suffer
heavily from windowing effects. These results indicate that the accumulated

stimuli, and understanding the remodeling and stability of vesicles in
heterogeneous environments is therefore of fundamental importance for a range
of cellular processes. One crucial question is how vesicles respond to external
osmotic stresses, imposed by differences in solute concentrations between the
vesicle interior and exterior. Previous analyses of the membrane bending energy
have predicted that micron-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) should
become globally deformed already for nanomolar concentration differences, in
contrast to experimental findings that find deformations at much higher osmotic
stresses. In this article, we analyze the mechanical stability of a spherical
vesicle exposed to an external osmotic pressure in a statistical-mechanical
model, including the effect of thermally excited membrane bending modes. We
find that the inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the vesicle shape changes
renders the vesicle deformation continuous, in contrast to the abrupt
transition in the athermal picture. Crucially, however, the predicted critical
pressure associated with global vesicle deformation remains the same as when
thermal fluctuations are neglected, approximately six orders of magnitude
smaller than the typical collapse pressure recently observed experimentally for
GUVs. We conclude by discussing possible sources of this persisting dissonance
between theory and experiments.

that optically and geometrically thick disks form near the equatorial plane,
and a part of the disk matter is launched from the disk surface in all models.
The gas ejection is mainly driven by the radiative force, but magnetic force
cannot be neglected, when $|a^*|$ is large. The energy outflow efficiency
(total luminosity normalized by $\dot{M}_{\rm in} c^2 $; $\dot{M}_{\rm in}$ and
$c$ are the mass accretion rate at the event horizon and the light speed) is
larger for rotating black holes than for non-rotating black holes. This is
$0.7\%$ for $a^*=-0.7$, $0.3\%$ for $a^*=0$, and $5\%$ for $a^*=0.7$ for
$\dot{M}_{\rm in} \sim 100L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ ($L_{\rm Edd}$ is Eddington
luminosity). Also, although the energy is mainly released by radiation when
$a^* \sim 0$, the Poynting power increases with $|a^*|$ and exceeds the
radiative luminosity for models with $a^* \geq 0.5$ and $a^* \leq -0.7$. The
more the black hole rotates, the larger the power ratio of the kinetic
luminosity to the isotropic luminosity tends to be. This implies that objects
with large (small) power ratio may have rapidly (slowly) rotating black holes.

convection-diffusion equations with nonsymmetric tensors, coupled with a
Poisson equation and describes in particular semiconductor devices immersed in
a magnetic field. We introduce a new scheme based on an entropy-dissipation
relation and prove that the scheme admits solutions with values in admissible
sets - especially, the computed densities remain positive. Moreover, we show
that the discrete solutions to the scheme converge exponentially fast in time
towards the associated discrete thermal equilibrium. Several numerical tests
confirm our theoretical results. Up to our knowledge, this scheme is the first
one able to discretise anisotropic drift-diffusion systems while preserving the
bounds on the densities.

has been recently predicted to be a basic Z2 topological semimetal. To date,
only one polytype of GaGeTe is known with trigonal centrosymmetric structure
(alpha phase, space group R-3m, No. 166). Here we show that as-grown samples of
GaGeTe show traces of at least another polytype with hexagonal
non-centrosymmetric structure (beta phase, space group P63mc, No. 186).
Moreover, we suggest that another bulk hexagonal polytype (gamma phase, space
group P-3m1, No. 164) could also be found near room conditions. Both alpha and
beta polytypes have been identified and characterized by means of X-ray
diffraction and Raman scattering measurements with the support of ab initio
calculations. We provide the vibrational properties of both polytypes and show
that the Raman spectrum reported for GaGeTe almost forty years ago and
attributed to the alpha phase, was, in fact, that of the secondary beta phase.
Additionally, we show that a Fermi resonance occurs in alpha-GaGeTe under
non-resonant excitation conditions, but not under resonant excitation
conditions. Theoretical calculations show that bulk beta-GaGeTe is a
non-centrosymmetric weak topological semimetal with even smaller lattice
thermal conductivity than centrosymmetric bulk alpha-GaGeTe. In perspective,
our work paves the way for the control and engineering of GaGeTe polytypes to
design and implement complex van der Waals heterostructures formed by a
combination of centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layers of up to three
different polytypes in a single material, suitable for a number of fundamental

future power systems should thus provide high levels of flexibility iin

decision makers and professionals in the energy industry. Forecasting energy
loads has become more advantageous for energy providers and customers, allowing
them to establish an efficient production strategy to satisfy demand. This
study introduces two hybrid cascaded models for forecasting multistep household
power consumption in different resolutions. The first model integrates
Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), as an efficient signal preprocessing
technique, with Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM). The second hybrid model combines SWT with a self-attention based neural
network architecture named transformer. The major constraint of using
time-frequency analysis methods such as SWT in multistep energy forecasting
problems is that they require sequential signals, making signal reconstruction
problematic in multistep forecasting applications.The cascaded models can
efficiently address this problem through using the recursive outputs.
Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid models achieve superior
prediction performance compared to the existing multistep power consumption
prediction methods. The results will pave the way for more accurate and
reliable forecasting of household power consumption.

the complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms
the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics.

alternative devices for beyond-CMOS computing as they offer several potential
applications when integrated with transistors. We propose a novel
semiconductor-free NDR tunnel diode concept that exhibits an ultra-high
peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) value. Our proposed NDR diode consists of
two cold metal electrodes separated by a thin insulating tunnel barrier. The
NDR effect stems from the unique electronic band structure of the cold metal
electrodes, i.e., the width of the isolated metallic bands around the Fermi
level as well as the energy gaps separating higher- and lower-lying bands
determine the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics and the PVCR value of
the tunnel diode. By proper choice of the cold metal electrode materials,
either a conventional N-type or ${\Lambda}$-type NDR effect can be obtained.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a unique platform for the realization of
proposed NDR tunnel diodes. To demonstrate the proof of concept we employ the
nonequilibrium Green function method combined with density functional theory to
calculate the $I$-$V$ characteristic of the lateral (AlI$_2$/MgI$_2$/AlI$_2$)
and vertical (NbS$_2$/h-BN/NbS$_2$) heterojunction tunnel diodes based on 2D
cold metals. For the lateral tunnel diode, we obtain a ${\Lambda}$-type NDR
effect with an ultra-high PVCR value of 10$^{16}$ at room temperature, while
the vertical tunnel diode exhibits a conventional N-type NDR effect with a
smaller PVCR value of about 10$^4$. The proposed concept provides a
semiconductor-free solution for NDR devices to achieve desired $I$-$V$
characteristics with ultra-high PVCR values for memory and logic applications.

computational costs when evaluating high-resolution videos. This cost hinders
them from learning better video-quality-related representations via end-to-end
training. Existing approaches typically consider naive sampling to reduce the
computational cost, such as resizing and cropping. However, they obviously
corrupt quality-related information in videos and are thus not optimal for
learning good representations for VQA. Therefore, there is an eager need to
design a new quality-retained sampling scheme for VQA. In this paper, we
propose Grid Mini-patch Sampling (GMS), which allows consideration of local
quality by sampling patches at their raw resolution and covers global quality
with contextual relations via mini-patches sampled in uniform grids. These
mini-patches are spliced and aligned temporally, named as fragments. We further
build the Fragment Attention Network (FANet) specially designed to accommodate
fragments as inputs. Consisting of fragments and FANet, the proposed FrAgment
Sample Transformer for VQA (FAST-VQA) enables efficient end-to-end deep VQA and
learns effective video-quality-related representations. It improves
state-of-the-art accuracy by around 10% while reducing 99.5% FLOPs on 1080P
high-resolution videos. The newly learned video-quality-related representations
can also be transferred into smaller VQA datasets, boosting performance in
these scenarios. Extensive experiments show that FAST-VQA has good performance
on inputs of various resolutions while retaining high efficiency. We publish

model for systems that consist of several interacting components, each with its
own objective. The standard solution concept for such games is Nash
Equilibrium, which is a ""stable"" strategy profile for the players.
  In many settings, the system is not fully observable by the interacting
components, e.g., due to internal variables. Then, the interaction is modelled
by a partial information game. Unfortunately, the problem of whether a partial
information game has an NE is not known to be decidable. A particular setting
of partial information arises naturally when processes are assigned IDs by the
system, but these IDs are not known to the processes. Then, the processes have
full information about the state of the system, but are uncertain of the effect
of their actions on the transitions.
  We generalize the setting above and introduce Multi-Topology Games (MTGs) --
concurrent games with several possible topologies, where the players do not
know which topology is actually used. We show that extending the concept of NE
to these games can take several forms. To this end, we propose two notions of
NE: Conservative NE, in which a player deviates if she can strictly add
topologies to her winning set, and Greedy NE, where she deviates if she can win
in a previously-losing topology. We study the properties of these NE, and show
that the problem of whether a game admits them is decidable.

given dataset. However, this predictive criterion rarely captures all desirable
properties of a model, in particular how well it matches a domain expert's
understanding of a task. Underspecification refers to the existence of multiple
models that are indistinguishable in their in-domain accuracy, even though they
differ in other desirable properties such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance. Identifying these situations is critical for assessing the
reliability of ML models.
  We formalize the concept of underspecification and propose a method to
identify and partially address it. We train multiple models with an
independence constraint that forces them to implement different functions. They
discover predictive features that are otherwise ignored by standard empirical
risk minimization (ERM), which we then distill into a global model with
superior OOD performance. Importantly, we constrain the models to align with
the data manifold to ensure that they discover meaningful features. We
demonstrate the method on multiple datasets in computer vision (collages,
WILDS-Camelyon17, GQA) and discuss general implications of underspecification.
Most notably, in-domain performance cannot serve for OOD model selection
without additional assumptions.

the \textit{externalities process} $E_v(\cdot)=\left\{E_v(x):x\geq0\right\}$.
It is shown that this process can be represented by an integral of a (shifted

distribution, so that $E_v(\cdot)$ is convex. Furthermore, we compute the LST

this paper, we introduce a geometric flow network (GFNet) to explore the

bidirectionally align and propagate the complementary information across
different views according to geometric relationships under the end-to-end

due to the nematic properties of the constituent particles. These effects are
the result of the active stresses generated by growth, passive mechanical
interactions between cells, and flow-induced effects due to the shape of the
confining container. However, how these contributing factors interact to give
rise to the observed global alignment patterns remains elusive. Here, we study,
in-silico, colonies of growing rod-shaped particles of different aspect ratios
confined in channel-like geometries. A spatially resolved analysis of the
stress tensor reveals a strong relationship between near-perfect alignment and
an inversion of stress anisotropy for particles with large length-to-width
ratios. We show that, in quantitative agreement with an asymptotic theory,
strong alignment can lead to a decoupling of active and passive stresses
parallel and perpendicular to the direction of growth, respectively. We
demonstrate the robustness of these effects in a geometry that provides less
restrictive confinement and introduces natural perturbations in alignment. Our
results illustrate the complexity arising from the inherent coupling between
nematic order and active stresses in growing active matter which is modulated
by geometric and configurational constraints due to confinement.

couplers and DC half wave voltage (V$\pi$) of less than 3.0 V, or a modulation

of roughly 30 GHz. Notably, the device demonstrates a power extinction ratio
over 45 dB at each output port without the use of cascaded directional couplers
or additional control circuitry; roughly 31 times better than previously
reported devices. Paired with a balanced photo-diode receiver, this modulator
can be used in various photonic communication systems. Such a detecting scheme
is compatible with complex modulation formats such as differential phase shift
keying and differential quadrature phase shift keying, where a dual-output,

One appealing way of
integrating fairness aspects into classical clustering problems is by
introducing multiple covering constraints. This is a natural generalization of
the robust (or outlier) setting, which has been studied extensively and is
amenable to a variety of classic algorithmic techniques. In contrast, for the
case of multiple covering constraints (the so-called colorful setting),
specialized techniques have only been developed recently for $k$-Center
clustering variants, which is also the focus of this paper. While prior
techniques assume covering constraints on the clients, they do not address
additional constraints on the facilities, which has been extensively studied in
non-colorful settings.
  In this paper, we present a quite versatile framework to deal with various
constraints on the facilities in the colorful setting, by combining ideas from
the iterative greedy procedure for Colorful $k$-Center by Inamdar and
Varadarajan with new ingredients. To exemplify our framework, we show how it
leads, for a constant number $\gamma$ of colors, to the first constant-factor
approximations for both Colorful Matroid Supplier with respect to a linear
matroid and Colorful Knapsack Supplier. In both cases, we readily get an
$O(2^\gamma)$-approximation.
  Moreover, for Colorful Knapsack Supplier, we show that it is possible to
obtain constant approximation guarantees that are independent of the number of
colors $\gamma$, as long as $\gamma=O(1)$, which is needed to obtain a
polynomial running time. More precisely, we obtain a $7$-approximation by
extending a technique recently introduced by Jia, Sheth, and Svensson for

including widely employed ones, such as AES and RSA. These attacks take
advantage of the algorithm implementation in hardware or software to extract
secret information via side channels. Software masking is a mitigation approach
against power side-channel attacks aiming at hiding the secret-revealing
dependencies from the power footprint of a vulnerable implementation. However,
this type of software mitigation often depends on general-purpose compilers,
which do not preserve non-functional properties. Moreover, microarchitectural
features, such as the memory bus and register reuse, may also leak secret
information. These abstractions are not visible at the high-level
implementation of the program. Instead, they are decided at compile time. To
remedy these problems, security engineers often sacrifice code efficiency by
turning off compiler optimization and/or performing local, post-compilation
transformations. This paper proposes Secure by Construction Code Generation
(SecCG), a constraint-based compiler approach that generates optimized yet
secure against power side channels code. SecCG controls the quality of the
mitigated program by efficiently searching the best possible low-level
implementation according to a processor cost model. In our experiments with
twelve masked cryptographic functions up to 100 lines of code on Mips32 and ARM

  For convex domains there is but one variational boundary value problem among
the investigated that allows the independent determination. It is the one with
essential no-penetration conditions combined with homogeneous tangential
traction conditions.
  Further, in most but not all investigated cases, the weakly divergence-free
displacement can be computed pressure robustly provided the total body force is
decomposed into its direct sum of divergence- and rotation-free components
using a Helmholtz decomposition. The elasticity problem is solved using these

the superposition principle.

explores the idea of leveraging hybrid modes to meet multiple operating points

dynamically reconfigure the connections of a hydrostatic actuator. The analyzed
opportunities consist in 1) switching between a highly geared power source or a
fast power source, 2) dynamically connecting an energy accumulator and 3) using
a locking mechanism for holding. Based on a knee exoskeleton case study
analysis, results show that switching between gearing ratio can lead to a
lighter and more efficient actuator. Also, results show that using an
accumulator to provide a preload continuous force has great mass-saving
potential, but does not reduce mass significantly if used as a power booster
for short transients. Finally, using a locking valve can slightly reduce
battery mass if the work cycle includes frequent stops. The operating
principles of the proposed multimodal schemes are demonstrated with a one-DOF

inference must be carried out separately for each of these, with the

Wadsworth (2022) have established theoretical links between different
characterisations of extremal dependence, through studying the limiting shape

and then using this to deduce self-consistent estimates for the extremal
dependence properties of interest. In simulations, the limit set estimates are
shown to be successful across a range of distributions, and the estimates of
dependence features are individually competitive with existing estimation
techniques, and jointly provide a major improvement. We apply the approach to a
data set of sea wave heights at pairs of locations, where the estimates
successfully capture changes in the limiting shape of the sample cloud as the
distance between the locations increases, including the weakening extremal

played a critical role in understanding the implicit regularization of SGD. In
this paper, we provide an explanation of this striking phenomenon by relating
the particular noise structure of SGD to its \emph{linear stability} (Wu et
al., 2018). Specifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with
square loss. We prove that if a global minimum $\theta^*$ is linearly stable
for SGD, then it must satisfy $\|H(\theta^*)\|_F\leq O(\sqrt{B}/\eta)$, where
$\|H(\theta^*)\|_F, B,\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\theta^*$,
batch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from
that minimum \emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD,
the sharpness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded
\emph{independently} of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining
these results is exploiting the particular structure of SGD noise: The noise
concentrates in sharp directions of local landscape and the magnitude is
proportional to loss value. This alignment property of SGD noise provably holds
for linear networks and random feature models (RFMs), and is empirically
verified for nonlinear networks. Moreover, the validity and practical relevance
of our theoretical findings are also justified by extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10 dataset.

of each frame and the global context of the sequence. Second, we propose the
Contrastive Feature Aggregation (CFA) module, which predicts frame weights for
temporal aggregation. Here, the weight for each frame is determined in a
contrastive manner: i.e., not only by the quality of each individual frame, but
also by the average quality of the other frames in a sequence. Therefore, it
effectively promotes the contribution of relatively good frames. Extensive
experimental results on four datasets show that CSA-Net consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

admirable theoretical properties, e.g., determinizability, and are practically
useful to capture timed specifications. However, unlike for timed automata,
there exist no implementations for event-clock automata. A main reason for this
is the difficulty in adapting zone-based algorithms, critical in the timed

recently studied in [Geeraerts et al 2011,2014], where the authors proposed a

  In this article, we propose a different zone-based algorithm to solve the
reachability problem for event-clock automata, using simulations for

properties hold of a concurrent multiagent system, under the assumption that
agents in the system choose strategies that form a game-theoretic equilibrium.
Rational verification can be understood as a counterpart to model checking for
multiagent systems, but while classical model checking can be done in
polynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such as CTL,
and polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational verification is much
harder: the key decision problems for rational verification are
2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications, even when using explicit-state
system representations. Against this background, our contributions in this
paper are threefold. First, we show that the complexity of rational
verification can be greatly reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a
fragment of LTL that can represent a broad and practically useful class of
response properties of reactive systems. In particular, we show that for a
number of relevant settings, rational verification can be done in polynomial
space and even in polynomial time. Second, we provide improved complexity
results for rational verification when considering players' goals given by
mean-payoff utility functions; arguably the most widely used approach for
quantitative objectives in concurrent and multiagent systems. Finally, we
consider the problem of computing outcomes that satisfy social welfare
constraints. To this end, we consider both utilitarian and egalitarian social
welfare and show that computing such outcomes is either PSPACE-complete or
NP-complete.

input components contribute to model robustness. Our results show that models
which encode dialog history are more robust, and when launching an attack on
history, model prediction becomes more uncertain. This is in contrast to prior
work which finds that dialog history is negligible for model performance on
this task. We also evaluate how to generate adversarial test examples which
successfully fool the model but remain undetected by the user/software

past user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing
training objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never
uses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially
discarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec
is only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore,
it requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a
novel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses
both limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art

be naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a
novel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since
gaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras
and the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2
to achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for

(CF-mMIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned as a
promising paradigm to improve network capacity and enhance coverage capability.
However, to reap full benefits of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO, the main challenge is to
efficiently design cooperative beamforming (CBF) at base stations (BSs), RISs,
and users. Firstly, we investigate the fractional programing to convert the
weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem into a tractable optimization
problem. Then, the alternating optimization framework is employed to decompose
the transformed problem into a sequence of subproblems, i.e., hybrid BF (HBF)
at BSs, passive BF at RISs, and combining at users. In particular, the
alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to solve the
HBF subproblem at BSs. Concretely, the analog BF design with unit-modulus
constraints is solved by the manifold optimization (MO) while we obtain a
closed-form solution to the digital BF design that is essentially a convex
least-square problem. Additionally, the passive BF at RISs and the analog
combining at users are designed by primal-dual subgradient and MO methods.
Moreover, considering heavy communication costs in conventional CF-mMIMO
systems, we propose a partially-connected CF-mMIMO (P-CF-mMIMO) framework to
decrease the number of connections among BSs and users. To better compromise
WSR performance and network costs, we formulate the BS selection problem in the
P-CF-mMIMO system as a binary integer quadratic programming (BIQP) problem, and
develop a relaxed linear approximation algorithm to handle this BIQP problem.
Finally, numerical results demonstrate superiorities of our proposed algorithms
over baseline counterparts.

spontaneously formed in FSSF overheated above the bulk smectic-isotropic
transition, and oil lenses deposited on the surface of the smectic film. The
realistic model, for which the upper drop interface is free from the smectic
layers, while at the lower drop surface the smectic layering still persists is
considered in detail. For isotropic droplets and oil lenses this leads
effectively to a sticking of fluid motion at the border with a smectic shell.
The above mentioned asymmetric configuration is realized experimentally when
the temperature of the upper side of the film is higher than at the lower one.
The full set of stationary solutions for Stokes stream functions describing the
Marangoni convection flows within the ellipsoidal drops were derived
analytically. The temperature distribution in the ellipsoidal drop and the
surrounding air was determined in the frames of the perturbation theory. As a
result the analytical solutions for the stationary thermocapillary convection
were derived for different droplet ellipticity ratios and the heat conductivity
of the liquid crystal and air. In parallel, the numerical hydrodynamic
calculations of the thermocapillary motion in the drops were performed. Both
the analytical and numerical simulations predict the axially-symmetric
circulatory convection motion determined by the Marangoni effect at the droplet
free surface. Due to a curvature of the drop interface a temperature gradient
along its free surface always persists. Thus, the thermocapillary convection
within the ellipsoidal droplets in overheated FSSF is possible for the
arbitrarily small Marangoni numbers.

first proposes a joint user pairing and power allocation algorithm for the
FTN-based single-carrier (SC) NOMA system. Then, the FTN-based
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) NOMA is studied and a dynamic user
pairing and power allocation scheme is presented. In both scenarios, the
maximum available sum rate (ASR) is the target. While based on the fairness
principle, the user's SE in the NOMA system is guaranteed to be no less than
that in the OMA system. Simulation results show the advantage of the FTN-based
NOMA with the proposed scheme in ASR and quality of service (QoS) performance.
As far as we know, this paper is the first solution to the issue of user

In this paper we study the impact of microfluidic jets generated by
thermocavitation processes on a capillary bridge between two parallel planar
walls. Different capillary bridge types were studied, Newtonian liquids,
viscoelastic liquids and agarose gels. Thus, we compare the cavity formation
and collapse between a wide range of material properties. Moreover, we model
the critical impact velocity for a jet to traverse a capillary bridge type. Our
results show that agarose gels with a storage modulus lower that 176 Pa can be
modelled as a liquid for this transition. However, the predicted transition
deviates for agarose gels with higher storage modulus. Additionally, we show
different types of cavity collapse, depending on the Weber number and the
capillary bridge properties. We conclude that the type of collapse determines
the number and size of entrained bubbles. Furthermore, we study the effects of
wettability on the adhesion forces and contact line dissipation. We conclude
that upon cavity collapse, for hydrophobic walls a Worthington jet is
energetically favourable. In contrast, for hydrophilic walls, the contact line
dissipation is in the same order of magnitude of the energy of the impacted
jet, suppressing the Worthington jet formation. Our results provide strategies
for preventing bubble entrapment and give an estimation of the cavity dynamics

several mutational signatures, which can be inferred using non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF). Mutational signatures have previously been parametrized
using either simple mono-nucleotide interaction models or general
tri-nucleotide interaction models. We describe a flexible and novel framework
for identifying biologically plausible parametrizations of mutational
signatures, and in particular for estimating di-nucleotide interaction models.
The estimation procedure is based on the expectation--maximization (EM)
algorithm and regression in the log-linear quasi--Poisson model. We show that
di-nucleotide interaction signatures are statistically stable and sufficiently
complex to fit the mutational patterns. Di-nucleotide interaction signatures
often strike the right balance between appropriately fitting the data and
avoiding over-fitting. They provide a better fit to data and are biologically
more plausible than mono-nucleotide interaction signatures, and the
parametrization is more stable than the parameter-rich tri-nucleotide
interaction signatures. We illustrate our framework on three data sets of
somatic mutation counts from cancer patients.

the band gap varying with temperature due to the gradual weakening of the Nb-Nb

metallic domains induced by local Joule heating. In solving the heat equation,
we find that the steady state can not be reached if the applied voltage exceeds
a threshold, resulting in the chaotic behavior observed in the high voltage and

the evolution of the metallic domains under bias voltage can be simulated and

and quantitative trends in favour of hadronic scenario and search for SNRs
which could be potential accelerators up to PeV energies (PeVatrons). We have
performed a Multiwavelength (MWL) study using different radiative models to
evaluate the hadronic contribution. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
selected SNRs are modeled using the Naima [1] package. Two different radiative
scenarios are considered, pure leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios, and
different methods are used to evaluate their importance. This study shows that
the lepto-hadronic scenario is favored for most SNRs. Two particular indicators
of hadronic contribution come from the data around the {\pi^0} production
threshold and the data above a few TeV. The hard rise at the {\pi^0} production
threshold cannot be explained by leptonic processes. More data in this region
would be valuable for these studies. For some SNRs, an important hadronic
contribution is observed up to a few TeV, thus making them promising PeVatron
candidates. In this high-energy region where the leptonic processes are
expected to be suppressed, more data is required to help distinguish between
the leptonic and hadronic origin of {\gamma}-ray emission. In the future, we
intend to use the obtained model parameters to simulate data for CTA and assess

future wireless networks due to its capability of shaping the wireless

enhanced capacity are, however, critically dependent on the accuracy of the
channel state information. However, traditional channel estimation schemes are
not applicable in RIS-assisted MIMO networks, since passive RISs typically lack
the signal processing capabilities that are assumed by channel estimation
algorithms. This becomes most problematic when physical imperfections or
electronic impairments affect the RIS due to its exposition to different
environmental effects or caused by hardware limitations from the circuitry.
While these real-world effects are typically ignored in the literature, in this
paper we propose efficient channel estimation schemes for RIS-assisted MIMO
systems taking different imperfections into account. Specifically, we propose
two sets of tensor-based algorithms, based on the parallel factor analysis
decomposition schemes. First, by assuming a long-term model in which the RIS
imperfections, modeled as unknown phase shifts, are static within the channel
coherence time we formulate an iterative alternating least squares (ALS)-based
algorithm for the joint estimation of the communication channels and the
unknown phase deviations. Next, we develop the short-term imperfection model,
which allows both amplitude and phase RIS imperfections to be non-static with
respect to the channel coherence time. We propose two iterative ALS-based and
closed-form higher order singular value decomposition-based algorithms for the
joint estimation of the channels and the unknown impairments. Moreover, we
analyze the identifiability and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithms and study the effects of various imperfections on the channel
estimation quality.

coupled Mott insulators with Ising-like magnetic anisotropies, such as Kitaev
materials, are a particularly rich playground to explore this competition. In
this work, we use effective field theory methods to show that a direct quantum
phase transition can occur in two-dimensional (2D) Ising spin systems between a
topologically ordered chiral spin liquid and a phase with magnetic long-range
order. Such a transition can be protected by lattice symmetries and is
described by a theory of massless Majorana fields coupled to non-Abelian
$SO(N)$ gauge fields with a Chern-Simons term. We further show that Euclidean
Majorana zero modes bound to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole-instantons in the emergent
non-Abelian gauge field are key to understanding spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the ordered phase.

  Network for Object Detection and Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking neural network (SNN) has been attached to great importance due to the
properties of high biological plausibility and low energy consumption on
neuromorphic hardware. As an efficient method to obtain deep SNN, the
conversion method has exhibited high performance on various large-scale
datasets. However, it typically suffers from severe performance degradation and
high time delays. In particular, most of the previous work focuses on simple
classification tasks while ignoring the precise approximation to ANN output. In
this paper, we first theoretically analyze the conversion errors and derive the
harmful effects of time-varying extremes on synaptic currents. We propose the
Spike Calibration (SpiCalib) to eliminate the damage of discrete spikes to the
output distribution and modify the LIPooling to allow conversion of the
arbitrary MaxPooling layer losslessly. Moreover, Bayesian optimization for
optimal normalization parameters is proposed to avoid empirical settings. The
experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on
classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time to obtain SNN comparable to ANN on these
tasks simultaneously. Moreover, we only need 1/50 inference time of the
previous work on the detection task and can achieve the same performance under
0.492$\times$ energy consumption of ANN on the segmentation task.

consequence, decoupling of $J$ and $I$ can be observed at relatively low

four well-spectrally-resolved and equidistantly-positioned atomic transitions
having the same amplitude (each group corresponds to a given circular
polarization $\sigma^\pm$) which we record using a simple experimental setup

healthcare data can help identify safety issues beyond those found in
pre-approval trials. When testing sequentially as data accrue, maximum
sequential probability ratio testing (MaxSPRT) is a common approach to
maintaining nominal type 1 error. However, the true type 1 error may still
deviate from the specified one because of systematic error due to the
observational nature of the analysis. This systematic error may persist even
after controlling for known confounders. Here we propose to address this issue
by combing MaxSPRT with empirical calibration. In empirical calibration, we
assume uncertainty about the systematic error in our analysis, the source of
uncertainty commonly overlooked in practice. We infer a probability
distribution of systematic error by relying on a large set of negative
controls: exposure-outcome where no causal effect is believed to exist.
Integrating this distribution into our test statistics has previously been
shown to restore type 1 error to nominal. Here we show how we can calibrate the
critical value central to MaxSPRT. We evaluate this novel approach using
simulations and real electronic health records, using H1N1 vaccinations during
the 2009-2010 season as an example. Results show that combining empirical
calibration with MaxSPRT restores nominal type 1 error. In our real-world
example, adjusting for systematic error using empirical calibration has a
larger impact than, and hence is just as essential as, adjusting for sequential
testing using MaxSPRT. We recommend performing both, using the method described
here.

a stake pool is constructed at the active UAV while encouraging stake

maximize the overall profit through the blockchain system in unit time by
jointly investigating the IoT transmission, incentives through investment and

erbium with millisecond coherence time is highly desirable for establishing
entanglement between adjacent quantum repeater nodes while long-term storage of
the entanglement could rely on transferring to erbium's second-long coherence
nuclear spins. Here we report GHz-range electron spin transitions of
$^{167}\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$ in yttrium oxide ($\mathrm{Y_2O_3}$) matrix with
coherence times that are consistently longer than a millisecond. Instead of
addressing field-specific Zero First-Order Zeeman transitions, we probe weakly
mixed electron spins with the field orientation along the lower g-factors.
Using pulsed electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we find paramagnetic
impurities are the dominant source of decoherence, and by polarizing them we
achieve a Hahn echo spin $\mathrm{T_2}$ up to 1.46 ms, and a coherence time up
to 7.1 ms after dynamical decoupling. These coherence lifetimes are among the
longest found in crystalline hosts especially those with nuclear spins. We
further enhance the coherence time beyond conventional dynamical decoupling,
using customized sequences to simultaneously mitigate spectral diffusion and
Er-Er dipolar interactions. Despite nuclear and impurity spins in the host,
this work shows that long-lived erbium spins comparable to non-nuclear spin
hosts can be achieved. Our study not only establishes $^{167}\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$:
$\mathrm{Y_2 O_3}$ as a significantly promising quantum memory platform but
also provides a general guideline for engineering long-lived erbium spins in a
variety of host materials for quantum technologies.

are introduced in the VFG models to integrate forward-backward hierarchical
information via a message passing scheme. Maximizing the evidence lower bound
(ELBO) of data likelihood aligns the forward and backward messages in each
aggregation node achieving a consistency node state. Algorithms have been
developed to learn model parameters through gradient updating regarding the
ELBO objective.
  The consistency of aggregation nodes enable VFGs to be applicable in
tractable inference on graphical structures. Besides representation learning
and numerical inference, VFGs provide a new approach for distribution modeling
on datasets with graphical latent structures. Additionally, theoretical study
shows that VFGs are universal approximators by leveraging the implicitly
invertible flow-based structures. With flexible graphical structures and
superior excessive power, VFGs could potentially be used to improve
probabilistic inference. In the experiments, VFGs achieves improved evidence
lower bound (ELBO) and likelihood values on multiple datasets.

learning, but it relies on a large amount of labeled data and still has a large
gap with how humans learn. The human brain can quickly learn various conceptual
knowledge in a self-organized and unsupervised manner, accomplished through
coordinating various learning rules and structures in the human brain.
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a general learning rule in the
brain, but spiking neural networks (SNNs) trained with STDP alone is
inefficient and perform poorly. In this paper, taking inspiration from
short-term synaptic plasticity, we design an adaptive synaptic filter and
introduce the adaptive spiking threshold as the neuron plasticity to enrich the
representation ability of SNNs. We also introduce an adaptive lateral
inhibitory connection to adjust the spikes balance dynamically to help the
network learn richer features. To speed up and stabilize the training of
unsupervised spiking neural networks, we design a samples temporal batch STDP
(STB-STDP), which updates weights based on multiple samples and moments. By
integrating the above three adaptive mechanisms and STB-STDP, our model greatly
accelerates the training of unsupervised spiking neural networks and improves
the performance of unsupervised SNNs on complex tasks. Our model achieves the
current state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised STDP-based SNNs in the
MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Further, we tested on the more complex CIFAR10
dataset, and the results fully illustrate the superiority of our algorithm. Our

operator. The purity of the state has been measured by taking the trace of the
square of the reduced density operator. In this article, we define the square
of the reduced density operator as the state purity operator, composed of a
completely pure state part and a completely mixed state part. The coefficient
of the completely mixed state part is the mixed state measure, formally
obtained as the determinant of the reduced density operator and it is therefore
directly related to tangle, the square of concurrence of the bipartite system.
Expressed in various equivalent forms, the mixed state measure provides all the
characteristic elements of state purity or entanglement, such as eigenvalues of
the reduced density operator, nonclassicality measures and a state purity
complex amplitude. The argument of the state purity complex amplitude in polar

purity of the state. We find that the degree of purity and concurrence are
complementary quantifiers satisfying a complementarity relation.

the failure times widely scatter. Furthermore, mechanical components often fail
before the deterministic failure time is reached. A possibility to overcome
these problems is to consider probabilistic failure times. Our approach for
probabilistic life prediction is based on the microstructure of the metal.
Since we focus on nickel-base alloys we consider a coarse grained
microstructure, with random oriented FCC grains. This leads to random
distributed Schmid factors and different anisotropic stress in each grain. To
gain crack initiation times, we use Coffin-Manson- Basquin and Ramberg-Osgood
equation on stresses corrected with probabilistic Schmid factors.
  Using these single grain crack initiation times, we have developed an
epidemiological crack growth model over multiple grains. In this mesoscopic
crack percolation model, cracked grains induce a stress increase in neighboring
grains. This stress increase is realized using a machine learning model trained
on data generated from finite element simulations. The resulting crack clusters
are evaluated with a failure criterion based on a multimodal stress intensity
factor. From the generated failure times, we calculate surface dependent hazard
rates using a Monte Carlo framework. We compare the obtained failure time
distributions to data from LCF experiments and find good coincidence of
predicted and measured scatter bands.

robust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth and
non-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the

novel metric -- that we call Counterfactual Stability -- that attempts to
quantify how robust a counterfactual is going to be to model changes under
retraining, and comes with desirable theoretical properties. Our proposed
strategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation method (base method) and
searches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining the counterfactual
generated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual Stability. We
compare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation methods
(for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate
that our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust

first experimental evidence for positive correlations between the total angular
momentum generated in fission and the excitation energy of the compound nucleus
prior to fission. The $\gamma$-ray multiplicity increases linearly with
incident energy below the 2\textsuperscript{nd}-chance fission threshold with a
slope of $0.085 \pm 0.010$ MeV$^{-1}$. This linear trend appears to hold for
the average excitation energy of the compound nucleus between $9 < \langle E_x

around a $\gamma$-ray energy of 0.7 MeV, which we interpret as stretched
quadrupole $\gamma$ rays that indicate an increase in total fission-fragment
angular momentum with excitation energy.

improve availability and offload read-only transactions. To both apply
replicated writes from the primary and serve read-only transactions, the
backups implement a cloned concurrency control protocol. The protocol ensures
read-only transactions always return a snapshot of state that previously
existed on the primary. This compels the backup to exactly copy the commit
order resulting from the primary's concurrency control. Existing cloned
concurrency control protocols guarantee this by limiting the backup's
parallelism. As a result, the primary's concurrency control executes some
workloads with more parallelism than these protocols. In this paper, we prove
that this parallelism gap leads to unbounded replication lag, where writes can
take arbitrarily long to replicate to the backup and which has led to
catastrophic failures in production systems. We then design C5, the first
cloned concurrency protocol to provide bounded replication lag. We implement
two versions of C5: Our evaluation in MyRocks, a widely deployed database,
demonstrates C5 provides bounded replication lag. Our evaluation in Cicada, a
recent in-memory database, demonstrates C5 keeps up with even the fastest of

been investigated as thoroughly as those stemming from electron-phonon

minimizing the $T=0$ K Helmholtz free energy. In this work, we show that the
formalism based on the Gr\""uneisen parameters, which commonly neglects
zero-point effects, can be efficiently used to compute ZPLE for both isotropic

test this formalism on 22 cubic and wurtzite materials and obtain excellent

resulting band gap ZPR. We use our results to validate an empirical expression
estimating the ZPLE-induced ZPR and unveil its sensitivity to the temperature

finally reveal that the ZPLE contribution to the band gap ZPR can reach 20% to

conclude that jets were the main powering sources of the pre-explosion outburst

energetic explosion itself, and of the post-explosion bump in the light curve.
The pre-explosion energy source is mainly a companion (main sequence,
Wolf-Rayet, neutron star or black hole) star that accreted mass and launched
jets. I find that the fast expansion of the CSM after acceleration by the
explosion ejecta requires the explosion energy to be >10^{52} erg. Only
jet-driven explosions can supply this energy in such SN 2009ip-like transients.
I conclude that ejecta-CSM interaction is extremely unlikely to power the
bright bump at about 110 days after explosion. Instead, I show by applying a
jet-driven bump toy-model that post-explosion jets are the most likely
explanation for the bump. I leave open the question of whether the explosion
itself (main outburst) was a core collapse supernova (CCSN) or a common
envelope jets supernova (CEJSN). In this study I further connect peculiar
transient events, here 2009ip-like transient events, to CCSNe by arguing that
jets drive all events, from regular CCSNe through superluminous CCSNe and to
many other peculiar and super-energetic transient events, including CEJSNe.
Jet-powering cannot be ignored when analyzing all these types of transients.

significant threat to the safety and security of mission-critical autonomous
systems. This paper considers the additional vulnerability of machine learning
models when attackers can measure the power consumption of their underlying
hardware platform. In particular, we explore the utility of power consumption
information for adversarial attacks on non-volatile memory crossbar-based
single-layer neural networks. Our results from experiments with MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets show that power consumption can reveal important information
about the neural network's weight matrix, such as the 1-norm of its columns.
That information can be used to infer the sensitivity of the network's loss
with respect to different inputs. We also find that surrogate-based black box
attacks that utilize crossbar power information can lead to improved attack
efficiency.

  Polycrystalline Semiconducting Films",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Photoinduced spin-charge interconversion in semiconductors with spin-orbit
coupling could provide a route to optically addressable spintronics without the
use of external magnetic fields. A central question is whether the resulting
spin-associated charge currents are robust to structural disorder, which is
inherent to polycrystalline semiconductors that are desirable for device
applications. Using femtosecond circular polarization-resolved pump-probe
microscopy on polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, we observe the
photoinduced ultrafast formation of spin-polarized positive and, unexpectedly,
negative spin domains on the micron scale formed through lateral currents.
Further, the polarization of these domains and lateral transport direction is
switched upon switching the polarization of the pump helicity. Micron scale
variations in the intensity of optical second-harmonic generation and vertical
piezoresponse suggest that the spin domain formation is driven by the presence
of strong local inversion symmetry breaking via inter-grain structural
disorder. We propose that this leads to spatially varying Rashba-like spin
textures that drive spin-momentum locked currents, leading to local spin
accumulation. Our results establish ultrafast spin domain formation in
polycrystalline semiconductors as a new optically addressable platform for
nanoscale spin-device physics.

an 8 GeV beam have been operational for about 18 years. While the magnetic
horns are expected to be replaced, the LBNF horn power supply is expected to
last the lifetime of the project, 30 years. A resonant, half sine wave pulser
was used for NuMI and BNB and has many practical advantages. The system has
impedance limited fault currents by design, albeit large ones. That along with
the resonant behavior means that thyristor switches are well suited. Many fault
modes of the system have also been calculated. Several circuit changes were
incorporated so that a single fault can be tolerated. The supply must be
reversable to enable both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos to be produced. These
reversal requirements required a significant amount of mechanical design and
consideration to allow for quick reversal of all the semiconductors.

countless potential applications and is an emerging area with many open
challenges. Fully-actuated multirotors have been introduced to tackle some of
these challenges. They provide complete control over position and orientation
and eliminate the need for attaching a multi-DoF manipulation arm to the robot.
However, there are many open problems before they can be used in real-world
applications. Researchers have introduced some methods for physical interaction
in limited settings. Their experiments primarily use prototype-level software
without an efficient path to integration with real-world applications. We
describe a new cost-effective solution for integrating these robots with the
existing software and hardware flight systems for real-world applications and
expand it to physical interaction applications. On the other hand, the existing
control approaches for fully-actuated robots assume conservative limits for the
thrusts and moments available to the robot. Using conservative assumptions for
these already-inefficient robots makes their interactions even less optimal and
may even result in many feasible physical interaction applications becoming
infeasible. This work proposes a real-time method for estimating the complete
set of instantaneously available forces and moments that robots can use to
optimize their physical interaction performance. Finally, many real-world
applications where aerial robots can improve the existing manual solutions deal
with deformable objects. However, the perception and planning for their
manipulation is still challenging. This research explores how aerial physical
interaction can be extended to deformable objects. It provides a detection
method suitable for manipulating deformable one-dimensional objects and
introduces a new perspective on planning the manipulation of these objects.

two scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs

that Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best
performance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight
aggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative

optimization problems (DMOPs), it is difficult for algorithms to find a
satisfactory solution set before the next environmental change, especially for
some complex environments. One reason may be that the information in the
environmental static stage can not be used well in the traditional framework.
In this paper, a novel framework based on generational and environmental
response strategies (FGERS) is proposed, in which response strategies are run
both in the environmental change stage and the environmental static stage to
obtain population evolution information of those both stages. Unlike in the
traditional framework, response strategies are only run in the environmental
change stage. For simplicity, the feed-forward center point strategy was chosen
to be the response strategy in the novel dynamic framework (FGERS-CPS).
FGERS-CPS is not only to predict change trend of the optimum solution set in
the environmental change stage, but to predict the evolution trend of the
population after several generations in the environmental static stage.
Together with the feed-forward center point strategy, a simple memory strategy
and adaptive diversity maintenance strategy were used to form the complete

pre-existing mechanisms for associative learning, allowed us to develop a
conceptually simple associative network that operates like a reservoir of

hypothesize that explicit human intelligence is based primarily on this type of

has shown that a priori probability predictions based on pattern complexities
can be made in a broad class of input-output maps. These algorithmic
probability predictions do not depend on a detailed knowledge of how output
patterns were produced, or historical statistical data. Although quantitatively
fairly accurate, a main weakness of these predictions is that they are given as
an upper bound on the probability of a pattern, but many low complexity, low

value. Here we study this low complexity, low probability phenomenon by looking
at example maps, namely a finite state transducer, natural time series data,
RNA molecule structures, and polynomial curves. Some mechanisms causing low

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in a variety of
fields due to their superior performance in relation modeling. In multimodal
ERC, GNNs are capable of extracting both long-distance contextual information
and inter-modal interactive information. Unfortunately, since existing methods
such as MMGCN directly fuse multiple modalities, redundant information may be
generated and diverse information may be lost. In this work, we present a
directed Graph based Cross-modal Feature Complementation (GraphCFC) module that
can efficiently model contextual and interactive information. GraphCFC
alleviates the problem of heterogeneity gap in multimodal fusion by utilizing
multiple subspace extractors and Pair-wise Cross-modal Complementary (PairCC)
strategy. We extract various types of edges from the constructed graph for
encoding, thus enabling GNNs to extract crucial contextual and interactive
information more accurately when performing message passing. Furthermore, we
design a GNN structure called GAT-MLP, which can provide a new unified network
framework for multimodal learning. The experimental results on two benchmark

get destroyed when tested. However, the destructiveness assumption may not be
necessary in many practical applications such as assessing the effect of
temperature on some electronic components, yielding to the so called
non-destructive one-shot devices. Further, one-shot devices generally have
large mean lifetime to failure, and so accelerated life tests (ALTs) must be
performed for inference. The step-stress ALT shorten the lifetime of the
products by increasing the stress level at which units are subjected to
progressively at pre-specified times. Then, the non-destructive devices are
tested at certain inspection times and surviving units can continue within the
experiment providing extra information. Classical estimation methods based on
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) enjoy suitable asymptotic properties but
they lack of robustness. In this paper, we develop robust inferential methods
for non-destructive one-shot devices based on the popular density power
divergence (DPD) for estimating and testing under the step-stress model with
Weibull lifetime distributions. We theoretically and empirically examine the
asymptotic and robustness properties of the minimum DPD estimators and
Wald-type test statistics based on them. Moreover, we develop robust estimators
and confidence intervals for some important lifetime characteristics, namely
reliability at certain mission times, distribution quantiles and mean lifetime
of a device. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature in three electronic
components, solar lights, medium power silicon bipolar transistors and LED
lights using real data arising from an step-stress ALT.

to cause over 10 million deaths per year and cost the global economy 100
trillion USD by 2050 under status quo projections. These losses would mainly
result from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,
AMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life
attributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the
development of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper
reviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make
essential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen
rapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an
integral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has
remained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,
detailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR
control approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical
practice, and in the ""One Health"" context. We discuss the potential impact and
challenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income

classification tasks that result in discrimination. As machine learning
algorithms are applied in new contexts, however, the harms or injustices that
result are qualitatively different than those presently studied. Existing
research at the level of metrics and definitions cannot measure these
qualitatively different types of injustice. One example of this is the problem
of market fairness and algorithmic collusion. Negative consequences of
algorithmic collusion affect all consumers, not only particular members of a
protected class. Drawing on this case study, I develop an ethical framework for
fair machine learning research in new domains. This contribution ties the
development of fairness metrics to specifically scoped normative principles.
This enables fairness metrics to reflect different concerns from
discrimination. I develop this framework and provide the philosophical
rationale for its structure, ultimately applying it to the case of algorithmic
