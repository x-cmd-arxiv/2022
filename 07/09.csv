to model even if the noise is classical. We present a systematic method based
on generalized cumulant expansions for deriving a time-local master equation
for such systems. This master equation has an intuitive form that directly
parallels a standard Lindblad equation, but contains several surprising
features: the combination of driving and non-Markovianity results in effective
time-dependent dephasing rates that can be negative, and the noise can generate
Hamiltonian renormalizations even though it is classical. We analyze in detail
the highly relevant case of a Rabi-driven qubit subject to various kinds of
non-Markovian noise including $1/f$ fluctuations, finding an excellent
agreement between our master equation and numerically-exact simulations over
relevant timescales. The approach outlined here is more accurate than commonly
employed phenomenological master equations which ignore the interplay between
driving and noise.

  two parts. This is Part I",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimal linear feedback control design is a valuable but challenging problem
due to nonconvexity of the underlying optimization and infinite dimensionality
of the Hardy space of stabilizing controllers. A powerful class of techniques
for solving optimal control problems involves using reparameterization to
transform the control design to a convex but infinite dimensional optimization.
To make the problem tractable, historical work focuses on Galerkin-type finite
dimensional approximations to Hardy space, especially those involving Lorentz
series approximations such as the finite impulse response appproximation.
However, Lorentz series approximations can lead to infeasibility, difficulty
incorporating prior knowledge, deadbeat control in the case of finite impulse
response, and increased suboptimality, especially for systems with large
separation of time scales. The goal of this two-part article is to introduce a
new Galerkin-type method based on approximation by transfer functions with a
selection of simple poles, and to apply this simple pole approximation for
optimal control design. In Part I, error bounds for approximating arbitrary
transfer functions in Hardy space are provided based on the geometry of the
pole selection. It is shown that the space of transfer functions with these
simple poles converges to the full Hardy space, and a uniform convergence rate
is provided based purely on the geometry of the pole selection. This is then
specialized to derive a convergence rate for a particularly interesting pole
selection based on an Archimedes spiral. In Part II, the simple pole
approximation is combined with system level synthesis, a recent
reparameterization approach, to develop a new control design method. This
technique is convex and tractable, always feasible, can include prior
knowledge, does not result in deadbeat control, and works well for systems with

is an exponential growth in the volume of jobs to access these data and perform
computations using them. The volume of data access or computing jobs can be
heterogeneous across different job types and can unpredictably change over
time. Cloud service providers cope with this demand heterogeneity and
unpredictability by over-provisioning the number of servers hosting each job
type. In this paper, we propose the addition of erasure-coded servers that can
flexibly serve multiple job types without additional storage cost. We analyze
the service capacity region and the response time of such erasure-coded systems
and compare them with standard uncoded replication-based systems currently used
in the cloud. We show that coding expands the service capacity region, thus
enabling the system to handle variability in demand for different data types.
Moreover, we characterize the response time of the coded system in various
arrival rate regimes. This analysis reveals that adding even a small number of
coded servers can significantly reduce the mean response time, with a drastic
reduction in regimes where the demand is skewed across different job types.

widely used for structural analysis. Often the structural model identified
through economically meaningful restrictions--e.g., sign restrictions--is
supposed to be independent of how the dependent variables are ordered. But
since the reduced-form model is not order invariant, results from the
structural analysis depend on the order of the variables. We consider a VAR
based on the factor stochastic volatility that is constructed to be order
invariant. We show that the presence of multivariate stochastic volatility
allows for statistical identification of the model. We further prove that, with

point-identified. An additional appeal of the proposed approach is that it can
easily handle a large number of dependent variables as well as sign

efforts and expertise are required to annotate spectrograms, the number of
training examples is very limited. However, it is well known that deep networks
can perform well only when the sample size of the training set is sufficiently
large. Furthermore, the imbalanced sample sizes in different classes can also
hamper the performance. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a
GAN-based data augmentation framework. While standard data augmentation methods
for conventional images cannot be applied on spectrograms, we found that a
variant of GANs, ProGAN, is capable of generating high-resolution spectrograms
which are consistent with the quality of the high-resolution original images
and provide a desirable diversity. We have validated our framework by
classifying glitches in the {\it Gravity Spy} dataset with the GAN-generated
spectrograms for training. We show that the proposed method can provide an
alternative to transfer learning for the classification of spectrograms using
deep networks, i.e. using a high-resolution GAN for data augmentation instead.
Furthermore, fluctuations in classification performance with small sample sizes
for training and evaluation can be greatly reduced. Using the trained network
in our framework, we have also examined the spectrograms with label anomalies
in {\it Gravity Spy}.

of only $\sim$5 Myr for the inner planets. Due to the chaos it is fundamentally
impossible to accurately predict the solar system's orbital evolution beyond
$\sim$50 Myr based on present astronomical observations. We have recently
developed a method to overcome the problem by using the geologic record to
constrain astronomical solutions in the past. Our resulting optimal
astronomical solution (called ZB18a) shows exceptional agreement with the
geologic record to $\sim$58 Ma (Myr ago) and a characteristic resonance
transition around 50 Ma. Here we show that ZB18a and integration of Earth's and
Mars' spin vector based on ZB18a yield reduced variations in Earth's and Mars'
orbital inclination and Earth's obliquity (axial tilt) from $\sim$58 to
$\sim$48 Ma -- the latter being consistent with paleoclimate records. The
changes in the obliquities have important implications for the climate
histories of Earth and Mars. We provide a detailed analysis of solar system
frequencies ($g$- and $s$-modes) and show that the shifts in the variation in
Earth's and Mars' orbital inclination and obliquity around 48 Ma are associated
with the resonance transition and caused by changes in the contributions to the
superposition of $s$-modes, plus $g$-$s$-mode interactions in the inner solar
system. The $g$-$s$-mode interactions and the resonance transition (consistent
with geologic data) are unequivocal manifestations of chaos. Dynamical chaos in
the solar system hence not only affects its orbital properties, but also the
long-term evolution of planetary climate through eccentricity and the link
between inclination and axial tilt.

Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which are notoriously difficult to solve
numerically. Engineers, interested primarily in describing turbulence at a
reduced range of resolved scales, have designed heuristics, known as Large Eddy
Simulation (LES). LES is described in terms of the temporally evolving Eulerian
velocity field defined over a spatial grid with the mean-spacing correspondent
to the resolved scale. This classic Eulerian LES depends on assumptions about
effects of sub-grid scales on the resolved scales.
  Here, we take an alternative approach and design novel LES heuristics stated
in terms of Lagrangian particles moving with the flow. Our Lagrangian LES, thus
L-LES, is described by equations generalizing the weakly compressible Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics formulation with extended parametric and functional
freedom, which is then resolved via Machine Learning training on Lagrangian
data from Direct Numerical Simulations of the NS equations. The L-LES model
includes physics-informed parameterization and functional form, by combining
physics-based parameters and physics-inspired Neural Networks to describe the
evolution of turbulence within the resolved range of scales. The sub-grid scale
contributions are modeled separately with physical constraints to account for
the effects from un-resolved scales. We build the resulting model under the
Differentiable Programming framework to facilitate efficient training. We
experiment with loss functions of different types, including physics-informed
ones accounting for statistics of Lagrangian particles. We show that our
Lagrangian LES model is capable of reproducing Eulerian and unique Lagrangian
turbulence structures and statistics over a range of turbulent Mach numbers.

the recently discovered high-energy stream Typhon. Typhon stars have apocenters
>100 kpc, making this the first detailed chemical picture of the Milky Way's
very distant stellar halo. Though the sample size is limited, we find that
Typhon's chemical abundances are more like a dwarf galaxy than a globular
cluster, showing a metallicity dispersion and no presence of multiple stellar
populations. Typhon stars display enhanced $\alpha$-element abundances and
increasing r-process abundances with increasing metallicity. The high-$\alpha$
abundances suggest a short star formation duration for Typhon, but this is at
odds with expectations for the distant Milky Way halo and the presence of
delayed r-process enrichment. If the progenitor of Typhon is indeed a new dwarf
galaxy, possible scenarios explaining this apparent contradiction include a
dynamical interaction that increases Typhon's orbital energy, a burst of
enhanced late-time star formation that raises [$\alpha$/Fe], and/or group
preprocessing by another dwarf galaxy before infall into the Milky Way.
Alternatively, Typhon could be the high-energy tail of a more massive disrupted
dwarf galaxy that lost energy through dynamical friction. We cannot clearly
identify a known low-energy progenitor of Typhon in the Milky Way, but 70% of
high-apocenter stars in cosmological simulations are from high-energy tails of
large dwarf galaxies. Typhon's surprising combination of kinematics and
chemistry thus underscores the need to fully characterize the dynamical history

new substructures.

i+T. For the individual channels from source to relay and relay to destination,
we assume a delay-constrained sliding-window (DCSW) based packet-erasure model

loop of civil infrastructure inspection performed by a semi-autonomous drone.
To understand job-specific commands from a group of heterogeneous and dynamic
inspectors, a model must be developed cost-effectively for the group and easily
adapted when the group changes. This paper is motivated to build a
multi-tasking deep learning model that possesses a Share-Split-Collaborate
architecture. This architecture allows the two classification tasks to share
the feature extractor and then split subject-specific and keyword-specific
features intertwined in the extracted features through feature projection and
collaborative training. A base model for a group of five authorized subjects is
trained and tested on the inspection keyword dataset collected by this study.
The model achieved a 95.3% or higher mean accuracy in classifying the keywords
of any authorized inspectors. Its mean accuracy in speaker classification is
99.2%. Due to the richer keyword representations that the model learns from the
pooled training data, adapting the base model to a new inspector requires only
a little training data from that inspector, like five utterances per keyword.
Using the speaker classification scores for inspector verification can achieve
a success rate of at least 93.9% in verifying authorized inspectors and 76.1%
in detecting unauthorized ones. Further, the paper demonstrates the
applicability of the proposed model to larger-size groups on a public dataset.
This paper provides a solution to addressing challenges facing AI-assisted

End-to-end Research Entity Extractor called EneRex to extract technical facets
such as dataset usage, objective task, method from full-text scholarly research
articles. Additionally, we extracted three novel facets, e.g., links to source
code, computing resources, programming language/libraries from full-text
articles. We demonstrate how EneRex is able to extract key insights and trends
from a large-scale dataset in the domain of computer science. We further test
our pipeline on multiple datasets and found that the EneRex improves upon a

their capacity and how EneRex may fit into an existing knowledge graph. We also

a qualitatively new type of nonlinear phenomena in vibrational systems and from
the point of view of applications. It is commonly believed that at least two
modes must be involved in generating a comb. In this paper we demonstrate that
a comb can be generated by a single nanomechanical mode driven by a resonant
monochromatic drive. The comb emerges where the drive is still weak, so that
the anharmonic part of the mode potential energy remains small. We relate the
effect to a negative nonlinear friction induced by the resonant drive, which
makes the vibrations at the drive frequency unstable. We directly map the
trajectories of the emerging oscillations in the rotating frame and show how
these oscillations lead to the frequency comb in the laboratory frame. The
results go beyond nanomechanics and suggest a qualitatively new approach to
generating tunable frequency combs in single-mode vibrational systems.

  Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac87b0",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Local thermal instability can plausibly explain the formation of multiphase
gas in many different astrophysical environments, but the theory is only well
understood in the optically thin limit of the equations of radiation
hydrodynamics (RHD). Here we lay groundwork for transitioning from this limit
to a full RHD treatment assuming a gray opacity formalism. We consider a
situation where the gas becomes thermally unstable due to the hardening of the
radiation field when the main radiative processes are free-free cooling and
Compton heating. We identify two ways in which this can happen: (i) when the
Compton temperature increases with time, through a rise in either the intensity
or energy of a hard X-ray component; and (ii) when attenuation reduces the flux
of the thermal component so that the Compton temperature increases with depth
through the slab. Both ways likely occur in the broad line region of active
galactic nuclei where columns of gas can be ionization bounded. In such
instances where attenuation is significant, thermal equilibrium solution curves
become position-dependent and it no longer suffices to assess the stability of
an irradiated column of gas at all depths using a single equilibrium curve. We
demonstrate how to analyze a new equilibrium curve -- the attenuation curve --
for this purpose, and we show that by Field's instability criterion, a negative
slope along this curve indicates that constant density slabs are thermally
unstable whenever the gas temperature increases with depth.

requires posterior samples only, which may be generated by any approach. This
flexibility, which is lacking in many alternative methods for computing the

three main neural density estimation approaches, including neural posterior

techniques on a range of inference problems, including a gravitational wave
example. Moreover, we further validate the accuracy of the learnt harmonic mean
estimator, implemented in the HARMONIC software, in likelihood-based settings.

to estimate the model evidence in both likelihood-based and simulation-based

In this article, we study the implications of this measurement on the parameter
space of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet extension (with hypercharge $Y=1$) of the
Standard Model Higgs sector, focusing on a limit where the new triplet is
approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd while the SM is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even. We study
the compatibility of the triplet spectrum preferred by the $W$ boson mass
measured by the CDF-II experiment with other electroweak precision observables

states at the LHC and highlighted the promising search channels. In addition,
we also investigate the cosmological implications of the case in which the
lightest new Higgs particle is either late decaying or cosmologically stable.

they decouple in the early Universe at a temperature $T\sim 2~{\rm MeV}$.
However, there are many relevant particle physics scenarios that can make
neutrinos interact at $T< 2~{\rm MeV}$. In this work, we take a global
perspective and aim to identify the temperature range in which neutrinos can
interact given current cosmological observations. We consider a generic set of
rates parametrizing neutrino interactions and by performing a full Planck
cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis we find that neutrinos cannot
interact significantly for redshifts $2000 \lesssim z \lesssim 10^5$, which we
refer to as the freestreaming window. We also derive a redshift dependent upper
bound on a suitably defined interaction rate $\Gamma_\text{nfs}(z)$, finding
$\Gamma_\text{nfs}(z)/H(z)\lesssim 1-10$ within the freestreaming window. We
show that these results are largely model independent under some broad
assumptions, and contextualize them in terms of neutrino decays, neutrino
self-interactions, neutrino annihilations, and majoron models. We provide
examples of how to use our model independent approach to obtain bounds in
specific scenarios, and demonstrate agreement with existing results. We also
investigate the reach of upcoming cosmological data finding that CMB Stage-IV
experiments can improve the bound on $\Gamma_\text{nfs}(z)/H(z)$ by up to a
factor $10$. Moreover, we comment on large-scale structure observations,
finding that the ongoing DESI survey has the potential to probe uncharted
regions of parameter space of interacting neutrinos. Finally, we point out a
peculiar scenario that has so far not been considered, and for which relatively
large interactions around recombination are still allowed by Planck data due to
some degeneracy with $n_s$, $A_s$ and $H_0$. This scenario can be fully tested

the hosts properties and the electromagnetic signatures of massive black holes

ones of single massive black holes. We find that the occupation fraction of

non-perturbative treatment of differential rotation modelled after Saturn's
zonal winds in self-consistently computed, polytropic equilibria. We find that
previous, approximate treatments of the effects of differential rotation in
Saturn overestimate shifts in the frequencies of fundamental modes (f-modes)
thought to be responsible for the majority of the waves detected in the C ring,
due to an omitted modification of the equilibrium shape and structure of the
planet by differential rotation. The bias introduced by these frequency
overestimates is small, but significant relative to the uncertainties afforded
by Cassini data. We additionally consider the non-perturbative effects of
Saturn-like differential rotation on the rotational mixing of f-modes and
internal gravity modes (g-modes), which is relevant to detections of multiple
density waves with very closely split pattern speeds. We find that higher order
rotational effects can produce orders-of-magnitude enhancements in the surface
gravitational perturbations of g-modes dominated by large spherical harmonic
degrees $\ell$, regardless of frequency separation from the sectoral f-mode.
Despite this enhancement, we find that the observed fine-splitting of density
waves is unlikely to involve g-modes dominated by $\ell\gtrsim 10$. This
restriction may aid in the inference of possible internal structures for
Saturn.

parametrized by the mass of the gas bubble. Our main result concerns the
approximate model. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the manifold
of equilibria with respect to small spherically symmetric perturbations. The
rate of convergence is exponential in time. To prove this result we first prove
a weak form of nonlinear asymptotic stability -- with no explicit rate of

captures all spherically symmetric equilibria of the approximate system.

Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive collocation scheme which
progressively allocates more collocation points (without increasing their
number) to areas where the model is making higher errors (based on the gradient
of the loss function in the domain). This, coupled with a judicious restarting
of the training during any optimization stalls (by simply resampling the
collocation points in order to adjust the loss landscape) leads to better
estimates for the prediction error. We present results for several problems,
including a 2D Poisson and diffusion-advection system with different forcing
functions. We find that training vanilla PINNs for these problems can result in
up to 70% prediction error in the solution, especially in the regime of low
collocation points. In contrast, our adaptive schemes can achieve up to an
order of magnitude smaller error, with similar computational complexity as the
baseline. Furthermore, we find that the adaptive methods consistently perform
on-par or slightly better than vanilla PINN method, even for large collocation

Conditional space-time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD) offers insight

of CPOD modes in a reduced subspace, resulting in new extensions and
adaptations that meet or exceed the capabilities of other decomposition
methods. Chiefly, it is demonstrated that the subsequent application of dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) to CPOD modes, provides a flexible tool to investigate
targeted flow instabilities, both tonal and convective in nature. By extending
the CPOD time-horizon to educe the former type, it is shown that CPOD-DMD can
exactly reproduce Spectral POD modes. Regarding the latter, a multi-resolution
framework (CPOD-mrDMD) yields a refined ""cause and effect"" stability analysis,
capable of diagnosing the natural forcing mechanisms within the flow, and the
resulting unstable modes. In a separate application, CPOD properties are
appreciated in the context of reduced order models, with an example of
real-time flow prediction of extreme events derived from an active sensor
correlated to a CPOD mode. The various CPOD functions and perspectives in this

the limitations of existing pruning heuristics, among which magnitude and

a novel integrated gradient pruning criterion, in which the relevance of each

a Bour surface $B_{n}$, such as the catenoid (or helicoid), $B_{0}$, and the
classical Enneper surface, $B_{2}$, among others. In particular, in this work,
the propagation of the electronic degrees of freedom on these surfaces is
studied based on the Dirac equation. As a consequence of the polar geometry of
$B_{n}$, it is found that the geometry of the surface causes the Dirac fermions
to move as if they would be subjected to an external potential coupled to a
spin-orbit term. The geometry-induced potential is interpreted as a barrier
potential, which is asymptotically zero. Furthermore, the behaviour of
asymptotic Dirac states and scattering states are studied through the
Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. It is found that for surfaces $B_{0}$ and
$B_{1}$, the total transmission phenomenon is found for sufficiently large
values of energy, while for surfaces $B_{n}$, with $n\geq 2$, it is shown that
there is an energy point $E_{K}$ where Klein's paradox is realized, while for
energy values $E\gg E_{K}$ it is found that the conductance of the hypothetical
material is completely suppressed, $\mathcal{G}(E)\to 0$.

electron correlation energy is estimated by taking a single Newton-Raphson step
from Hartree-Fock toward UCCSD. Such an approach has been explored previously,
but the accuracy was not extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate the
performance and observe similar pathologies to linearized coupled cluster with
singles and doubles. We introduce the use of derivatives of order three or
greater to help partially recover the variational lower bound of true UCCSD,
restricting these derivatives to those of the ""unmixed"" category in order to
simplify the model. By testing the approach on several potential energy
surfaces and reaction energies, we find this ""diagonal"" approximation to higher

strongly correlated regimes, while not significantly diminishing the accuracy

modulate the assembly of paramagnetic nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at
liquid-liquid interfaces and trigger an oversaturation in the areal density of
the NPSs at the interface, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the
interfacial tension, {\gamma}, and corroborated with a magnetostatic continuum
theory. Despite the significant reduction in {\gamma}, the presence of the
magnetic field does not cause stable interfaces to become unstable. Upon rapid
removal of the field, however, an explosive ejection of a plume of
microdroplets from the surface occurs, a dynamical interfacial instability
which is termed explosive emulsification. This explosive event rapidly reduces
the areal density of the NPSs to its pre-field level, stabilizing the
interface. The ability to externally suppress or trigger the explosive
emulsification and controlled generation of tens of thousands of microdroplets,
uncovers an efficient energy storage and release process, that has potential
applications for controlled and directed delivery of chemicals and remotely
controlled soft microrobots, taking advantage of the ferromagnetic nature of
the microdroplets.

is supported by the existence of an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, Reticulum~II,
where most of the stars are highly enhanced in $r$-process elements. In this
scenario, some small fraction of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way were $r$

to pinning energy ratio towards the base of the crust implied by the recent

Vortex lines assume a parabolic shape due to pinning to nuclear clusters and
finite tension of vortices acts as a restoring force that tends to bring a
vortex back to its straight shape. The resulting low frequency oscillations of
vortex lines combined with the time variable coupling between the internal
superfluid components and the external pulsar braking torque give rise to an
oscillatory spin-down rate. We apply this model to PSR B0950+08 observations

probe the innermost regions and to search for additional low-mass companion or
set detection limits. The star was observed with two different techniques
probing complementary spatial scales. We obtained new SAM observations with
SPHERE, which we combined with data from NACO, PIONIER and GRAVITY. We did not

area as the success of machine learning algorithms and methods grows. To combat
the safety concerns surrounding the freedom given to RL agents while training,
there has been an increase in work concerning Safe Reinforcement Learning
(SRL). However, these new and safe methods have been held to less scrutiny than
their unsafe counterparts. For instance, comparisons among safe methods often
lack fair evaluation across similar initial condition bounds and hyperparameter
settings, use poor evaluation metrics, and cherry-pick the best training runs
rather than averaging over multiple random seeds. In this work, we conduct an
ablation study using evaluation best practices to investigate the impact of run
time assurance (RTA), which monitors the system state and intervenes to assure
safety, on effective learning. By studying multiple RTA approaches in both
on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, we seek to understand which RTA methods
are most effective, whether the agents become dependent on the RTA, and the
importance of reward shaping versus safe exploration in RL agent training. Our
conclusions shed light on the most promising directions of SRL, and our
evaluation methodology lays the groundwork for creating better comparisons in

tearing instability and split into isolated magnetic islands (or plasmoids),
resulting in an enhanced reconnection rate. While several experimental
observations of plasmoids in the regime of low- to intermediate-$\beta$ (where
$\beta$ is the ratio of plasma thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) have been
made, there is a relative lack of experimental evidence for plasmoids in the

approaches to new domains and tasks.
  In this paper, we propose Sudowoodo, a multi-purpose DI&P framework based on
contrastive representation learning. Sudowoodo features a unified,
matching-based problem definition capturing a wide range of DI&P tasks
including Entity Matching (EM) in data integration, error correction in data

learning enables Sudowoodo to learn similarity-aware data representations from
a large corpus of data items (e.g., entity entries, table columns) without
using any labels. The learned representations can later be either directly used
or facilitate fine-tuning with only a few labels to support different DI&P
tasks. Our experiment results show that Sudowoodo achieves multiple
state-of-the-art results on different levels of supervision and outperforms
previous best specialized blocking or matching solutions for EM. Sudowoodo also
achieves promising results in data cleaning and semantic type detection tasks

Underground storage of H2 is a potentially viable solution, but poses unique

have yet to be studied quantitatively in the subsurface environment. We have
performed in situ X-ray flow experiments to investigate the fundamentals of
pore-scale fluid displacement processes during H2 injection into an initially

were followed, the displacement of H2 with H2-equilibrated brine and
non-H2-equilibrated brine both at temperature and pressure conditions
representative of deep underground reservoirs. H2 was found to be non-wetting
to brine after both displacement cycles, with average contact angles between
53.72 and 52.72, respectively. We also found a higher recovery of H2 (43.1%)
for non-H2-equilibrated brine compared to that of H2-equilibrated brine

this metric does not capture all aspects of robustness and in particular leaves
out the question of how many perturbations can be found for each point. In this

quantifies how difficult it is to find a successful perturbation given both an

constraint may be angular (L2 perturbations), or based on the number of pixels
(Linf perturbations).
  We show that sparsity provides valuable insight on neural networks in
multiple ways. analyzing the sparsity of existing robust models illustrates
important differences between them that accuracy analysis does not, and
suggests approaches for improving their robustness. When applying broken
defenses effective against weak attacks but not strong ones, sparsity can
discriminate between the totally ineffective and the partially effective
defenses. Finally, with sparsity we can measure increases in robustness that do
not affect accuracy: we show for example that data augmentation can by itself
increase adversarial robustness, without using adversarial training.

However, the unmonitored yet necessary overestimation of degradation amounts to

produced, such vortices can survive nearly unchanged over a large number of
rotation periods, slowly migrating towards the star. In the outer disc,
self-gravity may affect the vortex evolution and must be included in models.
  We performed 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the RoSSBi3D code. The outline
of our computations was limited to Euler's equations assuming a non-homentropic
and non-adiabatic flow for an ideal gas. A series of 45 runs were carried out
starting from a Gaussian vortex-model; the evolution of vortices was followed
during 300 orbits for various values of the vortex parameters and the Toomre
parameter. Two simulations, with the highest resolution (HR) thus far for
studies of vortices, were also run to better characterise the internal
structure of the vortices and for the purpose of comparison with an isothermal
case.
  We find that SG tends to destabilise the injected vortices, but compact
small-scale vortices seem to be more robust than large-scale oblong vortices.
Vortex survival critically depends on the value of the disc's Toomre parameter,
but may also depend on the disc temperature at equilibrium. Disc SG must be
small enough to avoid destruction in successive splitting and an approximate
`stability' criterion is deduced for vortices. The self-gravitating vortices
that we found persist during hundreds of rotation periods and look like the
quasi-steady vortices obtained in the non-self-gravitating case. A number of
these self-gravitating vortices are eventually accompanied by a secondary
vortex with a horseshoe motion. These vortices reach a new rotational
equilibrium in their core, tend to contract in the radial direction, and spin
faster.

advent of a wholly autonomous and at the same time safe and reliable ship. Full
autonomy could be obtained by two linked Artificial-Intelligence systems
representing the ship navigator and the ship engineer that possess sensing and
analysis skills, situational awareness, planning, and control capabilities.
Many efforts have been made in developing onboard systems; however, the shore
facilities are not ready yet to deal with these new technologies. The paper
aims to present the innovative technologies and methodologies needed to develop
a futuristic Vessel Traffic System. The proposed systems will aim at faultless
data acquisition and processing, provide input to decision-making systems, and
suggest evasive manoeuvre; to deal with hazards and systems failure without
human intervention onboard. The system is composed of three different and
interacting layers. The first is an artificially intelligent tool to detect and
control autonomous ships, thanks to situation recognition and obstacle
avoidance strategies. The second is an orchestration and management platform
designed to coordinate the sensing-actuation infrastructure and the AI
algorithms results made available by multiple ships, mustering edge, and
distributed computing techniques to fulfil the specific harsh requirements of
the sea environment. The final part is a holistic guidance-navigation-control
framework to manage autonomous ships navigation in a crowded area. Eventually,
a cyber-physical scenario, using both a ship digital-twin and a real
model-scale ship, is suggested to test and validate the innovative system
without the availability of a full-scale scenario.

including the brain and earthquake faults. The primary reason for this
conjecture is that the distribution of clusters (avalanches of firing neurons
in the brain or regions of slip in earthquake faults) can be described by a
power law. Because there are other mechanisms such as $1/f$ noise that can
produce power laws, other criteria that the cluster critical exponents must
satisfy can be used to conclude whether or not the observed power law behavior
indicates an underlying critical point rather than an alternate mechanism. We
show how a possible misinterpretation of the cluster scaling data can lead to
incorrectly conclude that the measured critical exponents do not satisfy these
criteria. Examples of the possible misinterpretation of the data for
one-dimensional random site percolation and the one-dimensional Ising model are

misinterpretation might lead to the abandonment of a promising area of

interactive framework where the system provider can enhance the quality of

burst of star formation, followed by a prompt truncation in further activity.
Identifying the mechanism(s) causing a galaxy to experience a post-starburst
phase therefore provides integral insight into the causes of rapid quenching.
Galaxy mergers have long been proposed as a possible post-starburst trigger.
Effectively testing this hypothesis requires a large spectroscopic galaxy
survey to identify the rare PSBs as well as high quality imaging and robust
morphology metrics to identify mergers. We bring together these critical
elements by selecting PSBs from the overlap of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
the Canada-France Imaging Survey and applying a suite of classification
methods: non-parametric morphology metrics such as asymmetry and Gini-M20, a
convolutional neural network trained to identify post-merger galaxies, and
visual classification. This work is therefore the largest and most
comprehensive assessment of the merger fraction of PSBs to date. We find that
the merger fraction of PSBs ranges from 19% to 42% depending on the merger
identification method and details of the PSB sample selection. These merger
fractions represent an excess of 3-46x relative to non-PSB control samples. Our
results demonstrate that mergers play a significant role in generating PSBs,
but that other mechanisms are also required. However, applying our merger
identification metrics to known post-mergers in the IllustrisTNG simulation
shows that ~70% of recent post-mergers (<200 Myr) would not be detected. Thus,
we cannot exclude the possibility that nearly all post-starburst galaxies have
undergone a merger in their recent past.

undesirable linguistic or sensitive concepts in their representation. Removing
such concepts is non-trivial because of a complex relationship between the

post-hoc and adversarial methods to remove such unwanted concepts from a
model's representation. Through an extensive theoretical and empirical
analysis, we show that these methods can be counter-productive: they are unable
to remove the concepts entirely, and in the worst case may end up destroying
all task-relevant features. The reason is the methods' reliance on a probing
classifier as a proxy for the concept. Even under the most favorable conditions
for learning a probing classifier when a concept's relevant features in
representation space alone can provide 100% accuracy, we prove that a probing
classifier is likely to use non-concept features and thus post-hoc or
adversarial methods will fail to remove the concept correctly. These
theoretical implications are confirmed by experiments on models trained on
synthetic, Multi-NLI, and Twitter datasets. For sensitive applications of
concept removal such as fairness, we recommend caution against using these
methods and propose a spuriousness metric to gauge the quality of the final

harder to understand. To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques
to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these
explainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose
and how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address
these challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for
explaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,
TalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface
for engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly
accessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,
interprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates
text responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.
We carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of
TalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user
inputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the
system's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations
with humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they
would use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability
in a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel
was easier to use for computing explanations. Our findings demonstrate that
TalkToModel is more effective for model explainability than existing systems,

the past decade. The need for AI-based analytics and automation tools to
extract and structure content from video has quickly become a priority for
organizations needing to search, analyze and exploit video at scale. With rapid
growth in machine learning technology, the maturity of machine transcription,
machine translation, topic tagging, and object recognition tasks are improving
at an exponential rate, breaking performance records in speed and accuracy as
new applications evolve. Each section of this paper reviews and compares
products, software resources and video analytics capabilities based on tasks
relevant to extracting information from video with machine learning techniques.

augmented/virtual reality evolves, computation is shifting from cloud-based
services to the edge, leading to the emergence of a cloud-edge compute
continuum. This continuum promises a wide spectrum of deployment opportunities
for workloads that can leverage the strengths of cloud (scalable
infrastructure, high reliability) and edge (energy efficient, low latencies).
Despite its promises, the continuum has only been studied in silos of various
computing models, thus lacking strong end-to-end theoretical and engineering
foundations for computing and resource management across the continuum.
Consequently, developers resort to ad hoc approaches to reason about
performance and resource utilization of workloads in the continuum. In this
work, we conduct a first-of-its-kind systematic study of various computing
models, identify salient properties, and make a case to unify them under a
compute continuum reference architecture. This architecture provides an
end-to-end analysis framework for developers to reason about resource
management, workload distribution, and performance analysis. We demonstrate the
utility of the reference architecture by analyzing two popular continuum
workloads, deep learning and industrial IoT. We have developed an accompanying
deployment and benchmarking framework and first-order analytical model for
quantitative reasoning of continuum workloads. The framework is open-sourced
and available at https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum.

$v^{\text{NAD}}$ in the vicinity of the nuclei has long been questioned, and

existence of singularities in $v^{\text{NAD}}$ is analyzed analytically for
various choices of $\rho_{\rm B}$ and $\rho_{\rm tot}$, using the nuclear cusp

the input point cloud. An implicit decoder learns to predict signed distance
values given points represented in this feature space. Setting the input point

understanding of rocky planet evolution. The James Webb Space Telescope is
expected to characterize the atmospheres of these planets, potentially
detecting CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, or abiotic O$_2$ from water
photodissociation and subsequent hydrogen escape. Here, we apply a coupled
atmosphere-interior evolution model to the Trappist-1 planets to anticipate
their modern atmospheres. This model, which has previously been validated for
Earth and Venus, connects magma ocean crystallization to temperate geochemical
cycling. Mantle convection, magmatic outgassing, atmospheric escape, crustal
oxidation, a radiative-convective climate model, and deep volatile cycling are
explicitly coupled to anticipate bulk atmospheres and planetary redox evolution
over 8 Gyr. By adopting a Monte Carlo approach that samples a broad range of
initial conditions and unknown parameters, we make some tentative predictions
about current Trappist-1 atmospheres. We find that anoxic atmospheres are
probable, but not guaranteed, for the outer planets; oxygen produced via
hydrogen loss during the pre-main sequence is typically consumed by crustal
sinks. In contrast, oxygen accumulation on the inner planets occurs in around
half of all models runs. Complete atmospheric erosion is possible but not
assured for the inner planets (occurs in 20%-50% of model runs), whereas the
outer planets retain significant surface volatiles in virtually all model
simulations. For all planets that retain substantial atmospheres,
CO$_2$-dominated or CO$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres are expected; water vapor is
unlikely to be a detectable atmospheric constituent in most cases. There are
necessarily many caveats to these predictions, but the ways in which they
misalign with upcoming observations will highlight gaps in terrestrial planet
knowledge.

further complicating the problem of modeling the dynamics. To address this

fails at high heating frequencies and/or in thick structures. Inspired by its
success in modeling wave propagation, we develop a numerically-stable
scattering matrix framework to model periodic heat diffusion in stratified
solid media.As a concreate example, we apply this scattering matrix methodology
to the three omega method.We first validate our framework using various
well-known solutions.Next, we demonstrate the numerical stability of the
framework using a configuration that resembles the three-dimensional stacked

exhibit, under certain circumstances, the merits of the scattering matrix
formalism in extracting thermal properties.

Similar to Gaussian Processes (GPs), NPs define distributions over functions

which limit their applications in sequential decision making. We propose
Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), a new member of the NP family that casts
uncertainty-aware meta learning as a sequence modeling problem. We learn TNPs
via an autoregressive likelihood-based objective and instantiate it with a
novel transformer-based architecture. The model architecture respects the
inductive biases inherent to the problem structure, such as invariance to the
observed data points and equivariance to the unobserved points. We further
investigate knobs within the TNP framework that tradeoff expressivity of the
decoding distribution with extra computation. Empirically, we show that TNPs
achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark problems,
outperforming all previous NP variants on meta regression, image completion,
contextual multi-armed bandits, and Bayesian optimization.

novel and explainable method, namely \textit{IOT-Match}, with the help of
computational optimal transport, which formulates the legal case matching
problem as an inverse optimal transport (IOT) problem. Different from most
existing methods, which merely focus on the sentence-level semantic similarity
between legal cases, our IOT-Match learns to extract rationales from paired
legal cases based on both semantics and legal characteristics of their
sentences. The extracted rationales are further applied to generate faithful
explanations and conduct matching. Moreover, the proposed IOT-Match is robust
to the alignment label insufficiency issue commonly in practical legal case
matching tasks, which is suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised
learning paradigms. To demonstrate the superiority of our IOT-Match method and
construct a benchmark of explainable legal case matching task, we not only
extend the well-known Challenge of AI in Law (CAIL) dataset but also build a
new Explainable Legal cAse Matching (ELAM) dataset, which contains lots of
legal cases with detailed and explainable annotations. Experiments on these two

solution to this problem is to adapt a pre-trained model to novel domains using
only unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on a challenging variant of this
problem, where access to the original source data is restricted. While fully
test-time adaptation (FTTA) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) are
closely related, the advances in UDA are not readily applicable to TTA, since
most UDA methods require access to the source data. Hence, we propose a new
approach, CATTAn, that bridges UDA and FTTA, by relaxing the need to access
entire source data, through a novel deep subspace alignment strategy. With a
minimal overhead of storing the subspace basis set for the source data, CATTAn
enables unsupervised alignment between source and target data during
adaptation. Through extensive experimental evaluation on multiple 2D and 3D
vision benchmarks (ImageNet-C, Office-31, OfficeHome, DomainNet, PointDA-10)

the diffraction in time of matter waves in two ways. First, we consider a
quasi-monochromatic beam of particles incident on a shutter which is removed at
time $t = 0$ and fall due to the gravitational field. The probability density
exhibits a set of mass-dependent oscillations which are genuinely quantum in
nature, thereby reflecting quantum violations to the weak equivalence
principle, although the strong equivalence principle remains valid. We estimate
the degree of violation in terms of the width of the diffraction-in-time
effect. Second, motivated by the recent advances in the manipulation of
ultracold atoms and neutrons as well as the experimental observation of quantum
states of ultracold neutrons in the gravitational field above a flat mirror, we
study the diffraction in time of a suddenly released beam of particles
initially prepared in gravitational quantum bound states. In this case, we
quantify the degree of violation by comparing the time of flight from the mean
position of the initial wave packet versus the time of flight as measured from
the mirror. We show that, in this case both the weak and strong versions of the
equivalence principle are violated. We demonstrate that compatibility between

status of PQCD factorization calculation of two-body charmless $B\to PP, PV,
VV$ decays up to the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. two new power
suppressed terms in decaying amplitudes are also taken into account. By using
the universal input (non-perturbative) parameters, we collected the branching
ratios and ${\bf CP}$ asymmetry parameters for all the charmless two body $B$
decays, calculated in the PQCD approach up to the NLO, including some power
suppressed terms in decaying amplitudes. The results are compared with the ones
from QCD factorization approach, soft-collinear effective theory approach and
the current experimental measurements. For most considered B meson decays, the
PQCD results for branching ratios agree well with other approaches and the
experimental data. The PQCD predictions for the ${\bf CP}$ asymmetry parameters
for many of the decay channels do not agree with other approaches, but have a
better agreement with the experimental data. The longstanding $K \pi $ puzzle
about the pattern of the direct CP asymmetries of the penguin-dominated $B \to

normal-to-superradiant phase transition in the limit where the ratio of the
transition frequency of the central spin to that of the bath spins and the
number of the bath spins tend to infinity. We give the low-energy effective
Hamiltonian analytically in the normal phase and the superradiant phase, and we
find that the longitudinal interaction can significantly influence the

are remarkably enhanced for the negative longitudinal interaction while
suppressed for the positive longitudinal interaction. We also use the quantum
Fisher information (QFI) to characterize the QPT and illustrate a measurement

  Correlations",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exploiting label correlations is important to multi-label classification.
Previous methods capture the high-order label correlations mainly by
transforming the label matrix to a latent label space with low-rank matrix
factorization. However, the label matrix is generally a full-rank or
approximate full-rank matrix, making the low-rank factorization inappropriate.
Besides, in the latent space, the label correlations will become implicit. To
this end, we propose a simple yet effective method to depict the high-order
label correlations explicitly, and at the same time maintain the high-rank of
the label matrix. Moreover, we estimate the label correlations and infer model
parameters simultaneously via the local geometric structure of the input to
achieve mutual enhancement. Comparative studies over ten benchmark data sets
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in multi-label
classification. The exploited high-order label correlations are consistent with
common sense empirically. Our code is publicly available at

temperatures has attracted considerable attention as a clue to designing
higher-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors. In particular, the relationship between the
number $n$ of CuO$_2$ layers in a unit cell of cuprate superconductors and the
optimum superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ is
intriguing. As experimentally observed in layered cuprates, $T_{\rm c}^{\rm
opt}$ increases when $n$ is increased, up to $n=3$, and, then, decreases for
larger $n$. However, the mechanism behind the $n$ dependence of $T_{\rm c}^{\rm
opt}$ remains elusive although there have been many studies on the $n$
dependence. In this paper, we studied a bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model to
clarify the effects of the adjacent CuO$_2$ layers on the stability of the
superconductivity by using a many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. We
calculate the superconducting correlation at long distance and zero
temperature, and the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions estimated
from the momentum distribution as the observables correlated with $T_{\rm
c}^{\rm opt}$. It is found that the in-plane superconducting correlation is not
enhanced in comparison with that in the single-layer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model.
The superconducting correlations of the bilayer Hamiltonian are significantly
small in the overdoped region in comparison with those of single-layer
Hamiltonian, which is attributed to the van Hove singularity. In addition, we
found that the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions is also similar
in both the single-layer and bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model at the optimal
doping. Therefore, we conclude that the adjacent Hubbard layers are not
relevant to the enhancement of $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ in the bilayer cuprates.
Possible origins of the enhanced $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ other than the adjacent
layers are also discussed.

have gradually attracted attention. Backdoor attacks are insidious, and
poisoned models perform well on benign samples and are only triggered when
given specific inputs, which cause the neural network to produce incorrect
outputs. The state-of-the-art backdoor attack work is implemented by data
poisoning, i.e., the attacker injects poisoned samples into the dataset, and
the models trained with that dataset are infected with the backdoor. However,
most of the triggers used in the current study are fixed patterns patched on a
small fraction of an image and are often clearly mislabeled, which is easily
detected by humans or defense methods such as Neural Cleanse and SentiNet.
Also, it's difficult to be learned by DNNs without mislabeling, as they may
ignore small patterns. In this paper, we propose a generalized backdoor attack
method based on the frequency domain, which can implement backdoor implantation
without mislabeling and accessing the training process. It is invisible to
human beings and able to evade the commonly used defense methods. We evaluate
our approach in the no-label and clean-label cases on three datasets (CIFAR-10,

learning, including graph kernels, graph metrics, and graph neural networks.
However, it focuses only on the consistency of the graph, which means that it
is unable to detect slight structural differences. Consequently, this limits
its ability to capture structural information, which also limits the
performance of existing models that rely on the WL test. This limitation is
particularly severe for traditional metrics defined by the WL test, which
cannot precisely capture slight structural differences. In this paper, we
propose a novel graph metric called the Wasserstein WL Subtree (WWLS) distance
to address this problem. Our approach leverages the WL subtree as structural
information for node neighborhoods and defines node metrics using the
$L_1$-approximated tree edit distance ($L_1$-TED) between WL subtrees of nodes.
Subsequently, we combine the Wasserstein distance and the $L_1$-TED to define
the WWLS distance, which can capture slight structural differences that may be
difficult to detect using conventional metrics. We demonstrate that the
proposed WWLS distance outperforms baselines in both metric validation and
graph classification experiments.

reduction of system size, leading to large uncertainty for the estimates of
dynamical quantities. Thus, increasing statistical efficiency, i.e., reducing
the number of samples required to achieve a given accuracy, is of great
significance for accurate estimation. Here we propose a theory as a fundamental
solution for such problem by constructing auxiliary path for each real path.
The states on auxiliary paths constitute canonical ensemble and share the same
macroscopic properties with the initial states of the real path. By
implementing the theory in molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain a
nanoscale Couette flow field with an accuracy of 0.2 {\mu}m/s with relative
standard error < 0.1. The required number of samples is reduced by 12 orders
compared to conventional method. The predicted thermolubric behavior of water
sliding on a self-assembled surface is directly validated by experiment under
the same velocity. As the theory only assumes the system is initially in
thermal equilibrium then driven from that equilibrium by an external
perturbation, we believe it could serve as a general approach for extracting
the accurate estimate of dynamical quantities from large fluctuations to
provide insights on atomic level under experimental conditions, and benefit the

factor for a one-dimensional double-barrier structure, where resonant tunneling
takes place between two terminals. Most studies to date have found, by means of
various approximate or phenomenological methods, that shot noise is insensitive
to dephasing caused by inelastic scattering. In this paper, we explore the
status of this statement by deriving a general Landaur-B\""uttiker-type formula
that expresses the current noise and Fano factor in a one-dimensional conductor
through inelastic scattering amplitudes. For a double-barrier structure, exact
scattering amplitudes are calculated in the presence of a time-dependent
potential. As an example of dephasing potential, we consider the one induced by
equilibrium phonons. We calculate transmission coefficients of a double-barrier
structure for these two types of phonon-induced dephasing. In the case of
diffusive phase relaxation valid for one dimension phonons, the resonant level
has a Lorentzian shape. For phonons whith high dimensions logarithmic dephasing
realized which leads to an unusual shape of the size-quantized level
characterized by the two energy scales. We further calculate the Fano factor
for these types of dephasing, using exact expressions for inelastic
transmission and reflection amplitudes. It turned out that when an integer
number of levels fall into the energy window of width eV, where V is the
voltage applied to the structure, the Fano factor is really insensitive to
inelastic processes inside the structure and coincides with the prediction of
phenomenological models with an accuracy of small corrections depending on
these processes. On the contrary, at low voltages, when the eV window is
smaller than the level width, this dependence is particularly pronounced and
the phenomenological formula does not work.

methods overwhelmingly rely on the strategy of directly fusing depth
information. Although these methods improve the accuracy of saliency prediction
through various cross-modality fusion strategies, misinformation provided by
some poor-quality depth images can affect the saliency prediction result. To
address this issue, a novel RGB-D salient object detection model (SiaTrans) is
proposed in this paper, which allows training on depth image quality
classification at the same time as training on SOD. In light of the common
information between RGB and depth images on salient objects, SiaTrans uses a
Siamese transformer network with shared weight parameters as the encoder and
extracts RGB and depth features concatenated on the batch dimension, saving
space resources without compromising performance. SiaTrans uses the Class token
in the backbone network (T2T-ViT) to classify the quality of depth images
without preventing the token sequence from going on with the saliency detection
task. Transformer-based cross-modality fusion module (CMF) can effectively fuse
RGB and depth information. And in the testing process, CMF can choose to fuse
cross-modality information or enhance RGB information according to the quality
classification signal of the depth image. The greatest benefit of our designed
CMF and decoder is that they maintain the consistency of RGB and RGB-D
information decoding: SiaTrans decodes RGB-D or RGB information under the same
model parameters according to the classification signal during testing.
Comprehensive experiments on nine RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets show that
SiaTrans has the best overall performance and the least computation compared
with recent state-of-the-art methods.

These could accelerate the clinical translation of PA technology. However, PA
signals generated with these light sources are readily degraded by noise due to
the low optical fluence, leading to decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in PA

PA denoising method was investigated for these light sources that usually have
low fluence and high repetition rates. The proposed method leverages both
spatial and temporal correlations between radiofrequency (RF) data frames.
Validation was performed on simulations and in vivo PA data acquired from human
fingers (2D) and forearm (3D) using a LED-based system. Spatiotemporal SVD
greatly enhanced the PA signals of blood vessels corrupted by noise while
preserving a high temporal resolution to slow motions, improving the SNR of in

wavelet denoising, averaging across 200 frames, and single frame without

feasible to realize longitudinal injection within a static bucket enabled by a
double-frequency RF system, suggesting an attractive longitudinal injection

models, where covariates enter the model through a combination of weighted
summations and non-linear functions. Although these models have some
similarities to the models typically used in statistical modelling, the
majority of neural network research has been conducted outside of the field of
statistics. This has resulted in a lack of statistically-based methodology,
and, in particular, there has been little emphasis on model parsimony.
Determining the input layer structure is analogous to variable selection, while
the structure for the hidden layer relates to model complexity. In practice,
neural network model selection is often carried out by comparing models using
out-of-sample performance. However, in contrast, the construction of an
associated likelihood function opens the door to information-criteria-based
variable and architecture selection. A novel model selection method, which
performs both input- and hidden-node selection, is proposed using the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) for FNNs. The choice of BIC over out-of-sample
performance as the model selection objective function leads to an increased
probability of recovering the true model, while parsimoniously achieving
favourable out-of-sample performance. Simulation studies are used to evaluate
and justify the proposed method, and applications on real data are
investigated.

easy-to-implement substitute. Furthermore, the simplest shell ECM consisting of
a single diffusion-aware voltage source and a resistor is validated against
experimental constant-current discharges at various rates. The diffusion-aware
voltage source can be used to measure diffusivity by fitting the diffusion
resistance against experimental data. The viability of the shell ECM for
onboard usage is confirmed by implementation into a battery management system

fashion with saliency maps or sequentially with scanpath models. However, while
both types of models have steadily improved on several benchmarks and datasets,
there is still a considerable gap in predicting human gaze. Here, we leverage
two recent developments to reduce this gap: theoretical analyses establishing a
principled framework for predicting the next gaze target and the empirical
measurement of the human cost for gaze switches independently of image content.
We introduce an algorithm in the framework of sequential decision making, which
converts any static saliency map into a sequence of dynamic history-dependent
value maps, which are recomputed after each gaze shift. These maps are based on
1) a saliency map provided by an arbitrary saliency model, 2) the recently
measured human cost function quantifying preferences in magnitude and direction
of eye movements, and 3) a sequential exploration bonus, which changes with
each subsequent gaze shift. The parameters of the spatial extent and temporal
decay of this exploration bonus are estimated from human gaze data. The
relative contributions of these three components were optimized on the MIT1003
dataset for the NSS score and are sufficient to significantly outperform
predictions of the next gaze target on NSS and AUC scores for five state of the
art saliency models on three image data sets. Thus, we provide an
implementation of human gaze preferences, which can be used to improve
arbitrary saliency models' predictions of humans' next gaze targets.

an exact Riemann solver. The spatial scheme accounts for the equilibrium
solution and is improved thanks to parabolic interpolation which permits to
reach third order in space. The code is developed in 3D and structured for
high-performance parallelism. The optimised version of the code works on high

to a rotation of order $q$ of $S^3$. If $K$ admits a symmetry which is a
homeomorphism without fixed point of period $q$ of $S^3$, then $K$ is called
freely $q$-periodic.
  In a previous paper, we obtained, as a consequence of Flyping Theorem due to
Menasco and Thislethwaite, that the $q$-periodicity with $q>2$ can be
visualized in an alternating projection as a rotation of the projection sphere.
  In this paper, we show that the free $q$-action of an alternating knot can be
represented on some alternating projection as a composition of a rotation of
order $q$ with some flypes all occurring on the same twisted band diagram of
its essential Conway decomposition. Therefore, for an alternating knot to be
freely periodic, its essential decomposition must satisfy certain conditions.
We show that any free or non-free $q$-action is somehow visible (virtually
visible) and give some sufficient criteria to detect the existence of
$q$-actions from virtually visible projections.
  Finally, we show how the Murasugi decomposition into atoms enables us to
determine the visibility type $(q,r)$ of the freely $q$-periodic alternating
knots ($(q,r)$-lens knots); in fact, we only need to focus on a certain atom of
their Murasugi decomposition to deduce their visibility type.

desire to `rank' features based on their importance. Such feature importance
rankings can then be used to either: (1) reduce the dataset size or (2)
interpret the Machine Learning model. In the literature, however, such Feature
Rankers are not evaluated in a systematic, consistent way. Many papers have a
different way of arguing which feature importance ranker works best. This paper
fills this gap, by proposing a new evaluation methodology. By making use of
synthetic datasets, feature importance scores can be known beforehand, allowing
more systematic evaluation. To facilitate large-scale experimentation using the
new methodology, a benchmarking framework was built in Python, called fseval.
The framework allows running experiments in parallel and distributed over
machines on HPC systems. By integrating with an online platform called Weights
and Biases, charts can be interactively explored on a live dashboard. The
software was released as open-source software, and is published as a package on
the PyPi platform. The research concludes by exploring one such large-scale
experiment, to find the strengths and weaknesses of the participating
algorithms, on many fronts.

reduces the parameters and complexity of the network. We then incorporate
Re-ConvSet into the widely-used U-Net architecture to construct an HS image

CCF between every pair of channels for each individual bright pulse and
extracts an average DM from the distribution of all channel-pair DMs. Both
methods allow the determination of the DM with a relative uncertainty of better
than 10^-5 and provide robust estimates for the uncertainty of the best-fit
value. We find differences in DM between the Main Pulse, the Low Frequency
Interpulse, and the High Frequency Interpulse using both methods in a frequency
range from 4 to 6 GHz. Earlier observations of the High Frequency Interpulse
carried out by Hankins et al. (2016) resulted in DM_HFIP-DM_MP of 0.010 +-

This work considers a scenario in which a massive number of devices with

is followed by a single common feedback broadcast message, which is used both
to schedule the active users to different transmission slots and to assign
orthogonal pilots to the users for channel estimation. The proposed coordinated

coded pilot access, which is based on the principle of coded slotted ALOHA, and
an approximate message passing scheme for joint user activity detection and

provides significant gains in the number of successful transmissions per slot

scales of interest, turbulence tends to mix the cue into patches of relatively
high concentration over a background of very low concentration, so that the
insect will only detect the cue intermittently and cannot rely on chemotactic
strategies which simply climb the concentration gradient. In this work, we cast
this search problem in the language of a partially observable Markov decision

near-optimal with respect to the arrival time. We test the computed strategies
on a large two-dimensional grid, present the resulting trajectories and arrival

introduce the analogy with Thomson scattering to characterize the bandgap
phenomena in chiral phononic crystals. Two phononic structures are proposed and
discussed, one with translationrotation coupling and another with
translation-translation coupling. The two lattices are different in appearance

drawn on to describe the coupling motion of the unit cells. We evidence that
the bandgap generation is essentially based on the analogous Thomson scattering

privacy mechanism for distributed mean estimation (DME) with applications to

the continuous Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis is based on a novel bound on
the R\'enyi divergence of two Poisson binomial distributions that may be of
independent interest.
  Unlike previous discrete DP schemes based on additive noise, our mechanism
encodes local information into a parameter of the binomial distribution, and
hence the output distribution is discrete with bounded support. Moreover, the
support does not increase as the privacy budget $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ as
in the case of additive schemes which require the addition of more noise to
achieve higher privacy; on the contrary, the support becomes smaller as
$\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. The bounded support enables us to combine our
mechanism with secure aggregation (SecAgg), a multi-party cryptographic
protocol, without the need of performing modular clipping which results in an
unbiased estimator of the sum of the local vectors. This in turn allows us to
apply it in the private FL setting and provide an upper bound on the
convergence rate of the SGD algorithm. Moreover, since the support of the
output distribution becomes smaller as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, the
communication cost of our scheme decreases with the privacy constraint
$\varepsilon$, outperforming all previous distributed DP schemes based on
additive noise in the high privacy or low communication regimes.

on pseudo pairs, we propose to improve the generalization of similarity

correspondence across images via inter-similarity. The intra-similarity
learning is based on channel attention to detect diverse local features from an

examples that are crafted with imperceptible perturbations, i.e., a small
change in an input image can induce a mis-classification, and thus threatens
the reliability of deep learning based deployment systems. Adversarial training
(AT) is often adopted to improve robustness through training a mixture of
corrupted and clean data. However, most of AT based methods are ineffective in
dealing with transferred adversarial examples which are generated to fool a
wide spectrum of defense models, and thus cannot satisfy the generalization
requirement raised in real-world scenarios. Moreover, adversarially training a
defense model in general cannot produce interpretable predictions towards the
inputs with perturbations, whilst a highly interpretable robust model is
required by different domain experts to understand the behaviour of a DNN. In
this work, we propose a novel approach based on Jacobian norm and Selective
Input Gradient Regularization (J-SIGR), which suggests the linearized
robustness through Jacobian normalization and also regularizes the
perturbation-based saliency maps to imitate the model's interpretable

interpretability of DNNs. Finally, we evaluate our method across different

low-resolution (LR) query identity images against high resolution (HR) gallery
images. It is a challenging and practical problem since the query images often
suffer from resolution degradation due to the different capturing conditions
from real-world cameras. To address this problem, state-of-the-art (SOTA)
solutions either learn the resolution-invariant representation or adopt
super-resolution (SR) module to recover the missing information from the LR
query. This paper explores an alternative SR-free paradigm to directly compare
HR and LR images via a dynamic metric, which is adaptive to the resolution of a
query image. We realize this idea by learning resolution-adaptive
representations for cross-resolution comparison. Specifically, we propose two
resolution-adaptive mechanisms. The first one disentangles the
resolution-specific information into different sub-vectors in the penultimate
layer of the deep neural networks, and thus creates a varying-length
representation. To better extract resolution-dependent information, we further
propose to learn resolution-adaptive masks for intermediate residual feature
blocks. A novel progressive learning strategy is proposed to train those masks
properly. These two mechanisms are combined to boost the performance of CRReID.
Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to existing
approaches and achieves SOTA performance on multiple CRReID benchmarks.
